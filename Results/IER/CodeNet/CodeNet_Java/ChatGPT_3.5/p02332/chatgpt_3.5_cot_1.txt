<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers n and k from the input. Then it creates an instance of the Combinatrics class passing k as a parameter.
Inside the Combinatrics class, it initializes three arrays: fact, inv, and finv. The fact array stores the factorial of each number from 0 to n, the inv array stores the inverse of each number from 1 to n, and the finv array stores the factorial inverse of each number from 0 to n.
Then, it calculates the permutation of k elements from n elements using the permutation method of the Combinatrics class and prints the result.
