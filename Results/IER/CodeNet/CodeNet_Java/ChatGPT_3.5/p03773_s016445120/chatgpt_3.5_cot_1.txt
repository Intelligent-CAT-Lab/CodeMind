<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input using the Scanner class. The first integer is stored in the variable str1 and the second integer is stored in the variable str2.
Then, it calculates the sum of str1 and str2 and stores it in the variable kei.
Next, it checks if the value of kei is less than 24. If it is, it prints the value of kei. Otherwise, it subtracts 24 from kei and prints the result.
In this case, the sum of 9 and 12 is 21, which is less than 24. So, the code will print 21 as the output.
<<<Output>>>
21
