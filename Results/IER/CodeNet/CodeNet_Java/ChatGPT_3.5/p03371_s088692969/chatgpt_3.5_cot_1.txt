<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes input from the user in the form of a string and splits it into an array of strings using the space as a delimiter. Then it converts the strings into integers and assigns them to variables A, B, C, X, and Y respectively.

Next, it calculates three different results: resultA, resultB, and resultC.

resultA is calculated by multiplying the value of X with A and the value of Y with B.

resultB is calculated based on the condition X > Y. If this condition is true, it calculates the cost of buying Y items of B and X-Y items of A. If the condition is false, it calculates the cost of buying X items of C and Y-X items of B.

resultC is calculated by multiplying the maximum value between X and Y with C and then multiplying it by 2.

Finally, the code prints the minimum value among resultA, resultB, and resultC.

In this case, X = 3 and Y = 2. So, resultA = 3 * 1500 + 2 * 2000 = 7500 + 4000 = 11500.
resultB = (3 - 2) * 1500 + 2 * 1600 * 2 = 1500 + 6400 = 7900.
resultC = 1600 * 3 * 2 = 9600.

The minimum value among resultA, resultB, and resultC is 7900.

<<<Output>>>
7900
