The variable l and variable k are initialized with 5 and 3 respectively according to the input. And a 2D array dp is initialized with size [2][l+1] and all elements are initialized with 0. The variable ans is initialized with 0.
Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to l to calculate the values of dp array. For each iteration, it updates the values of dp[0][i] and dp[1][i] based on the previous values of dp array. If i is greater than or equal to k, it also updates dp[1][i] based on the value of dp[0][i-k].
After the loop finishes, it enters another for loop to calculate the final value of ans by summing up all the values in dp[1] array.
Finally, it prints the value of ans as output.
<<<Output>>>
5
