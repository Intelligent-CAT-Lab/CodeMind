<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers n and k as input. It then calls the `iterationPowMod` method passing k and n as arguments. 
Inside the `iterationPowMod` method, it initializes a variable `mod` with the value 1000000007 and two variables `sum` and `x` with the value 1 and k respectively. 
Then it enters a while loop which continues until n becomes 0. Inside the loop, it checks if the least significant bit of n is 1. If it is, it multiplies the variable `sum` with `x` and takes the modulo of `sum` with `mod`. Then it multiplies `x` with itself and takes the modulo of `x` with `mod`. Finally, it right shifts n by 1 bit. 
After the loop finishes, it returns the value of `sum` as the output.
In the main method, it prints the output of the `iterationPowMod` method.
