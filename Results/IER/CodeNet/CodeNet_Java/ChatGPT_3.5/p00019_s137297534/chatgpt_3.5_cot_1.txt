<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input from the user and stores it in the variable nNum. It then initializes a variable nFact with a value of 1. 
Next, it enters a for loop that iterates from 2 to nNum. In each iteration, it multiplies the current value of nFact with the value of n, and stores the result back in nFact. 
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of nFact as the output.
In this case, the input is 5. So, the code will calculate the factorial of 5, which is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.
<<<Output>>>
120
