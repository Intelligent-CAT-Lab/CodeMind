<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 2 and variable K is initialized with 0 according to the input.
Then it creates three instances of the PartialCompute class: Psum, Pprod, and Prand.
It initializes the DP array with size [1205][1205] and ans with 0.
Then it calls the Read() method to read the input values and set the values of Psum, Pprod, and Prand.
After that, it calls the precalcP() method to calculate the partial sums and partial products of Psum, Pprod, and Prand.
Then it calls the solveDP() method to solve the dynamic programming problem.
Inside the solveDP() method, it iterates over the variable dist from 1 to 2*N-1 with a step of 2.
Inside the loop, it iterates over the variable i from 1 to 2*N.
Inside the inner loop, it calculates the variable j as i + dist.
If the sum of Prand from i to j is not equal to 0, it continues to the next iteration.
Otherwise, it calculates the variable sum as the sum of Psum from i to j.
Then it calculates the variable p as the product of Pprod of (2*N - 2*K - sum).
Then it sets the value of DP[i][j] as the product of Pprod of sum.
If the dist is not equal to 2*N-1, it calls the UpdatePartialCircle() method to update the values of DP[i][j] for the partial circle.
If the dist is equal to 2*N-1, it calls the UpdateFullCircle() method to update the values of DP[i][j] for the full circle.
Finally, it updates the value of ans by adding the product of DP[i][j] and p.
If the dist is equal to 2*N-1 and i is equal to 1, it returns from the method.
After the loop finishes, it prints the value of ans as the output.
