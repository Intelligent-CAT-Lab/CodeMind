<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input and converts it into a character array. It then initializes two variables, 'from' and 'to', with the values 0 and n-1 respectively, where n is the length of the character array.

The code then iterates through the character array to find the first occurrence of the character 'A'. It updates the value of 'from' to the index of this occurrence.

Next, the code iterates through the character array in reverse order to find the last occurrence of the character 'Z'. It updates the value of 'to' to the index of this occurrence.

Finally, the code calculates the difference between 'to' and 'from' and adds 1 to it. This value represents the number of characters between the first occurrence of 'A' and the last occurrence of 'Z', inclusive.
