The variable N is initialized with 2 according to the input. And variable result and variable a are initialized with 0.
It enters a nested for loop and it iterates from 1 to 2 for both variables i and j. The value of variable i is also passed to variable a.
Inside the nested for loop, it calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the current integers i and j by calling the gcd() method.
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from 1 to 2 for variable k.
Inside this loop, it calculates the gcd of the current integer a and k by calling the gcd() method again, and adds the result to variable result.
After all the loops finish, it prints the final value of variable result as output, which is 12.
<<<Output>>>
12
