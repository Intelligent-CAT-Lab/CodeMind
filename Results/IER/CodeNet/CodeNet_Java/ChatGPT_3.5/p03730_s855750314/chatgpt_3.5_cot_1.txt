<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input: a, b, and c. It then initializes a string variable ans with "NO". 
The code checks if c is divisible by the greatest common divisor (gcd) of b and the remainder of a divided by b. 
If the condition is true, it updates the value of ans to "YES". 
Finally, it prints the value of ans as the output.
In this case, a=7, b=5, and c=1. The gcd of 5 and the remainder of 7 divided by 5 (which is 2) is 1. Since 1 divides 1, the condition is true and ans is updated to "YES". Therefore, the output will be "YES".
<<<Output>>>
YES
