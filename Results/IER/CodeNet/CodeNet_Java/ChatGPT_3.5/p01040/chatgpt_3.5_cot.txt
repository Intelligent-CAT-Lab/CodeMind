<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes 6 inputs: y1, m1, d1, y2, m2, d2. The given input is `2015 3 13 2015 3 13`.
The code then calls the `count` method passing these inputs as arguments.
Inside the `count` method, it calculates the number of Friday the 13th between the given dates.
It first calculates the number of days between the given date and the date 1/1/1 using the `count` method with 7 arguments.
Then it subtracts the number of days between the given date and the date 1/1/1 from the number of days between the date 1/1/1 and the date 1/1/400 to get the final count.
In this case, the given date is the same, so the count will be 0.
