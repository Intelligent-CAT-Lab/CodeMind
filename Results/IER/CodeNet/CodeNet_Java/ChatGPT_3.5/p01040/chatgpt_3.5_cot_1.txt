<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes 6 inputs: y1, m1, d1, y2, m2, d2. The given input is `2015 3 13 2015 3 13`.
The code then calls the `count` method passing these inputs as arguments.
Inside the `count` method, it calculates the number of Friday the 13th between the given dates.
It first calculates the number of days between the start date and the nearest Friday the 13th before the start date.
Then it calculates the number of days between the end date and the nearest Friday the 13th before the end date.
Finally, it subtracts the two counts to get the total number of Friday the 13th between the given dates.
In this case, the start date and the end date are the same, so the count will be 0.
<<<Output>>>
