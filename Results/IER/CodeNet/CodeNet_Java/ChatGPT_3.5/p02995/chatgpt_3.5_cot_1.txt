<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes several variables and objects. Then it takes input values for variables A, B, C, and D.
It calculates the value of n as B-A+1.
Then it checks if C is equal to D. If it is, it calculates the number of integers between A and B (inclusive) that are divisible by C. It does this by dividing A and B by C and counting the number of integers in the resulting range. If A is divisible by C, it increments the count by 1. The result is stored in variable p.
Next, it calculates the number of integers between A and B (inclusive) that are divisible by D. It follows the same process as before and stores the result in variable q.
Then it calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of C and D using the Compute class's leastCommonMultiple method. It divides A and B by the LCM and counts the number of integers in the resulting range. If A is divisible by the LCM, it increments the count by 1. The result is stored in variable r.
Finally, it calculates the answer by subtracting the sum of p, q, and r from n. The answer is then printed.
