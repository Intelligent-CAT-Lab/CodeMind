The variable N is initialized with the value 3 according to the input. The variable total is initialized with the value 1L.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 3. In each iteration, it multiplies the current value of total with the current value of i and assigns the result back to total. The multiplication is done using the modulo operator with the value 1000000007.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of total as output.
