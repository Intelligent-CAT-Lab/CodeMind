<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input from the user and converts it into a character array. Then it checks if the first character of the array is equal to the third character. If they are equal, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".
In this case, the input is "575". The first character is '5' and the third character is also '5', so they are equal. Therefore, the output will be "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
