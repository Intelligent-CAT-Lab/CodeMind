<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers H and R from the input. It then checks three conditions:
1. If H is negative and the absolute value of H is equal to R, it prints 0.
2. If the sum of H and R is greater than 0, it prints 1.
3. If none of the above conditions are met, it prints -1.

In this case, H is -3 and R is 3. The first condition is not met because the absolute value of -3 is not equal to 3. The second condition is also not met because the sum of -3 and 3 is 0. Therefore, the code will print -1.

<<<Output>>>
-1
