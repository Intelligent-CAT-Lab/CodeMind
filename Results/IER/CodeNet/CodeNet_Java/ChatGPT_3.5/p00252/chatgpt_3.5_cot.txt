<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input and stores them in an array `a`. It then checks the values of `a[0]`, `a[1]`, and `a[2]` to determine the output.

In this case, the input is `0 0 1`. The first two conditions in the if-else if-else statement are not met (`a[0]` is not equal to 1 and `a[1]` is not equal to 1), so it moves to the else if condition. Since `a[2]` is equal to 1, the condition is met and it prints "Open".

<<<Output>>>
Open
