<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes an array `a` of size 3. Then it reads 3 integers from the input and stores them in the array `a`. The input values are 0, 0, and 1. 

Next, it checks the conditions using if-else statements. The first condition `a[0] == 1 && a[1] == 1` is not true because `a[0]` and `a[1]` are both 0. So it moves to the next condition.

The second condition `a[2] == 1` is true because `a[2]` is 1. Therefore, it prints "Open" as the output.

<<<Output>>>
Open
