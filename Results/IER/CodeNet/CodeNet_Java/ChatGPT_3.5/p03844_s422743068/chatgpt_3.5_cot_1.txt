<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads three inputs: an integer a, a string op, and another integer b. It then checks if the string op is equal to "+". If it is, it adds a and b and prints the result. Otherwise, it subtracts b from a and prints the result.
In this case, the input is "1 + 2". The code will read 1 into variable a, "+" into variable op, and 2 into variable b. Since op is equal to "+", it will add a and b (1 + 2) and print the result, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>
