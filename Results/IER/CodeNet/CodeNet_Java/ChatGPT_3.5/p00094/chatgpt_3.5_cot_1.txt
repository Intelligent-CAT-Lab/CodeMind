<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads input using a Scanner object. It enters a while loop and checks if there is more input available using the hasNext() method. If there is more input, it reads two double values using the nextDouble() method and calculates their product. Then it divides the product by 3.305785 and prints the result. This process continues until there is no more input available.
In this case, the input is "15 25". The code will read the first double value as 15 and the second double value as 25. It will then calculate (15 * 25) / 3.305785 and print the result.
