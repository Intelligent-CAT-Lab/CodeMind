<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads input from the user using the Scanner class. It expects two double values separated by a space. It then calculates the product of the two values and divides it by 3.305785. The result is printed to the console. 

In this case, the input is "15 25". The code will read the first double value as 15 and the second double value as 25. It will then calculate (15 * 25) / 3.305785, which is approximately 113.634. 

<<<Output>>>
113.634
