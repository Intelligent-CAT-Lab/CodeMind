<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 2 according to the input. The variable dp is initialized with {1, 0, 0}.
Then it initializes an array inv with size n + 7 and calculates the inverse modulo of each element in the array.
Then it initializes the variable coef with 1 and the variable ret with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to n to check each integer k in this range.
Inside the for loop, it initializes an array nxt with size 3.
Then it enters two nested for loops to calculate the values of array nxt based on the values of array dp.
After that, it assigns the value of array nxt to array dp.
Then it calculates the value of variable coef based on the current value of k.
Then it calculates the value of variable ways based on the current values of array dp and variable coef.
Then it calculates the value of variable delta based on the current values of array inv, variable n, variable k and variable ways.
Then it adds the value of variable delta to variable ret.
After the loop finishes, it takes the modulo of variable ret with P.
Then it enters another for loop to multiply variable ret with the inverse modulo of 3 for n - 1 times.
Finally, it prints the value of variable ret as output.
