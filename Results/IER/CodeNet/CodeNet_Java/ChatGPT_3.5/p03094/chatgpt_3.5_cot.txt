<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads an integer n from the input. It initializes an array dp with values {1, 0, 0}.
Then it initializes an array inv with size n + 7 and calculates the inverse modulo of each number from 2 to n + 7 using the formula inv[x] = P - (P / x) * inv[P % x] % P.
Then it initializes a variable coef with value 1 and a variable ret with value 0.
It enters a for loop from k = 1 to n.
Inside the loop, it initializes an array nxt with size 3.
Then it iterates over j1 from 0 to 2 and j2 from 0 to 2.
If j1 is not equal to j2, it adds dp[j1] to nxt[j2] and takes modulo P if nxt[j2] is greater than or equal to P.
After the nested loop, it assigns nxt to dp.
Then it calculates the value of coef by multiplying coef with (n - k + 1) modulo P and inv[k] modulo P.
Then it calculates the value of ways by multiplying dp[1] with coef modulo P.
Then it calculates the value of delta by multiplying inv[3] modulo P with inv[n] modulo P with inv[k] modulo P with ways modulo P.
Then it adds delta to ret.
After the loop, it takes modulo P of ret.
Then it enters another loop from i = 1 to n - 1 and multiplies ret with inv[3] modulo P.
Finally, it prints the value of ret.
