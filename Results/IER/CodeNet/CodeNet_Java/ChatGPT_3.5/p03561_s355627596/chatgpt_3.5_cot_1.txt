<<<Analysis>>>
The variable k is initialized with 3 and variable n is initialized with 2 according to the input.
It checks if k is even or odd. Since k is odd, it enters the else block.
It creates a list and adds (k+1)/2 to the list n times.
Then it enters a for loop which iterates n/2 times.
Inside the loop, it checks if the last element of the list is 1. If it is, it removes the last element from the list.
Otherwise, it subtracts 1 from the last element of the list and adds k to the list until the size of the list becomes n.
Finally, it prints the elements of the list separated by a space.
<<<Output>>>
