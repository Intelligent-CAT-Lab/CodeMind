<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four integers as input using the Scanner class. It multiplies the first two integers and assigns the result to variable 'a'. It also multiplies the last two integers and assigns the result to variable 'b'. Then it compares the values of 'a' and 'b' using the ternary operator. If 'a' is less than 'b', it prints the value of 'b'. Otherwise, it prints the value of 'a'.
In this case, the input is 3, 5, 2, and 7. So, 'a' will be 3 * 5 = 15 and 'b' will be 2 * 7 = 14. Since 'a' is greater than 'b', the code will print the value of 'a', which is 15.
<<<Output>>>
15
