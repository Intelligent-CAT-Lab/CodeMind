<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input from the user and stores it in variable a. Then it creates a new string variable b by concatenating "2018" with the substring of a starting from index 4. The substring method is used to extract the characters from index 4 to the end of the string. Finally, it prints the value of b as the output.
In this case, the input is "2017/01/07". So, the substring starting from index 4 would be "/01/07". Therefore, the value of b would be "201801/07".
<<<Output>>>
201801/07
