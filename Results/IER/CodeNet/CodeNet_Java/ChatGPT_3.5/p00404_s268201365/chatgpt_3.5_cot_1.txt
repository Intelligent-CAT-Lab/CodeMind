The variable x and variable y are initialized with 0 according to the input. And variable px, py, mx, my and ans are initialized with 0, 0, 0, 0 and 1 respectively.
It checks if both x and y are 0. If they are, it prints 1 as output and exits the program.
Otherwise, it enters an infinite while loop.
Inside the loop, it updates the values of px, py, mx, my and ans based on certain conditions.
It checks if the current values of px, py, mx and my satisfy certain conditions based on the values of x and y. If they do, it prints the current value of ans as output and exits the program.
The loop continues until one of the conditions is met.
