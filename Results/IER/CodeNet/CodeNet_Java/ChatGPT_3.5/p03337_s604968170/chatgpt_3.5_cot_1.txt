<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, `a` and `b`, using the `nextInt()` method of the `Scanner` class.
Then it calculates the sum of `a` and `b` and stores it in the variable `add`.
It also calculates the difference between `a` and `b` and stores it in the variable `sub`.
It calculates the product of `a` and `b` and stores it in the variable `p`.
Then it checks which of the three variables (`add`, `sub`, `p`) is the largest using if-else statements.
If `add` is the largest, it prints `add`.
If `sub` is the largest, it prints `sub`.
If `p` is the largest, it prints `p`.
Finally, it prints an empty string.
