<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a single line of input, which is a BigInteger. It then adds this BigInteger to itself and converts the result to a string. Finally, it prints the string as the output.
In this case, the input is "5 8", so the BigInteger value is 5. Adding 5 to itself gives 10. Converting 10 to a string gives "10".
<<<Output>>>
10
