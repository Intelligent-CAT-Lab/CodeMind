<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 4 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to (1 << n) - 1. In this case, it iterates from 0 to 15.
Inside the for loop, it creates a Vector va to store the indices of the set bits in the binary representation of the current integer i.
It enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to n-1. In this case, it iterates from 0 to 3.
Inside the inner for loop, it checks if the j-th bit of i is set by performing a bitwise AND operation between i and (1 << j). If the result is not zero, it means the j-th bit is set, so it adds j to the Vector va.
After the inner for loop finishes, it prints the current integer i followed by a colon. Then it prints the elements in the Vector va separated by spaces.
After printing the elements in the Vector va, it prints a newline character.
After the outer for loop finishes, the code execution ends.
