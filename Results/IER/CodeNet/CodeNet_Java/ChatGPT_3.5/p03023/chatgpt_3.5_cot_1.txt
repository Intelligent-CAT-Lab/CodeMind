<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads an integer input from the user using the Scanner class and stores it in the variable num.
Then it calculates the value of the variable answer by multiplying 180 with the difference between num and 2.
Finally, it prints the value of answer as the output.
In this case, since the input is 3, the value of answer would be 180 * (3 - 2) = 180.
<<<Output>>>
180
