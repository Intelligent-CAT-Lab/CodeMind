The variable N is initialized with 432 according to the input. And variable wk is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 432 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable wk.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable wk by multiplying i with 1.08 and converting it to an integer.
Then it checks if the calculated variable wk is equal to N. If it does, it prints the current integer i as output and returns from the function.
After the loop finishes, it prints ":(" as output.
