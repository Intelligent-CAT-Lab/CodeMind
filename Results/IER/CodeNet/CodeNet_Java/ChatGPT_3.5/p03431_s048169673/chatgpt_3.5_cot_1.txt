The variable n is initialized with 2 and variable k is initialized with 4 according to the input. The scanner object sc is created to read input from the console. The value of n and k are read from the input using the nextInt() method of the scanner object. The scanner object is then closed. The variable p is initialized with 998244353. The array f is created with size k and the first element is set to 1. Then a for loop is used to calculate the factorial of each number from 1 to k-1 and store the result in the array f. The array fi is created with size k and the last element is set to the inverse of f[k-1] modulo p. Then a for loop is used to calculate the inverse factorial of each number from k-1 to 1 and store the result in the array fi. The variable ans is initialized with 1. Then a for loop is used to calculate the value of ans by left shifting it by 1 and subtracting p if it becomes greater than or equal to p. Then another for loop is used to calculate the final answer by subtracting the product of f[k-1], fi[i] and fi[k-1-i] modulo p from ans for each i from 0 to min(n-1, k-1). Finally, the value of ans modulo p is printed as the output.
