<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input from the user and stores it in the variable `s`. 
Then it checks if the string `s` ends with the letter "s". If it does, it appends "es" to the string `s` and prints the result. Otherwise, it appends "s" to the string `s` and prints the result.
In this case, the input string is "apple" and it does not end with the letter "s". Therefore, the code will append "s" to the string "apple" and print "apples".
<<<Output>>>
apples
