<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string from the user using the Scanner class. It then checks if the input string ends with the letter "s". If it does, it appends "es" to the input string and prints the result. Otherwise, it appends "s" to the input string and prints the result.
In this case, the input string is "apple". Since it does not end with the letter "s", the code will append "s" to the input string and print "apples".
<<<Output>>>
apples
