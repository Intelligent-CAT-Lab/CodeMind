<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string in the format "yyyy/MM/dd" and extracts the substring starting from index 5, which gives us the month and day part of the date.
It then checks if the first character of the extracted substring is '1' or if the second character is greater than '4'. If either of these conditions is true, it prints "TBD". Otherwise, it prints "Heisei".
In the given input "2019/04/30", the extracted substring is "04/30". The first character is '0' and the second character is '4', which is not greater than '4'. Therefore, the output would be "Heisei".
<<<Output>>>
Heisei
