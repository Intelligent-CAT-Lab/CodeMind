<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes the input date in the format "yyyy/MM/dd" and extracts the substring starting from index 5, which gives us the month and day part of the date.
It then checks if the first character of the extracted substring is '1' or if the second character is greater than '4'. If either of these conditions is true, it prints "TBD".
Otherwise, it prints "Heisei".
In this case, the extracted substring is "04/30". The first character is '0' and the second character is '4', so the condition is not true. Therefore, the output will be "Heisei".
<<<Output>>>
Heisei
