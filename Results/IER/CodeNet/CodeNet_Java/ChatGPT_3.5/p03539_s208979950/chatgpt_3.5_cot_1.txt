<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 2 and variable K is initialized with 3 according to the input. And variable mod is initialized with 1000000007.
Then it initializes a 2D array sum with size (n+1) * 10000 and a 2D array num with size (n+1) * 10000.
It sets the value of num[n][0] to 1.
Then it enters a for loop and iterates from n-1 to 0. Inside the loop, it iterates from 0 to 9999.
Inside the nested loop, it checks if num[i+1][j] is not equal to 0. If it is not equal to 0, it calculates the value of notmove as the maximum of K-(i+2) and 0.
If notmove is greater than 0, it adds notmove to the variable check and updates the value of num[i][j] by multiplying num[i+1][j] with notmove and taking the modulo with mod.
It also updates the value of sum[i][j] by adding sum[i+1][j] multiplied by notmove and num[i+1][j] multiplied by ((K-1+j)*(K+j)/2 - (i+2+j)*(i+1+j)/2) and taking the modulo with mod.
Then it sets the value of u as the minimum of K-1 and i+1.
It enters another nested loop and iterates from 0 to u+j. Inside the loop, it calculates the value of lnum as the minimum of u+j and d+i minus the maximum of j and d plus 1.
If lnum is less than 0, it continues to the next iteration of the loop.
It adds lnum to the variable check and calculates the values of lmax and lmin.
It updates the value of num[i][j+e] by multiplying num[i+1][j] with lnum and taking the modulo with mod.
It also updates the value of sum[i][j+e] by adding sum[i+1][j] multiplied by lnum and num[i+1][j] multiplied by (lmax*(lmax+1)/2 - lmin*(lmin-1)/2) and taking the modulo with mod.
After the nested loop finishes, it checks if the value of check is equal to K. If it is not equal to K, it throws an assertion error.
After the for loop finishes, it initializes the variable ans to 0.
Then it enters another for loop and iterates from 0 to 9999. Inside the loop, it adds the value of sum[0][i] to ans.
Finally, it prints the value of ans modulo mod as the output.
