<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes input from the user and splits it into three parts: m, f, and b. It then checks three conditions:
1. If b is greater than the sum of m and f, it prints "NA".
2. If b is greater than m but not greater than the sum of m and f, it prints the difference between b and m.
3. If b is less than or equal to m, it prints "0".

In this case, b is equal to the sum of m and f, so the second condition is true. Therefore, the output will be the difference between b and m, which is 3000 - 1000 = 2000.
<<<Output>>>
2000
