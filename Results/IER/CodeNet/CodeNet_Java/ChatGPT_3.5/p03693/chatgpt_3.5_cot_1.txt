<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input and multiplies the first integer by 100, the second integer by 10, and leaves the third integer as it is. Then it adds all three integers and stores the result in the variable sum. Finally, it checks if the sum is divisible by 4 using the modulo operator (%). If the sum is divisible by 4, it prints "YES", otherwise it prints "NO".
In this case, the input is 4, 3, and 2. So, the code will calculate r = 4 * 100 = 400, g = 3 * 10 = 30, and b = 2. Then it will calculate sum = 400 + 30 + 2 = 432. Since 432 is not divisible by 4, the output will be "NO".
<<<Output>>>
