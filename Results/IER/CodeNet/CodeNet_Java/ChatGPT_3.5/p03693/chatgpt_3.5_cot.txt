<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input: r, g, and b. It multiplies r by 100, g by 10, and adds b to get the sum. Then it checks if the sum is divisible by 4. If it is, it prints "YES", otherwise it prints "NO".
In this case, the input values are 4, 3, and 2. So, r = 4 * 100 = 400, g = 3 * 10 = 30, and b = 2. The sum is 400 + 30 + 2 = 432. Since 432 is not divisible by 4, the output will be "NO".
<<<Output>>>
NO
