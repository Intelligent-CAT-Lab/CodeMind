<<<Analysis>>>
The variable K, variable A and variable B are initialized with 4000, 2000 and 500 respectively according to the input.
It checks the following conditions in order:
1. If A is greater than or equal to K, it prints 1.
2. If A is less than or equal to B, it prints -1.
3. If (K - A) is divisible by (A - B), it prints ((K - A) / (A - B)) * 2 + 1.
4. If none of the above conditions are met, it prints ((K - A) / (A - B)) * 2 + 3.

In this case, the condition (K - A) % (A - B) == 0 is true, so it prints ((K - A) / (A - B)) * 2 + 1.
