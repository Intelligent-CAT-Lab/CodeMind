<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads an integer input from the user using the Scanner class and stores it in variable 'a'. Then it calculates the sum of 'a', 'a' squared, and 'a' cubed, and prints the result as output.
In this case, the input is 2. So the code will calculate 2 + (2^2) + (2^3) = 2 + 4 + 8 = 14.
<<<Output>>>
14
