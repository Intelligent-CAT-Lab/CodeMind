The variable k is initialized with 15 according to the input. A LinkedList named list is created and initialized with the numbers from 1 to 9.
A variable val is initialized with -1. Then a while loop is executed until k becomes 0. In each iteration of the loop, the first element of the list is removed and assigned to val.
If the last digit of val is not 0, a new number is added to the list by multiplying val by 10 and adding the last digit of val minus 1.
Then a new number is added to the list by multiplying val by 10 and adding the last digit of val.
If the last digit of val is not 9, a new number is added to the list by multiplying val by 10 and adding the last digit of val plus 1.
Finally, the value of val is printed as the output.
