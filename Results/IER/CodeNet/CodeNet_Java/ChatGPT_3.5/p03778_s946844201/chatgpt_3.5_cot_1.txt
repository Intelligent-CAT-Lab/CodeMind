<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integer inputs W, a, and b using the Scanner class.
It then checks if the sum of a and W is less than b. If it is, it calculates the difference between b and the sum of a and W and prints it as the output.
If the sum of a and W is not less than b, it checks if the sum of b and W is less than a. If it is, it calculates the difference between a and the sum of b and W and prints it as the output.
If neither of the above conditions is true, it prints "0" as the output.
In this case, the sum of a and W is 5, which is not less than b (6), so the code checks the second condition. The sum of b and W is also not less than a (2), so the code prints "0" as the output.
