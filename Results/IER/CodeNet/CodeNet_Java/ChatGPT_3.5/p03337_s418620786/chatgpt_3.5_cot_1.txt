<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers from the input using the Scanner class and assigns them to variables a and b respectively. Then it calculates the maximum value among a+b, a-b, and a*b using the Math.max() method and prints the result.
In this case, a is 3 and b is 1. So, a+b is 4, a-b is 2, and a*b is 3. The maximum value among these three is 4. Therefore, the output will be 4.
<<<Output>>>
