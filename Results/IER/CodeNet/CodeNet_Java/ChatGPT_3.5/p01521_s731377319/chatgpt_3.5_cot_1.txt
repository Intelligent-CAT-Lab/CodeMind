<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string and converts it into a character array. It then checks if the first and last characters of the array are both 'x'. If they are, it prints 'x', otherwise it prints 'o'.
In this case, the first and last characters of the input string are 'o' and 'o' respectively, so the condition is not met. Therefore, the output will be 'o'.
<<<Output>>>
o
