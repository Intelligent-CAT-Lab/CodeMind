<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 0 according to the input. 
Then it calculates the integer division of n by 30 and assigns the result to variable ans1. Since n is 0, ans1 will also be 0.
Then it calculates the remainder of n divided by 30 and assigns the result to variable n. Since n is 0, n will remain 0.
Then it multiplies n by 2 and assigns the result to variable ans2. Since n is 0, ans2 will also be 0.
Finally, it prints the values of ans1 and ans2 separated by a space as output, which is "0 0".
<<<Output>>>
0 0
