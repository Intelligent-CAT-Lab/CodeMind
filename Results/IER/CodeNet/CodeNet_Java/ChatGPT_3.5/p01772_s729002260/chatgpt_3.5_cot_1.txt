<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string from the input and stores it in the variable `line`. It then initializes a `StringBuilder` object `sb` and a boolean variable `a` to `true`.
The code then iterates over each character `c` in the string `line`. If `c` is equal to 'A' and `a` is `true`, it sets `a` to `false`. If `c` is equal to 'Z' and `a` is `false`, it appends "AZ" to the `sb` object and sets `a` to `true`.
After the loop finishes, it checks if the length of `sb` is not equal to 0. If it is not 0, it prints the contents of `sb` as output. Otherwise, it prints -1 as output.
In this case, the string "AIZUNYANPEROPERO" contains the sequence "AZ" at the end, so the output will be "AZ".
