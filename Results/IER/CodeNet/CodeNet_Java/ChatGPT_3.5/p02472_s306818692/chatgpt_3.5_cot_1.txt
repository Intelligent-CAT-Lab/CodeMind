<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a line of input from the user and stores it in the variable `s`. Then it splits the string `s` into an array of strings `str` using the space character as the delimiter. The first element of `str` is converted to a `BigInteger` object and stored in the variable `a`, and the second element of `str` is converted to a `BigInteger` object and stored in the variable `b`. 

The code then adds `a` and `b` together and stores the result in the variable `c`. Finally, it prints the value of `c` as the output.

In this case, the input is "5 8", so `a` will be 5 and `b` will be 8. The sum of `a` and `b` is 13. Therefore, the output will be 13.
