<<<Analysis>>>
The variable a, variable n and variable m are initialized with 16, 2 and 1000 respectively according to the input. And variable max is initialized with the square root of m.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to max to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable x.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the power of i to the power of n and assigns it to variable x. Then it converts the integer x to a string and assigns it to variable str.
Then it initializes variable y with 0 and enters another for loop to iterate through each character in the string str. It converts each character to an integer and adds it to variable y.
After the inner loop finishes, it checks if the sum of variable y and variable a is equal to i. If it is, it increments the variable ans by 1.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable ans as output.
