<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 5 according to the input. And variables a, b and temp are initialized with 2, 1 and null respectively.
It checks if N is equal to 1. Since it is not, it enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to 5. In each iteration, it updates the values of variables a and b by swapping them and adding them together.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable b as output, which is 8.
<<<Output>>>
8
