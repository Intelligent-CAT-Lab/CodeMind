<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four integers as input: H, W, A, and B. It then initializes some arrays and variables. It calculates the answer by iterating over a loop and performing some calculations. Finally, it prints the answer as the output.

Here is a step-by-step analysis of the code:
1. Read the values of H, W, A, and B from the input.
2. Initialize the arrays fac[], rev[], and revfac[] with size H+W+1.
3. Set the initial values of fac[0], rev[0], and revfac[0].
4. Calculate the factorial, reverse, and reverse factorial values for each index from 1 to H+W.
5. Initialize the variable ans to 0.
6. Enter a loop that iterates from 0 to H-A.
7. Inside the loop, calculate the combination of (B+i-1, B-1) and (W-B+H-i-2, W-B-1).
8. Add the calculated combination to the variable ans.
9. Take the modulo of ans with MOD.
10. Print the value of ans as the output.
