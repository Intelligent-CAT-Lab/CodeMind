<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes input from the user using the Scanner class. It reads a string from the input and assigns it to the variable 'a'. Then it uses the replaceAll() method to replace all occurrences of the comma (',') with a space (' '). Finally, it prints the modified string as the output.
In this case, the input string is "happy,newyear,enjoy". So, the code will replace the comma with a space and the output will be "happy newyear enjoy".
<<<Output>>>
happy newyear enjoy
