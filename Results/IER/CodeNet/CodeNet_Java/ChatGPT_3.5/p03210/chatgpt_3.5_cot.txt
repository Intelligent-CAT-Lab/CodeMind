<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `age`. 
Then it checks if the value of `age` is equal to 3, 5, or 7. If it is, it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".
In this case, the value of `age` is 5, which is equal to one of the specified values. Therefore, the output will be "YES".
<<<Output>>>
YES
