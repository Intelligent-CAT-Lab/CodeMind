<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads an integer input from the user and stores it in the variable `age`. It then checks if the value of `age` is equal to 3, 5, or 7. If it is, it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".

In this case, the input is 5. So, the condition `age == 3 || age == 5 || age == 7` evaluates to true because `age` is equal to 5. Therefore, the code will print "YES" as the output.
<<<Output>>>
YES
