The variable N is initialized with 2 and variable X is initialized with 3 according to the input. The variable dp is a 3-dimensional array of long type with dimensions [2][512][X+1]. The array is initialized with all elements as 0.
Then, a for loop is used to initialize the elements of dp[0] array. For each index i, dp[0][i][i] is set to 1.
A variable t is initialized with 1. Then, a for loop is used to iterate from 1 to N-1. In each iteration, the value of t is toggled between 0 and 1.
Inside the loop, the elements of dp[t] array are set to 0 using Arrays.fill() method.
Then, a nested for loop is used to calculate the values of dp[t] array. For each index j, a variable sum is initialized with 0. Then, another nested for loop is used to iterate from 0 to X. In each iteration, the value of sum is updated by adding dp[1-t][j][k]. Then, dp[t][j^k][k] is updated by adding the value of sum and taking modulo with MOD.
After the loop finishes, a variable ans is initialized with 0. Then, a for loop is used to iterate from 0 to X. In each iteration, the value of ans is updated by adding dp[1-t][X][i].
Finally, the value of ans modulo MOD is printed as the output.
