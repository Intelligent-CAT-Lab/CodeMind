<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N and variable X are initialized with 2 and 3 respectively according to the input. The variable dp is initialized as a 3-dimensional array with dimensions [2][512][X+1]. The value of dp[0][i][i] is set to 1 for all i from 0 to X. The variable t is initialized as 1. 

Then, a for loop is executed N-1 times, where N is 2. In each iteration, the value of t is updated to 1-t. The inner for loop initializes all elements of dp[t][j] to 0. Then, another for loop is executed to calculate the sum of dp[1-t][j][k] for each j and k. The sum is stored in the variable sum. Then, the value of dp[t][j^k][k] is updated by adding the sum to it and taking the modulo MOD. 

After the loop finishes, the variable ans is initialized as 0. Another for loop is executed to calculate the sum of dp[1-t][X][i] for each i from 0 to X. The sum is added to the variable ans. Finally, the value of ans modulo MOD is printed as the output.
