<<<Analysis>>>
The variable base is initialized with 4 and variable K is initialized with 2 according to the input. The variable next is declared but not initialized and variable ans is initialized with 1.
It enters a while loop and it continues until the value of variable base is greater than or equal to 1.
Inside the while loop, it initializes the variables low and high with 0 and base respectively.
Then it enters another while loop and it continues until the difference between high and low is greater than 1.
Inside the inner while loop, it calculates the value of variable willNext as the average of low and high.
Then it checks if willNext is less than or equal to K multiplied by (base - willNext). If it is, it updates the value of low to willNext. Otherwise, it updates the value of high to willNext.
After the inner while loop finishes, it assigns the value of low to the variable next.
Then it checks if the value of next is greater than 0. If it is, it updates the value of base to next and increments the value of ans by 1. Otherwise, it breaks out of the while loop.
After the while loop finishes, it prints the value of ans as output, which is 3.
