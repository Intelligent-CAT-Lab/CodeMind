<<<Analysis>>>
The variable K is initialized with the value 10.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable num by adding the current value of variable d to it.
Then it checks if the result of the method calc() called with the argument (num + 2 * d) is less than the result of the method calc() called with the argument (num + d).
If the condition is true, it multiplies the value of variable d by 10.
Finally, it prints the value of variable num.
This process is repeated 10 times.
