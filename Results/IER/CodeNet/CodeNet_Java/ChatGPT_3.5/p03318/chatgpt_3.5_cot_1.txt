<<<Analysis>>>
The variable K is initialized with 10 according to the input. And variable num is initialized with 0 and variable d is initialized with 1.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 9. In each iteration, it adds the value of variable d to variable num and then checks if the result of calc(num + 2 * d) is less than the result of calc(num + d). If it is, it multiplies the value of variable d by 10.
Inside the for loop, it also prints the current value of variable num.
The calc() method calculates the sum of the digits of the input number and returns the result of dividing the input number by the sum.
After the loop finishes, it does not print any additional output.
