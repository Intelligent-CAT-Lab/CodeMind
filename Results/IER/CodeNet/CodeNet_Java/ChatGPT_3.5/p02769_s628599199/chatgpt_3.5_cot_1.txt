<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 3 and variable k is initialized with 2 according to the input.
It checks if k is greater than or equal to n - 1. Since k is 2 and n - 1 is 2, the condition is true.
Inside the if condition, it calls the choose() method with arguments 2 * n - 1 and n - 1. The choose() method calculates the binomial coefficient using the formula (a! / (b! * (a-b)!)) % mod. In this case, a is 5 and b is 2. The choose() method calculates the numerator and denominator of the binomial coefficient and returns the result. The result is then printed as output.
So the output would be the result of the choose() method, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
