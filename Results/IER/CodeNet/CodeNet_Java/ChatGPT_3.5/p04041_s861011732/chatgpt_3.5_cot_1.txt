<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes input values for n, x, y, and z as 3, 5, 7, and 5 respectively.
It initializes an array dp with size (n+1) and (1<<17) and fills it with -1.
It initializes an array pow with size (n+1) and calculates the values of pow[i] as (10*pow[i-1])%mod.
It calculates the value of XYZ_MASK as (1<<(z-1))|(1<<(z+y-1))|(1<<(z+y+x-1)).
It calls the function sol(n,0) and passes the values of n and 0 as arguments.
Inside the function sol, it checks if the mask is equal to XYZ_MASK. If it is, it returns pow[i].
If i is equal to 0, it returns 0.
If the value of dp[i][mask] is not equal to -1, it returns dp[i][mask].
Otherwise, it initializes dp[i][mask] as 0 and iterates through the digits from 1 to 10.
Inside the loop, it calls the function sol with arguments (i-1, merge(mask,digit)) and adds the returned value to dp[i][mask].
Finally, it returns dp[i][mask] % mod.
The final output is printed as the result of sol(n,0).
