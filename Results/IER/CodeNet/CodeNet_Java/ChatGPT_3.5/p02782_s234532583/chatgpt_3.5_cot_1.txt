<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four integers as input: r1, c1, r2, and c2. These values are read from the input using the Scanner class.
Then, it initializes the mod variable with 1000000007 and creates two arrays p and pi of size 2000003 to store the factorial and modular inverse values.
Next, it calculates the factorial values and modular inverses for each index of the arrays p and pi using a for loop.
After that, it calculates four values v1, v2, v3, and v4 using the nCr function and the values of r1, c1, r2, and c2.
Finally, it calculates the final answer by subtracting v2 and v3 from v1 and adding v4. It then applies the modulo operation and prints the answer.
