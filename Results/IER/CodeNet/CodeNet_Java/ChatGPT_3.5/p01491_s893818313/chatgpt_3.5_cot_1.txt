The variables M, N, m0, md, n0, and nd are initialized with the values 2, 3, 1, 3, 1, and 0 respectively according to the input.
Then, two arrays m and n are initialized with sizes M and N respectively.
The first element of m is set to m0 and the first element of n is set to n0.
Then, two for loops are used to fill the arrays m and n with values based on the formulas (m[i - 1] * 58 + md) % (N + 1) and (n[i - 1] * 58 + nd) % (M + 1) respectively.
After that, the arrays m and n are sorted using the sort method.
Next, two accumulative arrays accumN and accumM are initialized with sizes N + 1 and M + 1 respectively.
The accumN array is filled with the cumulative sum of the elements in the array n.
The accumM array is filled with the cumulative sum of the elements in the array m.
Then, a variable cur is set to N.
A variable sum is initialized with the value accumM[0] + accumN[cur] + (N - cur) * (M - 0).
A for loop is used to iterate through the elements of the accumM array.
Inside the loop, a while loop is used to find the maximum value of cur such that accumN[cur] >= accumN[cur - 1] + (M - i).
The sum is updated with the minimum value of sum, accumM[i] + accumN[cur] + (N - cur) * (M - i).
Finally, the value of sum is printed as the output.
