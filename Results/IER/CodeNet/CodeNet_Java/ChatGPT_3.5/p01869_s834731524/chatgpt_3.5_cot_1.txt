<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 1 according to the input. 
It calls the createGoodNumber() method to generate a list of good numbers. 
Then it initializes an empty list sub.
It iterates through the list of all good numbers and checks if N is divisible by each number. If it is, the number is added to the sub list.
If N is equal to 1, it prints -1 and returns.
It initializes a map array with the same size as the sub list.
It calls the dfs() method with parameters 0 and N.
Inside the dfs() method, it checks if the current number n is equal to 1. If it is, it returns 0.
If the map at index i contains the current number n, it returns the value stored in the map.
It initializes the variable ret with -1.
It iterates through the sub list starting from index i and checks if n is divisible by each number. If it is, it calls the dfs() method recursively with the updated value of n and stores the result in the variable tmp.
If tmp + 1 is greater than 0, it stores the value of tmp + 1 in the map at index i and returns tmp + 1.
If none of the conditions are met, it stores the value of ret in the map at index i and returns ret.
Finally, it prints the result of the dfs() method.
<<<Output>>>
-1
