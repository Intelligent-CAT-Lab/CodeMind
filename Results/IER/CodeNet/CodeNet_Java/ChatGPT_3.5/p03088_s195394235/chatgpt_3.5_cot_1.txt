<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 3 according to the input. The variable dp is a 4-dimensional array of type long. It is initialized with dimensions [4][4][4][n-3+1] and all elements are set to 0, except for dp[0][1][2][0], dp[0][2][1][0], and dp[1][0][2][0] which are set to 0. The variable sum is initialized with 0.

Then, there is a nested for loop that iterates over the dimensions of the dp array. Inside this loop, there is another nested for loop that iterates over the dimensions of the dp array again. Inside this loop, there is another nested for loop that iterates over the dimensions of the dp array again. Inside this loop, there is another nested for loop that iterates over the dimensions of the dp array again. Inside this loop, the value of dp[j][k][l][m+1] is updated by adding the value of dp[i][j][k][m] and taking the modulo of MOD. Then, the values of dp[0][1][2][m+1], dp[0][2][1][m+1], and dp[1][0][2][m+1] are set to 0. If i is equal to 0, then there is an additional nested for loop that iterates over the dimensions of the dp array and sets the values of dp[o][1][2][m+1] and dp[1][o][2][m+1] to 0.

After the nested for loops, there is another nested for loop that iterates over the dimensions of the dp array. Inside this loop, the value of sum is updated by adding the value of dp[i][j][k][n-3] and taking the modulo of MOD.

Finally, the value of sum is printed as the output.
