The variable n is initialized with 18 according to the input. 
A TreeSet called nums is created to store the factors of n. 
A for loop is used to iterate from 2 to the square root of n. 
Inside the loop, it checks if n is divisible by i. If it is, it adds -i and -n/i to the nums set. 
After the loop, the size of the nums set plus 1 is assigned to the variable max. 
The variable min is initialized with 0. 
A HashSet called used is created to store the factors of the negative numbers in the nums set. 
Another for loop is used to iterate through the nums set. 
Inside the loop, it checks if the negative number x is already in the used set. If it is, it continues to the next iteration. 
Otherwise, it increments the min variable by 1. 
Then, it iterates from 2 to the square root of -x. 
Inside this nested loop, it checks if -x is divisible by i. If it is, it adds i and -x/i to the used set. 
After the nested loop, it checks if the min variable is still 0. If it is, it increments it by 1. 
Finally, it prints the values of min and max as output. 
In this case, the values of min and max would be 1 and 3 respectively.
