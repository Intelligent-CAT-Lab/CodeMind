<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two BigInteger values from the input using the Scanner class. The first value is assigned to variable 'a' and the second value is assigned to variable 'b'. Then it calculates the remainder of 'a' divided by 'b' using the remainder() method of the BigInteger class. Finally, it prints the remainder as the output.
In this case, the input is "5 8". So, 'a' will be assigned the value 5 and 'b' will be assigned the value 8. The remainder of 5 divided by 8 is 5. Therefore, the output will be 5.
<<<Output>>>
5
