<<<Analysis>>>
The variable a, variable n and variable m are initialized with 16, 2 and 1000 respectively according to the input. And variable ans is initialized with 0.
It reads the input values of a, n and m using the Scanner class.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from a to m to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num2.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable y by calling the Dudeney() method with the argument num2. The Dudeney() method calculates the sum of the digits of num2.
Then it calculates the value of variable x by adding the value of y and a, and then raising it to the power of n.
If the value of num2 is equal to the value of x, it increments the value of ans by 1.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable ans as output.
