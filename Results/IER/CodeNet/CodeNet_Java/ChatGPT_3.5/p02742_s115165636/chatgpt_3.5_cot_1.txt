<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers H and W from the input. It then checks if H is greater than W. If it is, it swaps the values of H and W. 
Next, it checks if H is not equal to 1. If it is not, it calculates the number of cells in a rectangle with dimensions H and W. 
The formula used is ((W+1)/2)*((H+1)/2)+(W/2)*(H/2). 
If H is equal to 1, it simply prints 1 as the output.
In this case, H=4 and W=5. Since H is not equal to 1, the formula is used to calculate the output.
(((5+1)/2)*((4+1)/2)) + ((5/2)*(4/2)) = 3*3 + 2*2 = 9 + 4 = 13.
<<<Output>>>
13
