<<<Analysis>>>
The variable X and variable Y are initialized with 9 and 45000 respectively according to the input. And variable sum is initialized with 0. Variable judge is initialized with false. Variables a, b, and c are initialized with 0.

It enters a nested for loop and it iterates from 0 to 9 for variable i and from 0 to X-i+1 for variable k. The value of variable i and k are used to calculate the value of variable sum using the formula sum = 10000*i + 5000*k + 1000*(X-i-k).

Inside the nested for loop, it checks if the calculated variable sum is equal to Y. If it is, it sets the variable judge to true and assigns the values of i, k, and X-i-k to variables a, b, and c respectively. Then it breaks out of the inner for loop.

After the nested for loop finishes, it checks the value of variable judge. If it is true, it prints the values of variables a, b, and c. If it is false, it prints "-1 -1 -1".

In this case, the condition sum==Y is met when i=4, k=0, and X-i-k=5. So the values of a, b, and c are 4, 0, and 5 respectively.
