<<<Analysis>>>
The variable X and variable Y are initialized with 9 and 45000 respectively according to the input. And variable sum is initialized with 0. The variable judge is initialized with false. The variables a, b, and c are initialized with 0.

It enters a nested for loop and it iterates from 0 to 9 for variable i and from 0 to X-i+1 for variable k. The value of variable sum is calculated as 10000*i + 5000*k + 1000*(X-i-k) for each combination of i and k.

Inside the nested for loop, it checks if the calculated variable sum is equal to Y. If it is, it sets the variable judge to true and assigns the values of i, k, and X-i-k to variables a, b, and c respectively. Then it breaks out of the inner loop.

After the loops finish, it checks the value of judge. If it is true, it prints the values of a, b, and c. If it is false, it prints "-1 -1 -1".
