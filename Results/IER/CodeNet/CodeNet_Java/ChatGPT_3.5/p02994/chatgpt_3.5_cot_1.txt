<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and variable l are initialized with 5 and 2 respectively according to the input. 
A new ArrayList called diff is created to store the differences between the values of l+i-1 and 0 for each i from 1 to n.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of l+i-1 and stores it in the variable value. If the value is negative, it multiplies it by -1 to make it positive.
Then it adds the value to the diff ArrayList.
After the loop finishes, it finds the index of the minimum value in the diff ArrayList using the Collections.min() method and adds 1 to it to get the value of removeK.
Finally, it calculates the output by subtracting the sum of n and (l+removeK-1) from the sum of n*l and n*(n+1)/2.
