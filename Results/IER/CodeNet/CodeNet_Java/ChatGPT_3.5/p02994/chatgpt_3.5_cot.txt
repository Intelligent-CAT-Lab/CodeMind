<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and variable l are initialized with 5 and 2 respectively according to the input. 
A list called diff is created to store the differences between the values of l+i-1 and 0 for each i from 1 to n.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of l+i-1 and stores it in the variable value. If the value is negative, it converts it to positive by multiplying it with -1.
Then it adds the value to the list diff.
After the loop finishes, it finds the index of the minimum value in the list diff using the Collections.min() method and adds 1 to it. The result is stored in the variable removeK.
Finally, it calculates the final output by subtracting the sum of n and (l+removeK-1) from the sum of n*l and n*(n+1)/2.
