<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers A, B, and C as input.
It then checks two conditions:
1. If A is greater than C, or
2. If the sum of A and B is less than C.
If either of these conditions is true, it prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES".
In this case, A = 3, B = 5, and C = 4.
The condition A > C is false, and the condition A + B < C is also false.
Therefore, the code will print "YES".
<<<Output>>>
YES
