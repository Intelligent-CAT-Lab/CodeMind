<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads four long integers a, b, c, and k from the input. It then performs some calculations based on the value of k and prints the result.

The value of k is calculated as k = in.nextLong() % 2. Since the input value of k is 1, k will be 1 % 2 = 1.

Since k % 2 == 1, the code enters the if statement. Inside the if statement, it calculates two new values na = b + c and nb = a + c. Then it assigns na to a and nb to b.

Finally, it calculates and prints the value of a - b.

<<<Output>>>
