<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads an integer input from the user using the Scanner class and stores it in the variable x.
Then it checks if the value of x is less than 1200. If it is, it prints "ABC". Otherwise, it prints "ARC".
In this case, the value of x is 1000, which is less than 1200. So the code will print "ABC".
<<<Output>>>
ABC
