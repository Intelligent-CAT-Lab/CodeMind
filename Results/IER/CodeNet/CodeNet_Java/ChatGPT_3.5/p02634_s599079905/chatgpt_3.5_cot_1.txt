<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four integers A, B, C, and D as input. It initializes a constant variable MOD with the value 998244353. It also initializes two 2D arrays dp and sum with dimensions DxC. The elements of dp and sum are initially set to 0.

Next, it sets the value of sum[B-1][A-1] to 1.

Then, it enters a nested for loop. The outer loop iterates from B to D-1 and the inner loop iterates from A to C-1. Inside the loop, it calculates the value of dp[i][j] and sum[i][j] based on the previous values of dp and sum.

After the loop finishes, it initializes a variable ans to 0.

Then, it enters another nested for loop. The outer loop iterates from D-1 to B and the inner loop iterates from C-1 to A. Inside the loop, it calculates the value of ans based on the values of dp, powC, and powI.

Finally, it calculates the final value of ans by adding the product of powC and sum[B-1][C-1] to ans.

The final value of ans is printed as the output.
