<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string and replaces all occurrences of "egg" with "e" and all occurrences of "chicken" with "c". Then it replaces all occurrences of "ee" with "e e" and all occurrences of "cc" with "c c". It splits the modified string into an array of strings using space as the delimiter. It then iterates through the array and finds the string with the maximum length. If the last character of the string is 'e', it sets the answer as "egg", otherwise it sets the answer as "chicken". Finally, it prints the answer.

In this case, the input string is "eggchickenegg". After the replacements, the modified string becomes "e c e". The array of strings will have three elements: "e", "c", and "e". The string with the maximum length is "e" and its last character is 'e', so the answer will be "egg".

<<<Output>>>
egg
