<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input `n` and performs the following steps:
1. It initializes a variable `result` to 0.
2. It creates a 2D array `array` of size 10x10 to store the count of numbers with the same first and last digit.
3. It iterates from 1 to `n` and for each number `i`, it extracts the first digit (`head`) and the last digit (`tail`) of `i` and increments the count in `array[head][tail]`.
4. It calculates the number of numbers where the first digit is equal to the last digit by iterating from 1 to `n` and for each number `i`, it checks if the last digit (`tail`) is 0. If it is, it skips to the next iteration. Otherwise, it adds the count in `array[tail][head]` to `result`.
5. It prints the value of `result` as the output.
