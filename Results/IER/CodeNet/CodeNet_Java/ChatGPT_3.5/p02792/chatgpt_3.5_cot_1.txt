<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 25 according to the input. 
It creates a 2D array called array with size 10x10 to store the count of occurrences of each pair of head and tail digits.
Then it enters a for loop and iterates from 1 to n to calculate the head and tail digits of each number i.
Inside the loop, it extracts the head digit by converting the number i to a string and taking the first character, and extracts the tail digit by taking the remainder of i divided by 10.
It increments the count of the pair (head, tail) in the array.
After the loop finishes, it calculates the number of pairs where the tail digit is 0 and the head digit is not 0. It does this by iterating from 1 to n and adding the count of the pair (tail, head) in the array to the result variable.
Finally, it prints the value of the result variable as the output.
