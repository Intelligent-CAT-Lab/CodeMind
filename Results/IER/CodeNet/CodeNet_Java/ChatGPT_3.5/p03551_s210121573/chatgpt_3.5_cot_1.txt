<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 1 and variable M is initialized with 1 according to the input. The variable c is calculated as 1900.0*M + 100.0*(N-M), which is 1900.0*1 + 100.0*(1-1) = 1900.0. The variable p is initialized with 1.0 and the variable res is initialized with 0.0. The variable q is initialized with 1.0.
Then it enters a for loop and iterates from 0 to M-1 (0 to 0 in this case). In each iteration, it multiplies the variable p by 0.5. Since M is 1, the loop runs only once and p becomes 0.5.
Then it enters another for loop and iterates from 1 to 3000000. In each iteration, it calculates res += i*c*p*q and q *= 1-p. The value of res is incremented by i*c*p*q and the value of q is multiplied by 1-p. This loop runs 3000000 times.
After the loop finishes, it calculates the value of eps as 0.0000001 and the value of ret as (int)Math.floor(res+eps). Finally, it prints the value of ret as output.
