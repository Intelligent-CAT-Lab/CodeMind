<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers from the input using the Scanner class and stores them in variables. It then calculates the average of the two integers by adding them together and dividing the sum by 2. Finally, it prints the average as the output.
In this case, the input is "1000 3000". The first integer is 1000 and the second integer is 3000. The code adds them together (1000 + 3000 = 4000) and then divides the sum by 2 (4000 / 2 = 2000). Therefore, the output would be 2000.
<<<Output>>>
