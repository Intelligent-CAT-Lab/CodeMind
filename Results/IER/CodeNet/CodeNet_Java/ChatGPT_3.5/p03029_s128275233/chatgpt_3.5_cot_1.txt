<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers a and p from the input using the FastScanner class.
Then it calculates the value of n using the formula (a*3+p)/2.
Finally, it prints the value of n as the output.
In this case, the value of a is 1 and the value of p is 3.
So, the value of n would be (1*3+3)/2 = 3.
<<<Output>>>
3
