<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads an input integer r using the Scanner class. It then checks the value of r using if-else statements.
If r is less than 1200, it prints "ABC".
If r is between 1200 and 2800 (exclusive), it prints "ARC".
If r is greater than or equal to 2800, it prints "AGC".
In this case, the input value is 1199, which is less than 1200. Therefore, the output will be "ABC".
<<<Output>>>
ABC
