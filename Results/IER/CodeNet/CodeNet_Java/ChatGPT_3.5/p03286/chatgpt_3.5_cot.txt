<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input value N and performs a series of calculations to convert N to a negative base (-2 in this case). It initializes a string variable ans as an empty string.
Then it enters a while loop that continues until N becomes 0. Inside the loop, it calculates the quotient q and remainder r of dividing N by -2 using the q() and r() methods respectively. It appends the value of r to the beginning of the ans string. Finally, it updates the value of N to be the quotient q.
The q() method checks if the divisor b is positive or negative and calls either the floor() or ceil() method accordingly. The floor() method returns the largest integer n such that n <= a/b, while the ceil() method returns the smallest integer n such that n >= a/b.
The r() method calculates the remainder of dividing a by b by subtracting the product of q(a, b) and b from a.
The floor() and ceil() methods handle the cases where a and b have different signs by multiplying a and b by -1 before performing the calculations.
Finally, the code prints the value of ans as the output.
