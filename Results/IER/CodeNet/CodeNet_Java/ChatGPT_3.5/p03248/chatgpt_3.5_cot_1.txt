<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input and stores it in an array of characters called 'c'. It then checks if the first character is '0' or the last character is '1'. If either of these conditions is true, it prints -1 and returns. Otherwise, it iterates through the first half of the array and checks if the character at index 'i' is equal to the character at index 'l-i-2' (where 'l' is the length of the array). If any of these characters are not equal, it prints -1 and returns. If all characters are equal, it prints the pairs (1,2), (2,3), (3,4), ..., (l-1,l) where 'l' is the length of the array.
