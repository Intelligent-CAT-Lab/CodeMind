<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string as input and checks if the first character is '0' or the last character is '1'. If either of these conditions is true, it prints -1 and returns. Otherwise, it iterates through the characters of the string from the second character to the second-to-last character. For each character, it checks if it is equal to the character at the corresponding position from the end of the string. If any pair of characters is not equal, it prints -1 and returns. If all pairs of characters are equal, it prints the pairs of indices (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), ..., (n-1, n), where n is the length of the string.
