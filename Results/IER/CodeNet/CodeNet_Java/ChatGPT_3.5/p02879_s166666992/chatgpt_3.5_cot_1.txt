<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers from the input using the Scanner class and assigns them to variables a and b. 
Then it checks if both a and b are less than or equal to 9. If they are, it multiplies them and prints the result. 
Otherwise, it prints -1.
In this case, both a and b are less than or equal to 9, so the product of a and b (2 * 5) will be printed as the output.
