<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input: a, b, and c. It then calculates the sum of a and b and stores it in the variable d. It initializes the variable e with -1.

Next, it enters a for loop that iterates from 0 to 999. Inside the loop, it checks if the remainder of (60*i+c) divided by d is between 0 and a (inclusive). If it is, it assigns the value of i to e and breaks out of the loop.

After the loop, it checks if e is still -1. If it is, it prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the value of (60*e+c).

<<<Output>>>
-1
