<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a, b, and c are initialized with the values 10, 10, and 5 respectively according to the input. The variable d is initialized as the sum of a and b, which is 20. The variable e is initialized as -1. 

Then, a for loop is executed 1000 times. In each iteration, it checks if the remainder of (60 * i + c) divided by d is between 0 and a (inclusive). If it is, the value of i is assigned to e and the loop is terminated using the break statement. 

After the loop, it checks if e is still -1. If it is, it means that no value of i satisfies the condition in the loop, so it prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the value of (60 * e + c).

<<<Output>>>
-1
