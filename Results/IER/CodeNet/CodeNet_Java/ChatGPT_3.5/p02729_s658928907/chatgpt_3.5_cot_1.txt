<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a class `Main` that implements the `Runnable` interface. It also defines a class `Solver` that contains the `solve()` method. The `solve()` method takes two integers `N` and `M` as input and prints the result of the expression `N * (N - 1) / 2 + M * (M - 1) / 2`.

In the `main()` method, an instance of `Solver` is created and the `solve()` method is called with the input values `2` and `1`.

Therefore, the output of the code execution would be the result of the expression `2 * (2 - 1) / 2 + 1 * (1 - 1) / 2`, which simplifies to `1`.
