<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input integer n and performs several calculations to determine the output. 
First, it initializes an array of prime numbers using the sieve of Atkin algorithm. 
Then, it calls the enumDivisors method to calculate the divisors of n using the prime numbers array. 
Next, it calls the factorX method to factorize n into its prime factors. 
Finally, it prints the length of the factor array and the length of the divisors array minus 1 as the output.
In this case, the input is 18.
