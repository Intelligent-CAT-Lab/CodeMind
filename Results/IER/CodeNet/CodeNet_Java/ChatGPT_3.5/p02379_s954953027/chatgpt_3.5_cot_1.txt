<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four double values as input: x1, y1, x2, and y2. These values are read from the standard input using the Scanner class.
Then, it calculates the distance between the points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) using the distance formula: sqrt((x1-x2)^2 + (y1-y2)^2).
The calculated distance is stored in the variable ans.
Finally, it prints the value of ans as the output.
In this case, the input values are 0, 0, 1, and 1.
So, the distance between the points (0, 0) and (1, 1) is sqrt((0-1)^2 + (0-1)^2) = sqrt(1+1) = sqrt(2).
Therefore, the output will be sqrt(2).
