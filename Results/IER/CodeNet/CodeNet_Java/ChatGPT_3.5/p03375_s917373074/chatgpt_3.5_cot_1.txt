<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers n and MOD from the input. It then calls the `prec` method to precalculate the factorials and inverse factorials up to n. It also calls the `stirlingSecond` method to calculate the Stirling numbers of the second kind up to n.

Next, it initializes some arrays and variables. It calculates the powers of 2 modulo MOD and stores them in the `pow2` array. It also calculates the powers of 2 modulo MOD squared and stores them in the `other2` array.

Then, it enters a loop from 1 to n. For each iteration, it calculates the combinations of n choose i using the `comb` method. It also calculates the sum of the Stirling numbers multiplied by various factors and modulo MOD. The result is added to the `total` variable.

Finally, it calculates the final result by subtracting the `total` from the sum of the powers of 2 modulo MOD squared and modulo MOD. It prints the final result.
