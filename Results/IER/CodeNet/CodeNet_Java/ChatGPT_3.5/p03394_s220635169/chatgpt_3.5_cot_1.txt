<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 3 according to the input.
It checks if n is equal to 3. If it is, it prints "2 5 63" and returns.
If n is not equal to 3, it enters a while loop that continues indefinitely until a break statement is encountered.
Inside the while loop, it initializes a TreeSet called used and an array called ans with size n.
It initializes a Random object called random with seed 0.
It initializes a variable g0 with the value 2 * 3 * 5 * 7 * 11 * 13.
It enters a LOOP label that allows breaking out of the while loop.
Inside the while loop, it clears the used TreeSet and adds 1 to it.
It enters a for loop that iterates from 0 to n-1.
Inside the for loop, it generates a random integer between 1 and 30000 (inclusive) and assigns it to ans[i].
It checks if the greatest common divisor of g0 and ans[i] is 1 and if ans[i] is not already in the used TreeSet. If both conditions are true, it breaks out of the do-while loop.
It assigns 0 to ans[n-1].
It calculates the sum of all elements in the ans array and assigns it to the variable sum.
It enters a for loop that starts from g0 - sum % g0 and increments by g0 in each iteration until it reaches 30000.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current value of i can be added to the used TreeSet. If it can, it assigns i to ans[n-1], adds i to the sum, and breaks out of the for loop.
If ans[n-1] is less than or equal to 0, it continues to the next iteration of the while loop.
It calculates the greatest common divisor of all elements in the ans array and assigns it to the variable g.
If g is equal to 1, it enters a for loop that iterates from 0 to n-1.
Inside the for loop, it assigns the current element of ans to a variable a.
It checks if the greatest common divisor of sum - a and a is 1. If it is, it continues to the next iteration of the LOOP label.
If the for loop completes without encountering a continue statement, it calls the print method to print the elements of the ans array and breaks out of the while loop.
