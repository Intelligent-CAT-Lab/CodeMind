<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string and converts it to an integer num1. Then it extracts the individual digits from the input string and converts them to integers a, b, and c. It calculates num2 by rearranging the digits of num1. If num1 is equal to num2, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".
In this case, the input is "575". The code converts it to the integer num1 = 575. Then it extracts the digits 5, 7, and 5 and converts them to integers a = 5, b = 7, and c = 5. It calculates num2 = 100*5 + 10*7 + 5 = 575. Since num1 is equal to num2, it prints "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
