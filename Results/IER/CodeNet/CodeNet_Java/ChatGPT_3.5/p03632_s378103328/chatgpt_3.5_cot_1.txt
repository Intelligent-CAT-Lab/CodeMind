The variables a, b, c, and d are initialized with 0, 75, 25, and 100 respectively according to the input. The variables minSec and maxSec are initialized with the maximum and minimum possible integer values respectively.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 100 to check each integer i in this range. It checks if i falls within the range [a, b] and [c, d] for Alice and Bob respectively. If i falls within both ranges, it updates the values of minSec and maxSec accordingly.
After the loop finishes, it checks if the value of minSec is still the maximum possible integer value. If it is, it means no common value was found between the ranges and it prints "0" as output. Otherwise, it prints the difference between maxSec and minSec as output.
In this case, the value of minSec is 25 and the value of maxSec is 75, so the output would be 50.
<<<Output>>>
50
