<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers n and m as input. It initializes a 2D array dp of size (n+1) x (n+1) with all elements as 0. It also initializes dp[1][0] as 1.
Then it enters a for loop which iterates m times. Inside the loop, it initializes a new 2D array next of the same size as dp.
Then it iterates over all possible values of a and b from 0 to n. For each combination of a and b, it checks if dp[a][b] is not equal to 0.
If dp[a][b] is not equal to 0, it performs the following operations:
- It updates next[a+b][0] by adding dp[a][b] multiplied by a modulo MOD.
- It updates next[a][b+1] by adding dp[a][b] multiplied by (n-a-b) modulo MOD.
- It updates next[a][b] by adding dp[a][b] multiplied by b modulo MOD.
After updating all the values in next, it assigns next to dp.
Finally, it prints the value of dp[n][0] as the output.
