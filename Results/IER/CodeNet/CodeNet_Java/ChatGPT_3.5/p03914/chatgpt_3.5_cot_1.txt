<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and variable m are initialized with 3 and 3 respectively according to the input. And variable dp is initialized as a 2D array of size (n+1) x (n+1) with all elements as 0. The variable MOD is initialized as 1000000007.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2. Inside the loop, it initializes a new 2D array next of the same size as dp with all elements as 0.
Then it enters two nested for loops to iterate through all possible values of a and b. Inside these loops, it checks if the current element dp[a][b] is not equal to 0. If it is 0, it continues to the next iteration.
If dp[a][b] is not 0, it performs the following operations:
- It updates the element next[a+b][0] by adding dp[a][b] multiplied by a modulo MOD.
- It updates the element next[a][b+1] by adding dp[a][b] multiplied by (n-a-b) modulo MOD.
- It updates the element next[a][b] by adding dp[a][b] multiplied by b modulo MOD.
After the nested loops finish, it assigns the value of next to dp.
After the for loop finishes, it prints the value of dp[n][0] as output.
