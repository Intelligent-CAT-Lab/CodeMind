<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers A and B as input. It checks if A is greater than B. If it is, it prints -1 and returns. Otherwise, it enters a for loop that iterates from 1 to 99999999. Inside the loop, it checks if the integer i multiplied by 0.08 is equal to A and if i multiplied by 0.10 is equal to B. If both conditions are true, it prints the value of i and returns. If the loop finishes without finding a match, it prints -1.
In this case, A = 2 and B = 2. The loop will iterate through the numbers and check if (int)(i * 0.08) is equal to 2 and (int)(i * 0.10) is equal to 2. It will find a match when i = 25, because (int)(25 * 0.08) = 2 and (int)(25 * 0.10) = 2. Therefore, the return value will be 25.
