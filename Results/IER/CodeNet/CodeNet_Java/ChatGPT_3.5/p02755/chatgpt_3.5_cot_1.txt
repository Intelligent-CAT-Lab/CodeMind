<<<Analysis>>>
The variable A is initialized with 2 and variable B is initialized with 2 according to the input.
It checks if A is greater than B. Since A is not greater than B, it does not enter the if condition.
Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 99999999 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the integer value of (i * 0.08) is equal to A and the integer value of (i * 0.10) is equal to B.
If the condition is met, it prints the current value of i and returns from the method.
If the condition is not met after the loop finishes, it prints -1.
In this case, the condition is not met and the loop finishes without printing any value. So, it prints -1 as output.
<<<Output>>>
-1
