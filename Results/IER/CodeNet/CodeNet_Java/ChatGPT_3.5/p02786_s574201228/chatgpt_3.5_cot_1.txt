The variable h is initialized with 2 according to the input. And variable x is initialized with 1.
It enters a while loop and it continues to execute the loop until the value of h becomes 1.
Inside the loop, it divides the value of h by 2 and assigns the result back to h. It also multiplies the value of x by 2 and adds 1 to it.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable x as output, which is 3.
