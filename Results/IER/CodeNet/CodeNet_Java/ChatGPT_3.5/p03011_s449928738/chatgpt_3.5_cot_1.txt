<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes an array X of size 3 to store the input values. It then reads three integers from the input and stores them in the array X. The input values are 1, 3, and 4. 

The code then uses the Arrays.sort() method to sort the array X in ascending order. After sorting, the array X will be [1, 3, 4].

Finally, the code prints the sum of the first two elements of the sorted array X, which is 1 + 3 = 4.

<<<Output>>>
4
