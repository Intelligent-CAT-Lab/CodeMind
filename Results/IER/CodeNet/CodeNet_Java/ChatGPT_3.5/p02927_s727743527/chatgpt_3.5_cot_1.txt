The variable m is initialized with 15 and variable d is initialized with 40 according to the input. And variable result is initialized with 0.
It enters a nested for loop and it iterates from 1 to 15 for variable i and from 1 to 40 for variable j to check each combination of i and j in this range.
Inside the nested for loop, it checks if the last digit of j is greater than or equal to 2 and the first digit of j is greater than or equal to 2.
If both conditions are true, it checks if the product of the last digit and the first digit of j is equal to i. If it is, it increments the variable result by 1.
After the nested for loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable result as output, which is the count of combinations that satisfy the conditions.
