<<<Analysis>>>
The variable H, W and K are initialized with 2, 1 and 2 respectively according to the input. And variable mod is initialized with 1000000007.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer n in this range. The value of variable n is also passed to variable m.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the calculated variable m falls within the range [0, 1]. If it does, it calculates the value of variable ans using the formula given in the code.
The value of ans is calculated by multiplying the result of function P(H, n, mod, fif) with the result of function P(W, m, mod, fif) and then multiplying it with the result of the expression ((2*C(K+1, 3, mod, fif) * C(K-2, m-1, mod, fif) + x * C(K, m, mod, fif))%mod).
After the loop finishes, it print the final value of variable ans as output.
