<<<Analysis>>>
The variable H, variable W and variable K are initialized with 2, 1 and 2 respectively according to the input. And variable ans is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer n in this range. The value of variable n is also passed to variable m.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the calculated variable m falls within the range [0, 1]. If it does, it calculates the value of ans using the formula:
P(H, n, mod, fif) * P(W, m, mod, fif) % mod * ((2*C(K+1, 3, mod, fif) * C(K-2, m-1, mod, fif) + x * C(K, m, mod, fif))%mod)
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output.
