<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input `n` and passes it to the method `problem102a()`. 
Inside the method, it checks if `n` is divisible by 2 (i.e., `n % 2 == 0`). If it is, it returns `n`. Otherwise, it returns `n * 2`.
In this case, the input `3` is not divisible by 2, so the method will return `3 * 2 = 6`.
