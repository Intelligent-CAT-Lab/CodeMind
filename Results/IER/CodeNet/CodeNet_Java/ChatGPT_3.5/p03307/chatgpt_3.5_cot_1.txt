<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 3 according to the input.
The code then calls the method problem102a with the value of n as argument.
Inside the method, it checks if n is divisible by 2. If it is, it returns n. Otherwise, it returns n multiplied by 2.
In this case, 3 is not divisible by 2, so the method returns 3 multiplied by 2, which is 6.
The value returned by the method is then printed as output.
<<<Output>>>
6
