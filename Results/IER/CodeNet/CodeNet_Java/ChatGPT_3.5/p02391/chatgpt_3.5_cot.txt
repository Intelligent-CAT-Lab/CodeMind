<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes input from the user in the form of a string and splits it into two integers using the space as a delimiter. The first integer is assigned to variable x and the second integer is assigned to variable y. 
Then it checks the values of x and y using if statements. If x is equal to y, it prints "a == b". If x is less than y, it prints "a < b". If x is greater than y, it prints "a > b".
In this case, x=1 and y=2. Since x is less than y, the code will print "a < b".
<<<Output>>>
a < b
