<<<Analysis>>>
The variable CMD is initialized with the input "1 2". Then a BufferedReader object BR is created to read the input from the console. The input is read using the readLine() method and stored in the variable CMD. The variable CMD is then split into an array of strings using the split() method and stored in the variable str. The first element of the array is parsed into an integer and stored in the variable x, and the second element is parsed into an integer and stored in the variable y. 

Next, the code checks the values of x and y using if statements. Since x is not equal to y, the first if statement is skipped. Since x is less than y, the second if statement is executed and it prints "a < b". The third if statement is skipped.

Therefore, the output of the code execution would be "a < b".
<<<Output>>>
a < b
