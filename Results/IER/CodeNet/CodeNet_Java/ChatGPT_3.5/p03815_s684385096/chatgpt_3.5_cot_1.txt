<<<Analysis>>>
The variable numN is initialized with 7 according to the input. 
It calls the solveC() method.
Inside the solveC() method, it calculates the number of operations required to make the number numN divisible by 11.
It calculates the number of times numN can be divided by 11 and multiplies it by 2 to get the number of operations.
Then it checks if there is a remainder when numN is divided by 11. If there is a remainder, it checks if the remainder is greater than 6. If it is, it adds 2 to the number of operations. Otherwise, it adds 1 to the number of operations.
Finally, it prints the number of operations as output, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
