<<<Analysis>>>
The code uses a FastScanner class to read the input. It initializes an instance of FastScanner and reads an integer value x from the input.
Then it checks if x is greater than or equal to 30. If it is, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".
In this case, the value of x is 25, which is less than 30. So the output will be "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
