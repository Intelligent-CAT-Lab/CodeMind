<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input from the user. It then checks the characters of the string to determine the value of the variable res.
If the first three characters of the string are 'R', 'R', 'R', then res is set to 3.
If the first two characters of the string are 'R', 'R', then res is set to 2.
If the second and third characters of the string are 'R', 'R', then res is set to 2.
If the first three characters of the string are 'S', 'S', 'S', then res is set to 0.
Otherwise, res is set to 1.
Finally, the value of res is printed as the output.

In this case, the input string is "RRS". The first two characters are 'R', 'R', so res is set to 2.

<<<Output>>>
2
