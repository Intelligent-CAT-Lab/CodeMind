<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input from the user. It then checks the characters of the input string to determine the return value.

If the first three characters are 'R', 'R', 'R', the return value is 3.
If the first two characters are 'R', the return value is 2.
If the second and third characters are 'R', the return value is 2.
If the first three characters are 'S', 'S', 'S', the return value is 0.
Otherwise, the return value is 1.

In this case, the input string is "RRS". The first two characters are 'R', so the return value is 2.

<<<Output>>>
2
