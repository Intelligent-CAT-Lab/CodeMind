<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes input values for variables m, rd, rr, cd, and cr. It then calculates the value of d by dividing cd by rd and multiplying by 100. It increments the value of d until (d * rd) / 100 is equal to cd. Similarly, it calculates the value of r by dividing cr by rr and multiplying by 100. It increments the value of r until (r * rr) / 100 is equal to cr. Finally, it checks if (m - d - r) is less than 0. If it is, it prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the value of (m - d - r).
