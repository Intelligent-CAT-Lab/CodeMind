<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads input from the user using a Scanner object. It enters a while loop and continues to read input as long as there is more input available. Inside the loop, it reads a line of input and stores it in a String variable s. Then it converts the string to uppercase using the toUpperCase() method and prints it. This process repeats until there is no more input.
In this case, the input "this is a pen." is passed to the code. The code reads the input, converts it to uppercase, and prints "THIS IS A PEN." as the output.
<<<Output>>>
THIS IS A PEN.
