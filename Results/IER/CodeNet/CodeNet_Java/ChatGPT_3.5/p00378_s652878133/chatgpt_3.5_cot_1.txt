<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads three integers A, B, and X from the input. It then initializes an array dp of size X + 1000 + 1 with all elements set to INF (a large value). It also sets dp[0] to 0.

The code then enters a for loop that iterates from 0 to X. Inside the loop, it checks if dp[i + 1000] is greater than dp[i] + A. If it is, it updates dp[i + 1000] to dp[i] + A.

Next, the code enters another for loop that iterates from 0 to X + 500. Inside this loop, it checks if dp[i + 500] is greater than dp[i] + B. If it is, it updates dp[i + 500] to dp[i] + B.

After that, the code initializes a variable ans to INF. It then enters a for loop that iterates from X + 1000 to X. Inside this loop, it checks if dp[i] is less than ans. If it is, it updates ans to dp[i].

Finally, the code prints the value of ans as the output.

In summary, the code calculates the minimum cost to reach a target value X by adding either A or B to the current value at each step. The output will be the minimum cost to reach X.
