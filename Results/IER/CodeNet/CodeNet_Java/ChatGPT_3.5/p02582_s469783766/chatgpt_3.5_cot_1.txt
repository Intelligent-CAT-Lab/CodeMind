<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string as input and initializes a variable max with 0. It also initializes a variable left with 0.
Then it iterates through each character of the string. If the character is 'R', it calculates the length of the substring from left to the current index (i) and updates the value of max if it is greater than the current max. If the character is not 'R', it updates the value of left to the current index (i+1).
After the loop finishes, it returns the final value of max as the output.
In this case, the string is "RRS". The first character is 'R', so max is updated to 1. The second character is also 'R', so max is updated to 2. The third character is 'S', so left is updated to 3. Since there are no more characters, the loop finishes and the final value of max is 2.
