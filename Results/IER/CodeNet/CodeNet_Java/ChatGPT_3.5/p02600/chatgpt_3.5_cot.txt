<<<Analysis>>>
The variable x is initialized with 725 according to the input. And variable k is initialized with 0.
It checks the value of x against multiple conditions using if-else statements. If a condition is true, it assigns a specific value to variable k.
In this case, the condition 600 <= x && x < 800 is true, so it assigns the value 7 to variable k.
After the if-else statements, it prints the value of variable k as output, which is 7.
<<<Output>>>
7
