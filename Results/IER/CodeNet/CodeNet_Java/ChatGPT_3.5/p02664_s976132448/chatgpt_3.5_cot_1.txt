<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string from the user and stores it in the variable `s`. It then replaces all occurrences of the character "?" with the character "D" using the `replace` method. The resulting string is stored in the variable `result`. Finally, the code prints the value of `result` as the output.

In this case, the input string is "PD?D??P". The code will replace the first "?" with "D", resulting in the string "PDD??P". Then, it will replace the remaining two "?" with "D", resulting in the final string "PDDD?P".

<<<Output>>>
PDDD?P
