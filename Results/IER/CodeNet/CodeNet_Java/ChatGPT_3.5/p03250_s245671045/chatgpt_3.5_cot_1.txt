<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes an array `a` of size 3 to store the input values. Then it enters a for loop and iterates 3 times to read 3 integers from the input and store them in the array `a`. The input values are 1, 5, and 2. After reading the input, it sorts the array `a` in ascending order using the `Arrays.sort()` method. The sorted array `a` becomes [1, 2, 5]. Finally, it prints the sum of the largest element multiplied by 10, the second largest element, and the smallest element. The sum is calculated as (5 * 10) + 2 + 1, which is 57.
<<<Output>>>
57
