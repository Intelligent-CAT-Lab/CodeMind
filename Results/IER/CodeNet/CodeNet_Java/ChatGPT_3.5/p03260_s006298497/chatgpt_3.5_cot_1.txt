<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers A and B as input using the Scanner class.
Then it checks if both A and B are not equal to 2. If this condition is true, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
In this case, A is 3 and B is 1. Both A and B are not equal to 2, so the condition is true and it will print "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
