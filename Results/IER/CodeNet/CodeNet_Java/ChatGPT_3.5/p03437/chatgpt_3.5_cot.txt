<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two long integers as input, x and y. It checks if x is divisible by y by checking if the remainder of x divided by y is 0. If it is, it prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the value of x.
In this case, x = 8 and y = 6. Since 8 is not divisible by 6 (remainder is 2), the code will print the value of x, which is 8.
<<<Output>>>
8
