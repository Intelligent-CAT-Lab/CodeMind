<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers n and k as input. It initializes variables res, row, and w with 0, 1, and 0 respectively.
Then it enters a while loop which continues until n is greater than or equal to row.
Inside the loop, it checks if row multiplied by k is greater than or equal to w. If it is, it increments res by 1, adds row to w, and subtracts row from n.
If the condition is not met, it checks if n is greater than or equal to row+1. If it is, it increments row by 1.
If neither of the conditions is met, it breaks out of the loop.
Finally, it prints the value of res as the output.
In this case, the loop will run twice. In the first iteration, res will be incremented by 1, w will be updated to 1, and n will be updated to 3. In the second iteration, res will be incremented by 1 again, w will be updated to 3, and n will be updated to 1.
So the output will be 2.
