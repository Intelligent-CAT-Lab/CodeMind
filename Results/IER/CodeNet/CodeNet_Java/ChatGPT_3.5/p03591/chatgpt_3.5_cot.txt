<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input from the user and stores it in the variable `s`. 
It then checks if the length of the string is less than 4. If it is, it prints "No" and returns.
If the length of the string is 4 or greater, it extracts the first 4 characters of the string using the `substring` method and stores it in the variable `s2`.
It then checks if `s2` is equal to the string "YAKI". If it is, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
In this case, the input string is "YAKINIKU", which has a length of 9. So, the condition `s.length() < 4` is false.
The first 4 characters of the string are "YAKI", which is equal to the string "YAKI". So, the output will be "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
