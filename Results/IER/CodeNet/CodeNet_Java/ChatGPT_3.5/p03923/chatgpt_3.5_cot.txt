<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and variable a are initialized with 8 and 1 respectively according to the input. And variable ans is initialized with n.
It checks if n is equal to 1. If it is, it returns 1.
Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 40. Inside the loop, it calculates the value of variable t as a multiplied by (i-1).
Then it calculates the maximum value of variable maxK by calling the function f(i, n).
Then it initializes the variable curK with 1.
Inside the nested for loop, it checks if the condition curK * pow(maxK - 1, i - j) / pow(maxK - 1, i - j) == curK is true and curK * pow(maxK - 1, i - j) < n is also true. If both conditions are true, it adds the value of maxK to variable t and updates the value of curK accordingly.
If the conditions are not true, it adds the value of maxK - 1 to variable t and updates the value of curK accordingly.
After the nested loop finishes, it compares the value of variable t with the current value of variable ans and updates the value of ans if t is smaller.
After the loop finishes, it returns the final value of variable ans as output.
