<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and variable a are initialized with 8 and 1 respectively according to the input. 
The code then calls the solver method passing n and a as arguments.
Inside the solver method, the variable ans is initialized with the value of n.
If n is equal to 1, the method returns 1.
Otherwise, it enters a for loop that iterates from 1 to 40.
Inside the loop, it calculates the value of t as a*(i-1).
Then it calls the f method passing i and n as arguments to calculate the maximum value of k.
It also initializes the variable curK with 1.
Then it enters another for loop that iterates i times.
Inside this loop, it checks if the condition curK * pow(maxK - 1, i - j) / pow(maxK - 1, i - j) == curK is true and curK * pow(maxK - 1, i - j) < n.
If the condition is true, it adds maxK to t and updates the value of curK.
Otherwise, it adds maxK - 1 to t and updates the value of curK.
After the inner loop finishes, it updates the value of ans with the minimum value between ans and t.
Finally, it returns the value of ans as the output.
