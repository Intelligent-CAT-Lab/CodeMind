<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input from the user and initializes a variable price with 700. Then it iterates through each character in the string and checks if the character is 'o'. If it is, it adds 100 to the price variable. In this case, the string is "oxo" and there are two 'o' characters, so the price variable will be incremented by 200. Finally, it prints the value of the price variable as the output, which is 900.
<<<Output>>>
900
