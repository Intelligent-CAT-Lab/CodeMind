<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input: L, R, and d. It initializes a variable Ans with 0. Then it enters a for loop that iterates from L to R. For each iteration, it checks if the current number i is divisible by d (i % d == 0). If it is, it increments the Ans variable by 1. After the loop finishes, it prints the value of Ans as the output.

In this case, the input values are L=5, R=10, and d=2. The for loop will iterate from 5 to 10. The numbers in this range that are divisible by 2 are 6, 8, and 10. So the Ans variable will be incremented by 3. Therefore, the output will be 3.
