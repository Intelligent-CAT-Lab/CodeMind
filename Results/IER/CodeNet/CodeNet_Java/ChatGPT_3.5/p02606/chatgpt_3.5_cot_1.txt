<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes variables L, R, and d with the values 5, 10, and 2 respectively according to the input.
It initializes variable Ans with 0.
Then it enters a for loop that iterates from L to R (inclusive) and checks each integer i in this range.
Inside the loop, it checks if i is divisible by d (i % d == 0). If it is, it increments the value of Ans by 1.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of Ans as the output.
In this case, the loop will iterate for the values 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. Among these, only 6, 8, and 10 are divisible by 2. So the final value of Ans will be 3.
