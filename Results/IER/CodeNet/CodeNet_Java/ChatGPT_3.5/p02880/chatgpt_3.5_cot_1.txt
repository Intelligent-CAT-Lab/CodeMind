The variable N is initialized with 10 according to the input. And variable f is initialized with false.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 9 to check each integer A in this range. 
Inside the for loop, it checks if N is divisible by A and the result of N divided by A is less than 10. If both conditions are true, it sets variable f to true.
After the loop finishes, it checks the value of variable f. If it is true, it assigns the string "Yes" to variable ret. Otherwise, it assigns the string "No" to variable ret.
Finally, it prints the value of variable ret as output, which is "Yes" because 10 is divisible by 1 and 10 divided by 1 is less than 10.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
