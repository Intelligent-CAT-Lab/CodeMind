<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 10 according to the input. And variable f is initialized with false.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 9 to check each integer A in this range. 
Inside the for loop, it checks if the remainder of N divided by A is 0 and the result of N divided by A is less than 10. If both conditions are met, it sets variable f to true.
Since 10 divided by 1 is 10 and 10 divided by 2 is 5, the condition is met when A is 1 and 2.
After the loop finishes, it assigns the value "Yes" to variable ret if f is true, otherwise it assigns the value "No".
Finally, it prints the value of variable ret as output, which is "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
