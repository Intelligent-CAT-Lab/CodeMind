<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four integers as input: a, b, c, and d. It then checks if any two pairs of these integers are equal. If any two pairs are equal, it prints "yes", otherwise it prints "no".

In this case, the input is 1 1 3 4. The code checks if a is equal to b and c is equal to d, which is true. Therefore, it will print "yes" as the output.

<<<Output>>>
yes
