<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string input "BBBWW" and initializes a character array c with the same length as the input string. It then iterates over each character in the input string and assigns it to the corresponding index in the character array.

Next, it initializes a variable count with 0. It then iterates over the character array starting from index 1. For each character, it checks if it is different from the previous character (at index i-1). If it is different, it increments the count variable.

After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of the count variable, which represents the number of times the characters change in the input string. In this case, the characters change from 'B' to 'W' once, so the output would be 1.
