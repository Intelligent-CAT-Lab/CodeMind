<<<Analysis>>>
The code first declares three integer variables a, b, and c. Then it creates a Scanner object to read input from the user.
Next, it reads three integers from the user using the nextInt() method of the Scanner object and assigns them to variables a, b, and c.
Finally, it calculates the area of the right-angled triangle using the formula a*b/2 and prints the result.

In this case, the input is "3 4 5", so the values of a, b, and c will be 3, 4, and 5 respectively.
The area of the right-angled triangle is calculated as 3*4/2 = 6.

<<<Output>>>
6
