<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input and assigns them to variables a and b respectively.
Then it checks if the sum of a and b is equal to 15. If it is, it prints "+". 
If the sum is not equal to 15, it checks if the product of a and b is equal to 15. If it is, it prints "*".
If neither the sum nor the product is equal to 15, it prints "x".
In this case, the sum of 4 and 11 is 15, so the code will print "+".
