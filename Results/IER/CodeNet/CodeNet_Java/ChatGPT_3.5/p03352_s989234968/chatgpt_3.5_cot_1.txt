<<<Analysis>>>
The variable x is initialized with 10 according to the input. And variable mx is initialized with 0.
It checks if x is less than 4. Since 10 is not less than 4, it goes to the else block.
Inside the else block, it calculates the square root of x and assigns it to variable sq.
Then it initializes variable jo with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to sq to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of jo by raising i to the power of floor(log10(x)/log10(i)).
Then it checks if jo is greater than mx. If it is, it assigns jo to mx.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable mx as output, which is 4.
<<<Output>>>
4
