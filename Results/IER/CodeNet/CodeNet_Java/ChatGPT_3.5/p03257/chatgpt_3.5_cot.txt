<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input `n` and checks if it is equal to 2. If it is, it prints "4 7" and "23 10" and returns from the main method.
If `n` is not equal to 2, it proceeds with the rest of the code.
It initializes an array `snt` of size `n * 2` to store prime numbers.
It then initializes a variable `cn` to 0 and a variable `x` to 2.
It enters a while loop that continues until `cn` is less than `n * 2`.
Inside the while loop, it checks if `x` is a prime number using the `isSNT` method.
If `x` is a prime number, it stores it in the `snt` array at index `cn` and increments `cn` by 1.
After the while loop finishes, it initializes a 2D array `a` of size `n` by `n`.
It then enters nested for loops to fill the `a` array with values.
The outer loop iterates from 0 to `n-1` and the inner loop iterates from `i % 2` to `n-1` with a step size of 2.
Inside the nested loops, it calculates the indices `a1` and `a2` based on the current values of `i` and `j`.
It then assigns the product of `snt[a1]` and `snt[a2]` to `a[i][j]`.
After filling the `a` array, it enters another set of nested for loops to calculate the values of `a[i][j]` for certain indices.
The outer loop iterates from 0 to `n-1` and the inner loop iterates from `(i + 1) % 2` to `n-1` with a step size of 2.
Inside the nested loops, it initializes variables `gcd` and `tich` to 0 and 1 respectively.
It then enters another set of nested for loops to calculate the greatest common divisor (`gcd`) and product (`tich`) of the neighboring elements of `a[i][j]`.
It checks if the neighboring indices are within the bounds of the `a` array and if `gcd` is 0.
If the conditions are met, it assigns the value of `a[i + dx[k]][j + dy[k]]` to `gcd` and `tich`.
If the conditions are not met, it calculates the `gcd` and `tich` using the `gcd` method.
After calculating the `gcd` and `tich`, it assigns the value of `tich + 1` to `a[i][j]`.
Finally, it enters another set of nested for loops to print the values of the `a` array.
It prints each element of the `a` array followed by a space, and then prints a new line after each row.
