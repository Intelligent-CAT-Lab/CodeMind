The variable n is initialized with 2 according to the input. It then checks if n is equal to 2. If it is, it prints "4 7" and "23 10" and returns, which means the code execution ends here.
If n is not equal to 2, it continues to execute the rest of the code.
It initializes an array snt with size n*2 and a variable cn with 0. It also initializes a variable x with 2.
It enters a while loop and it keeps incrementing x by 1 until cn is equal to n*2. Inside the while loop, it checks if x is a prime number using the isSNT() method. If x is a prime number, it adds x to the snt array at index cn and increments cn by 1.
After the while loop finishes, it initializes a 2D array a with size n*n.
It enters a nested for loop to fill in the values of array a. It iterates through each element of array a and calculates its value based on the indices i and j. It uses the snt array to calculate the value of each element.
Then it enters another nested for loop to calculate the values of some elements of array a based on their neighbors. It uses the gcd() method to calculate the greatest common divisor of the neighbors and then calculates the product of the neighbors. It adds 1 to the product and assigns it to the current element of array a.
Finally, it enters another nested for loop to print the values of array a.
