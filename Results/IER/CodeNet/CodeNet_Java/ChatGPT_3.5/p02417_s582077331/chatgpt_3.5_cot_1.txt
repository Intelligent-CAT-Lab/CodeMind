<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes three strings: low_az, up_az, and str. It also initializes an integer array cnt with the length of low_az. All elements of cnt are set to 0.

Then, it creates a Scanner object to read input from the user.

The code enters a while loop that continues as long as there is more input. Inside the loop, it reads a line of input and assigns it to the variable str.

Next, it iterates over each character in the string str. For each character, it checks if it matches any character in the strings low_az or up_az. If there is a match, it increments the corresponding element in the cnt array.

After processing all the characters in the input, the code enters a for loop that iterates over each element in the cnt array. It prints the character from low_az at the current index, followed by a colon and the value of the corresponding element in cnt.

Finally, the Scanner object is closed.
