<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input: L, R, and d. It initializes a variable cnt with 0.
Then it enters a for loop that iterates from L to R (inclusive). For each iteration, it checks if the current number i is divisible by d (i % d == 0). If it is, it increments the cnt variable by 1.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of cnt as the output.
In this case, the code will iterate from 5 to 10 and check if each number is divisible by 2. The numbers that satisfy this condition are 6, 8, and 10. Therefore, the output will be 3.
