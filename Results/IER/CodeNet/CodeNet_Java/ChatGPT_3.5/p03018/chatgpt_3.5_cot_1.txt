<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input "ABCABC" using the FastScanner class. It then replaces all occurrences of "BC" with "X" in the string. 
It initializes two variables, 'a' and 'ans', with 0. 
Then, it iterates through the characters of the string in reverse order. 
If the current character is 'X', it increments the value of 'a'. 
If the current character is 'A', it adds the value of 'a' to 'ans'. 
If the current character is neither 'X' nor 'A', it sets the value of 'a' to 0. 
Finally, it prints the value of 'ans' as the output.
