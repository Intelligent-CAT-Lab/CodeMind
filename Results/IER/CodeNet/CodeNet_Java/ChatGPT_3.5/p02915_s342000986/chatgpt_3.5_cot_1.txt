<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads an integer input from the user using the Scanner class and stores it in the variable n. Then it closes the Scanner object.
Next, it calculates the cube of the variable n using the Math.pow() method and stores it in the variable a. Since the Math.pow() method returns a double value, the result is cast to an integer using (int) before printing it.
Finally, it prints the value of variable a as the output.
