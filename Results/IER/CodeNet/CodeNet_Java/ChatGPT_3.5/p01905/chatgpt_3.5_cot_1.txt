<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N and variable M are initialized with 2 and 0 respectively according to the input. And the array a is initialized with size N.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to M-1 to read M integers from the input and store them in the array a.
Then it initializes an array b of size N*2-1 with all elements set to true.
It enters another for loop and it iterates from M*2-2 to 0 with a step of -2. Inside the loop, it checks the values of b[i] and b[i-1] and updates the value of b[(i-2)/2] accordingly.
After the loop finishes, it initializes a variable ans to 0.
It enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to N-2. Inside the loop, it checks the values of b[i*2+1] and b[i*2+2]. If both are true, it increments the value of ans by 1.
Finally, it prints the value of ans as output.
