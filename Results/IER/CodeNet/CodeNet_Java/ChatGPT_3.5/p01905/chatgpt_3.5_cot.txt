<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 2 and variable M is initialized with 0 according to the input. And variable a is initialized as an array of size N.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 0 to check each integer i in this range. Since the loop doesn't execute, the array a remains empty.
Then it initializes an array b of size N*2-1 with all elements set to true.
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from N*2-2 to 0 with a decrement of 2. Inside the loop, it checks the values of b[i] and b[i-1] and based on their values, it sets the value of b[(i-2)/2].
After the loop finishes, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to N-2. Inside the loop, it checks the values of b[i*2+1] and b[i*2+2] and if both are true, it increments the value of ans.
Finally, it prints the value of ans as output, which is 0.
