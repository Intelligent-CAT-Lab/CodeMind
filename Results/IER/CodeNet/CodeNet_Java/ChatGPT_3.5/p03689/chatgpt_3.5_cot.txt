<<<Analysis>>>
The variables r, c, h, and w are initialized with 3, 3, 2, and 2 respectively according to the input.
It checks if r % h == 0 and c % w == 0. If both conditions are true, it prints "No" and returns.
Since r % h == 0 and c % w == 0 are not true, it continues to execute the code.
It calculates the value of mcnt as (r / h) * (c / w) which is 1.
It calculates the value of space as r * c - ((r / h) * h) * ((c / w) * w) which is 1.
It calculates the value of plusNumber as ((mcnt + space) / space) + 1 which is 3.
It calculates the value of minusNumber as -(plusNumber * (h * w - 1) + 1) which is -7.
It prints "Yes" and then enters a nested for loop to print the values of num.
For each value of i and j, it calculates the value of num as ((i+1) % h == 0 && (j+1) % w == 0) ? minusNumber : plusNumber.
It prints the value of num and a space character for each j.
After each row, it prints a new line character.
Finally, it flushes the output.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
3 3 3
3 3 3
3 3 3
