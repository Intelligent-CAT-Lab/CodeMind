<<<Analysis>>>
The variables r, c, h, and w are initialized with the values 3, 3, 2, and 2 respectively according to the input.
It checks if r is divisible by h and c is divisible by w. If both conditions are true, it prints "No" and returns.
Otherwise, it calculates the number of mcnt by dividing r by h and c by w.
It calculates the number of empty spaces by subtracting the product of (r/h) and h from r and the product of (c/w) and w from c.
It calculates the plusNumber by dividing the sum of mcnt and space by space and adding 1 to it.
It calculates the minusNumber by multiplying the plusNumber with (h*w - 1) and subtracting 1 from it.
Then it prints "Yes".
It iterates through each row and column and checks if the current row number + 1 is divisible by h and the current column number + 1 is divisible by w.
If both conditions are true, it prints minusNumber, otherwise it prints plusNumber.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
1 1 1
1 1 1
