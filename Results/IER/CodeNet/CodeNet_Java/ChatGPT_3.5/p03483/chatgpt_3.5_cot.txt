The code defines a method `solve()` which is called from the `main()` method. 
Inside the `solve()` method, it reads a string `s` from the input and initializes an array `idx` of size 26 to store the count of each character in the string.
Then, it iterates over the string `s` and increments the count of each character in the `idx` array.
Next, it initializes a 2D array `a` of size 26 to store the indices of each character in the string.
Then, it initializes an array `map` of size `n` (length of the string) and fills it with -1.
It also initializes an array `ptr` of size 26 to keep track of the current index in the `a` array for each character.
It initializes a variable `now` to 0 to keep track of the current index in the `map` array.
It initializes a variable `oddUsed` to -1 to keep track of the character that has an odd count.
Then, it iterates over the string `s` again and performs the following operations:
- It checks if the count of the current character is odd and if `oddUsed` is not -1 and not equal to the current character. If this condition is true, it prints -1 and returns.
- It checks the current index `p` in the `a` array for the current character. If `p` is less than half of the count of the character, it assigns the current index `now` to the `map` array and increments `now`.
- If the count of the current character is odd and `p` is equal to half of the count, it assigns the middle index `n/2` to the `map` array and assigns the current character to `oddUsed`.
- If none of the above conditions are true, it calculates the inverse index `inv` for the current character and assigns the corresponding index from the `a` array to the `map` array.
- It updates the `a` array with the current index `p` for the current character.
- It increments the `ptr` array for the current character.
After the loop, it initializes an array `array` of size `n` and assigns the indices from the `map` array to the `array` array.
Finally, it calls the `bubbleCount()` method with the `array` array, 0 as the starting index, and `n` as the ending index. It assigns the return value of `bubbleCount()` to the variable `x` and prints `x` as the output.
The `bubbleCount()` method is a recursive method that counts the number of inversions in an array using the merge sort algorithm.

The return value of `eel` would be the value of `x` printed as the output.
