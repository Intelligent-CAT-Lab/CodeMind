<<<Analysis>>>
The variable k is initialized with 4 according to the input. The variable N is calculated using the formula (Math.sqrt(8*k + 1) - 1) / 2. The variable missing is initialized with 0.
It checks if N*(N + 1)/2 is less than k. If it is, it calculates the value of missing using the formula (N + 1) * (N + 2) / 2 - k and increments the value of N by 1.
Then it enters a for loop and iterates from 1 to N. Inside the loop, it checks if the current value of j is equal to missing. If it is not, it prints the value of j.
Since N is 2, the loop will iterate twice. The value of missing is 0, so both values of j (1 and 2) will be printed.
