<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input using the Scanner class. It compares the values of the two integers using if-else statements. If the value of 'a' is less than 'b', it prints "a < b". If the value of 'a' is greater than 'b', it prints "a > b". If the values of 'a' and 'b' are equal, it prints "a == b". In this case, the value of 'a' is 1 and the value of 'b' is 2. Since 1 is less than 2, the output will be "a < b".
<<<Output>>>
a < b
