<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers from the input using the Scanner class. It assigns the first integer to variable a and the second integer to variable b. Then it checks if both a and b are less than 9. If they are, it prints "Yay!", otherwise it prints ":(".
In this case, the input is "5 4". So, both a and b are less than 9. Therefore, the code will print "Yay!" as the output.
<<<Output>>>
Yay!
