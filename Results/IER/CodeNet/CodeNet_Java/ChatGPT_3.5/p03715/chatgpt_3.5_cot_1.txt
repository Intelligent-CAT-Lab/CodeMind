The variable h and variable w are initialized with 3 and 5 respectively according to the input.
Then it calls the dfs method passing the parameters 3, Long.MAX_VALUE, Long.MIN_VALUE, 5 and 3.
Inside the dfs method, it checks if w or h is less than or equal to 0. If it is, it returns Long.MAX_VALUE.
If d is equal to 1, it calculates the maximum and minimum values of S2 and S1 respectively and returns the difference between them.
Otherwise, it initializes ans with Long.MAX_VALUE and enters a for loop that iterates from -1 to 1.
Inside the loop, it calculates dw and dh by dividing w and h by d and adding i to them.
If dw is greater than 0, it recursively calls the dfs method with d-1, the minimum value of S1 and dw * h, the maximum value of S2 and dw * h, w-dw and h as parameters and assigns the minimum value to ans.
If dh is greater than 0, it recursively calls the dfs method with d-1, the minimum value of S1 and w * dh, the maximum value of S2 and w * dh, w and h-dh as parameters and assigns the minimum value to ans.
After the loop finishes, it returns the value of ans.
Finally, it prints the value returned by the dfs method as output.
