<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers T and X from the input. It then calculates the division of T by X and assigns the result to the variable ans. Finally, it prints the value of ans with 10 decimal places.

In this case, T is 8 and X is 3. The division of 8 by 3 is 2.6666666667.

<<<Output>>>
2.6666666667
