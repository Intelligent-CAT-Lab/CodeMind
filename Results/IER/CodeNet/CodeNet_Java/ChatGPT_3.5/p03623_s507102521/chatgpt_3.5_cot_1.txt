<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads three integers from the input: x, a, and b. It then calculates the absolute difference between x and a and the absolute difference between x and b. It compares these two differences and prints 'B' if the difference between x and b is greater, and 'A' otherwise.
In this case, x = 5, a = 2, and b = 7. The absolute difference between x and a is 3, and the absolute difference between x and b is 2. Since the difference between x and b is greater, the code will print 'B'.
<<<Output>>>
B
