<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 5 and variable K is initialized with 3 according to the input.
It checks if the condition (N-2)*(N-1)/2<K is true or not. In this case, it is true because (5-2)*(5-1)/2=3.
So it enters the else block.
It calculates the value of variable g as N-1+(N-1)*(N-2)/2-K, which is 5-1+(5-1)*(5-2)/2-3=5.
Then it prints the value of variable g, which is 5.
Then it calculates the value of variable yokei as (N-1)*(N-2)/2-K, which is (5-1)*(5-2)/2-3=2.
Then it enters a nested for loop. The outer loop iterates from 1 to N-1, which is 1 to 4.
The inner loop iterates from 1 to i-1 for each value of i in the outer loop.
Inside the inner loop, it checks if the value of variable yokei is greater than 0. If it is, it decrements the value of yokei by 1 and prints the values of i and j.
The inner loop continues until the value of yokei becomes 0.
After the nested for loop finishes, it prints the output.
The output will be:
5
1 5
2 5
2 1
3 5
3 1
3 2
4 5
4 1
4 2
4 3
