<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 4 according to the input. The variable factorial is calculated as 2^n, which is 16. The variable cha is initialized as a character array of size n.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 15 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is converted to binary string and stored in variable str.
Inside the for loop, it copies each character of the binary string str to the character array cha.
Then it prints the value of i followed by a colon. It then iterates through the character array cha and if the current character is '1', it prints the index of that character.
After printing the index, it moves to the next character and repeats the process until all characters in the array have been checked.
After the inner loop finishes, it prints a new line.
This process is repeated for all values of i from 0 to 15.
