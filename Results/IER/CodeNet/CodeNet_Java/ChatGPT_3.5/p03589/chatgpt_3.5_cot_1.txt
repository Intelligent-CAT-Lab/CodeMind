<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 2 according to the input.
It enters two nested for loops, where the outer loop iterates from 1 to 3500 and the inner loop also iterates from 1 to 3500.
Inside the nested loops, it checks if the expression (4*h*n-N*n-N*h) is not equal to 0 and if the expression (N*h*n)/(4*h*n-N*n-N*h) is greater than 0 and if the expression (N*h*n)%(4*h*n-N*n-N*h) is equal to 0.
If all these conditions are met, it prints the values of h, n, and (N*h*n)/(4*h*n-N*n-N*h) as output and then returns from the method.
The loops continue until it finds the first set of values that satisfy the conditions.
If no such values are found, it does not print anything.
