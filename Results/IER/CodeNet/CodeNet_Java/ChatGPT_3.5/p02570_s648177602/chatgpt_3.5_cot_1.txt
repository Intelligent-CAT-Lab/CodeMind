<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads three double values from the input: d, t, and s. It then calculates the time it takes to travel the distance d at speed s, and stores it in the variable kakaruhun. If kakaruhun is less than or equal to t, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".
In this case, the values of d, t, and s are 1000, 15, and 80 respectively. The code calculates kakaruhun as Math.ceil(1000/80) = 13.0. Since 13.0 is less than or equal to 15, the output will be "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
