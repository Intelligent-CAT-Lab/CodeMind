<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 4 according to the input.
The code initializes an array spf and a boolean array composite, both of size n+1.
Then it calls the sieve function passing n as argument.
Inside the sieve function, it iterates from 2 to sqrt(n) and checks if the current number is composite or not. If it is not composite, it sets the smallest prime factor of that number in the spf array and marks all its multiples as composite in the composite array.
After that, it iterates from sqrt(n)+1 to n and sets the smallest prime factor of each number in the spf array if it is not composite.
Then it initializes a variable ans with 0.
It enters a for loop from 1 to n and calculates the number of divisors of each number i using the numDivisors function.
Inside the numDivisors function, it initializes a variable res with 1 and iterates until i becomes 1. In each iteration, it finds the smallest prime factor of i and calculates the power of that prime factor in i. It multiplies res with (pow+1) in each iteration.
Finally, it adds ((long) i) * numDivisors(i) to ans in each iteration of the for loop.
After the for loop finishes, it prints the value of ans as output.
