<<<Analysis>>>
The variable x is initialized with 2 according to the input. And variable next is initialized with 2.
It enters a for loop and it iterates 2 times. In each iteration, it updates the value of variable next by adding 1 to it and then multiplying it by 2.
In the first iteration, next = (2 + 1) * 2 = 6.
In the second iteration, next = (6 + 1) * 2 = 14.
After the loop finishes, it print the final value of variable next as output, which is 14.
<<<Output>>>
