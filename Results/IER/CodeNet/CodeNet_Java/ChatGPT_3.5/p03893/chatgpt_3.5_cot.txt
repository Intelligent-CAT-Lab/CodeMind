<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input from the user and stores it in the variable x. It then initializes the variable next with the value 2.
It enters a for loop that iterates x times. In each iteration, it updates the value of next by adding 1 to it and then multiplying it by 2.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of next as the output.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of `2` would be 10.
