<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers from the input, height and width, and initializes an array ph with length width+1 and an array pw with length height+1.
Then it calculates the values of ph and pw using a for loop.
After that, it initializes a variable res with 0.
Then it enters a for loop that iterates from 0 to the minimum of height and width.
Inside the loop, it calculates the number of ways to choose common elements from height and width using the factorial values stored in the arrays facts and invfacts, and the values stored in the arrays ph and pw.
If the number of common elements is even, it adds the calculated value to res. Otherwise, it subtracts the calculated value from res.
After the loop finishes, it takes the modulo of res with MODULO and assigns the result back to res.
If res is negative, it adds MODULO to res.
Finally, it prints the value of res.
