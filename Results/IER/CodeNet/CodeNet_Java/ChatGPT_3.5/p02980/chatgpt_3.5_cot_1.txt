<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers, height and width, from the input. It then initializes two arrays, ph and pw, with size equal to width+1 and height+1 respectively. The arrays are filled with values based on the formulas ph[i] = ph[i-1] * (height+1) % MODULO and pw[i] = pw[i-1] * (width+1) % MODULO. 

The code then calculates the value of res by iterating over the variable common from 0 to the minimum of height and width. For each value of common, it calculates the number of ways to choose common elements from height and width, and multiplies it with the corresponding values from the arrays ph and pw. If common is even, it adds the calculated value to res, otherwise it subtracts it.

Finally, it takes the modulo of res with MODULO and prints the result.

In this case, height=1 and width=2. The arrays ph and pw are filled as follows:
ph = [1, 2]
pw = [1, 2, 4]

The loop iterates only once, with common=0. The number of ways to choose 0 elements from height and width is 1. The value of res is updated to 1.

After taking the modulo with MODULO, the final value of res is 1.
