<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and variable k are initialized with 5 and 3 respectively according to the input.
A list of Pair objects is created and initialized with pairs (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5) using a for loop.
The variable now is calculated as (n-1)*(n-2)/2, which is 6.
If now is less than k, which is not the case here, it prints -1 and returns.
The variables from and to are initialized with 2 and 3 respectively.
A while loop is executed as long as now is greater than k.
Inside the loop, a new Pair object is added to the list with values from and to.
The variable now is decremented by 1.
If to is equal to n, from is incremented by 1 and to is set to from + 1.
Otherwise, to is incremented by 1.
After the loop finishes, it prints the size of the list as output, which is 8.
Then it prints each pair in the list as output.
