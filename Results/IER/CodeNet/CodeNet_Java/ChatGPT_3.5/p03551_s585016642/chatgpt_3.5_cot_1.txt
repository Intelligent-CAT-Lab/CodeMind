<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 1 and variable m is initialized with 1 according to the input.
Then it calculates the value of ((1L << m) * (1900 * m + 100 * (n - m))).
First, it calculates the value of (1L << m), which is equivalent to 2^m.
Then it calculates the value of (1900 * m + 100 * (n - m)), which is equivalent to (1900 * 1 + 100 * (1 - 1)) = 1900.
Finally, it multiplies the two calculated values together.
The final result is 2^1 * 1900 = 2 * 1900 = 3800.
<<<Output>>>
3800
