<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 5 and variable K is initialized with 2 according to the input. And variable ans is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from K+1 (3) to N (5) to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of ans by adding (i-K)*(N/i) to it. 
Then it checks if N is not divisible by i and the remainder is greater than or equal to K. If it does, it adds N%i-K+1 to ans.
After the loop finishes, it print the final value of variable ans as output.
<<<Output>>>
5
