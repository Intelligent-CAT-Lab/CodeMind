<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input `n` using the Scanner class. It then checks if `n` is equal to 0. If it is, it prints 0 and returns from the main method.
If `n` is not equal to 0, it enters a while loop. Inside the loop, it checks if `n` modulo -2 is equal to 0. If it is, it appends "0" to the StringBuilder `sb` and divides `n` by -2.
If `n` modulo -2 is not equal to 0, it appends "1" to `sb`. If `n` is less than 0, it divides `n` by -2 and adds 1 to it. Otherwise, it simply divides `n` by -2.
The loop continues until `n` becomes 0. After the loop finishes, it reverses the StringBuilder `sb` and converts it to a String `xx`. Finally, it prints `xx` as the output.
