The variable yoko is initialized with 12 and variable a is initialized with 4 according to the input. And variable sum is initialized with 0.
It checks if the value of yoko minus 2 times the value of a is greater than 0. If it is, it assigns the result to variable sum. In this case, 12 - 2*4 = 4, so the value of sum becomes 4.
Finally, it prints the value of sum as output, which is 4.
<<<Output>>>
