<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers A, B, and X as input. It checks if X is less than A or greater than the sum of A and B. If either condition is true, it prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES".
In this case, A=3, B=5, and X=4. X is not less than A and not greater than the sum of A and B. Therefore, it will print "YES".
<<<Output>>>
YES
