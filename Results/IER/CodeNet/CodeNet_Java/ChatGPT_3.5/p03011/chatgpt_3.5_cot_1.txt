<<<Analysis>>>
The variables P, Q, and R are initialized with the values 1, 3, and 4 respectively according to the input.
The variable max is initialized with 0.
The code then checks the values of P, Q, and R to determine the maximum value.
In this case, P (1) is not greater than Q (3), so it moves to the next condition.
Q (3) is greater than R (4), so it moves to the next condition.
R (4) is greater than P (1), so it sets max to the sum of P and Q (1 + 3 = 4).
Finally, it prints the value of max, which is 4.
<<<Output>>>
4
