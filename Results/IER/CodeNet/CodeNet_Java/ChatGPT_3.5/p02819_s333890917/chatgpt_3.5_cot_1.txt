<<<Analysis>>>
The variable X is initialized with 20 according to the input. A new ArrayList called dp is created to store prime numbers. The number 2 is added to dp. The variable i is initialized with 2.
Then it enters a do-while loop. Inside the loop, it checks if the current number i is divisible by any number in dp. If it is, the boolean variable f is set to false and the loop breaks. If it is not divisible by any number in dp, it adds i to dp. Then i is incremented by 1.
The loop continues until i is less than X.
After the do-while loop, the variable ans is initialized with 0.
Then it enters a for loop which iterates from X to 2*X. Inside the loop, it checks if the current number i is divisible by any number in dp. If it is, the boolean variable f is set to false and the loop breaks. If it is not divisible by any number in dp, it sets ans to i and breaks the loop.
Finally, it prints the value of X if X is equal to 2, otherwise it prints the value of ans.
