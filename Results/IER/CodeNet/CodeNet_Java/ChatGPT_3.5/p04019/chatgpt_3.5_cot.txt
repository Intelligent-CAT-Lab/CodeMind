<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string `s` and initializes four boolean variables `checkS`, `checkN`, `checkW`, and `checkE` to false.
Then it iterates through each character of the input string `s` and checks if it is equal to 'S', 'N', 'W', or 'E'. If it is, it sets the corresponding boolean variable to true.
After the loop finishes, it checks if `checkS` is equal to `checkN` and `checkW` is equal to `checkE`. If both conditions are true, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
In the case of input "SENW", all four boolean variables will be set to true, so the condition `checkS == checkN && checkW == checkE` will be true and the output will be "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
