<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string input from the user and initializes four boolean variables: checkS, checkN, checkW, and checkE, all set to false.
Then it iterates through each character of the input string and checks if it is equal to 'S', 'N', 'W', or 'E'. If it is, it sets the corresponding boolean variable to true.
After the loop finishes, it checks if checkS is equal to checkN and checkW is equal to checkE. If both conditions are true, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
In this case, the input string is "SENW". The loop will set checkS, checkN, checkW, and checkE to true because all four characters are present in the string.
Since checkS is equal to checkN and checkW is equal to checkE, the output will be "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
