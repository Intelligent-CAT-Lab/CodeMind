<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads three strings A, B, and C from the input. It then checks if the last character of string A is equal to the first character of string B, and if the last character of string B is equal to the first character of string C. If both conditions are true, it prints "YES", otherwise it prints "NO".

In this case, the input is "rng gorilla apple". So, A = "rng", B = "gorilla", and C = "apple". The last character of A is 'g', the first character of B is 'g', and the last character of B is 'a'. Therefore, the condition is true and the output will be "YES".
<<<Output>>>
YES
