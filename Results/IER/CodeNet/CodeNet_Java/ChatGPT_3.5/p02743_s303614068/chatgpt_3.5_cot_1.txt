<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by creating a Scanner object to read input from the user. Then it reads three integers from the input and assigns them to variables a, b, and c respectively. These variables are then passed to the sqrt() method, which calculates the square root of each number with a precision of 50 decimal places.

After calculating the square roots, the code compares the sum of a and b with c. If the sum is less than c, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".

In this case, the square root of 2 is approximately 1.41421356237309504880168872420969807856967187537694, the square root of 3 is approximately 1.73205080756887729352744634150587236694280525381038, and the square root of 9 is exactly 3. 

The sum of the first two square roots is approximately 3.14626436994197234232913506571557044551247712918732, which is less than the square root of 9. Therefore, the code will print "Yes".

<<<Output>>>
Yes
