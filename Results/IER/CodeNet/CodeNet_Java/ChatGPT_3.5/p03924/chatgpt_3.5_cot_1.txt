The variable N and variable M are initialized with 3 according to the input. And variable MOD is initialized with 1000000007.
A 3D array dp is created with dimensions (M+1) x (N+1) x (N+1). The initial value of dp[0][1][1] is set to 1.
Then, a nested for loop is used to iterate through the elements of dp. The loop iterates from 0 to M-1 for variable i, from 0 to N for variable j, and from 0 to N for variable k.
Inside the loop, there are three cases to consider:
1. If j is not equal to N, a town is added and not used in the loop. In this case, the value of dp[i+1][j+1][k] is updated by multiplying the value of dp[i][j][k] with (N-j) and taking the modulo MOD.
2. If j is equal to N, a town is added and used but not in the loop. In this case, the value of dp[i+1][j][k] is updated by multiplying the value of dp[i][j][k] with (j-k) and taking the modulo MOD.
3. If j is equal to k, a town is added and used in the loop. In this case, the value of dp[i+1][j][j] is updated by multiplying the value of dp[i][j][k] with k and taking the modulo MOD.
After the loop finishes, the final value of dp[M][N][N] is printed as the output.
