<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers N and M from the input. It then initializes a 3D array dp with dimensions (M+1) x (N+1) x (N+1). The value of dp[i][j][k] represents the number of ways to add towns to the existing towns in such a way that there are i days, j added towns, and k towns in the loop.

The code then sets dp[0][1][1] to 1, indicating that on day 0, with 1 added town and 1 town in the loop, there is 1 way to add towns.

Next, the code enters a nested loop that iterates M times. In each iteration, it updates the values of dp[i+1][j+1][k], dp[i+1][j][k], and dp[i+1][j][j] based on the values of dp[i][j][k].

For dp[i+1][j+1][k], it adds the number of ways to add a town to the existing towns (dp[i][j][k]) multiplied by the number of remaining towns (N-j), modulo MOD.

For dp[i+1][j][k], it adds the number of ways to add a town to the existing towns (dp[i][j][k]) multiplied by the number of towns that are not in the loop (j-k), modulo MOD.

For dp[i+1][j][j], it adds the number of ways to add a town to the existing towns (dp[i][j][k]) multiplied by the number of towns in the loop (k), modulo MOD.

After the nested loop finishes, the code prints the value of dp[M][N][N] as the output.
