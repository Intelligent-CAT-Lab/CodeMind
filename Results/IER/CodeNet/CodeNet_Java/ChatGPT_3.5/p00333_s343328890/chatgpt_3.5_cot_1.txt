<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input: W, H, and C. It initializes variables a and b with the values of W and H respectively. It also initializes variable c.
Then it enters a while loop which continues until the remainder of a divided by b is not equal to 0. Inside the loop, it swaps the values of a and b, and assigns the remainder of c divided by a to b.
After the loop finishes, it calculates the output by dividing W by b, multiplying it with H divided by b, and then multiplying the result with C.
Finally, it prints the calculated output.
