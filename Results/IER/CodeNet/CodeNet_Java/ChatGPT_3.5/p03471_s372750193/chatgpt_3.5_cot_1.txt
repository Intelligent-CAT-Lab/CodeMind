<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and variable y are initialized with 9 and 45000 respectively according to the input. And variable flag is initialized with false.
It enters a while loop and it continues to execute as long as there is more input. Inside the while loop, it reads the next integer from the input and assigns it to variable n. Then it reads the next integer from the input and assigns it to variable y. Then it divides the value of variable y by 1000.
It enters a nested for loop and it iterates from 0 to y/price[0] for variable i and from 0 to (y-price[0]*i)/price[1] for variable j. Inside the nested for loop, it calculates the value of variable need by subtracting price[0]*i and price[1]*j from y. Then it checks if the sum of i, j and need is equal to n. If it is, it sets the value of variable flag to true and prints the values of i, j and need. If the condition is not met, it prints "-1 -1 -1".
After the while loop finishes, it closes the input and output streams.
