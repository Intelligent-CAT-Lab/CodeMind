<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string as input and converts it into a character array. It then initializes two stacks, stack1 and stack2, which will be used to store indices and areas respectively.
It iterates through the character array and checks each character. If the character is '\', it pushes the index i into stack1. If the character is '/' and stack1 is not empty, it pops an index j from stack1 and calculates the area as i - j. It then adds the area to the variable sum. It also checks if stack2 is not empty and the top element of stack2 has an index greater than j. If it is true, it pops an element from stack2 and adds its area to the current area. Finally, it pushes a new element into stack2 with index j and area.
After the loop finishes, it creates a list ans to store the areas from stack2 in reverse order. It iterates through stack2 and adds the areas to ans.
Then it prints the value of sum as the first line of output. It prints the size of ans as the second line of output. It then iterates through ans and prints each element separated by a space.
