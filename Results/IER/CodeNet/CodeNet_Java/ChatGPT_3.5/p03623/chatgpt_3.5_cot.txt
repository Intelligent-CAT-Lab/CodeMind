<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integer inputs: x, a, and b.
It then calculates the absolute difference between x and a, and the absolute difference between x and b.
If the absolute difference between x and a is less than the absolute difference between x and b, it prints "A". Otherwise, it prints "B".
In this case, x=5, a=2, and b=7.
The absolute difference between x and a is 3, and the absolute difference between x and b is 2.
Since the absolute difference between x and b is less than the absolute difference between x and a, the code will print "B".
<<<Output>>>
B
