<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input: x, a, and b. It then compares the absolute difference between x and a with the absolute difference between x and b. If the absolute difference between x and a is smaller, it prints "A". Otherwise, it prints "B".
In this case, x = 5, a = 2, and b = 7. The absolute difference between x and a is 3, and the absolute difference between x and b is 2. Since the absolute difference between x and b is smaller, the code will print "B".
<<<Output>>>
B
