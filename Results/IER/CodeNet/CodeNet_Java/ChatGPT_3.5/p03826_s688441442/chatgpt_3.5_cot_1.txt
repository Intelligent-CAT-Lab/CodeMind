<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four integers as input: 3, 5, 2, and 7. It multiplies the first two integers (3 * 5) and assigns the result to variable a. It also multiplies the last two integers (2 * 7) and assigns the result to variable b. Then it compares the values of a and b. If a is greater than b, it prints the value of a. Otherwise, it prints the value of b. In this case, a is 15 and b is 14. Since a is greater than b, the output will be 15.
<<<Output>>>
