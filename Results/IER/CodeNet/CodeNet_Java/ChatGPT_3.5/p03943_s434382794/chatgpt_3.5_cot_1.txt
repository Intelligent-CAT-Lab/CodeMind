<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input and stores them in variables a, b, and c respectively.
Then it calculates the sum of a, b, and c and stores it in the variable sum.
Next, it calculates the value of the variable discr using the formula (2 * a - sum) * (2 * b - sum) * (2 * c - sum).
If the value of discr is equal to 0, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
In this case, the values of a, b, and c are 10, 30, and 20 respectively.
The sum of these three numbers is 60.
So, the value of discr will be (2 * 10 - 60) * (2 * 30 - 60) * (2 * 20 - 60) = (-40) * (0) * (-20) = 0.
Therefore, the output will be "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
