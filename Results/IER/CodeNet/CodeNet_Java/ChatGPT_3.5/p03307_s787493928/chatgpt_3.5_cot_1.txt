<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads an integer input from the user and stores it in the variable n. It then checks if n is divisible by 2 (i.e., n % 2 == 0). If it is, it prints the value of n. Otherwise, it multiplies n by 2 and prints the result.
In this case, the input is 3. Since 3 is not divisible by 2, the code will multiply 3 by 2 and print the result, which is 6.
<<<Output>>>
6
