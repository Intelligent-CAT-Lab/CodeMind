<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, a and b. It then calculates the division of a by b and stores it in a double variable c. It also calculates the integer division of a by b and the remainder of a divided by b. Finally, it prints the integer division, the remainder, and the value of c formatted to 5 decimal places.
In this case, a is 3 and b is 2. The division of 3 by 2 is 1.5, so the integer division is 1 and the remainder is 1. The value of c is also 1.5.
<<<Output>>>
