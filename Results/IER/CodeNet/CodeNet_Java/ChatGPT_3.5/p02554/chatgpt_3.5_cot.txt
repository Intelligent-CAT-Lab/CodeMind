<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a method `modpow` which calculates the modular exponentiation of two numbers. It takes three parameters: `a`, `n`, and `mod`. It uses a while loop to calculate the result by repeatedly squaring `a` and reducing `n` by half until `n` becomes 0.

In the `solve` method, it reads a long integer `n` from the input. It then calculates the modular exponentiation of 10 raised to the power of `n` using the `modpow` method. It also calculates the modular exponentiation of 9 raised to the power of `n` and 8 raised to the power of `n`. It multiplies the result of the second calculation by 2. Finally, it calculates the final answer by subtracting the partial result from the total result and adding the both result. It takes the modulo of the final answer with 1000000007 and prints the result.

The code does not provide any input, so the value of `n` is not known. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the return value of `2` without knowing the value of `n`.
