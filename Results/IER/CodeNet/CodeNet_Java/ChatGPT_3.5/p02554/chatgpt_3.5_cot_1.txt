<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 2 according to the input. The variable mod is initialized with 1000000007. The variable total is calculated by calling the modpow() method with parameters 10, n, and mod. The variable partial is calculated by multiplying 2 with the result of calling the modpow() method with parameters 9, n, and mod. The variable both is calculated by calling the modpow() method with parameters 8, n, and mod. The variable ans is calculated by subtracting partial from total, adding both to it, and then taking the modulo of mod. Finally, the value of ans is printed as output.
