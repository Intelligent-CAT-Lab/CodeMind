<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n, variable a and variable b are initialized with 5, 2 and 4 respectively according to the input. 
Then it calculates the difference between b and a and stores it in variable k. In this case, k = 4 - 2 = 2.
Then it checks if k is odd or even. Since 2 is even, the condition k % 2 == 1 is false.
Therefore, it prints "Alice" as the output.
<<<Output>>>
