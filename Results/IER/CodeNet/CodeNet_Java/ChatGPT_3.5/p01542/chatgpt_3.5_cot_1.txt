The code reads a string input and then calls the solve() method. In the solve() method, the string is converted to a character array and a variable max is initialized with -1. Then the dfs() method is called with an initial index of 0. The dfs() method is a recursive method that tries all possible combinations of characters at each index of the character array. If the character at the current index is '.', it tries all possible operators ('0', '1', '+', '-', '*', '(', ')') at that index and then calls dfs() recursively with the next index. If the character at the current index is not '.', it simply calls dfs() recursively with the next index. After trying all possible combinations, it calculates the maximum value obtained from the calc() method and prints it as output.
The calc() method calculates the value of the expression represented by the character array. It uses a recursive approach to evaluate the expression. It starts with the E() method, which evaluates the expression in the form of E = T + T - T + ... and returns the result. The T() method evaluates the expression in the form of T = F * F * F * ... and returns the result. The F() method evaluates the expression in the form of F = (E) or F = 0 or F = 1 and returns the result. The Result class is used to store the current index and value during the evaluation of the expression. It also checks if the expression is valid and within the specified range.
In this case, the input is "000". The solve() method is called and the dfs() method is called with an initial index of 0. Since the character at index 0 is '0', the dfs() method is called recursively with the next index. Since the character at index 1 is '0', the dfs() method is called recursively with the next index. Since the character at index 2 is '0', the dfs() method is called recursively with the next index. Since the character at index 3 is '$', the dfs() method calculates the maximum value obtained from the calc() method, which is -1. Finally, the maximum value is printed as output.
