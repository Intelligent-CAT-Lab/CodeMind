<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes two HashMaps, dec1 and dec2, which map characters to binary strings and vice versa. 
It then creates a Scanner object to read input from the user. 
Inside the while loop, it reads each line of input and converts each character to its corresponding binary string using the dec1 HashMap. 
It then checks if the binary string can be decoded using the dec2 HashMap. If it can, it appends the decoded character to the output string and removes the decoded part from the binary string. 
This process continues until the binary string cannot be decoded anymore. 
Finally, it prints the output string.

For the given input "?D-C'KOPUA`?", the code will perform the following steps:
1. Read the first line of input: "?D-C'KOPUA`?"
2. Convert each character to its corresponding binary string using the dec1 HashMap:
   - "?" becomes "11111"
   - "D" becomes "0001"
   - "-" becomes "10010001"
   - "C" becomes "0101"
   - "'" becomes "000000"
   - "K" becomes "10011011"
   - "O" becomes "00101"
   - "P" becomes "111"
   - "U" becomes "10011100"
   - "A" becomes "100101"
   - "`" becomes "11010"
   - "?" becomes "11111"
3. Decode the binary string using the dec2 HashMap:
   - "11111" becomes "?"
   - "0001" becomes "D"
   - "10010001" becomes "-"
   - "0101" becomes "C"
   - "000000" becomes "'"
   - "10011011" becomes "K"
   - "00101" becomes "O"
   - "111" becomes "P"
   - "10011100" becomes "U"
   - "100101" becomes "A"
   - "11010" becomes " "
   - "11111" becomes "?"
4. Append the decoded characters to the output string: "?D-C'KOPUA`?"
5. Read the next line of input (which is empty) and exit the while loop.
6. Print the output string: "?D-C'KOPUA`?"

<<<Output>>>
?D-C'KOPUA`?
