<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers from the input using the Scanner class. It subtracts 1 from each of the input integers and then multiplies them together. Finally, it prints the result as output.
In this case, the input is "3 4". The first integer is 3 and the second integer is 4. Subtracting 1 from each of them gives 2 and 3 respectively. Multiplying these two numbers together gives 6.
