The variable n is initialized with 3 according to the input. 
It creates an ArrayList of Point objects called ps and adds n Point objects to it. Each Point object has an array called coeff with size n and all elements are initialized to 1.
It initializes a HashSet called pp.
It initializes a 2D array called comb with size n+10 and fills it with combinations of numbers modulo mod.
It initializes a 2D array called dp with size n+10 and fills it with -1.
It calls the dfs method with parameters n-1 and 0 and adds the result to the dfs method with parameters n-1 and 1. It multiplies the sum by n and takes the modulo of mod.
It prints the final result.
