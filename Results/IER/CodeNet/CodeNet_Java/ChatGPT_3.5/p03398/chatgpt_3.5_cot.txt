The code defines a class `Main` with a nested class `TaskF` inside it. The `TaskF` class has a method `solve` which takes three parameters: `testNumber`, `in` and `out`. The method reads an integer `n` from the input, creates an ArrayList of `Point` objects and initializes each `Point` object with an array of size `n` with all elements set to 1. It also initializes a HashSet `pp` and a 2D array `comb` using the `Utils.getComb` method. It then initializes a 2D array `dp` with size `n+10` and 101 and fills it with -1. Finally, it prints the result of the expression `(n * (dfs(n - 1, 0) + dfs(n - 1, 1))) % mod` to the output.

The `dfs` method is a recursive method that takes two parameters: `left` and `excess`. It checks if the value of `dp[left][excess]` is already calculated and returns it if it is. If `left` is 0, it returns 1 if `excess` is 0, otherwise it returns 0. Otherwise, it initializes a variable `ret` to 0 and iterates over all possible values of `pos` and `neg` such that `pos + neg <= left`. It checks if `pos + neg` is not equal to 0 and if `excess > pos + neg + 1`. If both conditions are satisfied, it calculates the value of `t` as the absolute difference between `excess + pos - neg` and checks if `t` is even. If `t` is even, it adds the value of `dfs(left - pos - neg, t / 2) * comb[left][pos] % mod * comb[left - pos][neg]` to `ret`. Finally, it returns `ret % mod`.

The `Point` class is a simple class with a single field `coeff` which is an array of integers.

The `Utils` class has a single method `getComb` which takes two parameters: `sz` and `mod`. It initializes a 2D array `comb` of size `sz` and fills it with values calculated using the combinatorial formula. It returns the `comb` array.

The `AUtils` class has two methods `deepFill` which fill a 2D array or a 1D array with a given value.

The `InputReader` class is a utility class for reading input from the input stream.

The `OutputWriter` class is a utility class for writing output to the output stream.

The `Debug` class is a utility class for printing debug information.

The return value of `3` would be `0`.
