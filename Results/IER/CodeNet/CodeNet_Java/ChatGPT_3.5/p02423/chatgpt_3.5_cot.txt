<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input integer `x` and performs the following operations:
1. It converts `x` to a binary string using `Long.toBinaryString(x)`.
2. It performs a left shift on `x` by 1 bit and converts the result to a binary string using `Long.toBinaryString(x<<1)`.
3. It performs a right shift on `x` by 1 bit and converts the result to a binary string using `Long.toBinaryString(x>>1)`.
4. It calls the `to32` method to ensure that all binary strings have a length of 32 by adding leading zeros or truncating the string if it exceeds 32 characters.
5. It prints the binary string `twobit`.
6. It iterates over each character in the binary string `twobit` and prints the complement of each bit (0 becomes 1 and 1 becomes 0).
7. It prints the binary string `left` and `right` on separate lines.
