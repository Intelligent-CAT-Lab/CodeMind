<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input integer x and performs the following operations:
1. It converts x to a binary string using Long.toBinaryString() method and stores it in the variable twobit.
2. It performs a left shift operation on x (x<<1) and converts the result to a binary string using Long.toBinaryString() method. The binary string is stored in the variable left.
3. It performs a right shift operation on x (x>>1) and converts the result to a binary string using Long.toBinaryString() method. The binary string is stored in the variable right.
4. It calls the to32() method to ensure that all binary strings have a length of 32. The to32() method adds leading zeros if the length is less than 32 and truncates the string if the length is greater than 32.
5. It prints the value of twobit.
6. It iterates over each character in twobit and prints the complement of each character (0 becomes 1 and 1 becomes 0).
7. It prints the value of left.
8. It prints the value of right.
