The variables r, c, a1, a2, b1, and b2 are initialized with the values 4, 4, 0, 0, 3, and 3 respectively according to the input.
Then, two 2D arrays dp and cost are initialized with dimensions r x c, and a boolean array use is initialized with dimensions r x c.
The value of dp[a1][a2] is set to 1.
The cost array is filled with a large value (2 << 27) for each element.
An ArrayDeque object named queue is created.
A Data object with the values a1, a2, and 0 is added to the queue.
A while loop is executed until the queue is empty.
Inside the loop, a Data object is retrieved from the queue.
If the use[tmp.a][tmp.b] is true, the loop continues to the next iteration.
Otherwise, use[tmp.a][tmp.b] is set to true.
A for loop is executed four times.
Inside the loop, the coordinates ty and tx are calculated based on the current coordinates tmp.a and tmp.b, and the direction specified by vy[i] and vx[i].
If tx is -1, it is set to c-1.
If tx is c, it is set to 0.
If ty is -1, it is set to r-1.
If ty is r, it is set to 0.
If cost[ty][tx] is less than tmp.c+1 or use[ty][tx] is true, the loop continues to the next iteration.
Otherwise, cost[ty][tx] is set to tmp.c+1.
dp[ty][tx] is incremented by dp[tmp.a][tmp.b] and then modulo 100000007.
A new Data object with the values ty, tx, and tmp.c+1 is added to the queue.
Finally, the value of dp[b1][b2] is printed as the output.
