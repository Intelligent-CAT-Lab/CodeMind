<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers from the input using the Scanner class and stores them in variables x1 and x2. Then it calculates the absolute difference between x1 and x2 using the Math.abs() method. Finally, it prints the result of the calculation as the output.
In this case, the input is "20 30", so x1 will be assigned the value 20 and x2 will be assigned the value 30. The absolute difference between 20 and 30 is 10. Therefore, the output will be 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
