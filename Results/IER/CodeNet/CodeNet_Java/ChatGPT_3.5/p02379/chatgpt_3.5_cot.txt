<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a line of input and splits it into an array of strings called `lines`. Then, it creates an array of doubles called `list` with a size of 4. It initializes a variable `n` with the value 4. 

Then, it enters a while loop that decrements `n` by 1 in each iteration. Inside the loop, it parses each element of `lines` as a double and assigns it to the corresponding index in `list`. 

After the loop finishes, it calculates the distance between two points using the formula `Math.sqrt((list[0]-list[2])*(list[0]-list[2])+(list[1]-list[3])*(list[1]-list[3]))`. This formula calculates the square root of the sum of the squares of the differences between the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of the two points.

Finally, it prints the calculated distance as the output.
