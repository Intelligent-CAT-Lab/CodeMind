<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a line of input and splits it into an array of strings called "lines". Then, it creates an array of doubles called "list" with a size of 4. It initializes a variable "n" with the value of 4. 

Then, it enters a while loop that decrements the value of "n" by 1 in each iteration. Inside the loop, it parses each element of the "lines" array into a double and assigns it to the corresponding index in the "list" array.

After the loop finishes, it calculates the distance between two points using the formula: sqrt((x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2), where (x1, y1) are the first two elements of the "list" array and (x2, y2) are the last two elements of the "list" array. It uses the Math.sqrt() method to calculate the square root.

Finally, it prints the calculated distance as the output.
