<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads an integer input from the user using the Scanner class and stores it in the variable i. Then, it initializes the variable ans with the value 1. 
Next, it checks if the value of i is equal to 1. If it is, it assigns the value 0 to the variable ans. 
Finally, it prints the value of ans as the output. 
In this case, the input is 1, so the condition i == 1 is true and the value of ans is updated to 0. Therefore, the output will be 0.
