<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes variables x and y with the input values 2 and 1 respectively.
Then it calculates the values of variables tx and ty by subtracting the minimum of x and y from x and y respectively.
Finally, it checks if the sum of tx and ty is less than or equal to 1. If it is, it prints "Brown", otherwise it prints "Alice".
In this case, tx = 2 - min(2, 1) = 2 - 1 = 1 and ty = 1 - min(2, 1) = 1 - 1 = 0.
Since tx + ty = 1 + 0 = 1, which is less than or equal to 1, the output will be "Brown".
<<<Output>>>
Brown
