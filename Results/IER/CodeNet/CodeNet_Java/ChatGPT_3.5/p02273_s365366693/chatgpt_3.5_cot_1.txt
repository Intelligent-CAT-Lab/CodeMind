The variable n is initialized with 1 according to the input. Two Point2D objects p and r are created with coordinates (0,0) and (100,0) respectively. The coordinates of p are printed as output. Then the curve() method is called with the parameters n, p, and r. Inside the curve() method, if n is greater than 0, four new Point2D objects s, t, and u are created. The coordinates of s and t are calculated based on the coordinates of a and b. The coordinates of u are calculated using a rotation formula. Then the curve() method is recursively called four times with different parameters. The coordinates of s, u, and t are printed as output. Finally, the coordinates of r are printed as output.
