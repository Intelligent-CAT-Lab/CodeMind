<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string S using the Scanner class. It then creates a StringBuilder object sb with the value of S. It also creates a character array ch with the characters of S.

Next, it checks if the length of ch is greater than 9. If it is, it prints "NO" and returns from the main method.

If the length of ch is not greater than 9, it creates a string akb with the value "AKIHABARA".

Then, it enters a for loop that iterates from 0 to 8. Inside the loop, it checks if the length of sb is greater than i. If it is, it checks if the character at index i in akb is equal to the character at index i in sb. If they are equal, it continues to the next iteration of the loop.

If the characters are not equal, it inserts the character 'A' at index i in sb. Then, it checks if the character at index i in akb is equal to the character at index i in sb. If they are equal, it continues to the next iteration of the loop.

If the characters are not equal, it prints "NO" and exits the program.

After the loop finishes, it prints "YES".
