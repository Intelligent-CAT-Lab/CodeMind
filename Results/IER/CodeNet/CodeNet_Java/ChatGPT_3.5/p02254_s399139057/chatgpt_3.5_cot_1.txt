<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string as input and converts it into a character array. It then initializes an array called alpha with size 26 to store the count of each alphabet. It iterates through the character array and increments the count of the corresponding alphabet in the alpha array.

Next, it creates a PriorityQueue called queue and adds nodes to it. Each node represents an alphabet and its count. The nodes are added in ascending order of their counts.

If the size of the queue is 1, it means there is only one distinct alphabet in the input string. In this case, it prints the count of that alphabet and returns.

Otherwise, it creates an ArrayList called chars to store the nodes that represent alphabets. It then enters a while loop as long as the size of the queue is greater than 1. In each iteration, it removes the two nodes with the smallest counts from the queue, creates a new node with the sum of their counts, and adds it back to the queue. It also adds the removed nodes to the chars ArrayList if they represent alphabets.

After the while loop, it calls the setLength method to set the length of each node in the queue. The length is calculated as the depth of the node in the binary tree formed by the merging of nodes.

Finally, it calculates the total value by summing the product of the count and length for each node in the chars ArrayList. It prints the total value as the output.
