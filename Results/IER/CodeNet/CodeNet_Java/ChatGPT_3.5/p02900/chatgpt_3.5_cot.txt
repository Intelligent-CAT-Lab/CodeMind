<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two long integers as input, `a` and `b`. It then calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the `gcd` method. The `gcd` method uses recursion to calculate the GCD. Once the GCD is calculated, it passes the GCD to the `factors` method, which returns a HashSet containing the prime factors of the GCD. Finally, it prints the size of the HashSet, which represents the number of distinct prime factors of the GCD.

In this case, the input values are `12` and `18`. The GCD of `12` and `18` is `6`, and the prime factors of `6` are `2` and `3`. Therefore, the output should be `2`, which represents the number of distinct prime factors of the GCD.
