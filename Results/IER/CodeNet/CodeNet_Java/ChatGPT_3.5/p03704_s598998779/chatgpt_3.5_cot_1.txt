The variable n is initialized with 63 according to the input. And variable total is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 9 to check each integer i in this range. 
Inside the for loop, it calls the count method twice. The first time it passes an array of size i, n, 0 and i*2 as parameters. The second time it passes an array of size i+1, n, 0 and i*2+1 as parameters.
The count method is a recursive method that calculates the number of ways to form a number with a given sum and a given number of digits. It uses backtracking to explore all possible combinations of digits.
The count method returns the number of ways to form a number with the given sum and number of digits.
After the for loop finishes, it print the final value of variable total as output.
