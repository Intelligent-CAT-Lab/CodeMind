<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string input S and converts it into a character array d. It initializes an array dp of size 13 with all elements set to 0. It also initializes a variable base with the value 1.
Then it enters a for loop that iterates from the last character of d to the first character. Inside the loop, it initializes a new array next_dp of size 13 with all elements set to 0.
If the current character is '?', it enters another nested for loop that iterates from 0 to 9. Inside this loop, it calculates the next_dp array by adding the current dp array values to the corresponding positions in next_dp array based on the formula (k * base + j) % 13, where k is the current digit and j is the index of dp array. It also takes modulo 1000000007 for each addition.
If the current character is not '?', it converts the character to an integer k and performs the same calculation as above to update the next_dp array.
After the inner loop finishes, it assigns the next_dp array to dp array, updates the base variable by multiplying it with 10 and taking modulo 13.
Finally, it prints the value of dp[5] as the output.
