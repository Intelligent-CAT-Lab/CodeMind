<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string input `S` which is equal to `??2??5`. It then converts the string into a character array `d`. It initializes an array `dp` of size 13 with all elements set to 0. It also initializes `dp[0]` to 1. It sets `base` to 1.

Then it enters a for loop which iterates from the last character of `d` to the first character. Inside the loop, it initializes a new array `next_dp` of size 13 with all elements set to 0.

If the current character is a question mark '?', it enters another for loop which iterates from 0 to 9. Inside this loop, it iterates over the elements of `dp` and updates the corresponding elements of `next_dp` by adding the current element of `dp` to the element at index `(k * base + j) % 13` of `next_dp`. It also takes the modulo 1000000007 of the updated element.

If the current character is not a question mark, it converts the character to an integer `k` and enters a for loop which iterates over the elements of `dp`. It updates the corresponding elements of `next_dp` in the same way as before.

After the inner loop finishes, it assigns `next_dp` to `dp`. It multiplies `base` by 10 and takes the modulo 13 of the result.

After the outer loop finishes, it prints the value of `dp[5]` as the output.
