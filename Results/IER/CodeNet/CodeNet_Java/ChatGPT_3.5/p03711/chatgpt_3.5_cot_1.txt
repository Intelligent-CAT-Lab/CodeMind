<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers x and y as input.
It defines three arrays grp1, grp2, and grp3 which contain certain numbers.
It then calls the grouped() method passing grp1, x, and y as arguments and stores the result in bx.
It also calls the grouped() method passing grp2, x, and y as arguments and stores the result in by.
Finally, it checks if bx or by is true and prints "Yes" if either of them is true, otherwise it prints "No".

In the given input, x=1 and y=3.
The grouped() method is called twice:
1. grouped(grp1, 1, 3) - This checks if 1 and 3 are present in grp1. Since both are present, bx is set to true.
2. grouped(grp2, 1, 3) - This checks if 1 and 3 are present in grp2. Since neither are present, by remains false.

Since bx is true, the condition (bx || by) is true and the code prints "Yes".

<<<Output>>>
Yes
