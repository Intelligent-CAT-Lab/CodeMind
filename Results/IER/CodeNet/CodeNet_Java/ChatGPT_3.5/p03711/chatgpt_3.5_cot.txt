<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers x and y as input. It then checks if both x and y are present in any of the three arrays grp1, grp2, and grp3. If x is present in grp1 and y is present in grp1 or grp2, or if x is present in grp2 and y is present in grp1 or grp2, the function returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.

In this case, x=1 and y=3. Both x and y are present in grp1. Therefore, the function will return true.

<<<Output>>>
Yes
