<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers n and m as input. It then initializes two arrays, factorial and revFactorial, of size m+1 to store the factorial and factorial^-1 values respectively. It calculates the factorial values using a loop and stores them in the factorial array. It also calculates the factorial^-1 values using another loop and stores them in the revFactorial array. 

After that, it initializes a variable answer to 0. It then enters a for loop that iterates from 0 to n. Inside the loop, it calculates the result using the formula: (−1)^i × n_C_i * m_P_i × (m-i_P_n-i)^2. It adds the result to the answer variable. Finally, it prints the value of the answer variable as the output.

In this case, n=2 and m=2. The factorial array will be [1, 1, 2] and the revFactorial array will be [2, 1, 1]. The loop will iterate twice, for i=0 and i=1. For i=0, the result will be 1 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 1 * 1 = 8. For i=1, the result will be -1 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 1 * 1 = -8. Since the result is negative, we add MOD to it to make it positive, so the final result is 1. Therefore, the output will be 1.
