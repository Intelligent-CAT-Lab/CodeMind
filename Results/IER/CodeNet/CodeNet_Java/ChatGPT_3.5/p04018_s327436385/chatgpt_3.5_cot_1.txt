<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string as input and checks if the string can be divided into multiple equal parts. It uses the Z algorithm to find the longest prefix of the string that is also a suffix. If such a prefix exists, it means that the string can be divided into multiple equal parts. 

In this case, the input string is "aab". The Z algorithm is applied to this string to find the longest prefix that is also a suffix. The Z array is calculated as follows:
- For index 0, the Z value is 3 because the entire string "aab" is a prefix and a suffix.
- For index 1, the Z value is 0 because there is no common prefix and suffix starting from index 1.
- For index 2, the Z value is 1 because the prefix "a" and the suffix "b" have a common length of 1.

Since the Z value at index 0 is equal to the length of the string, it means that the string can be divided into multiple equal parts. Therefore, the output will be:
2
1

The first line of the output indicates the number of equal parts the string can be divided into, and the second line indicates the length of each part.
