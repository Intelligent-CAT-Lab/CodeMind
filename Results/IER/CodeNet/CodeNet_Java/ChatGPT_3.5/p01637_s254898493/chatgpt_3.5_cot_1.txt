<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs M and r. It then initializes several variables and constants. It then enters a for loop that iterates 1000 times. Inside the loop, it calculates the value of mid as the average of r and l. It then checks if cd is less than or equal to rd * mid / 100. If it is, it updates the value of l to mid. Otherwise, it updates the value of r to mid. After the loop finishes, it assigns the value of l to x. It then enters another for loop that iterates 1000 times. Inside the loop, it calculates the value of mid as the average of r and l. It then checks if cr is less than or equal to rr * mid / 100. If it is, it updates the value of l to mid. Otherwise, it updates the value of r to mid. After the loop finishes, it assigns the value of l to y. It then checks if x + y is greater than M. If it is, it prints -1. Otherwise, it calculates the values of D and R. It then calculates the value of ans as M - x - y. It checks if D is less than cd or R is less than cr. If either condition is true, it prints -1. Otherwise, it calculates the value of ans by adding 100 * (D - cd) / rd and 100 * (R - cr) / rr. Finally, it prints the value of ans.
