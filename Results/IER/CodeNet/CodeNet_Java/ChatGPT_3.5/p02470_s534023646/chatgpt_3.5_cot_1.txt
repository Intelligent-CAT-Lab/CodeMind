<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 6 according to the input. And variable t is also initialized with n. An empty list is created to store the factors of n.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to the square root of n to check each integer i in this range. If i is a factor of n, it adds i to the list and divides n by i until n is no longer divisible by i.
After the loop finishes, if n is not equal to 1, it means n is a prime number and it adds n to the list.
Then it calculates the value of variable k and variable t. For each factor i in the list, it multiplies k by (i-1) and divides t by i.
Finally, it prints the product of k and t as output.
