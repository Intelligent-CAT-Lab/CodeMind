<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input and splits it into an array of characters. It initializes two variables, ans and now, both set to 0. Then it enters a for loop that iterates through each character in the array. 
If the character is "(", it increments the value of now by 1. If the character is ")", it decrements the value of now by 1. If the character is neither "(", nor ")", it assigns the value of now to ans. 
After the loop finishes, it prints the value of ans as the output.
In this case, the input string is "((*)())". The code will increment now twice when encountering the first two "(" characters, then decrement now once when encountering the first ")" character. The "*" character does not affect the value of now. The code will assign the value of now (1) to ans when encountering the second ")" character. Therefore, the output will be 1.
