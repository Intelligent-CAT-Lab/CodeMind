<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string input from the user and stores it in the variable 's'. It then creates a character array 'word' with the same length as the input string. It also calculates the length of the input string minus 2 and stores it in the variable 'len'. 

Next, it iterates over each character in the input string and assigns it to the corresponding index in the 'word' array. 

Finally, it prints the first character of the 'word' array, followed by the value of 'len', and then the last character of the 'word' array. 

In this case, the input string is "internationalization". The length of the string is 22, so 'len' will be 20. The first character of the 'word' array is 'i' and the last character is 'n'. Therefore, the output will be "i20n".

<<<Output>>>
i20n
