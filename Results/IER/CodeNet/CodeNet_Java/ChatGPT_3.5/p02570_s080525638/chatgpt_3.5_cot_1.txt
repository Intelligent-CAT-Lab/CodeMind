<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads three integers from the input: d, t, and s. It then checks if the product of s and t is less than d. If it is, it prints "No". Otherwise, it prints "Yes".
In this case, the values of d, t, and s are 1000, 15, and 80 respectively. The product of s and t is 1200, which is greater than d. Therefore, the code will print "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
