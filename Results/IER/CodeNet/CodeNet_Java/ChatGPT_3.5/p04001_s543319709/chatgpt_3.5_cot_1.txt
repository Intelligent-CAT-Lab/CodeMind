<<<Analysis>>>
The variable S is initialized with "125" according to the input. The variable res is initialized with 0 and the variable n is initialized with the length of S minus 1, which is 2.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2^2-1=3 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is used to determine the positions where "+" should be inserted in the string S.
Inside the for loop, it creates a StringBuilder object sb with the value of S.
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from n-1 to 0. It checks if the j-th bit of i is 1 by using bitwise operations. If it is 1, it inserts "+" at the j+1 position in sb.
After the inner for loop finishes, it splits the string sb into an array of strings s using "+" as the delimiter.
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates through each element in s. It converts each element to a long and adds it to the variable res.
After the outer for loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable res as output.
