<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs h and w. It initializes ans as 0. 
It checks if both h and w are not divisible by 3. If they are not, it proceeds with the calculations.
If h is greater than w, it swaps the values of h and w.
It calculates the area of the rectangle s = h * w.
It initializes min_h_loop as s.
Then it enters a for loop with h_loop starting from 1 and going up to h-1.
Inside the loop, it calculates three areas s_a, s_b, and s_c based on the current value of h_loop.
It finds the maximum and minimum of these three areas and calculates the difference between them.
It updates min_h_loop with the minimum value between min_h_loop and the difference.
After the loop finishes, it assigns min_h_loop to ans.
If h is less than w, it enters another for loop with w_loop starting from 1 and going up to w-1.
Inside the loop, it calculates three areas s_a, s_b, and s_c based on the current value of w_loop.
It finds the maximum and minimum of these three areas and calculates the difference between them.
It updates min_w_loop with the minimum value between min_w_loop and the difference.
After the loop finishes, it updates ans with the minimum value between ans and min_w_loop.
Finally, it prints the value of ans as the output.
