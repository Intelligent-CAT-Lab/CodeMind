<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input D. It then checks the value of D using if statements. If D is equal to 25, it prints "Christmas". If D is equal to 24, it prints "Christmas Eve". If D is equal to 23, it prints "Christmas Eve Eve". If D is equal to 22, it prints "Christmas Eve Eve Eve". Since the input is 25, the condition D==25 is true and it will print "Christmas".
<<<Output>>>
Christmas
