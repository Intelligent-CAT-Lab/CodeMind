<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input D using the Scanner class. It then checks the value of D using multiple if statements. If D is equal to 25, it prints "Christmas". If D is equal to 24, it prints "Christmas Eve". If D is equal to 23, it prints "Christmas Eve Eve". If D is equal to 22, it prints "Christmas Eve Eve Eve". Since the input is 25, the first if statement is true and it prints "Christmas".
<<<Output>>>
Christmas
