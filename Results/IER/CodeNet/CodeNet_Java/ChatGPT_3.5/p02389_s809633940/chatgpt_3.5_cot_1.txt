<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers from the input using the Scanner class and assigns them to variables a and b respectively. Then it calculates the product of a and b and stores it in a variable. It also calculates 2 times the sum of a and b and stores it in another variable. Finally, it prints the product and the sum on the console separated by a space.
In this case, the input is "3 5", so a will be assigned the value 3 and b will be assigned the value 5. The product of 3 and 5 is 15 and 2 times the sum of 3 and 5 is 16. Therefore, the output will be "15 16".
<<<Output>>>
15 16
