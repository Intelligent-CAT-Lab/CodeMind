<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers A and B as input. It checks if B is divisible by A by checking if the remainder of B divided by A is 0. If it is, it adds A to B and prints the result. Otherwise, it subtracts A from B and prints the result.
In this case, A is 4 and B is 12. Since 12 is divisible by 4, the remainder is 0. Therefore, it adds 4 to 12 and the output is 16.
