<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string as input and stores it in variable s. Then it calculates the length of the string and stores it in variable leng. 
Next, it prints the first character of the string using s.charAt(0). 
Then it prints the length of the string minus 2, which is leng-2. 
Finally, it prints the last character of the string using s.charAt(leng-1).
So, the output would be the first character of the string, followed by the length of the string minus 2, and then the last character of the string.
