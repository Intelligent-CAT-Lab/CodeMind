<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string and calculates its length. It then prints the first character of the string, followed by the length of the string minus 2, and finally the last character of the string. 

In this case, the input string is "internationalization". The length of the string is 20. Therefore, the code will print "i", followed by 18, and then "n".
