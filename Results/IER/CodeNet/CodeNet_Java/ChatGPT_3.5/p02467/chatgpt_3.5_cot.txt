The code takes an input number `n` and starts a loop with variable `i` initialized to 2. 
Inside the loop, it checks if `n` is divisible by `i`. If it is, it divides `n` by `i` and prints `i` as a factor of `n`.
If `n` is not divisible by `i`, it increments `i` by 1 and continues the loop.
The loop continues until `n` is less than `i * i`.
Finally, it prints the remaining value of `n` as a factor.
In this case, the input number is 12.
The loop will iterate as follows:
- i = 2: 12 is divisible by 2, so n becomes 6 and 2 is printed.
- i = 2: 6 is divisible by 2, so n becomes 3 and 2 is printed.
- i = 3: 3 is not divisible by 3, so i becomes 4.
- i = 4: 3 is not divisible by 4, so i becomes 5.
- i = 5: 3 is not divisible by 5, so i becomes 6.
Since `n` is now less than `i * i`, the loop ends.
The remaining value of `n` is 3, so it is printed as a factor.
Therefore, the output will be: 12: 2 2 3
