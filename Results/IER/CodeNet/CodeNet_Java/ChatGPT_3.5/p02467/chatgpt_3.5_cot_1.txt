<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input integer n and initializes a variable i with 2. It then enters a while loop with the condition n >= i * i. Inside the loop, it checks if n is divisible by i. If it is, it divides n by i and prints the value of i. If it is not divisible, it increments the value of i by 1. The loop continues until n is no longer greater than or equal to i * i. Finally, it prints the remaining value of n. 

For the given input 12, the code will go through the following steps:
- n = 12, i = 2: 12 is divisible by 2, so n becomes 6 and 2 is printed.
- n = 6, i = 2: 6 is divisible by 2, so n becomes 3 and 2 is printed.
- n = 3, i = 2: 3 is not divisible by 2, so i becomes 3.
- n = 3, i = 3: 3 is divisible by 3, so n becomes 1 and 3 is printed.
- n = 1, i = 3: 1 is not greater than or equal to 3 * 3, so the loop ends.
- The remaining value of n, which is 1, is printed.

<<<Output>>>
12: 2 2 3
