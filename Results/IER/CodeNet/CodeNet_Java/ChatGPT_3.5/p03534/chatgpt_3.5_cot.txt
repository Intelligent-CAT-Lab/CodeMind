<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string as input and initializes an array abc of size 3 to store the count of occurrences of characters 'a', 'b', and 'c'. 
Then it iterates through each character of the input string and checks if it matches with any of the characters 'a', 'b', or 'c'. 
If there is a match, it increments the count in the corresponding index of the abc array. 
After counting the occurrences, it sorts the abc array in ascending order. 
Finally, it checks if the difference between the second smallest count and the smallest count is less than 2, and also if the difference between the largest count and the smallest count is less than 2. 
If both conditions are true, it prints "YES", otherwise it prints "NO".

In the given input "abac", the count of 'a' is 2, the count of 'b' is 1, and the count of 'c' is 1. 
After sorting the abc array, it becomes [1, 1, 2]. 
The difference between the second smallest count (1) and the smallest count (1) is 0, and the difference between the largest count (2) and the smallest count (1) is 1. 
Both differences are less than 2, so the code will print "YES".

<<<Output>>>
YES
