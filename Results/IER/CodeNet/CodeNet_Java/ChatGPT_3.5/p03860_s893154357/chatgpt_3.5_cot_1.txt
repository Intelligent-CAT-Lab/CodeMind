<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads three strings from the input: a, b, and c. Then it takes the first character of each string and concatenates them to form a new string ans. Finally, it prints the value of ans as the output.
In this case, the input is "AtCoder Beginner Contest". So, the value of a will be "AtCoder", the value of b will be "Beginner", and the value of c will be "Contest". Therefore, the value of ans will be "ABC".
<<<Output>>>
ABC
