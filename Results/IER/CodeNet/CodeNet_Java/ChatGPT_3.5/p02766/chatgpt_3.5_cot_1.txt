<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers N and K from the input. It then initializes two variables base and cnt with 1 and 0 respectively.
The code enters a while loop that continues as long as base is less than or equal to N. In each iteration of the loop, it increments cnt by 1 and multiplies base by K.
After the loop finishes, it prints the value of cnt as the output.
In this case, N is 11 and K is 2. The loop will iterate 4 times because 2^4 = 16 is the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to 11. Therefore, the value of cnt will be 4.
<<<Output>>>
4
