The code reads two integers n and w from the input. It then initializes an array count of size n+1 with all elements set to 0. It also initializes a StringBuilder object ans.
The code then enters a for loop that iterates from 1 to w. Inside this loop, it enters another for loop that iterates from 1 to the square root of i. Inside this inner loop, it checks if i is divisible by j. If it is, it increments count[j] and if i/j is not equal to j, it increments count[i/j]. This loop calculates the count of divisors for each number from 1 to w.
After the loop finishes, it initializes a variable nowcount to 0. It then enters another for loop that iterates from 0 to n. Inside this loop, it checks if count[j] is greater than or equal to 1. If it is, it increments nowcount. This loop calculates the number of distinct divisors for each number from 0 to n.
The code then appends the value of nowcount to the StringBuilder ans.
After that, it enters another for loop that iterates from 1 to n-w. Inside this loop, it enters another for loop that iterates from 1 to the square root of i. Inside this inner loop, it checks if i is divisible by j. If it is, it decrements count[j] and if j is equal to i, it checks if count[j] is less than or equal to 1. If it is, it decrements nowcount. If j is not equal to i, it checks if count[j] is equal to 1. If it is, it decrements nowcount. It then checks if i/j is not equal to j. If it is not, it decrements count[i/j] and if j is equal to 1, it checks if count[i/j] is less than or equal to 1. If it is, it decrements nowcount. If j is not equal to 1, it checks if count[i/j] is equal to 1. If it is, it decrements nowcount.
After that, it initializes a variable num to i+w. It then enters another for loop that iterates from 1 to the square root of num. Inside this inner loop, it checks if num is divisible by j. If it is, it increments count[j] and if j is less than or equal to i, it checks if count[j] is equal to 2. If it is, it increments nowcount. If j is not less than or equal to i, it checks if count[j] is equal to 1. If it is, it increments nowcount. It then checks if num/j is not equal to j. If it is not, it increments count[num/j] and if num/j is less than or equal to i, it checks if count[num/j] is equal to 2. If it is, it increments nowcount. If num/j is not less than or equal to i, it checks if count[num/j] is equal to 1. If it is, it increments nowcount.
After the inner loop finishes, it appends the value of nowcount to the StringBuilder ans.
Finally, it prints the substring of ans starting from index 1.
