<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four integers as input: a, b, c, and d. It compares the sum of a and b with the sum of c and d using if-else statements.
If the sum of a and b is greater than the sum of c and d, it prints "Left".
If the sum of a and b is equal to the sum of c and d, it prints "Balanced".
If the sum of a and b is less than the sum of c and d, it prints "Right".
In this case, the sum of a and b is 3 + 8 = 11, and the sum of c and d is 7 + 1 = 8. Since 11 is greater than 8, the output will be "Left".
