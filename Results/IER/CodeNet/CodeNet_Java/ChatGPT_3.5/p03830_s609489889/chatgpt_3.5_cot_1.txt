The variable N is initialized with 3 according to the input. The method getPrimes(1000) is called to get a list of prime numbers up to 1000 and store it in the variable primes.
The variable memo is initialized as an array of size 1000+1. Then, a for loop iterates from 2 to N. Inside the loop, a temporary variable tmp is initialized with the current value of i.
Then, another for loop iterates through each prime number in the list primes. Inside this loop, a while loop checks if tmp is greater than 0 and divisible by the current prime number p. If it is, tmp is divided by p and the corresponding index in the memo array is incremented by 1.
After the loop finishes, a 2D array dp is initialized with size 1000+2 and 10000+1. The value of dp[2][0] is set to 1.
Then, two nested for loops iterate from 2 to 1000 and from 0 to the value of memo[i] respectively. Inside the inner loop, if the current value of j+1 is less than or equal to the value of memo[i], the value of dp[i][j+1] is incremented by dp[i][j] and then modulo MOD.
After the inner loop finishes, the value of dp[i+1][0] is incremented by dp[i][j] and then modulo MOD.
After the outer loop finishes, the value of dp[1001][0] is printed as the output.
