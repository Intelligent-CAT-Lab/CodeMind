<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads input from the user using BufferedReader and stores it in the variable 's'. Then it initializes an empty string 't'. 
It then iterates through each character in the input string 's'. For each character, it checks if it is a lowercase letter (ASCII value between 97 and 123). 
If it is a lowercase letter, it converts it to uppercase by subtracting 32 from its ASCII value and appends it to the string 't'. 
If it is not a lowercase letter, it appends the character as it is to the string 't'. 
Finally, it prints the string 't' as the output.
In this case, the input string is "this is a pen.". 
The code will convert all lowercase letters to uppercase and print the output as "THIS IS A PEN.".
<<<Output>>>
THIS IS A PEN.
