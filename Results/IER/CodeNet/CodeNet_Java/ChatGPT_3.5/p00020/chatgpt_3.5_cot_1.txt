<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads input from the user using BufferedReader and stores it in the variable 's'. It then initializes an empty string 't'. 
The code then enters a while loop which continues until the input is not null. Inside the loop, it iterates through each character of the input string 's' using a for loop. 
For each character, it checks if it is a lowercase letter (ASCII value between 97 and 123). If it is, it converts it to uppercase by subtracting 32 from its ASCII value and appends it to the string 't'. 
If the character is not a lowercase letter, it appends it to 't' as it is. 
Finally, it prints the string 't' which contains the converted input string with all lowercase letters converted to uppercase.
<<<Output>>>
THIS IS A PEN.
