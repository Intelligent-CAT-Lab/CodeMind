<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes 5 integers as input: W, H, x, y, and r. It checks if the point (x, y) lies inside a rectangle with width W and height H, and with a circle of radius r inscribed inside it. 

The code checks if the following conditions are true:
1. r <= x <= (W - r) - This checks if the x-coordinate of the point lies within the rectangle, considering the radius of the circle.
2. r <= y <= (H - r) - This checks if the y-coordinate of the point lies within the rectangle, considering the radius of the circle.

If both conditions are true, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".

In this case, the input values are W=5, H=4, x=2, y=2, and r=1. 

The conditions are true because:
1. 1 <= 2 <= (5 - 1) - This is true because 2 lies between 1 and 4.
2. 1 <= 2 <= (4 - 1) - This is true because 2 lies between 1 and 3.

Therefore, the output will be "Yes".
