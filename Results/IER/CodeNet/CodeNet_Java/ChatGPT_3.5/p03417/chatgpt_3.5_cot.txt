<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two long integers N and M from the input. It then calculates the absolute value of (N-2) multiplied by (M-2) and stores the result in a variable. Finally, it prints the value of the variable as the output.

In this case, the input is "2 2". So, N will be assigned the value 2 and M will also be assigned the value 2. The code then calculates the value of (N-2) * (M-2), which is equal to 0. Finally, it prints the value 0 as the output.

<<<Output>>>
0
