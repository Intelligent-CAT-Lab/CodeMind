<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two long integers N and M from the input. It then calculates the absolute value of (N-2) multiplied by (M-2) and stores the result in a variable. Finally, it prints the value of the variable as the output.

In this case, the input is "2 2". So, N will be 2 and M will also be 2. The code then calculates (2-2) * (2-2) which is 0. Since the absolute value of 0 is also 0, the output will be 0.

<<<Output>>>
