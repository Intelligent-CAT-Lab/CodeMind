The variable l is initialized with 4 according to the input. Then it subtracts 1 from l and stores the result in l itself. So, l becomes 3.
Then it initializes cnum with the value of l and cval with 1.
Then it initializes m with 0 and n with 2.
Then it enters a while loop which runs until cnum becomes 0.
Inside the while loop, it subtracts cval from cnum and checks if cval*2 is less than or equal to cnum. If it is, then it multiplies cval by 2 and increments n by 1. Otherwise, it breaks out of the loop.
After the while loop, it initializes an empty list called ans.
Then it initializes cn with 1 and nn with 2.
Then it enters a for loop which runs until i becomes less than or equal to 1.
Inside the for loop, it adds a string to the ans list in the format "cn nn i" and "cn nn 0". Then it increments m by 2 and cn and nn by 1.
After the for loop, it initializes lv with 2*cval-1.
Then it enters a while loop which runs until lv becomes greater than or equal to l.
Inside the while loop, it initializes nlv with lv+1.
Then it initializes i with n and j with 1.
Then it enters a while loop which runs until 2*j-1+nlv becomes greater than l.
Inside the while loop, it decrements i by 1 and multiplies j by 2.
After the while loop, it divides j by 2.
Then it adds a string to the ans list in the format "1 i nlv" and increments m by 1.
Then it checks if j is greater than 0. If it is, then it assigns lv with nlv+2*j-1. Otherwise, it assigns lv with nlv.
After the while loop, it prints the values of n and m.
Then it enters a for loop which runs for each string in the ans list.
Inside the for loop, it prints the string.
Finally, it closes the output writer.
