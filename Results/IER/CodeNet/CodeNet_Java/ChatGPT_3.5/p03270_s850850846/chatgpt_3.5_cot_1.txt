<<<Analysis>>>
The variable K and variable N are initialized with 3 and 3 respectively according to the input.
Then it creates a PrintWriter object to print the output.
It calls the solve() method to calculate the values of the array ans.
Inside the solve() method, it initializes the FermatCombination object fc and a 2D array COMB.
Then it initializes an array ans with size 2*K+1.
It enters a for loop and iterates from 2 to 2*K.
Inside the for loop, it checks if i is less than or equal to K+1. If it is, it calls the calc() method passing i as an argument and assigns the returned value to ans[i].
Otherwise, it assigns ans[i] with ans[2*(K+1)-i].
After the for loop finishes, it returns the array ans.
Finally, it prints the values of ans from index 2 to 2*K using the PrintWriter object pw.
