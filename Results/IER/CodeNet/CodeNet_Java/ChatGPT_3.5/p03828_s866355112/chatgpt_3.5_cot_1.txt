The variable n is initialized with 3 according to the input. The variable mod is initialized with 1000000007. The variable dp is initialized as an array of size n+1.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to n-1 to check each integer i in this range. Inside the loop, it calls the primeFactorize() method passing i as an argument.
The primeFactorize() method is a recursive method that performs prime factorization of the given number num. It starts from 2 and checks if num is divisible by i. If it is, it increments the value of dp[i] by 1 and calls the primeFactorize() method recursively passing num/i as an argument. It then breaks out of the loop.
After the for loop finishes, it calls the primeFactorize() method passing n as an argument.
Then it initializes a variable count with 1. It enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to n. Inside the loop, it checks if the value of dp[i] is not equal to 0. If it is not, it calculates count as count%mod * (dp[i] + 1)%mod. This is done to calculate the count of divisors of n.
Finally, it prints the value of count as output.
