<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 5 according to the input. And variables 高原, 盆地, 山腹, 峰, 窪地 are initialized with 0.
Then it creates an array a with size N and reads N integers from input and stores them in array a.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to N-1 to check each integer i in this range. 
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current element a[i-1] is equal to the next element a[i]. If they are equal, it continues to the next iteration.
If they are not equal, it enters another for loop to find the index k where the consecutive elements in array a are not equal.
Then it checks several conditions based on the values of a[i-1], a[i], a[k], a[k+1] to determine the type of landform.
If a[i-1] > a[i] and a[k] > a[k+1], it increments the variable 山腹.
If a[i-1] < a[i] and a[k] < a[k+1], it increments the variable 山腹.
If a[i-1] > a[i] and a[k] < a[k+1], it increments the variable 盆地 if i < k, otherwise it increments the variable 窪地.
If a[i-1] < a[i] and a[k] > a[k+1], it increments the variable 高原 if i < k, otherwise it increments the variable 峰.
After the loop finishes, it prints the values of variables 高原, 盆地, 山腹, 峰, 窪地 as output.
