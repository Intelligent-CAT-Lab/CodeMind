The variable n is initialized with 10 according to the input.
Inside the while loop, it checks if the square of the current value of n is equal to n. If it is, it prints the value of n and returns from the main method.
In this case, the square of 10 is 100, which is not equal to 10. So it decrements the value of n by 1 and continues the loop.
It keeps decrementing the value of n by 1 in each iteration until it finds a value whose square is equal to n.
The first value that satisfies this condition is 9, because the square of 9 is 81, which is equal to 9.
So the output of the code execution would be 9.
<<<Output>>>
9
