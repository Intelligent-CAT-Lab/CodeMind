<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input and stores them in variables a, b, and c respectively.
Then it creates an array called sum and assigns the values of a, b, and c to the elements of the array.
Next, it uses the Arrays.sort() method to sort the elements of the array in ascending order.
Finally, it prints the sum of the first two elements of the sorted array, which would be the smallest and second smallest numbers among a, b, and c.
In this case, the sorted array would be {600, 700, 780}, so the output would be 600 + 700 = 1300.
<<<Output>>>
1300
