<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads input from the user using a Scanner object. It then initializes an array called "count" with 26 elements, each representing the count of a specific letter in the alphabet. 
The code enters a while loop that continues as long as there is more input to read. Inside the loop, it reads a line of input and converts it to lowercase. It then converts the string to a character array and iterates over each character. 
For each character, it checks if it is a lowercase letter (ASCII value between 97 and 122). If it is, it increments the count of that letter in the "count" array. 
After processing all the input, the code enters a for loop that iterates over the "count" array. It calculates the ASCII value of the corresponding letter and converts it to a character. It then prints the letter and its count.
