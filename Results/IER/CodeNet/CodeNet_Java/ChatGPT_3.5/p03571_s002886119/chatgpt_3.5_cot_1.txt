<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four integers as input: a, b, c, and d. It then calls the solve method passing these four integers as arguments.
Inside the solve method, it calculates the result by calling the solve2 method and adding the result to the solve2 method called with different arguments.
The solve2 method calculates the answer by iterating through a set of events and calculating the area and count based on the events.
Finally, the solve method returns the result modulo 1000000007.
The solve method is called inside the solve method and the result is printed as output.
