<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, k and n. It then creates an instance of the Solver class with k and n as parameters and calls the solve() method of the Solver class. The solve() method determines the type of solution based on the value of k and returns a list of integers as the result. The result is then printed one by one in the main method.
In this case, k = 3 and n = 2. The Solver class determines that k is odd and calls the solveKOdd() method. In the solveKOdd() method, an array of size n is created and filled with the value (k + 1) / 2, which is 2. Then, the decrement() method is called n/2 times to decrement the values in the array. The decrement() method finds the rightmost index i in the array where the value is greater than 1 and decrements it. If the value at index i is 1, it decrements it and returns. The values after index i are set to k. After the decrement() method is called n/2 times, the values in the array are added to a list called answers. Finally, the list answers is returned as the result.
In this case, the list answers will contain the values 2 and 2.
