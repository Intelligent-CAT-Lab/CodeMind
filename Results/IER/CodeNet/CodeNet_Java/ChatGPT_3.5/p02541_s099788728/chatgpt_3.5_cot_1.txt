<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input `n` and calculates the minimum value of `k` such that the sum of integers from 1 to `k` is a multiple of `n`. It does this by finding the divisors of `2n` and for each divisor `a`, calculating the value of `b = 2n/a`. It then uses the extended Euclidean algorithm to find the values of `x` and `y` such that `ax + by = gcd(a, b)`. If `x` and `y` are both non-zero and `gcd(a, b) = 1`, it checks if `y` is negative and updates the answer with the minimum value of `-b*y`. Finally, it prints the answer.

In this case, the input `n` is 11. The code first checks if `n` is equal to 1, which is not the case. It then finds the divisors of `2n = 22`, which are [1, 2, 11, 22]. For each divisor `a`, it calculates `b = 2n/a`. 

For `a = 1`, `b = 22` and the extended Euclidean algorithm gives `x = 1` and `y = -5`. Since `gcd(a, b) = 1` and `y` is negative, the answer is updated to `-b*y = -22*(-5) = 110`.

For `a = 2`, `b = 11` and the extended Euclidean algorithm gives `x = 1` and `y = 1`. Since `gcd(a, b) = 1` and `y` is not negative, the answer is not updated.

For `a = 11`, `b = 2` and the extended Euclidean algorithm gives `x = 1` and `y = 0`. Since `gcd(a, b) = 1` and `y` is not negative, the answer is not updated.

For `a = 22`, `b = 1` and the extended Euclidean algorithm gives `x = 1` and `y = 0`. Since `gcd(a, b) = 1` and `y` is not negative, the answer is not updated.

The final answer is 110, which is the output.
