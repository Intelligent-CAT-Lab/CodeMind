<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers A, B, and C as input using the Scanner class.
It then checks two conditions:
1. If A is equal to B and B is equal to C, or
2. If A is not equal to B, A is not equal to C, and B is not equal to C.
If either of these conditions is true, it prints "No". Otherwise, it prints "Yes".
In this case, A = 5, B = 7, and C = 5. Since A is not equal to B and A is equal to C, the first condition is false. Therefore, the code will print "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
