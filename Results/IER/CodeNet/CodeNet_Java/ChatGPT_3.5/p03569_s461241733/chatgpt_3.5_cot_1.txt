<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string as input and passes it to the `help` method. 
Inside the `help` method, it initializes variables `s` and `f` to 0 and the length of the string minus 1 respectively. It also initializes `count` to 0.
Then it converts the string to a character array.
It enters a while loop which continues until `f` is greater than `s`.
Inside the loop, it checks if the characters at positions `f` and `s` are equal. If they are, it increments `s` and decrements `f`.
If the characters are not equal and neither of them is 'x', it returns -1.
If the character at position `f` is 'x', it increments `count` and decrements `f`.
If the character at position `s` is 'x', it increments `count` and increments `s`.
After the loop finishes, it returns the value of `count`.
