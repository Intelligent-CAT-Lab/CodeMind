<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 4 and variable K is initialized with 2 according to the input.
It calls the divisors() method passing N as an argument, which returns an ArrayList of divisors of N.
It initializes an array num[] with the size of the divisor ArrayList.
It enters a for loop and iterates through each divisor in the divisor ArrayList.
Inside the loop, it calculates num[i] by calling the pow() method passing K and (divisor.get(i)+1)/2 as arguments.
Then it enters another for loop and iterates through each divisor before the current divisor.
Inside this loop, it checks if the current divisor is divisible by the divisor at index j.
If it is divisible, it subtracts num[j] from num[i].
After the inner loop finishes, it checks if num[i] is negative and adds MOD to it until it becomes positive.
It adds num[i] to tmpSum and takes the modulo of tmpSum with MOD.
After the outer loop finishes, it initializes ans to 0.
It enters another for loop and iterates through each divisor in the divisor ArrayList.
Inside this loop, it checks if the current divisor is even or odd.
If it is even, it adds num[i]*d/2 to ans.
If it is odd, it adds num[i]*d to ans.
Finally, it takes the modulo of ans with MOD and prints it as the output.
