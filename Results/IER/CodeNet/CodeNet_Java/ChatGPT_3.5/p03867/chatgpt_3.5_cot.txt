<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers N and K as input. It then calculates the divisors of N and stores them in an ArrayList called "divisor". 
It initializes an array called "num" with the same size as the "divisor" ArrayList. 
Then it iterates over each element in the "divisor" ArrayList and calculates the power of K raised to the power of (divisor.get(i)+1)/2 and stores it in the "num" array at index i. 
It also subtracts the values of "num" at previous indices from the current index if the current divisor is divisible by any previous divisor. 
After that, it calculates the sum of all the elements in the "num" array and stores it in the variable "tmpSum". 
Then it initializes a variable "ans" with 0. 
It iterates over each element in the "divisor" ArrayList and calculates the product of "num" at index i and the divisor at index i. 
If the divisor is even, it multiplies the product by d/2, otherwise, it multiplies the product by d. 
It adds the product to the "ans" variable and takes the modulo with MOD. 
Finally, it prints the value of "ans" as the output.
