<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string and converts it into a character array. It then checks if the length of the array is even or odd. If it is even, it checks if the first and last characters of the array are the same. If they are, it prints "Second", otherwise it prints "First". If the length of the array is odd, it always prints "First" because the first and last characters cannot be the same.

In this case, the input string is "aba". The length of the array is 3, which is odd. Therefore, the output will always be "First".
