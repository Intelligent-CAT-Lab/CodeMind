<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four integers as input: 3, 8, 7, and 1. It adds the first two integers (3 + 8) and assigns the sum to the variable "left". It then adds the next two integers (7 + 1) and assigns the sum to the variable "right". 

Next, it checks if "left" is greater than "right". Since 3 + 8 = 11 and 7 + 1 = 8, "left" is greater than "right". Therefore, it prints "Left" as the output.

<<<Output>>>
