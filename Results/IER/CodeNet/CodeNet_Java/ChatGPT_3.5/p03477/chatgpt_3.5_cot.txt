<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four integers as input: `3`, `8`, `7`, and `1`. It adds the first two integers (`3` and `8`) and assigns the sum to the variable `left`. It then adds the next two integers (`7` and `1`) and assigns the sum to the variable `right`. 

Next, it checks if `left` is greater than `right`. If it is, it prints "Left". Otherwise, it checks if `left` is equal to `right`. If it is, it prints "Balanced". If neither of these conditions is true, it prints "Right".

In this case, `left` is `11` and `right` is `8`, so the condition `left > right` is true. Therefore, the output would be "Left".
