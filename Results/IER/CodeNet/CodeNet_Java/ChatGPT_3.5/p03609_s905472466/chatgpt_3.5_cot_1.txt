<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input using the Scanner class. It subtracts the second integer from the first integer and stores the result in the variable sum. 
Then it checks if the value of sum is less than or equal to 0. If it is, it prints 0. Otherwise, it prints the value of sum.
In this case, the first integer is 100 and the second integer is 17. So, the value of sum would be 100 - 17 = 83.
Since 83 is greater than 0, the code will print 83 as the output.
<<<Output>>>
83
