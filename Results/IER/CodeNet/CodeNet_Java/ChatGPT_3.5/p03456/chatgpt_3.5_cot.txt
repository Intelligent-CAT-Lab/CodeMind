<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs, `s` and `t`, and concatenates them to form a string `mah`. Then it converts `mah` to an integer `a`. It calculates the square root of `a` and assigns it to `b`. If the square of `b` is equal to `a`, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".

In this case, the inputs are `1` and `21`. So `mah` becomes `121` and `a` becomes `121`. The square root of `a` is `11`. Since `11 * 11` is equal to `121`, the output will be "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
