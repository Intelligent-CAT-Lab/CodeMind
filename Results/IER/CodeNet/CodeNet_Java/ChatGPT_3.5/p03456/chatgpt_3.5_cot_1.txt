<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two strings s and t from the input. Then it concatenates the two strings to form a new string mah. It converts mah to an integer and assigns it to variable a. Then it calculates the square root of a and assigns it to variable b. If the square of b is equal to a, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
In this case, s = "1" and t = "21". So mah = "121". The integer value of mah is 121. The square root of 121 is 11. Since 11 * 11 is equal to 121, the output will be "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
