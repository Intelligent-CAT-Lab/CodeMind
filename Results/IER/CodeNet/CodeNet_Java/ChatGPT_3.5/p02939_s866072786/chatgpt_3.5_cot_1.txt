<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string input and initializes a stack to store substrings. It then checks the first two characters of the input string. If they are the same, it combines them into a single substring and pushes it onto the stack. If they are different, it pushes each character as a separate substring onto the stack. 

After that, it iterates through the remaining characters of the input string. If the current character is different from the previous substring, it creates a new substring and pushes it onto the stack. 

Finally, it prints the size of the stack, which represents the number of unique substrings in the input string.

In this case, the input string is "aabbaa". The first two characters are "aa", so it combines them into a single substring and pushes it onto the stack. Then it iterates through the remaining characters: "b", "b", "a". Each of these characters is different from the previous substring, so it creates a new substring and pushes it onto the stack. 

The stack will contain the following substrings: "aa", "b", "b", "a". The size of the stack is 4.
