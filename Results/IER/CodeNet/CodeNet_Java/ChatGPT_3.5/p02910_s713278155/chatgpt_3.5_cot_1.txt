<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string input from the user and assigns it to the variable `s`. It initializes the variable `ans` with the value "Yes". Then it splits the string `s` into an array of characters `ch`.

Next, it enters a for loop that iterates over each character in the `ch` array. Inside the loop, it checks if the index `i` is even and the character at index `i` is either "R", "U", or "D". If this condition is not met, it checks if the index `i` is odd and the character at index `i` is either "L", "U", or "D". If neither of these conditions is met, it updates the value of `ans` to "No".

After the loop finishes, it prints the value of `ans` as the output.

In this case, the string "RUDLUDR" satisfies the conditions in the loop, so the value of `ans` remains "Yes".

<<<Output>>>
Yes
