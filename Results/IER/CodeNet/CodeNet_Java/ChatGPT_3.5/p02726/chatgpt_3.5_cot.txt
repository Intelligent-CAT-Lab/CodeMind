<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n, variable x and variable y are initialized with 5, 2 and 4 respectively according to the input. 
An array edges of size n is initialized to store the count of edges.
Then it enters a nested for loop to iterate over all pairs of indices (i, j) where i < j.
Inside the nested loop, it calculates the value of edge based on the given formula:
edge = min(j-i, min(|x-i|+|j-y|, |y-i|+|j-x|))+1
Then it increments the count of edges[edge].
After the nested loop finishes, it prints the count of edges for each value of edge from 1 to n-1.
