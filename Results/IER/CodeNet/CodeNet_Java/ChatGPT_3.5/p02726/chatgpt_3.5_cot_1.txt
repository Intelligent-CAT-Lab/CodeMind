<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n, variable x and variable y are initialized with 5, 2 and 4 respectively according to the input. 
An array edges of size n is initialized to store the number of edges of each length.
Then, a nested for loop is used to iterate through all possible pairs of indices i and j.
Inside the nested loop, the variable edge is calculated based on the minimum of three values: j-i, the sum of the absolute differences between x and i and y and j, and the sum of the absolute differences between y and i and x and j. The minimum value is then incremented in the edges array.
After the nested loop finishes, a for loop is used to print the values in the edges array, starting from index 1.
