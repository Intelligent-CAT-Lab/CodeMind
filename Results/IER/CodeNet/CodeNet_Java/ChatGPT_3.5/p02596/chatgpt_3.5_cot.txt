<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with the value 101.
The code calculates the length of N and stores it in variable l.
Then it enters a for loop that iterates l times.
In each iteration, it updates the value of m by multiplying it by 10, adding 7, and taking the modulo N.
After the for loop, it initializes a variable i with the value of l.
It also initializes a boolean array vis of size N.
Then it enters a while loop that continues until a break statement is encountered.
Inside the while loop, it checks if the value of vis at index m is true. If it is, it prints -1 and breaks out of the loop.
Otherwise, it sets the value of vis at index m to true.
Then it checks if m is equal to 0. If it is, it prints the value of i and breaks out of the loop.
Otherwise, it updates the value of m by multiplying it by 10, adding 7, and taking the modulo N.
It also increments the value of i by 1.
After the while loop, it closes the input and output streams.
<<<Output>>>
-1
