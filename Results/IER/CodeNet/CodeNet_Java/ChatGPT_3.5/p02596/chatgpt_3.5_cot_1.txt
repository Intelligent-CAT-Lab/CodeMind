<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 101 according to the input. 
It calculates the length of N and stores it in variable l.
Then it enters a for loop and iterates l times. In each iteration, it updates the value of variable m by performing the operation (10 * m + 7) % N.
After the for loop, it initializes variable i with the value of l and creates a boolean array vis of size N.
Then it enters a while loop. In each iteration, it checks if the current value of m has been visited before. If it has, it prints -1 and breaks out of the loop.
Otherwise, it marks the current value of m as visited in the boolean array vis.
Then it checks if the current value of m is 0. If it is, it prints the value of i and breaks out of the loop.
Otherwise, it updates the value of m by performing the operation (10 * m + 7) % N and increments the value of i.
The while loop continues until one of the break conditions is met.
After the loop finishes, it closes the input and output streams.
<<<Output>>>
-1
