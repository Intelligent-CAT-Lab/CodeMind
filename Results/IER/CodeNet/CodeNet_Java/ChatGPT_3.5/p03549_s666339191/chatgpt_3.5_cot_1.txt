<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers n and m as input. It then calculates the output using the formula (1900 * m + 100 * (n - m)) * (1<<m), where << is the left shift operator.
In this case, n = 1 and m = 1. 
So, the output would be (1900 * 1 + 100 * (1 - 1)) * (1<<1) = (1900 + 100 * 0) * (1<<1) = 1900 * 2 = 3800.
<<<Output>>>
3800
