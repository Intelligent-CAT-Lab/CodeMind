<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a line of input and splits it into two strings using the space as a delimiter. The first string is assigned to variable A and the second string is assigned to variable B. 
Then it creates a BigInteger object for A and B.
It multiplies A and B and assigns the result to variable ans.
Finally, it prints the value of ans.
In this case, A is 5 and B is 8, so the product of A and B is 40.
<<<Output>>>
40
