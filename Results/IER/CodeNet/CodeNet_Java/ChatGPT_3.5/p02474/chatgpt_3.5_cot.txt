<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input and stores them in variables A and B respectively. Then it multiplies A and B and stores the result in variable ans. Finally, it prints the value of ans as the output.
In this case, A is 5 and B is 8. So the code will calculate 5 * 8 = 40 and store the result in ans. Then it will print 40 as the output.
<<<Output>>>
40
