The variable n, variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized with 3, 1, 2 and 0 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 1 to check each integer x in this range. The value of variable x is also passed to variable group1.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable restA as a - x, and the value of variable group2 as restA.
Then it calculates the value of variable restC1 as c - restA. If restC1 is less than 0, it breaks the loop.
If b is greater than 0, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to restC1 / 3 to check each integer y in this range. The value of variable y is also passed to variable group3.
Inside the inner for loop, it calculates the value of variable restC2 as restC1 - 3 * y, and the value of variable group4 as b / 2.
Then it calculates the value of variable count as the product of several combinations, and adds it to variable answer.
If b is 0 and restC1 is divisible by 3, it calculates the value of variable group3 as restC1 / 3, and the value of variable count as the product of two combinations, and adds it to variable answer.
After the loop finishes, it print the final value of variable answer as output.
