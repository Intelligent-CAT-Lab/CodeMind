<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four integers as input: n, a, b, and c. It then calls the `solve` method with these input values and returns the result.

Inside the `solve` method, it first checks if b is odd. If it is, it returns 0.

Then, it initializes a `ModCalculator` object with a modulus of 1_000_000_007 and a `ModCombinationCache` object with the `ModCalculator` object.

Next, it initializes a variable `answer` to 0.

Then, it enters a for loop that iterates from `a` to 0. Inside the loop, it calculates the values of `group1`, `group2`, `restA`, and `group3` based on the current value of `x`.

If `restC1` is less than 0, it breaks out of the loop.

If `b` is greater than 0, it enters another for loop that iterates from 0 to `restC1 / 3`. Inside this loop, it calculates the values of `group4` and `restC2` based on the current value of `y`.

Then, it calculates the value of `count` using the `ModCombinationCache` object and the calculated values of `group1`, `group2`, `group3`, and `group4`. It then adds `count` to `answer` using the `ModCalculator` object.

If `b` is 0 and `restC1` is divisible by 3, it calculates the value of `group3` and `count` using the `ModCombinationCache` object and the calculated values of `group1` and `group2`. It then adds `count` to `answer` using the `ModCalculator` object.

Finally, it returns the value of `answer`.

In the `main` method, it reads the input values using the `ContestReader` object, calls the `solve` method with the input values, and prints the result.
