<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input integer and assigns it to variable n. Then it calculates the remainder of n divided by 1000 and assigns it to variable x. 
If x is greater than 0, it subtracts x from 1000 and assigns the result to variable answer. Otherwise, answer remains 0.
Finally, it prints the value of answer as output.
In this case, the input is 1900. The remainder of 1900 divided by 1000 is 900. So, x is 900. 
Since x is greater than 0, answer is calculated as 1000 - 900, which is 100.
<<<Output>>>
100
