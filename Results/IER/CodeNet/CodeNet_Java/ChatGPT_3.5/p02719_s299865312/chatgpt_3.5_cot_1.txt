<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and variable k are initialized with 7 and 4 respectively according to the input. And variable ans is initialized with n and variable num is initialized with n % k.
It enters a while loop with condition true. Inside the loop, it calculates the absolute value of num and assigns it to variable num2. Then it compares the value of num2 with ans and assigns the smaller value to ans.
If num is less than 0, it breaks out of the loop. Otherwise, it subtracts k from num.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of ans as output.
In this case, the loop will only run once because num is initially positive. So the output will be 3.
