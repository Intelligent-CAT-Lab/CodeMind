The variable n is initialized with 3 according to the input. 
It checks if n is equal to 0 or 1. If it is, it prints 1 as output.
Otherwise, it subtracts 2 from n and assigns the result to n.
Then it calculates the power of matrix A ({{1,1},{1,0}}) to the power of n+1 using the Power() method.
Finally, it prints the sum of the elements in the first row of matrix E as output.
