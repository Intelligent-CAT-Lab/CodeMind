<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and variable K are initialized with 3 and 3 respectively according to the input. And variable ans is initialized with 0.
It enters a block of code where it initializes an array dp of size K with all elements as 0. Then it sets dp[0] to 1.
Then it enters a for loop which iterates from 0 to n-1. Inside the loop, it initializes a new array ndp of size K with all elements as 0.
Then it enters another for loop which iterates from 0 to K-1. Inside this loop, it enters another for loop which iterates from 0 to 2 and checks if j+k is less than K.
Inside this nested loop, it adds dp[j] to ndp[j+k] and takes the modulo of ndp[j+k] with mod.
After the nested loop finishes, it assigns ndp to dp.
After the outer loop finishes, it enters a for-each loop which iterates over each element v in dp and adds v to ans.
Then it enters another block of code.
Inside this block, it initializes a 2D array fif using the method enumFIF with parameters 10000 and mod.
Then it enters a for loop which iterates from K+1 to 2*K-1 with a step of 2. Inside this loop, it initializes a variable u with s-K. If u is odd, it increments u by 1.
Then it initializes a variable two with u/2 + (s-(K-1))/2.
Then it enters another for loop which iterates from (s-two*2+1)/2 to s-two*2. Inside this loop, it adds C(i, s-two*2-i, mod, fif) * C(n, i+two, mod, fif) to ans and takes the modulo of ans with mod.
After the loop finishes, it checks if K is odd. If it is, it adds pow(2, n, mod) to ans.
Then it enters another block of code.
Inside this block, it initializes an array dp of size K with all elements as 0. Then it sets dp[0] to 1.
Then it enters a for loop which iterates from 0 to n-1. Inside the loop, it initializes a new array ndp of size K with all elements as 0.
Then it enters another for loop which iterates from 0 to K-1. Inside this loop, it enters another for loop which iterates from 0 to 1 and checks if j+k is less than K.
Inside this nested loop, it adds dp[j] to ndp[j+k] and takes the modulo of ndp[j+k] with mod.
After the nested loop finishes, it assigns ndp to dp.
After the outer loop finishes, it enters a for-each loop which iterates over each element v in dp and subtracts v from ans.
After the block of code finishes, it takes the modulo of ans with mod.
Then it checks if ans is less than 0 and adds mod to ans if it is.
Finally, it prints the value of ans.
