<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and variable K are initialized with 3 and 3 respectively according to the input. And variable ans is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to n-1 to calculate the value of dp array. The value of dp array is calculated based on the previous value of dp array.
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from K+1 to 2*K-1 to calculate the value of ans. The value of ans is calculated based on the values of dp array and the combination of numbers.
After the loop finishes, it calculates the modulo of ans and prints it as output.
