<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input: a, b, and c. It then initializes an empty string variable called ans.
The code checks if a is greater than both b and c. If it is, it assigns "A" to ans.
The code then checks if b is greater than both a and c. If it is, it assigns "B" to ans.
Finally, the code checks if c is greater than both a and b. If it is, it assigns "C" to ans.
The code then prints the value of ans as the output.

In this case, a = 1000, b = 900, and c = 850. Since a is greater than both b and c, ans will be assigned "A".
Therefore, the output will be "A".
<<<Output>>>
A
