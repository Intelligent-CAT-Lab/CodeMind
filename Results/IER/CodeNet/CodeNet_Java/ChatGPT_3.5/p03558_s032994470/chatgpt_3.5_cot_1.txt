<<<Analysis>>>
The variable k is initialized with 6 according to the input. Then an array of Vertex objects is created with size k. Each element in the array is initialized with a new Vertex object with value i.
Then a for loop is used to set the edges of each vertex. For each vertex, it sets two edges: one to the vertex at index (i * 10) % k and another to the vertex at index (i + 1) % k.
After setting the edges, it calls the dijkstra method of the Search class with the start vertex at index 1 and the goal vertex at index 0.
In the dijkstra method, it initializes a map called minCost to store the minimum cost to reach each vertex. It sets the cost of the start vertex to 1.
Then it creates a priority queue called q to store pairs of vertices and costs. The queue is ordered by cost in ascending order. It adds a pair of the start vertex and its cost to the queue.
It also creates a set called visited to store the visited vertices.
Then it enters a while loop that continues until the queue is empty. In each iteration, it removes the pair with the smallest cost from the queue.
If the cost of the current vertex is greater than the minimum cost stored in the map, it means that a shorter path to this vertex has already been found, so it ignores this vertex and continues to the next iteration.
If the current vertex is the goal vertex, it returns the minimum cost to reach this vertex.
Otherwise, it adds the current vertex to the visited set and iterates through its connected edges.
For each connected edge, it checks if the next vertex has already been visited. If it has, it continues to the next iteration.
It calculates the cost to reach the next vertex by adding the cost of the current edge to the current cost.
If the new cost is smaller than the minimum cost stored in the map for the next vertex, it updates the minimum cost and adds the next vertex to the queue.
After the while loop finishes, it returns -1, indicating that no path was found.
