<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read input from the user. It then reads an integer value X from the user.
If X is equal to 2, it prints "2" and returns, exiting the program.
If X is an even number, it increments X by 1.
Then, it enters a while loop that continues until the check(X) method returns true.
Inside the while loop, it checks if X is a prime number by iterating from 3 to the square root of X and checking if X is divisible by any of these numbers. If X is divisible by any number, it returns false.
If the check(X) method returns true, it prints the value of X and exits the program.
In this case, X is 20, which is an even number. So, it increments X by 1 to make it 21.
Then, it enters the while loop and checks if 21 is a prime number. Since 21 is divisible by 3, the check(X) method returns false.
Then, it increments X by 2 to make it 23.
Now, it checks if 23 is a prime number. Since 23 is not divisible by any number from 3 to the square root of 23, the check(X) method returns true.
Finally, it prints the value of X, which is 23.
<<<Output>>>
23
