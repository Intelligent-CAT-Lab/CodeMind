The variable M, N, m0, md, n0, and nd are initialized with 2, 3, 1, 3, 1, and 0 respectively according to the input. 
Then, two arrays m and n are initialized with size M and N respectively. The first element of m is set to m0 and the first element of n is set to n0.
Then, two for loops are used to fill the arrays m and n with values based on the formulas given. The values are calculated using the previous element in the array and the values of md and nd.
After that, the arrays m and n are sorted using the sort method.
Next, two accumulative arrays accumM and accumN are created. These arrays store the cumulative sum of the elements in the arrays m and n respectively.
Then, a loop is used to calculate the minimum sum by iterating through the accumM array and finding the minimum sum based on the current element in accumM and accumN arrays.
Finally, the minimum sum is printed as the output.
