<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers l and r from the input. It then calculates the length of the binary representation of r and stores it in the variable n. It initializes a 4-dimensional array dp with dimensions [n+1][2][2][2] and initializes all elements to 1. 

Then it enters a nested for loop that iterates over the values of x, y, and msb. It checks if x is 1 or if the i-th bit of l is 0. If either condition is true, it adds the value of dp[i-1][x][y | getBit(r, i-1)][msb] to dp[i][x][y][msb]. It then checks if y is 1 or if the i-th bit of r is 1. If either condition is true, it adds the value of dp[i-1][x | (1-getBit(l, i-1))][y][1] to dp[i][x][y][msb]. Finally, it checks if x is 1 or if the i-th bit of l is 0, if y is 1 or if the i-th bit of r is 1, and if msb is 1. If all conditions are true, it adds the value of dp[i-1][x][y][1] to dp[i][x][y][msb].

After the nested for loop, it prints the value of dp[n][0][0][0].
