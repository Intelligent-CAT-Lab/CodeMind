<<<Analysis>>>
The variable b is initialized with 2 and variable w is initialized with 1 according to the input.
Then it creates an instance of ModMath class and initializes the variables exp and fact with the exponentiation and factorial objects respectively.
Then it initializes the variables p and q with 0.
Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to b+w. In each iteration, it calculates the value of (1 - p + q + MOD) % MOD * exp.pow(-1) % MOD and prints it.
Then it updates the values of p and q by adding the calculated values of fact.ncr(i - 1, b - 1) * exp.pow(-i) % MOD to p and q respectively.
After the loop finishes, the program ends.
