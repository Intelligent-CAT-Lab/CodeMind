<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integer inputs N, A, and B using the Scanner class.
It initializes the variable ans to 0.
Then it enters a for loop that iterates from 1 to N.
Inside the loop, it initializes the variable sum to 0.
Then it enters another for loop that calculates the sum of the digits of the current integer i.
It repeatedly divides i by 10 and adds the remainder to the sum.
After calculating the sum, it checks if it falls within the range [A, B].
If it does, it adds the current integer i to the variable ans.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of ans as the output.
In this case, the output would be 84.
<<<Output>>>
