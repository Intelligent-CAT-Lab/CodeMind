<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input: a, b, and c. It then checks the following conditions:
1. If a is less than b, it checks if b is less than c. If this condition is true, it prints "C".
2. If the first condition is false, it checks if a is less than c. If this condition is true, it prints "C".
3. If both conditions are false, it prints "A".

In this case, the values of a, b, and c are 1000, 900, and 850 respectively. The first condition is false because a is not less than b. The second condition is also false because a is not less than c. Therefore, the code prints "A" as the output.
