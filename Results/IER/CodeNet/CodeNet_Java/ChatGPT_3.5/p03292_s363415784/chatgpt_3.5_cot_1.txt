<<<Analysis>>>
The code first creates an array of size 3 to store the input values. Then it enters a for loop to read the input values and store them in the array. In this case, the input values are 1, 6, and 3.

After reading the input values, the code sorts the array in ascending order using the Arrays.sort() method. So the array becomes [1, 3, 6].

Next, the code calculates the absolute difference between the second element of the array (data[1]) and the first element of the array (data[0]). In this case, it is |3 - 1| = 2. Then it adds this difference to the sum variable.

Finally, the code calculates the absolute difference between the second element of the array (data[1]) and the third element of the array (data[2]). In this case, it is |3 - 6| = 3. Then it adds this difference to the sum variable.

The final value of the sum variable is printed as the output, which is 2 + 3 = 5.
