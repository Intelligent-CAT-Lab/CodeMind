<<<Analysis>>>
The variable K, variable A and variable B are initialized with 4000, 2000 and 500 respectively according to the input. 
Then the function help() is called with these values and the return value is stored in variable ans.
Inside the help() function, it first checks if A is less than or equal to B. If it is, then it checks if A is greater than or equal to K. If it is, then it returns 1. Otherwise, it returns -1.
If A is not less than or equal to B, it checks if A is greater than or equal to K. If it is, then it returns 1.
If none of the above conditions are met, it calculates the difference between A and B and stores it in variable dif.
Then it calculates the number of times dif can be subtracted from (K-A) and stores it in variable t. If there is a remainder after the division, it adds 1 to t.
Finally, it returns 2*t+1 as the output.
In the main function, it prints the value of ans as the final output.
