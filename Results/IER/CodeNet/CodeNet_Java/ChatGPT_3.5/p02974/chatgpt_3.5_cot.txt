<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers n and K as input. It checks if K is odd, if it is, it prints 0 and returns. Otherwise, it initializes a 2D array dp with dimensions (n+1) x (2*n*n+1). It sets dp[0][n*n] to 1.
Then it enters a for loop from i=1 to n. Inside the loop, it initializes a new 2D array ndp with the same dimensions as dp.
Then it iterates through each element of dp and performs the following operations:
1. If j+1 <= n and k-i >= 0, it adds dp[j][k] to ndp[j+1][k-i].
2. If j-1 >= 0 and k+i <= 2*n*n, it adds dp[j][k] * j * j to ndp[j-1][k+i].
3. It adds dp[j][k] * 2 * j to ndp[j][k].
4. It adds dp[j][k] to ndp[j][k].
After the loop finishes, it prints dp[0][K/2+n*n].
