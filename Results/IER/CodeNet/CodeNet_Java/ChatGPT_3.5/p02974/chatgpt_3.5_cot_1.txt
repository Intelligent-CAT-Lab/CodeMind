<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 3 and variable K is initialized with 2 according to the input. It checks if K is odd, if it is, it prints 0 and returns. In this case, K is even, so it continues to execute the code.
It initializes a 2D array dp with size (n+1) * (2*n*n+1) and sets dp[0][n*n] to 1.
Then it enters a for loop from i = 1 to n.
Inside the for loop, it initializes a new 2D array ndp with the same size as dp.
Then it enters three nested for loops to iterate through each element in dp.
Inside the nested for loops, it checks if dp[j][k] is not 0. If it is 0, it continues to the next iteration.
It adds the source to ndp by incrementing ndp[j+1][k-i] by dp[j][k]. It also takes the modulo of ndp[j+1][k-i] with mod.
It adds the sink or local sink to ndp by incrementing ndp[j-1][k+i] by dp[j][k] * j * j. It also takes the modulo of ndp[j-1][k+i] with mod.
It adds the intermediate point to ndp by incrementing ndp[j][k] by dp[j][k] * 2 * j. It also takes the modulo of ndp[j][k] with mod.
It adds the isolated point to ndp by incrementing ndp[j][k] by dp[j][k]. It also takes the modulo of ndp[j][k] with mod.
After the nested for loops finish, it assigns ndp to dp.
After the for loop finishes, it prints dp[0][K/2+n*n] as output.
In this case, dp[0][2/2+3*3] = dp[0][5] = 0.
