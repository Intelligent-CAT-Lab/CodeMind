<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a BigDecimal variable totalDebt with a value of 100000.
Then it takes an input from the user using the Scanner class and stores it in the variable term.
After that, it enters a for loop that iterates term number of times.
Inside the loop, it multiplies the totalDebt by 1.05 and sets the scale to -3 with rounding up using the setScale() method of the BigDecimal class.
Finally, it prints the long value of totalDebt using the longValue() method and closes the Scanner object.
In this case, the term is 5, so the loop will run 5 times.
The totalDebt will be multiplied by 1.05 and rounded up to the nearest thousand after each iteration.
<<<Output>>>
105000
