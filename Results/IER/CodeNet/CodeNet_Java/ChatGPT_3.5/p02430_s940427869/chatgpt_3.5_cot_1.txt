<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and variable k are initialized with 5 and 3 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2^n - 1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable temp.
Inside the for loop, it initializes an array bitArray with size n and initializes variable count with 0.
Then it calculates the binary representation of the current integer temp by repeatedly dividing it by 2 and storing the remainder in bitArray. At the same time, it counts the number of 1s in the binary representation and stores it in count.
If the count is equal to k, it prints the current integer i followed by the indices of the 1s in bitArray.
After the loop finishes, it prints a new line if count is equal to k.
