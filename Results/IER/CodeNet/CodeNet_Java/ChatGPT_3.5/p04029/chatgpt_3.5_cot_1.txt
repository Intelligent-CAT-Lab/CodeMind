<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes the variable sum with 0. Then it takes an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable n. 
After that, it enters a for loop that iterates from 1 to n. In each iteration, it adds the value of i to the variable sum.
Finally, it prints the value of sum as the output.
In this case, the input is 3. So, the loop will iterate 3 times and add the values 1, 2, and 3 to the sum. Therefore, the output will be 6.
<<<Output>>>
6
