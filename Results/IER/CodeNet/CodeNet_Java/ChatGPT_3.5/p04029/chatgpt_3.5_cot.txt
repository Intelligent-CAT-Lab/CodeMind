<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input from the user and stores it in the variable n. It then initializes the variable sum with 0. 
Next, it enters a for loop that iterates from 1 to n. In each iteration, it adds the value of i to the variable sum.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of sum as the output.
In this case, the input is 3. So, the loop will iterate 3 times and add the values 1, 2, and 3 to the sum. Therefore, the output will be 6.
<<<Output>>>
6
