<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 8 and variable A is initialized with 1 according to the input. The variable ret is initialized with n.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 40 to check each integer dep in this range. The value of variable dep is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable num based on the value of dep and base. It also calculates the value of variable plus based on the value of base, me and en.
Then it checks if the value of variable n is less than or equal to the value of variable m plus the value of variable plus. If it is, it calculates the value of variable ret based on the value of variable num and variable A.
After the loop finishes, it print the final value of variable ret as output.
<<<Output>>>
8
