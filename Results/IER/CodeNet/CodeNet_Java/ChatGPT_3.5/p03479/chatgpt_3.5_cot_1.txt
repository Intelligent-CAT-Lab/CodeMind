<<<Analysis>>>
The variable x and variable y are initialized with 3 and 20 respectively according to the input. And variable ans is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from x to y with a step size of i*2. In each iteration, it increments the value of ans by 1.
The loop will run for 4 iterations because the values of i will be 3, 6, 12 and 24. After the loop finishes, it print the final value of variable ans as output, which is 4.
<<<Output>>>
4
