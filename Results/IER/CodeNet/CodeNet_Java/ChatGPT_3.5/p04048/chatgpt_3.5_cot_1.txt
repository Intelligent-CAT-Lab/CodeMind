<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n, variable x and variable sum are initialized with 5, 2 and 0 respectively according to the input.
It checks if x is equal to n - x. If it is, it calculates the sum as 3 * x and prints the sum as output, which is 6.
If x is not equal to n - x, it checks if x is greater than n - x. If it is, it calculates the sum as x + n - x and calls the calc() method with parameters x, n - x and false.
If x is less than n - x, it calculates the sum as x + n - x and calls the calc() method with parameters x, n - x and false.
Inside the calc() method, it checks if x is divisible by y. If it is, it calculates the sum as y if it is the first call, and then adds (x / y * 2 - 1) * y to the sum. It returns the sum.
If x is not divisible by y, it calculates the sum as y if it is the first call, and then adds (x / y * 2) * y to the sum. It also calls the calc() method recursively with parameters y and x % y.
Finally, it prints the sum as output.
