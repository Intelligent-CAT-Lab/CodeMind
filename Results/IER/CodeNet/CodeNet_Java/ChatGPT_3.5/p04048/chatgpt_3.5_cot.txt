<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two long integers as input, n and x. It then checks if x is equal to n - x. If it is, it calculates the sum as 3 * x and returns the sum.
If x is not equal to n - x, it checks if x is greater than n - x. If it is, it calculates the sum as x + (n - x) and calls the calc() function with parameters x, n - x, and false. 
If x is less than n - x, it calculates the sum as x + (n - x) and calls the calc() function with parameters x, n - x, and false.
The calc() function calculates the sum based on the values of x and y. If x is divisible by y, it calculates the sum as y + (x / y * 2 - 1) * y and returns the sum.
If x is not divisible by y, it calculates the sum as y + (x / y * 2) * y and calls the calc() function recursively with parameters y and x % y.
The final sum is printed as the output.
