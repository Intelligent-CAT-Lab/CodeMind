<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 3 and variable M is initialized with 14 according to the input.
A TreeSet object x is created to store integers in sorted order.
Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to sqrt(M) to check each integer i in this range. 
Inside the for loop, it checks if M is divisible by i. If it is, it adds i and M/i to the TreeSet x.
After the loop finishes, it prints the result of M divided by the smallest element in x that is greater than or equal to N.
In this case, the smallest element in x that is greater than or equal to N is 7, so the output would be 14/7 = 2.
