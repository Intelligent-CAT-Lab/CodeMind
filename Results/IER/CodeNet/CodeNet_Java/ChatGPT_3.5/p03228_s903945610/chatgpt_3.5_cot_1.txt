<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integer inputs A, B, and K. It then enters a for loop that iterates from 1 to K/2. Inside the loop, it performs the following operations:
1. A = A/2
2. B = (A + B)/2
3. A = A + B

After the loop, it checks if K is odd (K%2 == 1). If it is, it performs the following operation:
1. A = A/2
2. B = A + B

Finally, it prints the values of A and B.

For the given input (5 4 2), the code will perform the following steps:
1. A = 5/2 = 2
2. B = (2 + 4)/2 = 3
3. A = 2 + 3 = 5

Since K = 2, the loop will not execute again.

The final values of A and B are 5 and 3 respectively.

<<<Output>>>
5 3
