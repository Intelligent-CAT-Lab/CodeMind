<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes an array of size 3 to store the input values. It then uses a for loop to read the input values from the scanner and store them in the array. The input values are 4, 5, and 3. 
After reading the input values, the code uses the Arrays.sort() method to sort the array in ascending order. 
Finally, the code prints the first and last elements of the sorted array, separated by a space. In this case, the first element is 3 and the last element is 5, so the output will be "3 5".
<<<Output>>>
3 5
