<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers n and m as input. It then checks if n is even or odd. If n is even, it prints 0 followed by n/2 zeros and then n/2 times the value of m. If n is odd, it prints 0 followed by n/2 zeros and then n/2 times the value of m. Finally, it prints a new line character.

In this case, n = 3 and m = 100. Since n is odd, it will print 0 followed by n/2 zeros (i.e., 0) and then n/2 times the value of m (i.e., 100). So the output will be "0 0 100".

0 0 100
