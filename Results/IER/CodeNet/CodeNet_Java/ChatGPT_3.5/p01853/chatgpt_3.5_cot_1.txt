<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers n and m from the input. It then checks if n is even or odd. If n is even, it prints 0 followed by n/2 zeros and n/2 times the value of m. If n is odd, it prints 0 followed by n/2 zeros and n/2 times the value of m. Finally, it prints a new line character.

In this case, n = 3 and m = 100. Since n is odd, it will print 0 followed by n/2 zeros (which is 1 zero) and n/2 times the value of m (which is 1 time the value of m). Therefore, the output will be "0 0 100".

<<<Output>>>
0 0 100
