<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads an integer input `n` and performs some calculations to determine the output. 

First, it calculates `ans` which is the result of dividing `n` by 1.08. 

Then, it calculates `ans1` which is the largest integer less than or equal to `ans` multiplied by 1.08. 

Next, it calculates `ans2` which is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `ans` multiplied by 1.08. 

Finally, it checks if `n` is equal to `ans1` or `ans2`. If it is, it prints `ans1` or `ans2` respectively. Otherwise, it prints `:(`.

In this case, `n` is 432. 

`ans` is calculated as 400.0. 

`ans1` is calculated as 432.0. 

`ans2` is calculated as 466.56. 

Since `n` is equal to `ans1`, the output will be 432.
