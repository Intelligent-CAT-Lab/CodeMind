The code takes three integers as input: n, a, and b. It then calls the solve method with these input values. The solve method takes three integers as input: n, a, and b. It then calls the solveSub method with these input values. The solveSub method takes three integers as input: n, a, and b. It checks if n is equal to 1. If it is, it checks if a is not equal to b. If it is not, it returns a list containing a and b. If it is, it returns null. If n is not equal to 1, it enters a for loop that iterates from 0 to n-1. Inside the loop, it checks if the i-th bit of a is not equal to the i-th bit of b. If it is not, it drops the i-th bit from a and b using the dropBit method. It then sets c to the complement of the i-th bit of a. It calls the solveSub method recursively with n-1, aDash, and c as input values and stores the result in path1. It also calls the solveSub method recursively with n-1, c, and bDash as input values and stores the result in path2. If both path1 and path2 are not null, it creates a new list called path. It iterates over each value in path1 and inserts the i-th bit of a at the i-th position using the insertBit method. It also iterates over each value in path2 and inserts the i-th bit of b at the i-th position using the insertBit method. It returns the path list. If either path1 or path2 is null, it returns null. If the for loop finishes without finding a difference between a and b, it returns null. The solve method checks if the path list is null. If it is, it returns a list containing "NO". If it is not, it creates a StringBuffer called sb and appends the first value in the path list. It then iterates over the remaining values in the path list and appends them to sb with a space in between. It returns a list containing "YES" and sb.toString(). The execute method takes input values from the reader and calls the solve method with these input values. It then prints each line in the result list. The main method creates a ContestReader object and a PrintWriter object. It calls the execute method with the ContestReader object and the PrintWriter object as input values. It then flushes the PrintWriter object.
