<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input N. It initializes an array cnt of size N+1 with all elements as 0. 
Then it iterates from 2 to N and for each number i, it checks if it is a prime number by iterating from 2 to the square root of i. 
If i is divisible by j, it increments the count of j in the cnt array and divides i by j. 
After the inner loop, if i is still greater than 1, it means i is a prime number and it increments the count of i in the cnt array. 
Then it calculates the answer by iterating from 2 to N and multiplying the answer with (cnt[i]+1) for each i. 
Finally, it prints the answer modulo 1000000007. 
In this case, the input N is 3. 
The cnt array will have cnt[2]=1 and cnt[3]=1. 
The answer will be (1+1)*(1+1) = 4 modulo 1000000007.
