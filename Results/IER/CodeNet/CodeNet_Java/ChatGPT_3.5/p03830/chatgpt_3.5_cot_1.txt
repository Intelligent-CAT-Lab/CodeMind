The variable N is initialized with 3 according to the input. The variable MOD is initialized with 1000000007. The variable cnt is an array of size N+1 initialized with all elements as 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to N to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable temp.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the prime factorization of the current integer temp. It iterates from 2 to the square root of temp and checks if j is a factor of temp. If it is, it increments the count of factor j in the array cnt and divides temp by j. This process is repeated until temp is no longer divisible by j.
After the inner loop finishes, it checks if temp is greater than 1. If it is, it means that temp is a prime number and it increments the count of factor temp in the array cnt.
After the loop finishes, it initializes the variable ans with 1. It enters another for loop and it iterates from 2 to N. For each integer i, it multiplies ans by (cnt[i]+1) and takes the modulo MOD. This is done to calculate the total number of divisors of N.
Finally, it prints the value of ans as output.
