<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes an array x of size 5 and a variable sum to 0. It then enters a for loop that iterates 5 times. In each iteration, it takes an integer input from the user using the Scanner class and stores it in the corresponding index of the array x. It also adds the input value to the sum variable. After the loop finishes, it subtracts the sum from 15 and prints the result as the output.

In this case, the input values are 0, 2, 3, 4, and 5. The sum of these values is 14. Subtracting 14 from 15 gives the output 1.
