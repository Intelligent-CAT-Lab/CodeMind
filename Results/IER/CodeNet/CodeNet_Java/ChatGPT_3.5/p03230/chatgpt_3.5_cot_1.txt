<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 3 according to the input.
Since n is not equal to 1 or 2, it enters a for loop and iterates from 3 to n.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of ic2, which is i * (i - 1) / 2.
If ic2 is equal to n, it assigns the value of i to variable k and breaks out of the loop.
If ic2 is greater than n, it prints "No" and returns.
After the loop finishes, it prints "Yes" as output.
It initializes a 2D list called ansList with size k.
It initializes an array called target with size k and fills it with values from 0 to k-1.
It calls the combination method with target, 2, and an empty list as parameters.
Inside the combination method, it checks if the size of the list is equal to k.
If it is, it increments the value of v and adds the value of v to the corresponding list in ansList.
If the size of the list is not equal to k, it initializes a variable i with the last element of the list + 1.
If the size of the list plus the length of target minus i is less than k, it returns.
It then enters a for loop and iterates from i to the length of target.
Inside the loop, it adds the value of i to the list, calls the combination method recursively, and then removes the last element from the list.
After the combination method finishes, it prints the value of k as output.
It then enters a for loop and iterates from 0 to k.
Inside the loop, it creates a StringBuilder and appends k-1 to it.
It gets the corresponding list from ansList and appends each element to the StringBuilder.
Finally, it deletes the last character from the StringBuilder and prints it as output.
<<<Output>>>
