<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 3 according to the input.
Since n is equal to 3, it enters the first if condition and prints "Yes" as output.
Then it initializes the ansList as an ArrayList of ArrayLists with size k.
It initializes an array target with size k and fills it with values from 0 to k-1.
It calls the combination method passing the target array, 2 as the value of k, and an empty ArrayList as the list parameter.
Inside the combination method, it checks if the size of the list is equal to k. If it is, it increments the value of v and adds the value of v to the corresponding list in the ansList.
If the size of the list is not equal to k, it initializes the variable i with the value of the last element in the list plus 1. If the size of the list plus the length of the target array minus i is less than k, it returns.
Then it enters a for loop starting from i and iterates until the end of the target array. Inside the loop, it adds the value of i to the list, calls the combination method recursively, and then removes the last element from the list.
After the combination method finishes, it prints the value of k as output.
Then it enters a for loop starting from 0 and iterates until k. Inside the loop, it creates a StringBuilder object and appends the value of k-1 to it. Then it retrieves the corresponding list from the ansList and appends each element in the list to the StringBuilder. Finally, it removes the last character from the StringBuilder and prints it as output.
