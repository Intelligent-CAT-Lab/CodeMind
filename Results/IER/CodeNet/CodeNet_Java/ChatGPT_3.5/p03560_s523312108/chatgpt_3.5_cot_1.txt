The variable n is initialized with 6 according to the input. The variable best is an array of size n and all elements are initialized with 100.
The variable d is initialized with 1. It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 999999. Inside the loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 1 to 9. Inside the second loop, it calculates the value of td as (d * j) % n and it updates the value of best[td] to the minimum of its current value and j. After the second loop finishes, it updates the value of d as (d * 10) % n. After the first loop finishes, it calculates the value of ans as best[0].
Then it calculates the value of ans0 as the sum of the digits of n. It iterates from nn = n to 1 and in each iteration, it adds nn % 10 to ans0 and updates nn as nn / 10. After the loop finishes, it updates the value of ans as the minimum of ans0 and ans.
Then it initializes an array of lists called wset of size 50. It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 49. Inside the loop, it initializes each element of wset as an empty list.
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from 1 to n-1. Inside the loop, it checks if best[i] is not equal to 100. If it is not equal to 100, it adds i to the list at index best[i] in wset.
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from f = 0 to n-1. Inside the loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from l = 1 to 9. Inside the second loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates over each element w in the list at index l in wset. Inside the third loop, it updates the value of best[(f+w)%n] to the minimum of its current value and best[f] + l.
After the third loop finishes, it checks if the current time is greater than till. If it is, it breaks the loop.
Then it updates the value of ans as the minimum of ans and best[0].
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from i = 1 to n-1. Inside the loop, it updates the value of ans as the minimum of ans and best[i] + best[n-i].
Finally, it prints the value of ans as output.
