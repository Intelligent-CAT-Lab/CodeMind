<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input from the user and converts it into a character array. It then initializes an integer array called "last" with a length of 26 and fills it with -1. 

The code then iterates through each character in the input string. For each character, it calculates the corresponding index in the "last" array by subtracting the character 'a' from the current character. 

If the value at the calculated index in the "last" array is greater than or equal to 0 (indicating that the character has been encountered before) and the difference between the current index and the value at the calculated index is less than 3, it prints the indices (1-based) of the two repeated characters and returns from the function.

If no repeated characters are found, it prints "-1 -1".

<<<Output>>>
The return value of `needed` is "-1 -1".
