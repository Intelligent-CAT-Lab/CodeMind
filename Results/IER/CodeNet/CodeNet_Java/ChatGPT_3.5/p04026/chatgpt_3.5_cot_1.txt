<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input and converts it into a character array. It then initializes an integer array called "last" with size 26 and fills it with -1. This array will be used to store the last index of each character encountered in the string.

Next, it enters a for loop that iterates through each character in the string. Inside the loop, it calculates the index of the current character by subtracting 'a' from the ASCII value of the character. It then checks if the last index of this character is greater than or equal to 0 (indicating that the character has been encountered before) and if the difference between the current index and the last index is less than 3. If both conditions are true, it prints the last index + 1 and the current index + 1 (to account for 0-based indexing) and returns from the main method.

If the loop finishes without finding a pair of characters that satisfy the conditions, it prints "-1 -1" as the output.

In the given input "needed", the code will not find any pair of characters that satisfy the conditions, so the output will be "-1 -1".
