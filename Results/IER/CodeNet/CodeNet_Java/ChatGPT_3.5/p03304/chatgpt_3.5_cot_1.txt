<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads three long integers n, m, and d from the input. Then it calculates the value of s based on the value of d. If d is 0, then s is equal to n. Otherwise, s is equal to (n - d) * 2.
Finally, it calculates the result by dividing s by n twice, multiplying it by (m - 1), and casting it to a double. The result is then printed.
In this case, n = 2, m = 3, and d = 1. So, s = (2 - 1) * 2 = 2.
The result is calculated as (2 / 2 / 2) * (3 - 1) = 0.5 * 2 = 1.0.
<<<Output>>>
1.0
