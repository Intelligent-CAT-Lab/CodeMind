<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three long integers as input: n, m, and d.
It calculates the value of s based on the value of d. If d is 0, s is set to n. Otherwise, s is calculated as (n - d) * 2.
Finally, it calculates the result by dividing s by n twice, multiplying it by (m - 1), and casting it to a double.
The result is then printed.
In this case, the input values are 2, 3, and 1.
So, s = (2 - 1) * 2 = 2.
The result is calculated as (2 / 2 / 2) * (3 - 1) = 0.5.
Since the result is a double, it is printed as 0.5.
<<<Output>>>
0.5
