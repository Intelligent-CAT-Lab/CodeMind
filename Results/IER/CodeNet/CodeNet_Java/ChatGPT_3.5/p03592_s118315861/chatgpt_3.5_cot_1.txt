<<<Analysis>>>
The variables N, M, and K are initialized with the values 2, 2, and 2 respectively according to the input.
A 2D array b of size N x M is created and initialized with all elements as 1.
A nested for loop is used to iterate through all possible values of i and k from 0 to N and M respectively.
Inside the loop, it checks if the equation K = (M * i + N * k - 2 * i * k) is satisfied. If it is, then it prints "Yes" and returns.
If the loop finishes without finding a solution, it prints "No".
In this case, the equation is not satisfied for any values of i and k, so the output will be "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
