<<<Analysis>>>
The variable k and variable n are initialized with 3 and 3 respectively according to the input.
Then it initializes a 2D array cdp with size 4001x4001 and another 2D array idp with size 2001x1001.
Then it calculates the values of cdp and idp arrays using nested for loops.
After that, it initializes an array ans with size 2*k+1.
Then it enters a for loop which iterates from 2 to 2*k.
Inside the loop, it calculates the value of ni which is the number of odd numbers in the range [max(i-k, 1), min(i-1, k)].
Then it checks if i is odd or even.
If i is odd, it enters another for loop which iterates from 0 to ni/2.
Inside this loop, it calculates the values of nn and nk based on the current values of n and k.
Then it checks if nn is less than 0, if it is, it continues to the next iteration.
Otherwise, it calculates the value of ans[i] by multiplying the value of cdp[nn+nk-1][nn] with the value of idp[ni][j] and taking modulo with mod.
If i is even, it enters two separate for loops.
The first for loop calculates the values of nn and nk based on the current values of n and k.
Then it checks if nn is less than 0, if it is, it continues to the next iteration.
Otherwise, it calculates the value of ans[i] by multiplying the value of cdp[nn+nk-1][nn] with the value of idp[ni-1][j] and taking modulo with mod.
The second for loop calculates the values of nn and nk based on the current values of n and k.
Then it checks if nn is less than 0, if it is, it continues to the next iteration.
Otherwise, it calculates the value of ans[i] by multiplying the value of cdp[nn+nk-1][nn] with the value of idp[ni-1][j] and taking modulo with mod.
Finally, it enters another for loop which iterates from 2 to 2*k and prints the value of ans[i].
