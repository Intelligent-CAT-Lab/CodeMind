The variable M is initialized with 15 and variable D is initialized with 40 according to the input. And variable ans is initialized with 0.
It enters a nested for loop and it iterates from 1 to M and from 1 to D to check each pair of integers (m, d) in this range. The value of variable m is also passed to variable d.
Inside the nested for loop, it calculates the units digit and tens digit of the current integer d by using modulo and division operations respectively and assigns them to variables d1 and d2.
Then it checks if both d1 and d2 are greater than or equal to 2 and if the product of d1 and d2 is equal to m. If the condition is true, it increments the variable ans by 1.
After the nested for loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable ans as output, which is 6.
<<<Output>>>
