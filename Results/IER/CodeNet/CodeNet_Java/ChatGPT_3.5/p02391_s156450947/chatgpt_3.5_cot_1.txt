<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read input from the standard input. It then reads two integers a and b from the input using the nextInt() method.
Next, it checks if a is greater than b. If it is, it prints "a > b". If a is not greater than b, it checks if a is less than b. If it is, it prints "a < b".
If neither of these conditions are true, it means that a is equal to b, so it prints "a == b".
Finally, it closes the Scanner object.
In this case, the input is "1 2", so a is 1 and b is 2. Since 1 is less than 2, the code will print "a < b".
<<<Output>>>
a < b
