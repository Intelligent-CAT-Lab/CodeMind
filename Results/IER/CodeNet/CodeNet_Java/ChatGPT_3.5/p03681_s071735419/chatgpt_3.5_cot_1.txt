The variable n and variable m are initialized with 2 and 2 respectively according to the input. And variable nk and variable mk are initialized with 1.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 2 to calculate the factorial of n and m. The value of variable i is multiplied with variable nk and variable mk respectively and then the result is stored back in the same variable. After each multiplication, the result is taken modulo 1000000007.
After the loop finishes, it checks if n is equal to m. If it is, it calculates the answer as 2 times the product of nk and mk, and then takes modulo 1000000007. Otherwise, it checks if the absolute difference between n and m is 1. If it is, it calculates the answer as the product of nk and mk, and then takes modulo 1000000007. Otherwise, it sets the answer to 0.
Finally, it prints the value of the answer as output.
