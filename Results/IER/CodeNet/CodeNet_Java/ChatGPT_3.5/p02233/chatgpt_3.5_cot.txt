<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a recursive function `fib` that calculates the Fibonacci number for a given input `n`. It uses an array `memo` to store the previously calculated Fibonacci numbers to avoid redundant calculations.

In the `main` method, it takes an input `n` from the user using the `Scanner` class and passes it to the `fib` function. The return value of `fib(n)` is then printed as the output.

When `n` is 3, the `fib` function is called with `n=3`. Since `memo[3]` is initially 0, it enters the first if condition and returns `fib(3-1) + fib(3-2)`. 

For `fib(2)`, `memo[2]` is also 0, so it enters the first if condition and returns `fib(2-1) + fib(2-2)`. 

For `fib(1)`, `memo[1]` is 0, so it enters the second if condition and returns 1. 

For `fib(0)`, `memo[0]` is 0, so it enters the second if condition and returns 1. 

Now, `fib(2)` can be calculated as `fib(1) + fib(0)`, which is 1 + 1 = 2. 

Finally, `fib(3)` can be calculated as `fib(2) + fib(1)`, which is 2 + 1 = 3.

Therefore, the return value of `3` would be `3`.
