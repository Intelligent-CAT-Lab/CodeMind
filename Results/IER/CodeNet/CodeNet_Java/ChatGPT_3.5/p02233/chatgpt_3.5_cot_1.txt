<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a recursive function `fib` that calculates the Fibonacci number for a given input `n`. It uses memoization to store the previously calculated Fibonacci numbers in the `memo` array.

In the `main` method, it takes an integer input from the user using the `Scanner` class. It then calls the `fib` function with the input as the argument and prints the result.

When `n` is 3, the `fib` function is called with `n=3`. Since `memo[3]` is 0, it calculates `fib(2)` and `fib(1)` recursively. 

For `fib(2)`, it checks if `memo[2]` is 0, which is true. So it calculates `fib(1)` and `fib(0)` recursively.

For `fib(1)`, it returns 1 and stores it in `memo[1]`. For `fib(0)`, it returns 1 and stores it in `memo[0]`.

Now, `fib(2)` can be calculated as `memo[1] + memo[0]`, which is 1 + 1 = 2. So, it stores 2 in `memo[2]`.

Now, `fib(3)` can be calculated as `memo[2] + memo[1]`, which is 2 + 1 = 3. So, it stores 3 in `memo[3]` and returns 3.

Finally, the `main` method prints the result, which is 3.
