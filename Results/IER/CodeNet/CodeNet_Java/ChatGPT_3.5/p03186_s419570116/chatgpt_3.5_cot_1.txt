<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads three integers a, b, and c from the input. It then checks if the sum of a and b is greater than or equal to c. If it is, it prints the sum of b and c. Otherwise, it prints 2 times b plus a plus 1.
In this case, a is 3, b is 1, and c is 4. The sum of a and b is 4, which is greater than c. Therefore, the code will print the sum of b and c, which is 5.
<<<Output>>>
5
