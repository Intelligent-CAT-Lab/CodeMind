The variable n is initialized with 3 according to the input. 
The code initializes a 2D array c with size (n+1) x (n+1) and sets c[0][0] to 1. Then it uses a nested for loop to calculate the values of c[i][j] using the formula c[i][j] = c[i-1][j-1] + c[i-1][j].
Then it initializes a 3D array dp with size (n+1) x (n+1) x (n+1) and sets dp[1][1][0] to 1.
It uses three nested for loops to iterate through all possible values of total, plus, and minus.
Inside the nested loops, it checks if the current value of dp[total][plus][minus] is non-zero. If it is, it calculates the values of nextPlus and nextMinus based on the current values of plus, minus, and total.
Then it calculates the values of morePlus and moreMinus based on the values of nextPlus and nextMinus.
If the values of plus and minus are greater than or equal to morePlus and moreMinus respectively, it calculates the values of goPlus and goMinus based on the values of plus, minus, morePlus, and moreMinus.
Then it calculates the value of mult by multiplying c[goMinus + goPlus][goPlus], c[total][goPlus + goMinus], and cur.
If the value of total is equal to n, it adds mult to the variable res.
If either nextPlus or nextMinus is greater than 0, it updates the value of dp[nextTotal][nextPlus][nextMinus] by adding mult to it.
After the nested loops finish, it prints the value of res as the output.
