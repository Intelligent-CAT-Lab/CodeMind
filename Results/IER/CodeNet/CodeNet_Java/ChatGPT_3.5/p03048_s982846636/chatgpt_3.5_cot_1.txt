<<<Analysis>>>
The variable r, g, b, and n are initialized with 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively according to the input. And variable ans is initialized with 0.
It enters a nested for loop and it iterates from 0 to n/r and 0 to (n-(i*r))/g for each i in the range 0 to n/r.
Inside the nested for loop, it checks if (n-(i*r+j*g))%b is equal to 0. If it is, it increments the value of ans by 1.
After the nested for loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable ans as output, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
