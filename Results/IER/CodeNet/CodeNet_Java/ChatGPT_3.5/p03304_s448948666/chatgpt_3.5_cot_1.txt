<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n, m and d are initialized with 2, 3 and 1 respectively according to the input. 
The variable diff is calculated based on the value of d. If d is 0, then diff is 1, otherwise diff is 2.
The variable result is calculated using the formula ((n - d) * diff / Math.pow(n, 2)) * (m - 1).
The result is then printed with 10 decimal places.
