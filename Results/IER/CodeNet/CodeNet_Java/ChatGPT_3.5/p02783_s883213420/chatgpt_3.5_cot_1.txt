<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers h and a as input. It initializes a variable ans with 0.
Then it enters a while loop which continues until the value of h becomes 0 or negative. In each iteration of the loop, it subtracts the value of a from h and increments the value of ans by 1.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of ans as output.
In this case, the value of h is 10 and a is 4. The loop will run 3 times because after the third iteration, the value of h will become 0. So the output will be 3.
