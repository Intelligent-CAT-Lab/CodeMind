<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string N and iterates over the first 3 characters of the string. 
Inside the loop, it checks if the current character is '1'. If it is, it prints '9'.
If the current character is '9', it prints '1'.
Otherwise, it prints the current character as it is.
After the loop finishes, it does not print a new line character, so the output will be printed on the same line.
