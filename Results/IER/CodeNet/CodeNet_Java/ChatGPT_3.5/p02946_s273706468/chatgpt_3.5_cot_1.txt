The variable k is initialized with 3 and variable x is initialized with 7 according to the input.
An empty ArrayList integers is created to store integers.
The method getMinCoodinate is called passing integers, k, and x as arguments. This method adds k-1 integers greater than x to the integers list.
Then, the value of x is added to the integers list.
The method getMaxCoodinate is called passing integers, k, and x as arguments. This method adds k-1 integers smaller than x to the integers list.
The integers list is sorted in ascending order.
Finally, the integers list is printed. Each element is printed followed by a space, except for the last element which is printed alone on a new line.
So, the output would be: 6 7 8
<<<Output>>>
