<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input: l, r, and d. It then calculates the number of integers between l and r (inclusive) that are divisible by d. 
The code first creates an object of the FastScanner class to read input. It then reads the values of l, r, and d using the nextInt() method of the FastScanner class.
The code then calculates the number of integers between l and r (inclusive) that are divisible by d using the formula: (r/d) - (l-1)/d. 
Finally, it prints the result as output.
In this case, l=5, r=10, and d=2. The number of integers between 5 and 10 (inclusive) that are divisible by 2 is 3 (6, 8, and 10).
