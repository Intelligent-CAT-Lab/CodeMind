<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and variable K are initialized with 7 and 7 respectively according to the input. 
It checks if n is less than or equal to 2. If it is, it prints 0 and returns.
Otherwise, it calculates the value of variable ret by dividing (n-2) by 11 and multiplying it by 5.
Then it enters a nested for loop. The outer loop iterates from 1 to 5 and the inner loop iterates from 0 to (n-2)%11.
Inside the inner loop, it calculates the value of variable b as (9*j+9+63)%11 and checks if (b+k*63)%11 is equal to K. If it is, it increments the value of variable ret.
After the loops finish, it prints the final value of variable ret as output.
