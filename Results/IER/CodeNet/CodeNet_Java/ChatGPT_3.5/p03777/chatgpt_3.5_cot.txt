<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two strings from the input using the Scanner class. It then checks if the two strings are equal using the equals() method. If they are equal, it prints "H", otherwise it prints "D".
In this case, the input is "H H", so both strings are "H". Therefore, the condition in the if statement is true and it will print "H".
<<<Output>>>
H
