<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two strings from the input using the Scanner class. The first string is assigned to variable 'a' and the second string is assigned to variable 'b'. 
Then it checks if the two strings are equal using the equals() method. If they are equal, it prints "H". Otherwise, it prints "D".
In this case, the input is "H H", so the two strings are equal. Therefore, the output will be "H".
<<<Output>>>
