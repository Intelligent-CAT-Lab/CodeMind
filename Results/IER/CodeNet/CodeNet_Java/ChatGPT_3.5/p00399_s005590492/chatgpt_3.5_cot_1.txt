<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a variable ans with 0. Then it enters a for loop which iterates 4 times. In each iteration, it reads an integer input from the input stream using the FastScanner class. It adds the value of input to the variable ans. After the loop finishes, it prints the value of ans as output.
So, the code reads 4 integers from the input stream and adds them together to get the final value of ans. The input values are 2, 1, 1, and 1. Therefore, the output will be 5.
<<<Output>>>
5
