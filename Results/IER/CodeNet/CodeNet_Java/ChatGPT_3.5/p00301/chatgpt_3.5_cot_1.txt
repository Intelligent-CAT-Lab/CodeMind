<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 25 according to the input. And an integer array a is initialized with size 15 and all elements are initialized with 0. The variable i is initialized with 0.
It enters a while loop and it continues until n becomes 0. In each iteration, it calculates the value of a[i] by taking the remainder of (n+1) divided by 3 and subtracting 1. Then it updates the value of n by subtracting a[i] and dividing by 3. The value of i is also incremented by 1 in each iteration.
After the first while loop finishes, it enters another while loop and it continues until i becomes 0. In each iteration, it prints the value of a[i] with a "+" sign if a[i] is positive, a "-" sign if a[i] is negative, and "0" if a[i] is 0. It also prints a newline character if i is 0.
So, the output will be a sequence of "+" and "-" signs followed by a newline character.
