<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 25 according to the input. And an integer array a of size 15 is initialized with all elements as 0. The variable i is initialized with 0.
It enters a while loop and it continues until n becomes 0. Inside the loop, it calculates the value of a[i] as (n+1)%3-1 and updates the value of n as (n-a[i])/3. The value of i is incremented by 1 after each iteration.
After the first iteration, the value of a[0] becomes 1 and n becomes 8.
After the second iteration, the value of a[1] becomes -1 and n becomes 2.
After the third iteration, the value of a[2] becomes 0 and n becomes 0.
After the loop finishes, it enters another while loop and it continues until i becomes 0. Inside the loop, it prints the value of a[i] as "+", "0" or "-". The condition a[i]==0?"0":a[i]>0?"+":"-" is used to determine the appropriate string to print. The condition i==0?"\n":"" is used to determine whether to print a new line or not.
After the second iteration, it prints "-".
After the first iteration, it prints "+".
After the loop finishes, it prints a new line.
