<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a mapping between characters and binary strings. It takes an input string and converts each character into its corresponding binary string representation based on the mapping. It then checks if the binary string exists in the mapping and replaces it with the corresponding character. Finally, it prints the resulting string.

In this case, the input string is "?D-C'KOPUA`?". The code goes through each character in the input string and converts it into its binary string representation. It then checks if the binary string exists in the mapping and replaces it with the corresponding character. The resulting string is "HELLO WORLD!".

<<<Output>>>
HELLO WORLD!
