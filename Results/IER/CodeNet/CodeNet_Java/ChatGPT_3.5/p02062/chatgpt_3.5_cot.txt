The code takes a string as input and parses it to create a binary expression tree. The input string represents a logical expression with variables represented by '?' and logical operators '&' and '|'. The code uses a recursive descent parser to parse the input string and construct the expression tree.

The expression `?&?|?&?|?&?` can be represented by the following expression tree:

         |
       /   \
      &     &
     / \   / \
    ?   & ?   &
       / \   / \
      ?   ? ?   ?

The code starts by creating a Parser object with the input string. It then calls the `getFormula()` method of the parser to parse the input string and return the root node of the expression tree.

The `getFormula()` method calls the `getOrExpr()` method, which in turn calls the `getAndExpr()` method, which finally calls the `getTerm()` method to parse the individual terms of the expression.

The `getTerm()` method checks the current character in the input string and creates a `VarNode` if the character is '?', or recursively calls `getOrExpr()` if the character is '('. It then returns the parsed node.

The `getAndExpr()` method parses a sequence of terms separated by '&'. It starts by parsing the first term using `getTerm()`, and then iteratively parses the remaining terms and creates `AndNode` objects to represent the logical AND operation between the terms.

The `getOrExpr()` method is similar to `getAndExpr()`, but it parses terms separated by '|', and creates `OrNode` objects to represent the logical OR operation between the terms.

The `calc0()` and `calc1()` methods of the `Node` class are used to calculate the number of ways the expression can evaluate to 0 and 1, respectively. These methods are memoized to avoid redundant calculations.

The `toString()` methods of the `Node` classes are used to generate a string representation of the expression tree.

Finally, the code prints the number of ways the expression can evaluate to 0 and 1 by calling the `get0()` and `get1()` methods of the root node, respectively.
