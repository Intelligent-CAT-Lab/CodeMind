<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string and parses it to create a binary expression tree. The input string represents a logical expression with variables represented by '?' and operators '&' and '|'. The code uses a recursive descent parser to parse the input string and create the expression tree.

The code starts by reading the input string from the user using a Scanner object. It then creates a Parser object and passes the input string to it. The Parser object has methods to parse the input string and create the expression tree.

The Parser class has several methods to parse different parts of the input string. The getTerm() method is used to parse a single term, which can be a variable or a subexpression enclosed in parentheses. The getAndExpr() method is used to parse a sequence of terms connected by the '&' operator. The getOrExpr() method is used to parse a sequence of terms connected by the '|' operator. The getFormula() method is used to parse the entire input string and create the expression tree.

The Node class is an abstract class that represents a node in the expression tree. It has two abstract methods, calc0() and calc1(), which are used to calculate the number of ways the expression can evaluate to 0 and 1, respectively. The VarNode class is a subclass of Node that represents a variable. The AndNode and OrNode classes are subclasses of Node that represent the '&' and '|' operators, respectively.

The code creates a Parser object and calls its getFormula() method to parse the input string and create the expression tree. It then calls the get0() and get1() methods on the root node of the expression tree to calculate the number of ways the expression can evaluate to 0 and 1, respectively. Finally, it prints the results.
