<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, a and b. It then calls the calcu() method passing a and b as arguments. Inside the calcu() method, it initializes a variable ans with the value of a. It then enters a while loop where it calculates the remainder of a divided by b and assigns it to ans. It then updates the values of a and b by assigning b to a and ans to b. This process continues until b becomes 0. Finally, it prints the value of a as the output.
In the main method, it checks if a is greater than b. If it is, it calls the calcu() method with a and b as arguments. Otherwise, it calls the calcu() method with b and a as arguments.
So, in this case, a=54 and b=20. Since a is greater than b, the calcu() method is called with a=54 and b=20. Inside the calcu() method, the while loop runs as follows:
1. ans = 54 % 20 = 14
2. a = 20, b = 14
3. ans = 20 % 14 = 6
4. a = 14, b = 6
5. ans = 14 % 6 = 2
6. a = 6, b = 2
7. ans = 6 % 2 = 0
8. a = 2, b = 0
Since b is now 0, the while loop terminates. The value of a is 2, which is then printed as the output.
