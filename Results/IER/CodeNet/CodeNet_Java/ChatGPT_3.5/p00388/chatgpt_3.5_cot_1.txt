<<<Analysis>>>
The variable H, variable A and variable B are initialized with 100, 2 and 4 respectively according to the input. And variable ans is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to 4 to check each integer i in this range. 
Inside the for loop, it checks if the remainder of H divided by i is 0. If it is, it increments the value of variable ans by 1. The condition is met when i is 2 and 4.
After the loop finishes, it print the final value of variable ans as output, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
