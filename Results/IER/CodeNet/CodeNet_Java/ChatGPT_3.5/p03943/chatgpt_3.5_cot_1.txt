<<<Analysis>>>
The code uses a custom FastScanner class to read input from the user. It reads three integers a, b, and c using the nextInt() method of the FastScanner class.
Then it checks three conditions:
1. a + b == c
2. a + c == b
3. b + c == a

If any of these conditions are true, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".

In this case, the values of a, b, and c are 10, 30, and 20 respectively. Let's evaluate the conditions:
1. 10 + 30 == 20 -> false
2. 10 + 20 == 30 -> true
3. 30 + 20 == 10 -> false

Since the second condition is true, the code will print "Yes".

<<<Output>>>
Yes
