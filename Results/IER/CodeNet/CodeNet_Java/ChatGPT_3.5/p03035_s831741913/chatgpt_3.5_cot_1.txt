<<<Analysis>>>
The variable a and variable b are initialized with 30 and 100 respectively according to the input.
It checks if a is less than or equal to 5. If it is, it prints 0 as output.
If a is greater than 5 and less than 13, it prints b/2 as output.
If a is greater than or equal to 13, it prints b as output.
In this case, a is greater than 5 and less than 13, so it prints 100/2 = 50 as output.
<<<Output>>>
50
