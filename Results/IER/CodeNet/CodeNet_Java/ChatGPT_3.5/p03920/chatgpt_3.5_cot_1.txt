The variable N is initialized with 4 according to the input. 
It enters a while loop and it continues until N becomes 0.
Inside the while loop, it initializes a variable sum with 0 and a variable i with 1.
Then it enters a for loop and it iterates indefinitely.
Inside the for loop, it adds the current value of i to the variable sum.
Then it checks if the sum is greater than or equal to N. If it is, it prints the value of i, subtracts i from N, and breaks out of the for loop.
After the for loop, it continues to the next iteration of the while loop.
Since N is 4, the for loop will iterate once and the value of i will be 1. It will print 1, subtract 1 from N, and break out of the for loop.
Since N is still greater than 0, it continues to the next iteration of the while loop.
Since N is now 3, the for loop will iterate once and the value of i will be 2. It will print 2, subtract 2 from N, and break out of the for loop.
Since N is still greater than 0, it continues to the next iteration of the while loop.
Since N is now 1, the for loop will iterate once and the value of i will be 3. It will print 3, subtract 3 from N, and break out of the for loop.
Since N is now 0, the while loop condition is no longer true and the program terminates.
