<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a line of input and splits it into an array of strings using the space as a delimiter. It then initializes two HashMaps, `count` and `length`, to store the count and length of each word in the input.

Next, it iterates over each word in the input array. If the word is not already present in the `count` HashMap, it adds it with a count of 1 and stores its length in the `length` HashMap. If the word is already present, it increments its count in the `count` HashMap.

After counting the occurrences and lengths of all the words, the code finds the word with the maximum count and the word with the maximum length. It initializes variables `max` and `maxlen` to 0 and empty strings `m` and `mlen` to store the words with the maximum count and length, respectively. It then iterates over the keys of the `count` HashMap and updates `m` and `max` if the current count is greater than the current maximum count. Similarly, it iterates over the keys of the `length` HashMap and updates `mlen` and `maxlen` if the current length is greater than the current maximum length.

Finally, it prints the word with the maximum count (`m`) and the word with the maximum length (`mlen`) separated by a space.
