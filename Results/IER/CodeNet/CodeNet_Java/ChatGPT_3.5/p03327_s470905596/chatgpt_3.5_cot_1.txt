<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads an integer input from the user using the Scanner class and stores it in the variable n.
It then checks if the value of n is greater than 999. If it is, it prints "ABD". Otherwise, it prints "ABC".
In this case, the value of n is 999, which is not greater than 999. Therefore, the code will print "ABC".
<<<Output>>>
ABC
