The variable m is initialized with 2 and variable n is initialized with 3 according to the input.
The code then calls the modPow() method passing m and n as arguments.
Inside the modPow() method, it checks if n is equal to 0. Since n is not 0, it proceeds to the next condition.
It checks if n is divisible by 2. Since n is divisible by 2, it calculates modPow(m * m % mod, n / 2) and returns the result.
Inside the modPow() method, it again checks if n is equal to 0. Since n is not 0, it proceeds to the next condition.
It checks if n is divisible by 2. Since n is divisible by 2, it calculates modPow(m * m % mod, n / 2) and returns the result.
Inside the modPow() method, it again checks if n is equal to 0. Since n is not 0, it proceeds to the next condition.
It checks if n is divisible by 2. Since n is not divisible by 2, it calculates modPow(m * m % mod, (n - 1) / 2) * m % mod and returns the result.
Inside the modPow() method, it again checks if n is equal to 0. Since n is not 0, it proceeds to the next condition.
It checks if n is divisible by 2. Since n is divisible by 2, it calculates modPow(m * m % mod, n / 2) and returns the result.
Inside the modPow() method, it again checks if n is equal to 0. Since n is equal to 0, it returns 1.
Finally, the code prints the result of modPow(m, n) as output, which is 8.
<<<Output>>>
8
