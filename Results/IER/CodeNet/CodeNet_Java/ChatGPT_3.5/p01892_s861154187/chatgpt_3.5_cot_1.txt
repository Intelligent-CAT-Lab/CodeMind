<<<Analysis>>>
The variable a, variable b and variable n are initialized with 19, 30 and 3 respectively according to the input. And variable min is initialized with the maximum value of long.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 3 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it checks if b is divisible by i. If it is not, it continues to the next iteration.
If b is divisible by i, it calculates the value of x by dividing b by i.
Then it calculates the value of y by dividing a by x.
If y is greater than n or y is equal to 0, it calculates the absolute difference between n * x and a and updates the value of min if it is smaller than the current value of min.
If y is not greater than n or y is not equal to 0, it calculates the absolute difference between y * x and a and updates the value of min if it is smaller than the current value of min.
Then it checks if y + 1 is greater than n. If it is, it calculates the absolute difference between n * x and a and updates the value of min if it is smaller than the current value of min.
If y + 1 is not greater than n, it calculates the absolute difference between (y + 1) * x and a and updates the value of min if it is smaller than the current value of min.
Then it checks if y - 1 is equal to 0 or y - 1 is greater than n. If it is, it calculates the absolute difference between n * x and a and updates the value of min if it is smaller than the current value of min.
If y - 1 is not equal to 0 or y - 1 is not greater than n, it calculates the absolute difference between (y - 1) * x and a and updates the value of min if it is smaller than the current value of min.
After the loop finishes, it print the final value of variable min as output.
