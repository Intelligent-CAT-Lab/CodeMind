<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers n and m as input. It calculates the value of total by performing the following operations:
1. total += (n * (n-1) / 2) - It calculates the sum of all numbers from 1 to n-1 and adds it to total.
2. total += (m * (m-1) / 2) - It calculates the sum of all numbers from 1 to m-1 and adds it to total.

In this case, n = 2 and m = 1. So, the calculations would be:
1. total += (2 * (2-1) / 2) = 1
2. total += (1 * (1-1) / 2) = 1

Therefore, the final value of total would be 1.
