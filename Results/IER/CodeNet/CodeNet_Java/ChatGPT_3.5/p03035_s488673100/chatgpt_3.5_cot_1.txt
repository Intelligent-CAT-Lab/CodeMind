<<<Analysis>>>
The variable A is initialized with 30 and variable B is initialized with 100 according to the input.
Then it checks the value of A. If A is greater than or equal to 13, it prints the value of B.
If A is greater than 5 but less than 13, it prints the value of B divided by 2.
If A is less than or equal to 5, it prints 0.
In this case, A is greater than 5 but less than 13, so it prints the value of B divided by 2, which is 50.
<<<Output>>>
50
