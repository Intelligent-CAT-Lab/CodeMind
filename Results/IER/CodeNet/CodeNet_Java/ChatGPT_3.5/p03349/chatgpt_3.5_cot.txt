<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three inputs: n, k, and MOD. In this case, n=2, k=2, and MOD=100.
Then it initializes several arrays and variables.
It calculates the number of sequences of size i with an element bigger than j using a nested loop.
Finally, it prints the value of numberOfSequencesOfSizeIwithElementBiggerThenJ[n][0].
