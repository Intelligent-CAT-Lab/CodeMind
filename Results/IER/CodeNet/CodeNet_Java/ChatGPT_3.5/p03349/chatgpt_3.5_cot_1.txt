<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads three integers n, k, and MOD from the input. Then it initializes several arrays and variables.
It calculates the number of sequences of size i with an element bigger than j for each i and j using dynamic programming.
Finally, it prints the value of numberOfSequencesOfSizeIwithElementBiggerThenJ[n][0].
In this case, n = 2, k = 2, and MOD = 100.
