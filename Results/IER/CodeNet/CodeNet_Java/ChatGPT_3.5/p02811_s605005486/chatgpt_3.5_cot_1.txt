<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 2 and variable m is initialized with 900 according to the input.
It checks if the product of n and 500 is greater than or equal to m. If it is, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
In this case, 2*500=1000, which is greater than 900. So it prints "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
