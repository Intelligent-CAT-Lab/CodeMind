<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers from the input using the Scanner class and assigns them to variables a and b. 
Then it calculates the average of a and b by adding them and dividing the sum by 2.0. 
The Math.ceil() method is used to round up the result to the nearest integer. 
Finally, it prints the rounded up average as the output.
In this case, the input is 1 and 3. The sum of 1 and 3 is 4, and dividing it by 2.0 gives 2.0. 
Since Math.ceil(2.0) is 2, the output will be 2.
