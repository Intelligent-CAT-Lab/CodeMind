<<<Analysis>>>
The variable k is initialized with 101 according to the input.
It checks if k is divisible by 2 or 5. If it is, it prints -1.
Otherwise, it initializes count with 1 and cur with 7 % k.
Then it enters a while loop which continues until cur becomes 0.
Inside the loop, it increments count by 1, multiplies cur by 10 and adds 7 to it, and then takes the modulo of k with cur.
Finally, it prints the value of count as output, which is the number of times the loop iterated before cur became 0.
