<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input and stores them in variables a, b, and c respectively.
Then it initializes a variable max with 0.
It compares the sum of a*10+b+c with the current value of max and if it is greater, it updates the value of max.
Similarly, it compares the sum of a+b*10+c with the current value of max and updates max if it is greater.
Finally, it compares the sum of a+b+c*10 with the current value of max and updates max if it is greater.
After all the comparisons, it prints the value of max as the output.
In this case, the sum of a*10+b+c is 1*10+5+2 = 17, which is greater than 0. So, max is updated to 17.
The sum of a+b*10+c is 1+5*10+2 = 57, which is greater than 17. So, max is updated to 57.
The sum of a+b+c*10 is 1+5+2*10 = 21, which is not greater than 57. So, max remains 57.
Therefore, the output will be 57.
