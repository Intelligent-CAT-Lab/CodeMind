<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n, variable m and variable T are initialized with 2, 2 and 1 respectively according to the input. 
The function solve() is called, which performs the following steps:
1. It calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of T and n and stores it in the variable gn.
2. It calculates the gcd of T and m and stores it in the variable gm.
3. It calculates the gcd of (n/gn) and (m/gm) and stores it in the variable q.
4. It calculates the value of pow(pow(2, q, mod) - 2 + pow(2, n/gn, mod) + pow(2, m/gm, mod) - 1, (long)gn*gm, mod), where mod is 1000000007, and stores it in a variable.
5. It prints the value of the variable as output.

The gcd() function calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.
The pow() function calculates the power of a number modulo a given modulus using the binary exponentiation algorithm.
