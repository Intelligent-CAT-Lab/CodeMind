<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 2 according to the input. An ArrayList named list is created and it is populated with integers from 1 to n (i.e., 1 and 2).
Then, it enters a while loop which continues until the size of the list becomes 0.
Inside the while loop, it prints the elements of the list separated by a space.
Then, it calls the nextPermutation method passing the list as an argument. The nextPermutation method generates the next permutation of the list and returns it.
The nextPermutation method finds the pivot position and pivot value in the list. If the pivot position is -1 and the pivot value is 0, it means that there are no more permutations to generate and the list is cleared.
Otherwise, it finds the minimum value greater than the pivot value in the right side of the list and swaps it with the pivot value. Then, it sorts the sublist from the pivot position+1 to the end of the list.
The next permutation of the list is generated and assigned back to the list variable.
The while loop continues until there are no more permutations to generate.
