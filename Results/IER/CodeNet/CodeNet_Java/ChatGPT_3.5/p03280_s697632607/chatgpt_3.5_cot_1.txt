<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers from the input using the Scanner class and assigns them to variables a and b. Then it calculates the result of the expression a*b - b - a + 1 and prints it as the output.
In this case, the input is "2 2", so a will be assigned the value 2 and b will also be assigned the value 2. 
The expression a*b - b - a + 1 evaluates to 2*2 - 2 - 2 + 1 = 4 - 2 - 2 + 1 = 1.
Therefore, the output will be 1.
