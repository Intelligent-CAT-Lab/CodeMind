<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads an integer input from the user using the Scanner class and stores it in the variable n. 
Then it checks if the value of n is equal to 0. If it is, it prints "1". Otherwise, it prints "0".
In this case, the input is 1, which is not equal to 0. Therefore, the code will print "0".
<<<Output>>>
0
