<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string S and checks its length. If the length is 1, it returns 1 as the output.
Otherwise, it initializes the variable mid as -1 and iterates through the characters of the string S.
For each character, it compares it with the previous character. If they are different, it updates the value of mid using the moreMid() function.
The moreMid() function compares the current mid value with the result of the mid() function for the current border value.
The mid() function calculates the distance from the border to the middle of the string and returns the minimum value between the border and the distance from the border to the end of the string.
After iterating through all the characters, it checks the value of mid. If it is still -1, it returns the length of the string as the output.
Otherwise, it returns the difference between the length of the string and the value of mid as the output.
In this case, the input string is "010". The length of the string is 3.
The first character is '0' and it is equal to the second character '1'. The mid value remains -1.
The second character is '1' and it is different from the third character '0'. The mid value is updated to 1.
Since the mid value is not -1, the output is the difference between the length of the string (3) and the mid value (1), which is 2.
