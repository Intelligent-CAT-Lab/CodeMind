<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes two variables, max and idx, with 0. Then it enters a for loop that iterates 3 times. In each iteration, it takes an integer input from the user using the Scanner class and stores it in the variable x. It then checks if the value of x is greater than the current value of max. If it is, it updates the values of max and idx with the value of x and the current iteration index i, respectively. After the loop finishes, it prints the character corresponding to the index idx + 'A' as output. In this case, the input values are 1000, 900, and 850. The maximum value among these is 1000, which is the first input. Therefore, the output will be 'A'.
