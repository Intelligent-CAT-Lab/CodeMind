<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers X and Y from the input. The values of X and Y are 81 and 58 respectively according to the input.
Then it calculates the expression X + Y / 2. Since the division operator (/) has higher precedence than the addition operator (+), the division is performed first. The value of Y is divided by 2, which gives 29. Then the value of X is added to 29, resulting in 110.
Finally, the code prints the value of the expression, which is 110.
<<<Output>>>
110
