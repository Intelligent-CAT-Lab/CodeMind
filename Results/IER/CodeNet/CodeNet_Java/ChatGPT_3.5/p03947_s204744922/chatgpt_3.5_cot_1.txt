<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string input from the user and assigns it to the variable 's'. It then initializes a character variable 'c' with the first character of the string. It also initializes an integer variable 'sum' with 0.
The code then enters a for loop that iterates through each character of the string. Inside the loop, it checks if the current character is different from the character 'c'. If it is, it increments the 'sum' variable by 1 and updates the value of 'c' to the current character.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of 'sum' as the output.
In this case, the string is "BBBWW". The first character is 'B'. The loop iterates through each character and counts the number of times the character changes. In this case, the character changes from 'B' to 'W' once. Therefore, the output will be 1.
