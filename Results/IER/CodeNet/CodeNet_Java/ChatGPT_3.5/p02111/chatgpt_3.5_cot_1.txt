<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 0 according to the input. 
It then calculates the value of variable minute by multiplying 12, 60 and n and then dividing it by 360.
Since n is 0, the value of minute will also be 0.
Finally, it prints the value of minute divided by 60 and the value of minute modulo 60 as output, which is "0 0".
