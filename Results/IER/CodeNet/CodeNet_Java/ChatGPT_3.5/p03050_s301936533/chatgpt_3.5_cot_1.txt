<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 8 according to the input. An ArrayList num is created to store the numbers that satisfy the condition. 
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to the square root of N-1. Inside the loop, it checks if (N-i) is divisible by i and (N-i)/i is greater than i. If the condition is satisfied, it adds (N-i)/i to the ArrayList num.
After the loop finishes, it initializes a variable ans with 0 and enters another loop to calculate the sum of all the numbers in the ArrayList num.
Finally, it prints the value of ans as the output, which is the sum of all the numbers in the ArrayList num.
