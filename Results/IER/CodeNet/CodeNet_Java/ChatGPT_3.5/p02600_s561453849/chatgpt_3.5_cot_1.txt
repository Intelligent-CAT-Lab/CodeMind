<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes an integer variable `a` with the value `725`. Then it defines an integer array `kyu` with the values `{599,799,999,1199,1399,1599,1799,1999}`. It then enters a for loop that iterates from `i=0` to `i<8`. Inside the loop, it checks if the value of `a` is less than or equal to the current element of the `kyu` array. If it is, it prints `8 - i` and returns. If the loop finishes without finding a match, it means that `a` is greater than all the elements in the `kyu` array, so it prints `0`.
