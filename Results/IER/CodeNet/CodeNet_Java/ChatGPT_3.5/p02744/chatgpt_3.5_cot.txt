<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input `n` and calls the `func` method passing `n` as an argument. 
Inside the `func` method, if `n` is equal to 1, it adds the string "a" to the `list` and returns the `list`.
If `n` is greater than 1, it recursively calls the `func` method with `n-1` and stores the returned list in `prevList`.
Then, for each string `s` in `prevList`, it finds the maximum character in `s` and stores it in `max`.
It then iterates from character 'a' to `max+1` and appends each character to `s` to create a new string `newString`.
Finally, it adds `newString` to the `list`.
The `func` method returns the `list` after all iterations are done.
In the `main` method, it takes an integer input `n` and calls the `func` method passing `n` as an argument.
It stores the returned list in `list` and prints each string in `list` on a new line.
