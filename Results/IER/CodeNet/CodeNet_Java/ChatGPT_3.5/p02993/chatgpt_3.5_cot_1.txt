<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input from the user and initializes a boolean variable flag to false.
Then it enters a for loop that iterates from 0 to the length of the input string minus 1.
Inside the loop, it checks if the current character at index i is equal to the next character at index i+1.
If the condition is true, it sets the flag variable to true and breaks out of the loop.
After the loop finishes, it checks the value of the flag variable.
If the flag is true, it prints "Bad".
If the flag is false, it prints "Good".
In this case, the input string is "3776".
The loop iterates through the string and compares each character with the next character.
At index 2, the character '7' is equal to the next character '7', so the flag variable is set to true.
Therefore, the output of the code execution would be "Bad".
