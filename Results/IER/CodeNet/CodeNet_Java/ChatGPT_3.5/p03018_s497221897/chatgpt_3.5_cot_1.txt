<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string input "ABCABC" and initializes variables acnt and sum to 0.
It then enters a for loop that iterates through each character of the string.
Inside the loop, it checks if the current character is 'A'. If it is, it increments the value of acnt by 1.
If the current character is 'B' and the next character is 'C', it adds the value of acnt to sum and increments the loop variable i by 1 to skip the next character.
If the current character is neither 'A' nor 'B', it resets the value of acnt to 0.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of sum, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
