<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 3 and variable P is initialized with 24 according to the input.
It checks if the value of P is a prime number using the isPrime() method. Since 24 is not a prime number, it proceeds to the next step.
It calls the getPrimeFactorization() method to get the prime factorization of P. The method returns a HashMap where the keys are prime factors and the values are the powers of those factors.
It initializes the variable output with 1.
It iterates through the keys of the HashMap and checks if the power of each prime factor is greater than or equal to N. If it is, it multiplies the prime factor by the power divided by N and updates the value of output.
Finally, it prints the value of output as the output of the code, which is 6.
<<<Output>>>
6
