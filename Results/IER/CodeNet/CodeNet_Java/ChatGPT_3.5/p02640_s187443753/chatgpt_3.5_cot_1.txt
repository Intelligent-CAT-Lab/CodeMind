<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input and assigns them to variables x and y respectively.
Then it checks if the condition x*2 <= y and x*4 >= y is true. If it is true, it checks if y is divisible by 2. If both conditions are true, it prints "Yes" and returns from the main method.
If the conditions are not met, it prints "No".
In this case, x = 3 and y = 8. The condition x*2 <= y is true (6 <= 8) and x*4 >= y is also true (12 >= 8). However, y is not divisible by 2. Therefore, the output will be "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
