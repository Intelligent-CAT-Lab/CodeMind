<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with the value 432 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to N to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the result of multiplying i by 1.08 and converting it to an integer is equal to N.
If the condition is true, it prints the value of i and returns from the main method.
If the condition is not true after the loop finishes, it prints ":(" as output.
In this case, the condition is not true for any value of i from 0 to 432, so the output will be ":(".
