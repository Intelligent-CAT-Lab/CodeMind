The variable N is initialized with 432 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 432 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the product of i and 1.08 is equal to N. If it is, it prints the value of i and returns from the main method.
After the loop finishes, it prints ":(" as output.
