<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes 5 integers as input: a, b, c, x, and y.
It then calculates the value of nc by multiplying c with 2.
It initializes the variable price with the maximum value of a long integer.
Then it enters a for loop that iterates from 0 to 100000.
Inside the loop, it calculates the temporary price (tmpPrice) by multiplying i with nc and adding the maximum of 0 and the difference between x and i multiplied by a, and the maximum of 0 and the difference between y and i multiplied by b.
If the temporary price (tmpPrice) is less than the current price, it updates the price with the temporary price.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of price as the output.

In this case, the loop will iterate from 0 to 100000 and calculate the temporary price for each iteration. The temporary price is calculated by multiplying i with nc and adding the maximum of 0 and the difference between x and i multiplied by a, and the maximum of 0 and the difference between y and i multiplied by b. The loop will find the minimum value of tmpPrice and update the price accordingly. Finally, it will print the final value of price as the output.
