<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string as input and converts it into a character array. It then initializes a variable ans with 0. 
It then iterates through the character array starting from index 1. For each character, it checks if it is different from the previous character. If it is, it increments the ans variable by 1.
After the loop finishes, it prints the value of ans as the output.
In this case, the input string is "BBBWW". The first character is 'B' and it is the same as the previous character, so ans remains 0. The second character is also 'B' and it is the same as the previous character, so ans remains 0. The third character is 'B' and it is the same as the previous character, so ans remains 0. The fourth character is 'W' and it is different from the previous character, so ans is incremented to 1. The fifth character is also 'W' and it is the same as the previous character, so ans remains 1. Therefore, the output would be 1.
