<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes 6 inputs A, B, C, D, E, and F. It then calculates ans1 as A * 100 and initializes ans2 as 0.
It then enters a nested for loop with variables a, b, c, and d. The loop iterates through all possible combinations of a, b, c, and d within their respective ranges.
Inside the loop, it checks if the sum of (100 * a * A + 100 * b * B + C * c + D * d) is less than or equal to F and if the ratio of (C * c + D * d) to (100 * a * A + 100 * b * B + C * c + D * d) is less than or equal to (E / 100).
If these conditions are met, it checks if a and b are both 0. If they are not, it compares the ratio of ans2 to ans1 with the ratio of (C * c + D * d) to (100 * a * A + 100 * b * B + C * c + D * d).
If the latter ratio is greater, it updates ans1 and ans2 with the current values of (100 * a * A + 100 * b * B + C * c + D * d) and (C * c + D * d) respectively.
After the loop finishes, it prints the values of ans1 and ans2 as output.
