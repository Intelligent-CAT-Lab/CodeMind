<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes 6 inputs A, B, C, D, E, and F using the Scanner class.
Then it initializes two variables ans1 and ans2 with the values of A * 100 and 0 respectively.
It then enters a nested for loop with four variables a, b, c, and d.
The loop iterates from 0 to F / (A * 100) for a, from 0 to F / (B * 100) for b, from 0 to F / C for c, and from 0 to F / D for d.
Inside the nested loop, it checks if the sum of the products of a, A, b, B, c, C, d, and D is less than or equal to F and if the ratio of the sum of c and d to the sum of a, A, b, B, c, C, d, and D is less than or equal to E / 100.
If the condition is met, it checks if a and b are both 0. If they are, it continues to the next iteration of the loop.
If not, it checks if the ratio of ans2 to ans1 is less than the ratio of the sum of c and d to the sum of a, A, b, B, c, C, d, and D.
If it is, it updates ans1 and ans2 with the current values of the sums of a, A, b, B, c, C, d, and D and c and d respectively.
After the nested loop finishes, it prints the values of ans1 and ans2 as integers.
