<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 3 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 3 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the equation i * (i + 1) / 2 is equal to n. If it is, it prints "Yes" and the value of i + 1.
Then it initializes a 2D array called array with dimensions (i + 1) x i.
It enters two nested for loops to populate the array with values.
After that, it enters another for loop to print the array.
Finally, it returns from the main method.
If the equation i * (i + 1) / 2 is not equal to n for any value of i in the range [1, 3], it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
2
2 1 
2 3 4
