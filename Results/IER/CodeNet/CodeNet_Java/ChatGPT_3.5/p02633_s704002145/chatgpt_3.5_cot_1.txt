<<<Analysis>>>
The variable x is initialized with 90 according to the input. The variable deg is initialized with 360 and the variable ans is initialized with 0.
It enters a while loop and checks if deg is not divisible by x. If it is not divisible, it adds deg/x to ans and updates deg to 360+deg%x.
The loop continues until deg is divisible by x. After the loop finishes, it adds deg/x to ans and prints the value of ans as output.
