<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers A, B, and C as input. It then finds the maximum value among A, B, and C using the Math.max() function and assigns it to the variable M.
Next, it checks if the sum of A, B, and C modulo 2 is equal to M modulo 2. If it is, it calculates and prints the value of (3*M - (A+B+C))/2. Otherwise, it calculates and prints the value of ((3*M + 3) - (A+B+C))/2.
In this case, the input values are 2, 5, and 4. The maximum value among them is 5. The sum of 2, 5, and 4 is 11, which is odd. The maximum value 5 is also odd. So, the condition (A+B+C)%2 == M%2 is true.
Therefore, the code will calculate and print the value of (3*5 - (2+5+4))/2, which simplifies to (15 - 11)/2 = 2.
