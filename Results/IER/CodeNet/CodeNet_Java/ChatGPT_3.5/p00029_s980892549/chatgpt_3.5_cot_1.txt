<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a sentence as input and splits it into an array of words using the split() method. It then initializes variables i, j, k, l, and m. It also initializes two empty strings str1 and str2. It creates an array cnt of the same length as the sentence array and initializes all elements to 0.

Next, it enters a nested for loop to count the frequency of each word in the sentence. It compares each word with every other word in the sentence and increments the corresponding element in the cnt array if a match is found.

After that, it finds the word with the highest frequency by iterating through the cnt array and updating the max and str1 variables accordingly.

Then, it finds the longest word in the sentence by iterating through the sentence array and updating the longest and str2 variables accordingly.

Finally, it prints the word with the highest frequency (str1) followed by the longest word (str2).
