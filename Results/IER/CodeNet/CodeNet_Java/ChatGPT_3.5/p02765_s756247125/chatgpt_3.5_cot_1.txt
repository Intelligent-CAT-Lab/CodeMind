<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 2 and variable r is initialized with 2919 according to the input.
Then it checks if n is greater than or equal to 10. Since n is 2, the condition is not met.
So it calculates the value of variable na as 100*(10-n)+r, which is 100*(10-2)+2919 = 1000+2919 = 3919.
Finally, it prints the value of variable na as output, which is 3919.
<<<Output>>>
3919
