<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input `n` and converts it into a string `str`. Then it calls the `permutation` method passing `str` as the first parameter and an empty string as the second parameter. 

The `permutation` method is a recursive method that generates all possible permutations of the characters in the input string `q`. It takes two parameters: `q` which represents the remaining characters to be permuted, and `ans` which represents the current permutation being built.

In the base case, when the length of `q` is less than or equal to 1, the method prints the current permutation `ans` followed by the remaining character `q`.

In the general case, the method iterates over each character in `q` and recursively calls itself with the remaining characters after removing the current character. It appends the current character to the current permutation `ans` and adds a space before it if `ans` is not empty.

The method is called initially with an empty `ans` and the entire string `str`. So it will generate all possible permutations of the characters in `str` and print them.
