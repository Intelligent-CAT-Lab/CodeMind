<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 2 according to the input. And an empty string str is initialized.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is converted to a string and stored in variable str2.
Then the string str2 is concatenated to the string str.
After the loop finishes, it calls the permutation method passing the string str and an empty string as arguments.
Inside the permutation method, it checks if the length of the string q is less than or equal to 1. If it is, it prints the concatenation of the string ans and q as output.
If the length of the string q is greater than 1, it enters a for loop and iterates through each character of the string q.
Inside the loop, it calls the permutation method recursively by passing a modified version of the string q and a modified version of the string ans as arguments.
The modified version of the string q is obtained by removing the character at index i from the original string q.
The modified version of the string ans is obtained by concatenating the character at index i of the original string q to the original string ans.
After the loop finishes, the program execution ends.
