<<<Analysis>>>
The variables A, B, and C are initialized with the values 4, 12, and 20 respectively according to the input. The variable count is initialized with 0.
It enters a while loop and checks if A, B, and C are all divisible by 2. If they are, it performs the following operations:
- If A, B, and C are all equal, it prints -1 and returns.
- Otherwise, it assigns the values of B and C to A, the values of A and C to B, and the values of A and B to C. This is done by calculating the average of two variables and assigning it to the third variable.
After each iteration of the while loop, the count variable is incremented by 1.
The while loop continues until at least one of A, B, or C is not divisible by 2.
Finally, it prints the value of the count variable as the output.
