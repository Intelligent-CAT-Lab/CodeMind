<<<Analysis>>>
The variables A, B, and C are initialized with 4, 12, and 20 respectively according to the input. The variable count is initialized with 0. 
The code enters a while loop and checks if A, B, and C are all divisible by 2. If they are, it performs the following operations:
- If A, B, and C are all equal, it prints -1 and returns.
- Otherwise, it assigns the values of B and C to A, the values of A and C to B, and the values of A and B to C. Then it increments the count variable by 1.
The while loop continues until at least one of A, B, or C is not divisible by 2.
After the while loop finishes, it prints the final value of the count variable as the output.
<<<Output>>>
