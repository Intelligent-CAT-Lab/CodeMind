<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, n and k. It then checks if k is equal to 1. If it is, the value of ans is set to 0. Otherwise, the value of ans is set to n - k. Finally, the value of ans is printed as the output.

In this case, the input is "3 2". So, n will be 3 and k will be 2. Since k is not equal to 1, the value of ans will be 3 - 2, which is 1.
