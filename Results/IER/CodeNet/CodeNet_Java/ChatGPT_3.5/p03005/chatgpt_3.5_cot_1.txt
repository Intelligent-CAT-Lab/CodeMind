<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 3 and variable k is initialized with 2 according to the input. The variable ans is initialized with 0.
It checks if the value of variable k is equal to 1. If it is, then it assigns 0 to variable ans. Otherwise, it assigns the value of n - k to variable ans.
In this case, k is not equal to 1, so the value of ans will be 3 - 2 = 1.
Finally, it prints the value of ans as output, which is 1.
