<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input and stores it in variable a. Then it calculates the individual digits of the input number by dividing it by 100, 10 and 1 and storing the remainder in variables a100, a10 and a1 respectively. Then it calculates the reverse of the input number by multiplying the individual digits in reverse order and storing it in variable rev. 
Next, it checks if the input number is equal to its reverse. If it is, it assigns the string "Yes" to variable ans. Otherwise, it assigns the string "No" to variable ans.
Finally, it prints the value of variable ans as output.
<<<Output>>>
No
