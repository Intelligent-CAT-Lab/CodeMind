<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input and stores it in variable a. Then it calculates the individual digits of the input number by dividing it by 100, 10, and 1 and storing the remainder in variables a100, a10, and a1 respectively. Then it calculates the reverse of the input number by multiplying the individual digits in reverse order and storing it in variable rev. 
Next, it checks if the input number is equal to its reverse. If they are equal, it assigns the string "Yes" to variable ans. Otherwise, it assigns the string "No" to variable ans.
Finally, it prints the value of variable ans as the output.
In this case, the input number is 575. So, a100 = 5, a10 = 7, a1 = 5. The reverse of 575 is 575. Therefore, the value of variable ans will be "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
