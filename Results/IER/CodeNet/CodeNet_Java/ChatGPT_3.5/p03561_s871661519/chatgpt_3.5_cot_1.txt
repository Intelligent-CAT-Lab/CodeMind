<<<Analysis>>>
The variable k is initialized with 3 and variable n is initialized with 2 according to the input.
It checks if k is even or odd. Since k is odd, it enters the else block.
Inside the else block, it creates an ArrayList called res and adds (k+1)/2 to the list n times.
Then it calculates the value of cnt as n/2.
It enters a for loop and iterates cnt times.
Inside the loop, it checks if the last element of res is greater than 1. If it is, it subtracts 1 from the last element and adds k to the list until the size of res becomes n. If the last element is not greater than 1, it removes the last element from the list.
After the loop finishes, it enters another for loop and iterates through the elements of res. It prints each element followed by a space if it is not the last element, otherwise it prints a new line.
So the output would be "2 2" since k is 3 and n is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2 2
