<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two long integers as input, a and b.
Then it calls the toString() method passing the result of a bitwise AND operation between a and b as an argument. The toString() method converts the result to a binary string representation and prints it.
Next, it calls the toString() method passing the result of a bitwise OR operation between a and b as an argument. The toString() method converts the result to a binary string representation and prints it.
Finally, it calls the toString() method passing the result of a bitwise XOR operation between a and b as an argument. The toString() method converts the result to a binary string representation and prints it.
The toString() method converts the long integer to a binary string representation by repeatedly dividing the number by 2 and appending the remainder to a StringBuilder object. The StringBuilder object is then reversed and converted to a string.
In this case, the bitwise AND operation between 8 and 10 is 8, the bitwise OR operation is 10, and the bitwise XOR operation is 2.
