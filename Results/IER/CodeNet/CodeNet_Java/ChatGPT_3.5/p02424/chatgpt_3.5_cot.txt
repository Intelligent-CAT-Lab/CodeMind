<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two long integers as input, a and b.
Then it calls the toString() method passing the result of a bitwise AND operation between a and b as an argument. The toString() method converts the result to a binary string representation and returns it.
Next, it calls the toString() method passing the result of a bitwise OR operation between a and b as an argument. The toString() method converts the result to a binary string representation and returns it.
Finally, it calls the toString() method passing the result of a bitwise XOR operation between a and b as an argument. The toString() method converts the result to a binary string representation and returns it.
The output of the code will be the binary string representations of the results of the bitwise AND, OR, and XOR operations between a and b.
