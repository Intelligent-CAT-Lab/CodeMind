<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers N and K as input using the Scanner class.
It then calculates the difference between N and K and adds 1 to it.
Finally, it prints the result as the output.
In this case, N is 4 and K is 2.
So, the difference between N and K is 2.
Adding 1 to it gives us the result 3.
