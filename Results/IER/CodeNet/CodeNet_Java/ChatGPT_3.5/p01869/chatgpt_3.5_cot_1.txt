<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads an input integer n. If n is equal to 1, it prints -1 and returns. Otherwise, it calls the function func(n) to calculate the maximum possible value of the expression func(now / d) + func(d), where now is the current value of n and d is a divisor of now. The function func(n) uses dynamic programming to store the calculated values in a hashmap to avoid redundant calculations. It iterates through all possible divisors of now and recursively calls func() to calculate the maximum value. If the calculated maximum value is -1, it means that no valid divisor is found, so it sets res to -100000000. Finally, it prints the maximum value res if it is greater than -1, otherwise it prints -1.
<<<Output>>>
-1
