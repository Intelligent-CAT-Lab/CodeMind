<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a list called "list" and adds integers from 2 to 13 to the list. It then adds the integer 1 to the list.
The code reads two integers, "a" and "b", from the input.
The code finds the indices of "a" and "b" in the list.
If the index of "a" is less than the index of "b", it prints "Bob".
If the index of "a" is equal to the index of "b", it prints "Draw".
If the index of "a" is greater than the index of "b", it prints "Alice".
In this case, "a" is 8 and "b" is 6. The index of 8 in the list is 7 and the index of 6 in the list is 5. Therefore, the output will be "Alice".
<<<Output>>>
Alice
