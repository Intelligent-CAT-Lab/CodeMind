<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 3 according to the input. 
Then it calls the solve() method passing N as an argument.
Inside the solve() method, it checks if n is equal to 0 or 1. If it is, it returns 1 or 2 respectively.
If n/2 is already present in the check map, it retrieves the value and assigns it to variable a. Otherwise, it recursively calls the solve() method passing n/2 as an argument and stores the result in variable a. It also puts the value of n/2 and a in the check map.
Similarly, if n/2-1 is already present in the check map, it retrieves the value and assigns it to variable b. Otherwise, it recursively calls the solve() method passing n/2-1 as an argument and stores the result in variable b. It also puts the value of n/2-1 and b in the check map.
Finally, it checks if n is odd or even. If it is odd, it returns (2*a + b) % 1000000007. If it is even, it returns (2*b + a) % 1000000007.
In this case, n is 3 which is odd. So it returns (2*a + b) % 1000000007.
