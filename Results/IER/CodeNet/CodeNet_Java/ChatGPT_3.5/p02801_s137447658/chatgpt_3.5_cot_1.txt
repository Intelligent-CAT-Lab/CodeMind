<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string using the Scanner class. It then extracts the first character of the input string and assigns it to variable 'a'. It then converts the ASCII value of 'a' to an integer and assigns it to variable 'b'. Finally, it adds 1 to the ASCII value of 'a' and converts it back to a character, which is assigned to variable 'c'. The code then prints the value of 'c' as the output.

In this case, the input string is "a". The ASCII value of 'a' is 97. Adding 1 to 97 gives 98, which corresponds to the character 'b'. Therefore, the output of the code would be 'b'.
