<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three long integers as input: n, a, and b. It calculates the value of ans using the following formula:
ans = (n / (a + b)) * a + Math.min(a, n % (a + b))
Here, n / (a + b) gives the number of complete cycles of length (a + b) that can be formed using n. Multiplying it by a gives the sum of a for each complete cycle.
n % (a + b) gives the remaining elements after forming complete cycles. Math.min(a, n % (a + b)) gives the minimum value between a and the remaining elements.
Finally, the value of ans is printed as the output.

In this case, n = 8, a = 3, and b = 4.
The value of ans can be calculated as follows:
ans = (8 / (3 + 4)) * 3 + Math.min(3, 8 % (3 + 4))
    = (8 / 7) * 3 + Math.min(3, 8 % 7)
    = 1 * 3 + Math.min(3, 1)
    = 3 + 1
    = 4

<<<Output>>>
4
