<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three long integers as input: n, a, and b. It then calculates the value of ans using the following formula:
ans = (n / (a + b)) * a + Math.min(a, n % (a + b))

Let's break down the formula:
1. (n / (a + b)) * a: This calculates the number of complete segments of length (a + b) that can be formed from n. It then multiplies this value by a to get the sum of all complete segments.
2. Math.min(a, n % (a + b)): This calculates the remaining length after forming complete segments. It takes the minimum value between a and n % (a + b) to account for the case where the remaining length is less than a.

Finally, the code prints the value of ans as the output.

In this case, n = 8, a = 3, and b = 4.
1. (8 / (3 + 4)) * 3 = 1 * 3 = 3
2. Math.min(3, 8 % (3 + 4)) = Math.min(3, 8 % 7) = Math.min(3, 1) = 1

Therefore, the output of the code would be 3 + 1 = 4.
