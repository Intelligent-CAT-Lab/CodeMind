<<<Analysis>>>
The code first initializes variables a, b, d, r, and f. Then it creates a Scanner object to read input from the user.
It reads two integers from the input and assigns them to variables a and b.
Then it performs integer division of a by b and assigns the result to variable d.
Next, it calculates the remainder of a divided by b and assigns it to variable r.
After that, it calculates the floating-point division of a by b and assigns the result to variable f.
Finally, it prints the values of d, r, and f in the specified format.

In this case, a is 3 and b is 2.
d = 3 / 2 = 1 (integer division)
r = 3 % 2 = 1 (remainder)
f = 3 / 2 = 1.5 (floating-point division)

<<<Output>>>
1 1 1.50000
