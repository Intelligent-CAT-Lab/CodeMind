<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input using the Scanner class. It adds 1 to the first integer and then divides the result by 2. It then compares this result with the second integer. If the result is greater than or equal to the second integer, it prints "YES", otherwise it prints "NO".
In this case, the first integer is 3 and the second integer is 2. So, (3 + 1) / 2 = 2. Since 2 is equal to the second integer 2, the condition is true and "YES" will be printed.
<<<Output>>>
YES
