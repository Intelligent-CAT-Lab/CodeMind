<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input using the Scanner class. It then performs the following operations:
1. It adds 1 to the first input and divides the result by 2.
2. It compares the result of the above operation with the second input.
3. If the result is greater than or equal to the second input, it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".

In this case, the first input is 3 and the second input is 2.
1. (3 + 1) / 2 = 2
2. 2 >= 2 (condition is true)
3. "YES" is printed as the output.

<<<Output>>>
YES
