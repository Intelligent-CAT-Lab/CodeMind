<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input and passes it to the solve() method. Inside the solve() method, it checks the value of the input integer. If the input is 0, it returns 1. If the input is 1, it returns 2. If the input is 2, it returns 1. For any other input, it returns 0.
In the main() method, it creates an instance of the Main class, calls the run() method passing System.in and System.out as arguments, and then closes the scanner.
