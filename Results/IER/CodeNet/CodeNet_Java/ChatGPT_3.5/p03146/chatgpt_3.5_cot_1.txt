<<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized with the value 8 according to the input. A HashSet named set is created and the value of s is added to it.
A variable i is initialized with the value 1.
Then, a while loop is executed indefinitely until a condition is met.
Inside the loop, the value of i is incremented by 1.
Then, it checks if the value of s is divisible by 2. If it is, the value of s is divided by 2.
If the value of s is not divisible by 2, it is multiplied by 3 and 1 is added to it.
Then, it checks if the set contains the value of s. If it does, it prints the value of i and returns from the method.
If the set does not contain the value of s, it adds the value of s to the set.
The loop continues until the condition is met.
