<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string as input and passes it to the function `fun()`. 
Inside the `fun()` function, it calculates the length of the string and initializes a variable `res` with 0.
Then it iterates over the first half of the string and checks if the character at index `i` is equal to the character at index `len-1-i`, where `len` is the length of the string.
If the characters are not equal, it increments the `res` variable by 1.
Finally, it returns the value of `res`.
In the main function, it takes the input string from the user and passes it to the `fun()` function. The returned value from `fun()` is then printed as the output.
