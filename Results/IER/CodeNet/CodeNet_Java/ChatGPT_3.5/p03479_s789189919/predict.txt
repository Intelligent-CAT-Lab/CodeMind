The variable X is initialized with 3 and variable Y is initialized with 20 according to the input. Variable A is initialized with the value of X and variable ans is initialized with 1.
It enters a while loop which runs indefinitely until a condition is met to break the loop.
Inside the loop, it checks if the value of A is less than 0. If it is, it multiplies A by -2. Otherwise, it multiplies A by 2.
Then it checks if the value of A is less than or equal to Y. If it is, it increments the value of ans by 1.
If the condition is not met, it prints the value of ans and returns from the main method.
In this case, the loop runs as follows:
1. A = 3, A is not less than 0, so A is multiplied by 2, A becomes 6. ans is incremented to 2.
2. A = 6, A is not less than 0, so A is multiplied by 2, A becomes 12. ans is incremented to 3.
3. A = 12, A is not less than 0, so A is multiplied by 2, A becomes 24. ans is incremented to 4.
4. A = 24, A is not less than 0, so A is multiplied by 2, A becomes 48. ans is incremented to 5.
5. A = 48, A is not less than 0, so A is multiplied by 2, A becomes 96. ans is incremented to 6.
6. A = 96, A is not less than 0, so A is multiplied by 2, A becomes 192. ans is incremented to 7.
7. A = 192, A is not less than 0, so A is multiplied by 2, A becomes 384. ans is incremented to 8.
8. A = 384, A is not less than 0, so A is multiplied by 2, A becomes 768. ans is incremented to 9.
9. A = 768, A is not less than 0, so A is multiplied by 2, A becomes 1536. ans is incremented to 10.
10. A = 1536, A is not less than 0, so A is multiplied by 2, A becomes 3072. ans is incremented to 11.
11. A = 3072, A is not less than 0, so A is multiplied by 2, A becomes 6144. ans is incremented to 12.
12. A = 6144, A is not less than 0, so A is multiplied by 2, A becomes 12288. ans is incremented to 13.
13. A = 12288, A is not less than 0, so A is multiplied by 2, A becomes 24576. ans is incremented to 14.
14. A = 24576, A is not less than 0, so A is multiplied by 2, A becomes 49152. ans is incremented to 15.
15. A = 49152, A is not less than 0, so A is multiplied by 2, A becomes 98304. ans is incremented to 16.
16. A = 98304, A is not less than 0, so A is multiplied by 2, A becomes 196608. ans is incremented to 17.
17. A = 196608, A is not less than 0, so A is multiplied by 2, A becomes 393216. ans is incremented to 18.
18. A = 393216, A is not less than 0, so A is multiplied by 2, A becomes 786432. ans is incremented to 19.
19. A = 786432, A is not less than 0, so A is multiplied by 2, A becomes 1572864. ans is incremented to 20.
20. A = 1572864, A is not less than 0, so A is multiplied by 2, A becomes 3145728. ans is incremented to 21.
21. A = 3145728, A is not less than 0, so A is multiplied by 2, A becomes 6291456. ans is incremented to 22.
22. A = 6291456, A is not less than 0, so A is multiplied by 2, A becomes 12582912. ans is incremented to 23.
23. A = 12582912, A is not less than 0, so A is multiplied by 2, A becomes 25165824. ans is incremented to
