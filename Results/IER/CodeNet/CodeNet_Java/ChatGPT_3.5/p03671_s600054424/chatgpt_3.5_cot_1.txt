<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input: a, b, and c. It then calculates the maximum value among a, b, and c using the max() function from the Math class. The result is stored in the variable result. Finally, the value of result is printed as the output.

In this case, the input values are 700, 600, and 780. The maximum value among these three is 780. Therefore, the value of result will be 700 + 600 + 780 - 780 = 1500.

<<<Output>>>
1500
