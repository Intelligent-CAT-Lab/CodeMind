<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads three integers n, x, and y from the input. It then calculates the minimum of x and y and assigns it to a variable called "min". It also calculates the maximum of (x + y - n) and 0 and assigns it to a variable called "max". Finally, it prints the values of "min" and "max" separated by a space and followed by a line break.
In this case, n = 10, x = 3, and y = 5. The minimum of x and y is 3. The maximum of (x + y - n) and 0 is 0. Therefore, the output would be "3 0".
<<<Output>>>
3 0
