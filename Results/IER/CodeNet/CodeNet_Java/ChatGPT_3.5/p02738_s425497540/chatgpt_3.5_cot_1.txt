The variable n is initialized with 1 and the variable mod is initialized with 998244353 according to the input.
A 2D array dp is created with dimensions (3*n+1) and (2*n+1). All elements of dp are initialized with 0 except for dp[0][n] which is initialized with 1.
Then a nested for loop is used to calculate the values of dp. The outer loop iterates from 1 to 3*n and the inner loop iterates from 1 to 3.
Inside the inner loop, there are three cases based on the value of j:
- If j is 3, it calculates the value of dp[i][k] by multiplying dp[i-3][k] with (i-3+2) * (i-3+1) and taking the modulo with mod.
- If j is 2, it calculates the value of dp[i][k] by multiplying dp[i-2][k+1] with (i-2+1) and taking the modulo with mod.
- If j is 1, it calculates the value of dp[i][k] by adding dp[i-1][k-1] to dp[i-1][2*n] and taking the modulo with mod.
After the nested for loop, it calculates the final answer by summing up the values of dp[3*n][i] for i ranging from n to 2*n.
Finally, it prints the answer modulo mod as the output.
