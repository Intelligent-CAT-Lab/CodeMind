<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads 5 integers from the input: a, b, ab, x, and y. Then it initializes a variable r with the maximum value of a long integer.
It enters a for loop that iterates from the maximum of x and y multiplied by 2 down to 0. In each iteration, it calculates the cost of buying items based on the current value of i.
The cost is calculated as ab multiplied by i plus the maximum of 0 and the difference between x and i divided by 2 multiplied by a plus the maximum of 0 and the difference between y and i divided by 2 multiplied by b.
The minimum cost is updated in the variable r in each iteration.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of r as the output.
