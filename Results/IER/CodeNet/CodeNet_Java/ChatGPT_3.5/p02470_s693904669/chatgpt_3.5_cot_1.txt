<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 6 according to the input. The variable ans is initialized with 1. The for loop iterates from 2 to n. Inside the loop, the variable cnt is initialized with 0. Then it enters a while loop which runs as long as n is divisible by i. Inside the while loop, it increments the cnt variable and divides n by i. After the while loop, it checks if cnt is greater than 0. If it is, it calculates ans by multiplying the difference between i raised to the power of cnt and i raised to the power of cnt-1. Finally, it prints the value of ans as output, which is 4.
