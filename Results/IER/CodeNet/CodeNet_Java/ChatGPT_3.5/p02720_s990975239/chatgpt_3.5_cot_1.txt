<<<Analysis>>>
The variable k is initialized with 15 according to the input. And a new ArrayDeque object que is created.
Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 9 to add each integer i to the front of the deque que.
After the loop, it initializes three long variables cnt, temp and modTen with 0.
Then it enters a while loop and it continues to execute the loop until the value of cnt is equal to k.
Inside the loop, it increments the value of cnt by 1.
Then it removes the last element from the deque que and assigns it to the variable temp.
It calculates the remainder of temp divided by 10 and assigns it to the variable modTen.
If modTen is not equal to 0, it adds temp * 10 + modTen - 1 to the front of the deque que.
It adds temp * 10 + modTen to the front of the deque que.
If modTen is not equal to 9, it adds temp * 10 + modTen + 1 to the front of the deque que.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable temp as output.
