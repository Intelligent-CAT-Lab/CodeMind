<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input `k` and initializes an array `parent`, `rank`, and `num` with size `k`. It then calls the `init` method to initialize these arrays. The `init` method sets each element in the `parent` array to its index, and sets each element in the `num` array to 1.

Next, the code enters a for loop that iterates from 1 to `k-1`. In each iteration, it calls the `unite` method with `i` and `(i*10)%k` as arguments. The `unite` method merges the sets containing `i` and `(i*10)%k` by updating the `parent` and `num` arrays.

After that, the code initializes an array of `HashSet` called `edges` with size `k`. It then enters a for loop that iterates from 0 to `k-1`. In each iteration, it checks if the sets containing `i` and `(i+1)%k` are different using the `same` method. If they are different, it adds the root of `(i+1)%k` to the `edges` array at index `root(i)`.

Next, the code creates a `ArrayDeque` called `dq` and adds the root of 1 to it. It also initializes an array `d` with size `k` and sets each element to -1. It then sets `d[root(1)]` to 0.

The code enters a while loop that continues as long as `dq` is not empty. In each iteration, it removes the first element from `dq` and assigns it to `now`. It then iterates over the elements in the `edges` array at index `now`. If the element is not visited (i.e., `d[next]` is -1), it sets `d[next]` to `d[now] + 1` and adds `next` to the end of `dq`.

Finally, the code prints `d[root(0)] + 1` as the output.
