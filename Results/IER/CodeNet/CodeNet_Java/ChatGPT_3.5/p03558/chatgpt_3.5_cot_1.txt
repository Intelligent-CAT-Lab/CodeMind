<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input k and initializes an array parent, rank, and num of size k.
It then calls the init() method to initialize the parent and num arrays.
Next, it enters a for loop from i=1 to i<k and calls the unite() method to unite the elements i and (i*10)%k.
After that, it initializes an array of HashSet called edges of size k.
Then, it enters a for loop from i=0 to i<k and checks if the elements i and (i+1)%k are not in the same set using the same() method.
If they are not in the same set, it adds the root of i+1 to the HashSet at index root(i) in the edges array.
Next, it initializes an ArrayDeque called dq and adds the root of 1 to it.
It also initializes an array d of size k and sets all elements to -1.
Then, it sets d[root(1)] to 0.
Next, it enters a while loop while dq is not empty.
Inside the loop, it removes the first element from dq and assigns it to the variable now.
Then, it enters a for loop to iterate over the elements in the HashSet at index now in the edges array.
For each element next, it checks if d[next] is less than 0.
If it is, it sets d[next] to d[now]+1 and adds next to dq.
After the while loop finishes, it prints d[root(0)]+1 as the output.
