<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes input from the user in the form of a string and splits it into three parts: a, b, and angle. These values are then converted to double data type. 
The code then checks if the angle is 90 degrees. If it is, it calculates the area, circumference, and height of a right-angled triangle using the given formulae. 
If the angle is not 90 degrees, it calculates the area, circumference, and height of a general triangle using the given formulae. 
Finally, it prints the calculated values of area, circumference, and height.
In this case, the angle is 90 degrees, so the code will calculate the values for a right-angled triangle.
The area will be (4 * 3) / 2 = 6.
The circumference will be sqrt(4^2 + 3^2) + 4 + 3 = 12.83.
The height will be 3.
