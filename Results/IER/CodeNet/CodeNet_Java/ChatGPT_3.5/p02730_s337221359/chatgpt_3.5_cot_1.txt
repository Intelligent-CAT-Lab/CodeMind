<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string input from the user and stores it in the variable 's'. It then calculates the length of the string and stores it in the variable 'n'. 
Next, it creates two substrings - 'left' and 'right' - from the original string 's'. The 'left' substring contains the characters from index 0 to ((n + 1) / 2) - 1, and the 'right' substring contains the characters from index ((n + 3) / 2) - 1 to the end of the string.
The code then calls the 'function' method three times - once with the original string 's', once with the 'left' substring, and once with the 'right' substring. If all three function calls return true, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".
The 'function' method takes a string input and checks if it is a palindrome. It first calculates the length of the string and stores it in the variable 'len'. It then calculates the index of the center character and stores it in the variable 'center'.
If the length of the string is even, it creates two substrings - 'left' and 'right' - from the original string. The 'left' substring contains the characters from index 0 to center-1, and the 'right' substring contains the characters from index center to the end of the string. It then reverses the 'right' substring using the 'reverse' method and checks if 'left' is equal to the reversed 'right' substring. If they are equal, it returns true.
If the length of the string is odd, it creates two substrings - 'left' and 'right' - from the original string. The 'left' substring contains the characters from index 0 to center, and the 'right' substring contains the characters from index center to the end of the string. It then reverses the 'right' substring using the 'reverse' method and checks if 'left' is equal to the reversed 'right' substring. If they are equal, it returns true.
The 'reverse' method takes a string input and reverses it by creating a StringBuilder object and appending the characters of the input string in reverse order. It then returns the reversed string.
