<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string `s` and initializes variables `n` and `count` with the length of `s` and an array of size `2 * n + 1` respectively. It also initializes variable `now` with 0.
Then it iterates through each character in the string `s`. If the character is '(', it increments `now` by 1. If the character is ')', it decrements `now` by 1.
After updating `now`, it increments the value at index `now + n` in the `count` array.
Then it resets `now` to 0 and initializes variable `ans` with 0.
It again iterates through each character in the string `s`. If the character is '(', it increments `now` by 1. If the character is ')', it decrements `now` by 1.
After updating `now`, it decrements the value at index `now + n` in the `count` array and adds the value to `ans`.
Finally, it prints the value of `ans` as the output.

In this case, the input string is `((()())())`.
The length of the string is 10.
The code first counts the number of opening and closing brackets at each position and stores it in the `count` array.
Then it calculates the number of valid substrings by iterating through each character and adding the count of closing brackets at each position.
The final value of `ans` is the total number of valid substrings.
