The code reads the values of variables w, h, g, and n from the input. Then it initializes arrays xs and ys with size n and reads n pairs of integers into these arrays. After that, it reads a string into variable run and appends a "$" at the end of the string. 

The code then calls the solve() method. In the solve() method, it initializes a variable sum with 0. It then enters a for loop that iterates 4 times. In each iteration, it calls the solve1() method and adds the returned value to the sum. It then updates the values of gx and gy by rotating them 90 degrees clockwise. It also updates the values of xs and ys by rotating them 90 degrees clockwise. Finally, it swaps the values of w and h.

In the solve1() method, it initializes two arrays of TreeSet objects, sets1 and sets2. It then adds -1 and h to each TreeSet object in sets1 and adds -1 and w to each TreeSet object in sets2. It then adds the values of xs and ys to the corresponding TreeSet objects in sets1 and sets2. It also adds the values of gx and gy to the corresponding TreeSet objects in sets1 and sets2.

The method then initializes a variable sum with 1. It enters a for loop that iterates over the values of x from 0 to w-1. In each iteration, it initializes a variable py with -2. It then iterates over the values of y in the TreeSet object at index x in sets1. In each iteration, it initializes a variable sy with y-1. If sy is not equal to py, it checks if the point (x, sy) is reachable from the current position (x, y) with direction 0 (up). If it is reachable, it adds y-py-1 to the sum. Finally, it updates py with y.

The method then returns the value of sum.

After the for loop in the solve() method finishes, it prints the value of sum as the output.
