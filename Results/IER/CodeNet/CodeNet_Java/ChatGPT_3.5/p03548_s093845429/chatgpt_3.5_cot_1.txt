The variable x, variable y and variable z are initialized with 13, 3 and 1 respectively according to the input. And variable answer is initialized with 0.
It enters a while loop with condition true, which means it will keep looping until a break statement is encountered.
Inside the while loop, it checks if the value of variable answer is 0. If it is, it checks if y+2*z is greater than x. If it is, it breaks out of the loop. Otherwise, it increments the value of variable answer by 1 and subtracts y+2*z from x.
If the value of variable answer is not 0, it checks if y+z is greater than x. If it is, it breaks out of the loop. Otherwise, it increments the value of variable answer by 1 and subtracts y+z from x.
The loop continues until a break statement is encountered.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable answer as output.
