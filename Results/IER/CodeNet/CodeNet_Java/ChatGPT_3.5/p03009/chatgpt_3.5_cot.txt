<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input: n, h, and d. It then initializes a modular object with a value of 1e9 + 7 and a factorial object with a limit of n. It also initializes an array dp of size h+1 and sets the first element to the factorial of n. It calculates the sum of factorials from 1 to n and stores it in the variable factSum. It then iterates from 1 to h and calculates the value of dp[i] based on the previous values of dp and preDpSum. Finally, it prints the value of dp[h].
