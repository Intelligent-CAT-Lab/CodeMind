<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n, variable h and variable d are initialized with 2, 2 and 1 respectively according to the input. 
It creates an instance of the Modular class with a modulus of 1e9 + 7 and an instance of the Factorial class with a limit of n and the Modular instance.
It initializes an array dp with a size of h + 1 and sets the first element dp[0] to the factorial of n.
It initializes a variable factSum to 0 and calculates the sum of factorials from 1 to n and stores it in factSum.
It initializes an array preDpSum with a size of h + 1 and sets the first element preDpSum[0] to dp[0].
It then iterates from 1 to h and calculates the value of dp[i] based on the previous values of dp and preDpSum.
It updates preDpSum[i] with the sum of dp[0] to dp[i].
Finally, it prints the value of dp[h] as the output.
