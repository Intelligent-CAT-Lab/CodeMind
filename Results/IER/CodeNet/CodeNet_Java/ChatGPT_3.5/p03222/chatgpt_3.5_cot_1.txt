<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input: H, W, and K. It then initializes a 2D array dp with dimensions (H+1) x W and sets dp[0][0] to 1. It also calls the makeMemo() method to populate the memo array.

The code then enters a nested for loop, where the outer loop iterates from 0 to H-1 and the inner loop iterates from 0 to W-1. Inside the loop, it performs the following operations:

1. If w+1 < W, it adds dp[h][w] * memo[w] * memo[(W-1)-(w+1)] to dp[h+1][w+1]. This represents moving right from position (h, w) to (h+1, w+1).

2. If w-1 >= 0, it adds dp[h][w] * memo[w-1] * memo[(W-1)-w] to dp[h+1][w-1]. This represents moving left from position (h, w) to (h+1, w-1).

3. It adds dp[h][w] * memo[w] * memo[(W-1)-w] to dp[h+1][w]. This represents moving down from position (h, w) to (h+1, w).

After the loop finishes, it assigns the value of dp[H][K-1] to the variable ans and prints it as the output.
