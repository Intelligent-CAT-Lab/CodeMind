<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers H, W, and K as input. It then calls the makeMemo() function to initialize the memo array. 

After that, it creates a 2D array dp with dimensions (H+1) x W and initializes dp[0][0] to 1.

Then, it enters a nested for loop to calculate the values of dp. The outer loop iterates from 0 to H-1 and the inner loop iterates from 0 to W-1.

Inside the loop, it calculates the values of dp[h+1][w+1], dp[h+1][w-1], and dp[h+1][w] based on the values of dp[h][w], memo[w], and memo[(W-1)-w].

Finally, it assigns the value of dp[H][K-1] to the variable ans and prints it as the output.
