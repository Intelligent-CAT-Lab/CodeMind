<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 3 according to the input. 
The code then creates a 2D array e with size n x n and an array l with size n+1.
The for loop initializes the array l with values based on the formula l[i] = 1 + l[(i + 1) >> 1].
The addEdges method is called with parameters e, l, 0, and n to populate the 2D array e.
The addEdges method is a recursive method that adds edges to the 2D array e based on the values in the array l.
The solve method then prints the values in the 2D array e.
