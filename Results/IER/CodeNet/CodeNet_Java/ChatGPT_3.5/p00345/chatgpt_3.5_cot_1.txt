<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string "0.(3)" and splits it into two parts: "0" and "3". The first part represents the non-recurring part of the decimal and the second part represents the recurring part of the decimal.
The code then converts the recurring part "3" into a fraction by setting the numerator (bn) to 3 and the denominator (bd) to 99 (since the recurring part has 2 digits).
Next, the code splits the non-recurring part "0" into two parts: "0" and an empty string. Since there is no non-recurring part, the numerator (an) remains 0 and the denominator (ad) remains 1.
The code then calculates the least common multiple (lcm) of the denominators (ad and bd) using the lcm() method.
After that, the code calculates the numerator (n) by multiplying the non-recurring numerator (an) by the lcm divided by the non-recurring denominator (ad), and adding it to the recurring numerator (bn) multiplied by the lcm divided by the recurring denominator (bd).
The code also calculates the greatest common divisor (g) of the numerator (n) and denominator (d) using the gcd() method.
Finally, the code divides the numerator (n) and denominator (d) by the greatest common divisor (g) to simplify the fraction.
The code then prints the simplified fraction as output in the format "n/d".

<<<Output>>>
