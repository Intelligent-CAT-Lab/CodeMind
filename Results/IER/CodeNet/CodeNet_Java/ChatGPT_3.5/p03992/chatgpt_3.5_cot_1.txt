<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input from the user and stores it in variable X. Then it initializes an empty StringBuilder object sb.
It then iterates through each character of the string X using a for loop. Inside the loop, it checks if the current index i is equal to 4. If it is, it appends a space and the current character to the StringBuilder sb. Otherwise, it appends only the current character to sb.
After the loop finishes, it converts the StringBuilder sb to a string and prints it as the output.
