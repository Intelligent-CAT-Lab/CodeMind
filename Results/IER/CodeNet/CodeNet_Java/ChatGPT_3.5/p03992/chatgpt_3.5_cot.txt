<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input from the user and stores it in variable X. Then it iterates over each character of the string using a for loop. Inside the loop, it checks if the current index is equal to 4. If it is, it appends a space and the character at that index to a StringBuilder object sb. Otherwise, it appends only the character at that index to sb. Finally, it prints the string representation of sb.

In this case, the input string is "CODEFESTIVAL". The loop iterates over each character of the string. When the index is 4, it appends a space and the character 'F' to sb. For all other indices, it appends the corresponding character to sb. Therefore, the output would be "CODE FESTIVAL".
