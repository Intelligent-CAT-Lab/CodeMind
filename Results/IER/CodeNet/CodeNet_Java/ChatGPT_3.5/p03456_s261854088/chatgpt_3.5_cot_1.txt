<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs from the user and concatenates them into a single string. Then it converts the string into an integer and assigns it to the variable n. 
Next, it calculates the square root of n and assigns it to the variable sqr. 
Then it checks if the floor value of sqr is equal to sqr. If it is, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".
In this case, the value of n is 121, and the square root of 121 is 11. Since the floor value of 11 is equal to 11, the output will be "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
