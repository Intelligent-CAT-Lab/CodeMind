The code defines a class Solution inside the Main class. The Solution class has a method solve() which takes no arguments and throws an IOException. Inside the solve() method, it reads two integers a and b from the input using the InputReader class. Then it prints the product of a and b followed by the sum of 2*a and 2*b.

In the main method, it creates an instance of the Solution class and calls the solve() method. It also initializes the InputReader and PrintWriter objects for reading input and printing output.

So, the code reads two integers a and b from the input and prints the product of a and b followed by the sum of 2*a and 2*b.
