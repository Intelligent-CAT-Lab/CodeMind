<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a class Solution inside the Main class. Inside the Solution class, there is a method solve() which takes no arguments and throws an IOException. Inside the solve() method, it reads two integers a and b from the input using the InputReader class. Then it prints the product of a and b followed by the sum of 2 times a and 2 times b. The output is printed using the PrintWriter class.

In the main method, it creates an instance of the InputReader class to read input from System.in and an instance of the PrintWriter class to print output to System.out. Then it creates an instance of the Solution class and calls the solve() method. Finally, it closes the PrintWriter.
