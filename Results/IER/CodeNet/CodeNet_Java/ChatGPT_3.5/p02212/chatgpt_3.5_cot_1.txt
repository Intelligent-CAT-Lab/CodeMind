<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads 4 integers from the input and stores them in an array `a`. Then it sorts the array in ascending order. The sorted array is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. It then calculates the absolute difference between the sum of the first and last elements of the array (`1 + 4 = 5`) and the sum of the second and third elements of the array (`2 + 3 = 5`). The absolute difference is `0`. Finally, it prints the absolute difference as the output.
