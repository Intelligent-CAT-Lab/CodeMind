<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes 4 integers as input and stores them in an array `a`. Then it sorts the array in ascending order. Finally, it calculates the absolute difference between the sum of the first and last elements of the sorted array and the sum of the second and third elements of the sorted array. The result is printed as the output.
In this case, the input is `2 1 3 4`. After sorting the array, it becomes `1 2 3 4`. The sum of the first and last elements is 1 + 4 = 5, and the sum of the second and third elements is 2 + 3 = 5. So the absolute difference is 0.
