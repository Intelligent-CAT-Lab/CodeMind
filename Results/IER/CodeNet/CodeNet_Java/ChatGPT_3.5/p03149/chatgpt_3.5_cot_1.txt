<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes an array N of size 4 to store the input values. It then uses a for loop to read 4 integers from the input and store them in the array N. The input values are 1, 7, 9, and 4.

After reading the input, the code sorts the array N in ascending order using the Arrays.sort() method. The sorted array N will be [1, 4, 7, 9].

Next, the code checks if the elements of the sorted array N are equal to 1, 4, 7, and 9 respectively. If they are, the boolean variable ans is set to true. In this case, the condition is met because the elements of the sorted array N are indeed 1, 4, 7, and 9.

Finally, the code checks the value of ans. If it is true, it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".

<<<Output>>>
YES
