<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes 4 integers as input and stores them in an array N. Then it sorts the array in ascending order using the Arrays.sort() method. 
After sorting, it checks if the first element of the array is 1, the second element is 4, the third element is 7, and the fourth element is 9. 
If all these conditions are true, it sets the boolean variable ans to true. 
Finally, it checks the value of ans and prints "YES" if it is true, and "NO" otherwise.
In this case, the input is "1 7 9 4", so after sorting the array, the elements will be [1, 4, 7, 9]. 
Since these elements satisfy the conditions, the value of ans will be true and the output will be "YES".
<<<Output>>>
YES
