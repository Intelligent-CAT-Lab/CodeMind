<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two long integers as input, X and Y.
It checks if either X or Y is divisible by 2 (i.e., if either X or Y is even). If either of them is even, it prints "Even" and returns.
If neither X nor Y is even, it prints "Odd".
In this case, X=3 and Y=4. Since Y is even, the condition X%2==0||Y%2==0 is true. Therefore, the code will print "Even" and return.
<<<Output>>>
Even
