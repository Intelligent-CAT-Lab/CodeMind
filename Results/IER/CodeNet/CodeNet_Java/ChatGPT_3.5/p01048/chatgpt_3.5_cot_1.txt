<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes an array called "ans" with some pre-defined values. Then it takes an integer input from the user and stores it in the variable "i". Finally, it prints the value at index "i" in the "ans" array.

In this case, the input is 1. So, the code will print the value at index 1 in the "ans" array, which is 1.

<<<Output>>>
1
