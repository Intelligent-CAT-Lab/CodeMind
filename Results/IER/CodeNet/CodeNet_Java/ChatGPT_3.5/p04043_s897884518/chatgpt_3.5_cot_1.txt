<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input: SideA, SideB, and SideC. It then creates an array arr with these three integers and sorts the array in ascending order. 
Next, it checks if the first element of the sorted array is 5, the second element is 5, and the third element is 7. If all these conditions are true, it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".
In this case, the input is 5 5 7, so the sorted array will be [5, 5, 7]. The conditions for the if statement are all true, so the output will be "YES".
<<<Output>>>
YES
