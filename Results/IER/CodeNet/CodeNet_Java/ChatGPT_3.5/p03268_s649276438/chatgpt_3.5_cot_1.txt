<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N and variable K are initialized with 3 and 2 respectively according to the input. And variable ans is initialized with 0.
It calculates the value of variable baisuu by dividing N by K. Then it calculates the value of variable ans by multiplying baisuu with itself three times.
If K is even, it checks if the remainder of N divided by K is greater than or equal to K/2. If it is, it increments baisuu by 1.
Then it calculates the value of variable ans by multiplying baisuu with itself three times again.
Finally, it prints the value of variable ans as output, which is 1.
