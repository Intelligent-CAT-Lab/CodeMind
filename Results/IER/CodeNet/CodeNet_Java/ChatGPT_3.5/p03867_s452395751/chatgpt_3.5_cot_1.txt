<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and variable k are initialized with 4 and 2 respectively according to the input. 
It initializes an empty list called divisors.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to sqrt(n) to check each integer i in this range. 
Inside the for loop, it checks if i is a divisor of n. If it is, it adds i to the list divisors. It also checks if i^2 is less than n. If it is, it adds n/i to the list divisors.
After the for loop, it sorts the list divisors in ascending order.
It initializes the variable ans with 0 and creates an array called ptn with the same size as the list divisors.
It enters another for loop and it iterates through each element in the list divisors.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of pt by calling the pow method with arguments k and (cycle+1)/2.
It assigns the value of pt to the corresponding index in the array ptn.
It enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to i-1.
Inside the nested for loop, it checks if cycle is divisible by the element at index j in the list divisors. If it is, it adds (MOD - ptn[j]) % MOD to ptn[i] and takes the modulo of ptn[i] with MOD.
It calculates the value of add by multiplying ptn[i] with cycle and taking the modulo of the result with MOD.
If cycle is even, it multiplies add by the inverse of 2 modulo MOD and takes the modulo of the result with MOD.
It adds add to ans.
After the for loop, it prints the value of ans modulo MOD as output.
