<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 2 and variable K is initialized with 2 according to the input.
Then it calculates the value of (K * Math.pow(K - 1, N - 1)) and prints it as output.
Math.pow(K - 1, N - 1) calculates the value of (K - 1) raised to the power of (N - 1).
So the output would be (2 * (2 - 1)^(2 - 1)) = 2.
<<<Output>>>
