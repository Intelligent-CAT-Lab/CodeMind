<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 6 according to the input. 
It calculates the number of divisors of n-1 and stores it in variable n1. It iterates from 2 to the square root of (n-1) and checks if (n-1) is divisible by i. If it is, it increments n1 by 1. If i*i is equal to (n-1), it increments n1 by 1 again. Otherwise, it increments n1 by 2.
It calculates the number of divisors of n and stores it in variable n2. It iterates from 2 to the square root of n and checks if n is divisible by i. If it is, it divides n by i repeatedly until it is no longer divisible by i. If the remainder of n divided by i is 1, it increments n2 by 1.
Finally, it prints the sum of n1 and n2 as output.
