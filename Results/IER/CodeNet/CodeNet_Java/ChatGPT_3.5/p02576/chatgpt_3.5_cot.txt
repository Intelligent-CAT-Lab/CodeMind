<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integer inputs n, x, and t using the Scanner class.
It initializes the variables ans and tako with 0.
Then it enters a while loop which continues until the value of tako is less than n.
Inside the loop, it adds the value of t to ans and the value of x to tako.
After the loop finishes, it prints the value of ans as the output.
In this case, the value of n is 20, x is 12, and t is 6.
The loop will run 2 times because the value of tako will become 12 after the first iteration and then 24 after the second iteration, which is greater than n.
So, the value of ans will be 6 + 6 = 12.
<<<Output>>>
12
