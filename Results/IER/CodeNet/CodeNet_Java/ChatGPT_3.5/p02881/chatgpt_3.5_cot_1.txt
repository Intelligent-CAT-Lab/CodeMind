<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 10 according to the input. And variable sqrt is initialized with the square root of n.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from sqrt to 1 to check each integer i in this range. It checks if n is divisible by i. If it is, it assigns the value of i to variable x and the value of n/i to variable y, and then breaks out of the loop.
After the loop, it checks if both x and y are non-zero. If they are, it calculates the value of ans as (x-1) + (y-1). Otherwise, it calculates the value of ans as n-1.
Finally, it prints the value of ans as output.
