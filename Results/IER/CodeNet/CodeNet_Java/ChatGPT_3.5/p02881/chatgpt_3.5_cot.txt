<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input `10` and assigns it to the variable `n`. It then calculates the square root of `n` and assigns it to the variable `sqrt`. 
It initializes variables `x` and `y` to 0. 
It then enters a for loop that iterates from `sqrt` to 1. 
Inside the loop, it checks if `n` is divisible by `i`. If it is, it assigns the value of `i` to `x` and the value of `n/i` to `y`, and then breaks out of the loop. 
After the loop, it checks if `x` and `y` are both non-zero. If they are, it calculates `ans` as `(x-1) + (y-1)`. Otherwise, it calculates `ans` as `n-1`. 
Finally, it prints the value of `ans` as the output, which is `8`.
