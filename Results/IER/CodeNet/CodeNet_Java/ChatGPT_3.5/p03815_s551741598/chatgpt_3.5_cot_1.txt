The variable X is initialized with the value 7 according to the input.
It enters an if-else statement to check the value of X.
Since X is greater than 6, it goes to the else block.
Inside the else block, it checks if X is divisible by 11. If it is, it prints the value of X divided by 11 multiplied by 2 as output.
If X is not divisible by 11, it checks if the remainder of X divided by 11 is greater than 6. If it is, it prints the floor value of X divided by 11 multiplied by 2 plus 2 as output.
If the remainder of X divided by 11 is not greater than 6, it prints the floor value of X divided by 11 multiplied by 2 plus 1 as output.
In this case, X is 7 and it is not divisible by 11. The remainder of 7 divided by 11 is 7, which is greater than 6. Therefore, the output would be 2.
