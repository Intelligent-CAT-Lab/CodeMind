<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 6 and variable D is initialized with 2 according to the input. 
Then it calculates the value of ans by dividing N by (D * 2 + 1.0). Since D is 2, the denominator becomes 5.0. 
The division is performed using BigDecimal to ensure precision. 
The result is then rounded up to the nearest whole number using the setScale() method with RoundingMode.CEILING. 
Finally, the value of ans is printed as output, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
