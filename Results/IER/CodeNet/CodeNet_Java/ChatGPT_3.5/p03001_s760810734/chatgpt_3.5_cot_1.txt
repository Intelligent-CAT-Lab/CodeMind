<<<Analysis>>>
The variables W, H, x, and y are initialized with the input values 2, 3, 1, and 2 respectively.
The variable men is calculated as the product of W and H divided by 2.0.
The variables a and b are calculated as x multiplied by H and the difference between the product of W and H and a respectively.
The variables c and d are calculated as y multiplied by W and the difference between the product of W and H and c respectively.
The variables xx and yy are calculated as the minimum value between a and b, and the minimum value between c and d respectively.
The variable hou is initially set to 0.
If xx is equal to men, hou is incremented by 1.
If yy is equal to men, hou is incremented by 1.
If hou is less than or equal to 1, hou is set to 0. Otherwise, hou is set to 1.
The final output is the concatenation of men and hou, separated by a space.
