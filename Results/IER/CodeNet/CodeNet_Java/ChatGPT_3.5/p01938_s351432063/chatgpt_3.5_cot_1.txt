<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string "AIZU" and calculates the number of steps required to reach each character from the previous character in the English alphabet. It initializes the variable `pre_char` with the ASCII value of 'A' (65) and the variable `cnt` with 0. Then it iterates through each character of the input string. For each character, it calculates the difference between the ASCII value of the current character and the previous character. If the current character is greater than the previous character, it adds the difference to `cnt`. Otherwise, it adds the difference plus 26 (the number of characters in the English alphabet) to `cnt`. Finally, it divides `cnt` by 26 and prints the result as the output.

In this case, the input string is "AIZU". The ASCII values of the characters are: 'A' = 65, 'I' = 73, 'Z' = 90, 'U' = 85. The differences between consecutive characters are: 73 - 65 = 8, 90 - 73 = 17, 85 - 90 + 26 = 21. Therefore, `cnt` is 8 + 17 + 21 = 46. Dividing 46 by 26 gives the output 1.
