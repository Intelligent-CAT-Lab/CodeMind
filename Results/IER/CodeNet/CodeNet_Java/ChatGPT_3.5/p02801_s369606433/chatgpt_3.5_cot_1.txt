<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a character input from the user using the Scanner class. It then assigns the input character to the variable 'c'. The code then calculates the ASCII value of the next character by adding 1 to the ASCII value of 'c'. Finally, it converts the ASCII value back to a character using the Character.toChars() method and prints the result.
In this case, the input character is 'a', which has an ASCII value of 97. Adding 1 to 97 gives 98, which corresponds to the character 'b'. Therefore, the output of the code execution would be 'b'.
<<<Output>>>
b
