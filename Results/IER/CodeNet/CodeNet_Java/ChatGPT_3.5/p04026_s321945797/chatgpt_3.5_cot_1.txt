<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string as input and converts it into a character array. It then initializes a variable n with the length of the character array. It also creates a TreeMap called sumIdx to store the sum and index values.

The code then enters a for loop that iterates through each character from 'a' to 'z'. Inside the loop, it initializes a variable sum with 0 and clears the sumIdx TreeMap. It also adds an initial entry of (0.0, -1) to the TreeMap.

Next, it enters another for loop that iterates through each character in the character array. Inside this loop, it checks if the current character is equal to the character being iterated in the outer loop. If it is, it adds 0.5 to the sum variable. Otherwise, it subtracts 0.5 from the sum variable.

After updating the sum variable, it checks if there is a lower entry in the sumIdx TreeMap with a key less than the current sum. If there is, it checks if the value of the lower entry is equal to the current index minus 1. If it is, it finds the lower entry of the lower entry and checks if it is not null. If it is not null, it prints the lower entry value plus 2 and the current index plus 1 as the output and returns from the main method.

If the conditions in the previous step are not met, it puts the current sum and index as an entry in the sumIdx TreeMap.

After the outer loop finishes, it prints "-1 -1" as the output if no valid range is found.
