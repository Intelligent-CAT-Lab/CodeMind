<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input using the Scanner class. The first integer is assigned to variable a and the second integer is assigned to variable b.
Then it checks if the sum of a and b is greater than 0. If it is, it prints "1".
If the sum of a and b is less than 0, it prints "-1".
If the sum of a and b is equal to 0, it prints "0".
In this case, the sum of -3 and 3 is 0, so the code will print "0".
<<<Output>>>
0
