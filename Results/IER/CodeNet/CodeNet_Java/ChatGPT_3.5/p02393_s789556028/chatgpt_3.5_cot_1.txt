<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input and stores them in an array called num. It also initializes two variables, max and ind, to keep track of the maximum value and its index in the array.
Then, it enters a for loop and iterates three times. In each iteration, it reads an integer from the input and checks if it is greater than the current maximum value. If it is, it updates the maximum value and its index.
After the loop finishes, it checks if the index of the maximum value is not 2. If it is not, it swaps the value at index 2 with the maximum value.
Then, it checks if the value at index 0 is greater than the value at index 1. If it is, it swaps the two values.
Finally, it prints the values in the array num, separated by spaces.
In this case, the input is 3, 8, and 1. The maximum value is 8 and its index is 1. Since the index is not 2, the value at index 2 (1) is swapped with the maximum value (8). Then, the values at index 0 (3) and index 1 (1) are swapped. Therefore, the output is "1 3 8".
