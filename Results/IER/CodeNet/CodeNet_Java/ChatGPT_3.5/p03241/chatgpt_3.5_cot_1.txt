<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and variable m are initialized with 3 and 14 respectively according to the input. 
It enters a for loop and it iterates from m/n to infinity. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current value of i is a divisor of m. If it is, it prints the value of i and breaks out of the loop.
In this case, the loop starts from 14/3 = 4 and checks if 4 is a divisor of 14. Since 4 is not a divisor of 14, it continues to check 3, 2, and 1. When it checks 1, it finds that 1 is a divisor of 14. So it prints 1 and breaks out of the loop.
