<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers n and K as input. It initializes a variable ans with 0.
Then it enters a nested for loop. The outer loop iterates from K+1 to n and the inner loop iterates from 0 to n/i.
Inside the inner loop, it checks if i * (j + 1) - 1 is less than or equal to n. If it is, it adds i - K to ans. Otherwise, it adds the maximum of i - K - (i * (j + 1) - 1 - n) and 0 to ans.
After the loops finish, it checks if K is equal to 0. If it is, it subtracts n from ans.
Finally, it prints the value of ans as the output.
