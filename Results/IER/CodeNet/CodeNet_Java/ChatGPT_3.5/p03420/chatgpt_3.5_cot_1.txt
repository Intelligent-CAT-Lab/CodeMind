<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and variable K are initialized with 5 and 2 respectively according to the input. And variable ans is initialized with 0.
It enters a nested for loop and it iterates from K+1 to n to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the nested for loop, it checks if the condition i * (j + 1) - 1 <= n is true. If it is true, it adds i - K to variable ans. Otherwise, it adds the maximum value between i - K - (i * (j + 1) - 1 - n) and 0 to variable ans.
After the nested for loop finishes, it checks if K is equal to 0. If it is true, it subtracts n from variable ans.
Finally, it prints the final value of variable ans as output.
