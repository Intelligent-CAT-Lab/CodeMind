The variable k is initialized with 7 according to the input. The variable s is initialized with "FESTIVA". The variable idx is initialized with 0.
It enters a while loop and it continues as long as k is greater than 0 and idx+1 is less than the length of array c.
Inside the while loop, it calculates the base value based on the current value of idx. It starts with base = idx * 25 + 100 and then it iterates from base to 100 to find the minimum value of i such that k % i is less than k % base. The minimum value of i is assigned to base.
Then it appends "L" to the string s k % base times.
Then it appends the characters of array c from index c.length-1 to idx to the string s base-1 times.
Then it divides k by base and increments idx by 1.
After the while loop, it checks if k is still greater than 0. If it is, it calculates the square root of k and assigns it to variable sqrt.
Then it appends "L" to the string s k % sqrt times.
Then it appends the character at index idx of array c to the string s sqrt-1 times.
Then it decrements k by 1 and appends "L" to the string s k times.
Finally, it prints the string s as output.
