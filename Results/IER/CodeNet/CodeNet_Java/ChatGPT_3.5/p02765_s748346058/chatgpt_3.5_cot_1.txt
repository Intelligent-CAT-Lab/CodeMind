<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 2 and variable r is initialized with 2919 according to the input.
Then it checks if n is greater than or equal to 10. Since n is 2, the condition is not met.
So it prints the value of r plus 100 multiplied by (10 - n) as the output, which is 2919 + 100 * (10 - 2) = 2919 + 800 = 3719.
<<<Output>>>
3719
