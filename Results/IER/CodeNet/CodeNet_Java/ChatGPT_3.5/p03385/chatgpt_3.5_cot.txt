<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string and converts it into a character array. Then it initializes a boolean array `abc` of size 3. It iterates over the character array and checks if each character is 'a', 'b', or 'c'. If it is, it sets the corresponding index in the `abc` array to true. After that, it checks if all the elements in the `abc` array are true using the `isOK` variable. If all the elements are true, it sets `isOK` to true, otherwise it sets it to false. Finally, it prints "Yes" if `isOK` is true, otherwise it prints "No".

In this case, the input string is "bac". The code will set `abc[0]` to true for 'a', `abc[1]` to true for 'b', and `abc[2]` to true for 'c'. Then it will check if all the elements in `abc` are true, which they are. So `isOK` will be true. Therefore, the output will be "Yes".

<<<Output>>>
Yes
