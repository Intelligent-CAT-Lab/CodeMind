<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string input and converts it into a character array. It then initializes a boolean array `abc` of size 3. It iterates over the character array and checks if each character is 'a', 'b', or 'c'. If it is, it sets the corresponding index in the `abc` array to true. 

After that, it initializes a boolean variable `isOK` to true. It then iterates over the `abc` array and checks if all the elements are true. If any element is false, it sets `isOK` to false.

Finally, it prints "Yes" if `isOK` is true, and "No" if `isOK` is false.

In this case, the input is "bac". The code will set `abc[0]` to true (for 'a'), `abc[1]` to true (for 'b'), and `abc[2]` to true (for 'c'). Then it will check if all elements in `abc` are true, which is the case. So, it will print "Yes" as the output.

<<<Output>>>
Yes
