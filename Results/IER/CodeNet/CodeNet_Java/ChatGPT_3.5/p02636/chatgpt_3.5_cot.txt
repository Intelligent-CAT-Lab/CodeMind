<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string as input and calculates the number of valid substrings in the input string. A valid substring is defined as a substring that contains an equal number of '0's and '1's. 

The code uses dynamic programming to solve this problem. It creates a 3D boolean array dyn1 to store the states of the substrings. dyn1[i][j][k] represents whether it is possible to have a valid substring of length i with j '0's and k '1's. 

The code then iterates through the input string and updates the dyn1 array based on the current character and the previous states. 

After updating dyn1, the code creates another 3D integer array dyn2 to store the number of valid substrings that end at each position. dyn2[i][j][k] represents the number of valid substrings of length i that end with j '0's and k '1's. 

The code then iterates through the dyn1 array in reverse order and updates dyn2 based on the current state and the previous states. 

Finally, the code prints the value of ans, which represents the total number of valid substrings in the input string. 

In this case, the input string is "0001". The code will calculate the number of valid substrings in this string and print the result.
