The code takes a string input `s` and calculates the number of valid substrings of `s`. A valid substring is defined as a substring that contains an equal number of '0's and '1's. The code uses dynamic programming to solve this problem.

First, it initializes a 3D boolean array `dyn1` of size (n+1) x (n+1) x (n+1), where n is the length of the input string `s`. The indices of `dyn1` represent the current position in the string, the number of remaining '0's, and the number of remaining '1's, respectively. The value at each index represents whether it is possible to form a valid substring at that position with the given number of remaining '0's and '1's.

Then, it iterates through each position in the string and updates the values of `dyn1` based on the current character and the number of remaining '0's and '1's. If it is possible to form a valid substring at the current position, it updates the corresponding indices in `dyn1` to true.

Next, it initializes another 3D integer array `dyn2` of size (n+1) x (n+1) x (n+1). The indices of `dyn2` have the same meaning as `dyn1`. The value at each index represents the number of valid substrings that can be formed at that position with the given number of remaining '0's and '1's.

Then, it iterates through each position in the string in reverse order and updates the values of `dyn2` based on the current character and the number of remaining '0's and '1's. If it is possible to form a valid substring at the current position, it updates the corresponding indices in `dyn2` by adding the value at the current index in `dyn2` to the value at the previous index in `dyn2`.

Finally, it prints the value at index (n, 0, 0) in `dyn2`, which represents the total number of valid substrings that can be formed using the entire string `s` and no remaining '0's and '1's.
