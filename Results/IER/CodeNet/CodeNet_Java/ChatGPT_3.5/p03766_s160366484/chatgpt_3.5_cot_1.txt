The variable N is initialized with the value 2 according to the input. The variable n is initialized with the value of N and the variable mod is initialized with the value 1000000000 + 7.
Then, two arrays dp and sum are initialized with size N+1.
The first element of dp and sum is set to 1, and the second element of dp and sum is set to N.
Then, a for loop is executed from i=2 to N.
Inside the loop, dp[i] is calculated based on the previous values of dp and sum.
dp[i] is calculated by adding sum[i-1] and mod - dp[i-2], and then taking the modulo of mod.
dp[i] is also calculated by adding (n-i+2) and taking the modulo of mod.
dp[i] is also calculated by adding (n-1) * (n-1) and taking the modulo of mod.
sum[i] is calculated by adding sum[i-1] and dp[i], and then taking the modulo of mod.
Finally, the value of dp[N] is printed as the output.
