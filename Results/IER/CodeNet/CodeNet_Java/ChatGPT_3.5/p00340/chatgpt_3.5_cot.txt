<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a line of input and splits it into four integers using StringTokenizer. These integers are stored in an array called "sides". Then, the code calculates the sum of all four sides and stores it in the variable "total". 

Next, the code sorts the "sides" array in ascending order using the Arrays.sort() method.

Finally, the code checks if the first two sides are equal and the last two sides are equal. If both conditions are true, it prints "yes". Otherwise, it prints "no".

In this case, the input is "1 1 3 4". After splitting the input, the "sides" array will contain [1, 1, 3, 4]. The sum of all sides is 9. After sorting the array, it remains the same. Since the first two sides are equal (1) and the last two sides are not equal (3 and 4), the code will print "no".

<<<Output>>>
no
