<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads the input from the user and stores it in the variable `sides` as an array of integers. It then calculates the sum of all the elements in the `sides` array and stores it in the variable `total`. 

Next, it sorts the `sides` array in ascending order using the `Arrays.sort()` method.

Then, it checks if the first two elements of the `sides` array are equal and if the last two elements are equal. If both conditions are true, it prints "yes". Otherwise, it prints "no".

In this case, the input is `1 1 3 4`. After storing the input in the `sides` array and calculating the `total`, the `sides` array becomes `[1, 1, 3, 4]`. After sorting the array, it remains the same. Since the first two elements are equal and the last two elements are not equal, the output will be "no".

<<<Output>>>
