<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, M and R are initialized with 2, 0 and 3 respectively according to the input. And variable R is subtracted by N*M, which is 0 in this case. Since R is not less than 0, it does not enter the if condition.
Then it initializes a BigInteger variable ans with value 1.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to N-1, which is 0 to 1 in this case. The value of variable i is incremented by 1 in each iteration.
Inside the for loop, it multiplies the current value of ans with (R + N - 1 - i) and then divides it by (i + 1). The result is stored back in ans.
After the loop finishes, it print the final value of ans as output, which is 3.
