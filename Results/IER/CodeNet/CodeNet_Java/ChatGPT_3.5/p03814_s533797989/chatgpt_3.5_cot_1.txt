<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string input from the user and stores it in the variable 's'. It then converts the string into a character array called 'words'. 
The code initializes two variables 'min' and 'max' to 0. 
It then iterates through the character array 'words' from the end to the beginning and checks if the current character is 'A'. If it is, it updates the value of 'min' to the current index.
Next, it iterates through the character array 'words' from the beginning to the end and checks if the current character is 'Z'. If it is, it updates the value of 'max' to the current index.
Finally, it prints the difference between 'max' and 'min' plus 1 as the output.

In the given input "QWERTYASDFZXCV", the character 'A' is present at index 7 and the character 'Z' is present at index 12. Therefore, the output will be 12 - 7 + 1 = 6.
