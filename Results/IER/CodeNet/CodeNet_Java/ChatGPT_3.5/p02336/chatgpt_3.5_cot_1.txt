<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers n and k as input. It then creates an instance of the Combinatrics class passing n-1 as the parameter.
Inside the Combinatrics class, it initializes three arrays: fact, inv, and finv. It also initializes the mod variable with the value 1000000007.
The Combinatrics class has several methods for calculating combinations, permutations, and other combinatorial values.
In the main method, it creates an instance of the FastScanner class and reads the values of n and k from the input.
It then creates an instance of the Combinatrics class passing n-1 as the parameter.
Finally, it calls the homogeneous method of the Combinatrics class passing k and n-k as the parameters and prints the result.
The homogeneous method calculates the value of nHr (n+r-1Cr) and returns it.
