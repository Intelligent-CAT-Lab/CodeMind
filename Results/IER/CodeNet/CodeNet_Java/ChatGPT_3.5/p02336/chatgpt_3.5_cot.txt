<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers n and k as input. It then creates an instance of the Combinatrics class passing n-1 as the parameter.
Inside the Combinatrics class, it initializes three arrays: fact, inv, and finv. The fact array stores the factorial values, the inv array stores the inverse values, and the finv array stores the factorial inverse values.
Then, it calculates the value of c.homogeneous(k, n-k) and prints it.
The homogeneous method in the Combinatrics class calculates the value of nHr, which is the number of ways to choose r items from n items with repetition allowed.
