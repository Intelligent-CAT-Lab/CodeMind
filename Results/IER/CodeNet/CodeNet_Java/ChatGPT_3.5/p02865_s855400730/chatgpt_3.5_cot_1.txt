<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads an integer N from the input. It then subtracts 1 from N and divides the result by 2. The final result is printed as the output.
In this case, the input is 4. So, (4-1)/2 = 3/2 = 1.5. However, since the result is an integer, the decimal part is truncated. Therefore, the output would be 1.
