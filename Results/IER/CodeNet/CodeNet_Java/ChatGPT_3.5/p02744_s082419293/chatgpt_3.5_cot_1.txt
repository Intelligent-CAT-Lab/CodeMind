<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 1 according to the input.
It initializes two maps: integerMap_ and stringMap_.
Then it calls the function func(n) and stores the returned list in the variable list.
The function func(n) is a recursive function that takes an integer n as input and returns a list of strings.
If n is equal to 1, it adds the string "a" to the list.
Otherwise, it calls the function func(n-1) and stores the returned list in the variable prevList.
Then it iterates over each string s in prevList.
Inside the loop, it searches for a character that is not contained in the string s by iterating from 1 to 10 and checking if the character is present in s using the contains() method.
If it finds a character that is not contained in s, it stores it in the variable last.
Then it iterates from 1 to the integer value of last in the stringMap_ and appends each character to the string s to create a new string newString.
Finally, it adds the newString to the list.
After the loop finishes, it returns the list.
Then it sorts the list in lexicographical order using the Collections.sort() method.
Finally, it prints each string in the list on a new line.
<<<Output>>>
