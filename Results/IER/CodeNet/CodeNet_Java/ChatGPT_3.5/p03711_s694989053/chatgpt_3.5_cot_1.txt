<<<Analysis>>>
The variable x and variable y are initialized with 1 and 3 respectively according to the input. And variable Xans and variable Yans are initialized with empty string.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 6 to check each integer i in array A. If x or y is equal to A[i], it assigns "A" to variable Xans or variable Yans respectively.
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 3 to check each integer i in array B. If x or y is equal to B[i], it assigns "B" to variable Xans or variable Yans respectively.
After the loops, it checks if x is equal to 2. If it is, it assigns "C" to variable Xans.
Then it checks if y is equal to 2. If it is, it assigns "C" to variable Yans.
Finally, it checks if Xans is equal to Yans. If they are equal, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
In this case, Xans is "A" and Yans is "A", so it prints "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
