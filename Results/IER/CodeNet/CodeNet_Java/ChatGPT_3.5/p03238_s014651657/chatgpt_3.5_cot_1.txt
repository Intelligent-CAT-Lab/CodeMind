<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input from the user using the Scanner class and stores it in variable 'a'. 
Then it checks if the value of 'a' is equal to 1. If it is, it prints "Hello World". 
Since the input is 1, the condition is true and "Hello World" will be printed as the output.
<<<Output>>>
Hello World
