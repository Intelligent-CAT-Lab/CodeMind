<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers from the input using the Scanner class and assigns them to variables a and b. Then it calculates the absolute difference between a and b using the Math.abs() method and assigns the result to the variable ans. Finally, it prints the value of ans as the output.
In this case, the input is "20 30", so a will be assigned the value 20 and b will be assigned the value 30. The absolute difference between 20 and 30 is 10, so the value of ans will be 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
