<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input using the Scanner class. The first integer is assigned to variable a and the second integer is assigned to variable b.
Then it calculates the absolute difference between a and b using the Math.abs() method and assigns the result to variable ans.
Finally, it prints the value of ans as the output.
In this case, the input is 20 and 30. So the absolute difference between 20 and 30 is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
