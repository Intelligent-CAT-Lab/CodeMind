<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads three strings from the input: a, b, and c. It then checks if the last character of string a is equal to the first character of string b, and if the last character of string b is equal to the first character of string c. If both conditions are true, it prints "YES", otherwise it prints "NO".

In this case, the input is "rng gorilla apple". So, the value of string a is "rng", the value of string b is "gorilla", and the value of string c is "apple". The last character of string a is 'g', the first character of string b is 'g', and the last character of string b is 'a'. Therefore, both conditions are true and the output will be "YES".
<<<Output>>>
YES
