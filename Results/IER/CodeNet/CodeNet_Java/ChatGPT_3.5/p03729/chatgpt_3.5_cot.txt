<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three inputs: a, b, and c. It checks if the last character of string a is equal to the first character of string b, and if the last character of string b is equal to the first character of string c. If both conditions are true, it prints "YES", otherwise it prints "NO".

In this case, the input is "rng gorilla apple". The first input "rng" is assigned to variable a, the second input "gorilla" is assigned to variable b, and the third input "apple" is assigned to variable c. 

The last character of "rng" is 'g', and the first character of "gorilla" is 'g'. The last character of "gorilla" is 'a', and the first character of "apple" is 'a'. Both conditions are true, so the code will print "YES".

<<<Output>>>
YES
