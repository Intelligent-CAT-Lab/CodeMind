<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two characters as input, A and B. It compares the two characters and assigns a value to the variable ans based on the comparison. If A is equal to B, ans is assigned the value '='. If A is greater than B, ans is assigned the value '>'. If A is less than B, ans is assigned the value '<'. Finally, the value of ans is printed as the output.
