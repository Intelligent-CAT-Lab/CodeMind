<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to variables a and b. Then it calculates the product of a and b and subtracts the sum of a and b minus 1 from the product. Finally, it prints the result as the output.
In this case, a = 2 and b = 2. So the product of a and b is 4. The sum of a and b is 4. Subtracting the sum minus 1 from the product, we get 4 - (4 - 1) = 1.
