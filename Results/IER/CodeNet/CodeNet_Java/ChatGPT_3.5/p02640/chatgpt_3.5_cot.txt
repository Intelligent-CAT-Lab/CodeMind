<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs, x and y, using the Scanner class. These inputs represent the number of heads and the number of legs, respectively.
Then, it calculates the number of cranes and turtles using the following formulas:
- crane = -(y/2) + 2*x
- turtle = x - crane

Next, it checks if the number of turtles or cranes is negative or if they are not whole numbers. If any of these conditions are true, it prints "No". Otherwise, it prints "Yes".

In this case, the input is "3 8". So, x = 3 and y = 8.
Using the formulas, we can calculate:
- crane = -(8/2) + 2*3 = -4 + 6 = 2
- turtle = 3 - 2 = 1

Since both the number of turtles and cranes are positive integers, the output will be "Yes".

<<<Output>>>
Yes
