<<<Analysis>>>
The variable x is initialized with 3 and variable y is initialized with 8 according to the input. 
Then it calculates the number of cranes and turtles based on the given equations:
crane = -(y/2) + 2*x
turtle = x - crane

After that, it checks if the number of turtles and cranes are valid. If any of the following conditions are met, it prints "No":
- The number of turtles or cranes is negative
- The number of turtles or cranes is not an integer

Otherwise, it prints "Yes".

In this case, the number of turtles is 1 and the number of cranes is 2, which are both valid integers. So the output would be "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
