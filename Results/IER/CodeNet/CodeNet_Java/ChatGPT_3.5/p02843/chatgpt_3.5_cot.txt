<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input and stores it in variable x.
Then it checks if the remainder of x divided by 100 is less than or equal to the result of x divided by 100 multiplied by 5.
If the condition is true, it prints 1. Otherwise, it prints 0.
In this case, the input is 615. So, x % 100 = 15 and x / 100 * 5 = 30.
Since 15 is less than or equal to 30, the condition is true and the code will print 1.
<<<Output>>>
1
