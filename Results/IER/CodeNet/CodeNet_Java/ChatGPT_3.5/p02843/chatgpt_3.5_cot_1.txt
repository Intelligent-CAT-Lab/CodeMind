<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads an integer input from the user and stores it in variable x. 
Then it checks if the remainder of x divided by 100 is less than or equal to the result of x divided by 100 multiplied by 5. 
If the condition is true, it prints 1. Otherwise, it prints 0.
In this case, the value of x is 615. 
The remainder of 615 divided by 100 is 15, and the result of 615 divided by 100 multiplied by 5 is 30. 
Since 15 is less than or equal to 30, the condition is true and the output will be 1.
