<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a class AOJ0257 inside the Main class. Inside the AOJ0257 class, there is a method called solve which takes a string input as parameter. If the input is equal to "1 1 0" or "0 0 1", it returns "Open". Otherwise, it returns "Close".
Inside the doIt method, it uses a while loop to read input from the scanner until there is no more input. For each input, it calls the solve method and prints the result.
In this case, the input is "0 0 1". The solve method checks if the input is equal to "1 1 0" or "0 0 1". Since the input is equal to "0 0 1", it returns "Open".
<<<Output>>>
Open
