<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads input from the user using the Scanner class. It then initializes an array of integers called res with a size of 26, which will be used to store the frequency of each letter in the input.
The code then enters a while loop that continues as long as there is more input to read. Inside the loop, it reads a line of input using cin.nextLine() and assigns it to the variable str.
Next, it iterates over each character in the string using a for loop. For each character, it checks if it is an uppercase letter (ASCII value between 65 and 90) or a lowercase letter (ASCII value between 97 and 122).
If the character is an uppercase letter, it increments the corresponding element in the res array by 1 using the ASCII value of the character minus 65 as the index.
If the character is a lowercase letter, it increments the corresponding element in the res array by 1 using the ASCII value of the character minus 97 as the index.
After processing all the characters in the input, the code enters another for loop that iterates over the elements of the res array. For each element, it prints the corresponding lowercase letter (ASCII value plus 97) followed by a colon and the value of the element.
The output will be the frequency of each letter in the input string.
