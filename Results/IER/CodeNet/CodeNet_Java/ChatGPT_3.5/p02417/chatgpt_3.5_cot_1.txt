<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads input from the user using the Scanner class. It initializes an array of size 26 to store the count of each alphabet. Then it enters a while loop which continues until there is more input to read. Inside the loop, it reads a line of input and iterates through each character of the input string. If the character is an uppercase letter, it increments the count of that letter in the array. If the character is a lowercase letter, it also increments the count of that letter in the array. After processing all the characters in the input string, it prints the count of each letter in the array.
In this case, the input string is "This is a pen.". The code will count the occurrences of each letter in the string and print the result.
