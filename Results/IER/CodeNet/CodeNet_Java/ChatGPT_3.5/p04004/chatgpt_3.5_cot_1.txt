<<<Analysis>>>
The variable x, variable y and variable z are initialized with 1, 1 and 1 respectively according to the input. And variable B is assigned with the minimum value between y and z, which is 1. Variable C is assigned with the maximum value between y and z, which is 1. Then the function prec(1000000) is called to initialize the arrays _fact and _invfact. Then an array pow3 is initialized with the length of 1000000 and the first element is assigned with 1. Then a for loop is used to calculate the rest of the elements in the pow3 array. Then a for loop is used to calculate the elements in the ans array. Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of base and last based on the current value of l, x, y, z, B and C. Then it calculates the value of ans[l] based on the values of base, last and pow3. After the for loop, it calculates the sum of all elements in the ans array and assigns it to the variable sum. Finally, it prints the value of sum % MOD as output.
