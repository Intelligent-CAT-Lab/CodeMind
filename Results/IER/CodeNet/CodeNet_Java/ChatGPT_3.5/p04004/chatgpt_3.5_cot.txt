<<<Analysis>>>
The variables x, y and z are initialized with 1, 1 and 1 respectively according to the input. And variable B is assigned with the minimum value between y and z, which is 1. Variable C is assigned with the maximum value between y and z, which is also 1. Then the function prec(1000000) is called to initialize the arrays _fact and _invfact. The function pow3 is called to initialize the array pow3. Then the variable ans is initialized as an array of length x+y+z+2. The variable last is initialized with 0. Then a for loop is executed from x+1 to x+y+z+1. Inside the loop, it calculates the value of base and row. Then it checks the value of row and updates the value of last accordingly. Finally, it calculates the value of ans[l] and assigns it to the corresponding index in the array ans. After the loop finishes, it calculates the sum of all elements in the array ans and assigns it to the variable sum. Finally, it prints the value of sum % MOD as the output.
