<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a double value from the input and assigns it to the variable r. It then calculates the value of pi using the Math.PI constant. It calculates the area of a circle by multiplying r*r*pi and assigns it to the variable x. It calculates the circumference of the circle by multiplying 2*r*pi and assigns it to the variable y. Finally, it prints the values of x and y with 6 decimal places using the printf method.
Given the input value of 2, the code will calculate the area and circumference of a circle with radius 2 and print the values as output.
<<<Output>>>
