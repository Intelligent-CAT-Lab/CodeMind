<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers N and M from the input. In this case, the input is "3 4". The values of N and M are assigned as 3 and 4 respectively. Then it calculates the product of N and M, which is 3 * 4 = 12. Finally, it prints the result as output using the format "%d\n", which means it prints the integer followed by a new line character. So the output would be:
12
