<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four integers as input: sx, sy, tx, and ty. It then calls the solve() method passing these four integers as arguments.
Inside the solve() method, it calculates the differences dx and dy between tx and sx, and ty and sy respectively.
Then, it creates a StringBuilder object to store the result.
The code appends characters to the StringBuilder object based on the values of dx and dy.
It appends 'R' dx times, followed by 'U' dy times.
Then, it appends 'L' dx times, followed by 'D' dy times.
Next, it appends 'D' once, followed by 'R' (dx + 1) times, 'U' (dy + 1) times, and 'L' once.
Finally, it appends 'U' once, followed by 'L' (dx + 1) times, 'D' (dy + 1) times, and 'R' once.
The method returns the string representation of the StringBuilder object.
The main method prints the return value of the solve() method.
