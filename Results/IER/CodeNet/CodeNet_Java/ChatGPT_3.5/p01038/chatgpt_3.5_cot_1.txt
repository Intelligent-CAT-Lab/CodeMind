The variable N is initialized with 5 according to the input. Then an array called heights is initialized with the next 5 integers from the input.
Then an ArrayList called signed is initialized. It is used to store the signs of the differences between consecutive elements in the heights array.
A variable called prev is initialized with the minimum value of an integer.
Then a for loop is used to iterate through the heights array. Inside the loop, it calculates the difference between the current element and the next element in the heights array.
Then it calculates the sign of the difference by dividing the difference by its absolute value. If the difference is 0, the sign is set to 0.
If the loop index is 0, it sets the value of prev to the current sign and continues to the next iteration.
If the value of prev is not equal to the current sign, it adds the value of prev to the signed ArrayList and updates the value of prev to the current sign.
After the loop finishes, if the value of prev is not equal to the minimum value of an integer, it adds the value of prev to the signed ArrayList.
Then an array called counts is initialized with 5 elements, all set to 0.
Then a for loop is used to iterate through the signed ArrayList. Inside the loop, it checks if the current sign is 0. If it is, it checks the signs of the previous and next elements.
If the previous sign is 1 and the next sign is -1, it increments the value at index 0 of the counts array. If the previous sign is -1 and the next sign is 1, it increments the value at index 1 of the counts array.
Otherwise, it increments the value at index 2 of the counts array.
Then another for loop is used to iterate through the signed ArrayList. Inside the loop, it checks if the current sign is different from the next sign and both signs are not 0.
If the current sign is greater than 0, it increments the value at index 3 of the counts array. Otherwise, it increments the value at index 4 of the counts array.
Finally, a for loop is used to print the values in the counts array separated by spaces, followed by a new line.
