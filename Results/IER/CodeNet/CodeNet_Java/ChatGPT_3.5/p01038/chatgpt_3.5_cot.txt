<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 5 according to the input. Then an array called heights is initialized with the values [1, 2, 3, 4, 3].
Then an ArrayList called signed is initialized. It iterates through the array heights and calculates the difference between each consecutive element. If the difference is 0, it adds 0 to the signed ArrayList. Otherwise, it adds the sign of the difference (1 or -1) to the signed ArrayList.
Then it initializes an array called counts with 5 elements, all initialized to 0.
It iterates through the signed ArrayList and checks for specific patterns. If the current element is 0 and the previous and next elements are 1 and -1 respectively, it increments counts[0]. If the current element is 0 and the previous and next elements are -1 and 1 respectively, it increments counts[1]. Otherwise, it increments counts[2].
Then it iterates through the signed ArrayList again and checks for consecutive elements with different signs. If the current element is positive and the next element is negative, it increments counts[3]. If the current element is negative and the next element is positive, it increments counts[4].
Finally, it prints the values of the counts array separated by spaces.
