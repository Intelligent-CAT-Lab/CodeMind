<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a, b, c, and k are initialized with 2, 1, 1, and 3 respectively according to the input. And the variable ans is initialized with 0.
It adds the minimum of a and k to ans. Since a is 2 and k is 3, the minimum is 2. So ans becomes 2.
Then it subtracts the minimum of b and k from k. Since b is 1 and k is 1, the minimum is 1. So k becomes 0.
Then it checks if k is greater than 0. Since k is 0, the condition is not met and it does not execute the if block.
Finally, it prints the value of ans as output, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
