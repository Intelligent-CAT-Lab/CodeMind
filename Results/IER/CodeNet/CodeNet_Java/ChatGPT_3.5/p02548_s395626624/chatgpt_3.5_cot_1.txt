<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 3 according to the input. 
It creates an instance of the Sieve class and initializes the variable ans with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to N-1 to check each integer C in this range.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of AB as N - C.
Then it calls the primeFactor method of the Sieve class to get the prime factorization of AB.
It calculates the value of m by multiplying the count of each prime factor plus 1.
Then it adds the value of m to the variable ans.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable ans as output.
