<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with the input "apple". The length of the string n is calculated and stored in the variable len.
Then it checks the last character of the string n. If it is 's', it appends "es" to the string n and prints it. Otherwise, it appends "s" to the string n and prints it.
In this case, the last character of the string n is 'e', so it appends "s" to the string n and prints "apples".
<<<Output>>>
apples
