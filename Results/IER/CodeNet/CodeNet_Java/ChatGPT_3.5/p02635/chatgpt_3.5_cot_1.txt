<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs: a string `str` and an integer `k`. The string `str` represents a binary number and `k` represents the maximum number of shifts that can be performed on the binary number. 

The code first counts the number of consecutive 0's at the end of the binary number and stores it in the list `rlc`. It then calculates the number of 1's and 0's in the binary number. 

If the number of 1's or 0's is 0, it means that the binary number is either all 1's or all 0's. In this case, the code prints 1 and returns.

The code then initializes a 3D array `dp` to store the dynamic programming values. It also initializes two 2D arrays `sum0` and `sum1` to store the cumulative sums of the dynamic programming values.

The code then starts a loop to calculate the dynamic programming values. It iterates over each position in the binary number and performs the following steps:

1. Calculates the cumulative sums of the dynamic programming values for the current position and stores them in `sum0` and `sum1`.
2. Copies the dynamic programming values from the previous position to the current position.
3. Calculates the dynamic programming values for the current position by considering the cases of putting and taking 1's and 0's.
4. Updates the cumulative sums of the dynamic programming values for the next position.

Finally, the code calculates the final answer by summing up the dynamic programming values for the last position up to `k` shifts. It prints the answer modulo 998244353.
