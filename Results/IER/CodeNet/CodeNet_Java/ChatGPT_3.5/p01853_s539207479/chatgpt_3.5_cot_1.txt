<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and variable m are initialized with 3 and 100 respectively according to the input. 
An array ns of size n is created.
Since n is greater than 2, it enters a for loop and it iterates from n/2 + 1 to n-1. In this case, it iterates from 2 to 2.
Inside the loop, it assigns the value of m to each element of the array ns starting from index 2.
After the loop finishes, it prints the elements of the array ns separated by a space.
The output would be "0 0 100".
<<<Output>>>
0 0 100
