The code takes four integers as input: x1, y1, x2, and y2. These values are assigned to variables x1, y1, x2, and y2 respectively.
Then, it calculates the differences between x2 and x1, and y2 and y1, and assigns them to variables a and b respectively.
Next, it calculates the values of x3 and y3 by subtracting b from x2 and adding a to y2 respectively.
After that, it calculates the values of x4 and y4 by subtracting a from x3 and subtracting b from y3 respectively.
Finally, it prints the values of x3, y3, x4, and y4 in the format "%d %d %d %d".

In this case, the input is "0 0 0 1". So, x1 = 0, y1 = 0, x2 = 0, and y2 = 1.
The calculations are as follows:
a = x2 - x1 = 0 - 0 = 0
b = y2 - y1 = 1 - 0 = 1
x3 = x2 - b = 0 - 1 = -1
y3 = y2 + a = 1 + 0 = 1
x4 = x3 - a = -1 - 0 = -1
y4 = y3 - b = 1 - 1 = 0

So, the output will be "-1 1 -1 0".
