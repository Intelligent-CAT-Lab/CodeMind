<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four integers as input: x1, y1, x2, and y2. It then calculates the differences between x2 and x1 (stored in variable a) and between y2 and y1 (stored in variable b). It then calculates the new coordinates x3 and y3 by subtracting b from x2 and adding a to y2, respectively. Finally, it calculates the new coordinates x4 and y4 by subtracting a from x3 and subtracting b from y3, respectively. The code then prints the values of x3, y3, x4, and y4 in the format "%d %d %d %d".

In this case, the input is "0 0 0 1". This means that x1 = 0, y1 = 0, x2 = 0, and y2 = 1. 

The code then calculates a = x2 - x1 = 0 - 0 = 0 and b = y2 - y1 = 1 - 0 = 1. 

Next, it calculates x3 = x2 - b = 0 - 1 = -1 and y3 = y2 + a = 1 + 0 = 1. 

Finally, it calculates x4 = x3 - a = -1 - 0 = -1 and y4 = y3 - b = 1 - 1 = 0. 

The code then prints the values of x3, y3, x4, and y4 in the format "x3 y3 x4 y4", which is "-1 1 -1 0".

<<<Output>>>
-1 1 -1 0
