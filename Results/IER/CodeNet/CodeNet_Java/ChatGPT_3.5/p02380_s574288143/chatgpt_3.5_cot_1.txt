<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads three double values from the input, which are assigned to variables a, b, and c respectively. Then it performs several calculations using these variables and prints the results.

1. The code calculates the area of a triangle using the formula 0.5 * a * b * sin(c), where a and b are the lengths of the sides of the triangle and c is the angle between them. It uses the Math.sin() method to calculate the sine of the angle, and Math.toRadians() to convert the angle from degrees to radians.

2. The code calculates the length of the third side of the triangle using the law of cosines. It uses the formula a^2 + b^2 - 2ab * cos(c), where a and b are the lengths of the other two sides of the triangle and c is the angle between them. It uses the Math.cos() method to calculate the cosine of the angle, and Math.sqrt() to calculate the square root.

3. The code calculates the height of the triangle using the formula b * sin(c), where b is the length of one of the sides of the triangle and c is the angle opposite to that side. It uses the Math.sin() method to calculate the sine of the angle.

Finally, the code prints the results of these calculations.
