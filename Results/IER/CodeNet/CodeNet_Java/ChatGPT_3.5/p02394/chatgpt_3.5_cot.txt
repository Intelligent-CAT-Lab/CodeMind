<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes input in the form of a string and splits it into an array of strings using the space as a delimiter. Then it converts each element of the array into an integer and assigns them to the variables W, H, x, y, and r respectively.

Next, it checks if the circle with center (x, y) and radius r lies completely within the rectangle with width W and height H. It does this by checking if the x-coordinate of the center minus the radius is greater than or equal to 0 and if the x-coordinate of the center plus the radius is less than or equal to W. It also checks if the y-coordinate of the center minus the radius is greater than or equal to 0 and if the y-coordinate of the center plus the radius is less than or equal to H.

If all these conditions are true, it assigns the value "Yes" to the variable judge. Otherwise, it assigns the value "No" to the variable judge.

Finally, it prints the value of the variable judge.

<<<Output>>>
Yes
