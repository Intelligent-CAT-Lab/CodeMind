<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes input from the user and splits it into an array of strings. Then it converts the strings into integers and assigns them to variables W, H, x, y, and r respectively.
Next, it checks if the circle with center (x, y) and radius r lies completely within the rectangle with width W and height H. It does this by checking if the x-coordinate of the center minus the radius is greater than or equal to 0 and if the x-coordinate of the center plus the radius is less than or equal to W. It also checks if the y-coordinate of the center minus the radius is greater than or equal to 0 and if the y-coordinate of the center plus the radius is less than or equal to H.
If all these conditions are true, it sets the variable judge to "Yes", otherwise it sets it to "No".
Finally, it prints the value of judge as the output.
In this case, the circle with center (2, 2) and radius 1 lies completely within the rectangle with width 5 and height 4, so the output will be "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
