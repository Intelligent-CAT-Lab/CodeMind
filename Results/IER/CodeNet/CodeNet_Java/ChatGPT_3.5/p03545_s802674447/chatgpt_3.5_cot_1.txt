<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string `s` and converts each character of the string to an integer and stores it in an array `a`. In this case, the array `a` will be [1, 2, 2, 2].

Then, it uses a nested loop to generate all possible combinations of addition and subtraction operations on the elements of `a`. The outer loop iterates from 0 to 7 (2^3) and the inner loop iterates from 0 to 2. 

Inside the inner loop, it checks the value of the j-th bit of the current number in the outer loop. If the bit is 1, it adds the j+1-th element of `a` to the current value of `num` and stores the '+' character in the corresponding position of the `op` array. If the bit is 0, it subtracts the j+1-th element of `a` from the current value of `num` and stores the '-' character in the corresponding position of the `op` array.

After the inner loop finishes, it checks if the final value of `num` is equal to 7. If it is, it constructs a string `ans` by concatenating the elements of `a` and `op` arrays along with the '=' character and '7'. Then it prints the `ans` string and returns from the function.

If no combination of operations results in `num` equal to 7, the code does not print anything.

In this case, the code will find a combination of operations that results in `num` equal to 7, since the input is '1222'. The combination is 1+2+2-2=7.

<<<Output>>>
1222=7
