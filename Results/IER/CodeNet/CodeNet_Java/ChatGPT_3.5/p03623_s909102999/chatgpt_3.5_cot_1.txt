<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input: x, a, and b. It then initializes a string variable ans with the value "A".
Next, it checks if the absolute difference between x and a is greater than the absolute difference between x and b. If this condition is true, it updates the value of ans to "B".
Finally, it prints the value of ans as the output.
In this case, x = 5, a = 2, and b = 7. The absolute difference between x and a is 3, and the absolute difference between x and b is 2. Since 3 is not greater than 2, the value of ans remains "A".
<<<Output>>>
A
