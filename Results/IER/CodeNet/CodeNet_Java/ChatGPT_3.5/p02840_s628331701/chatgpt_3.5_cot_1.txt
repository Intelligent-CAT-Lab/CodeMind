<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three long integers as input: n, x, and d.
It then checks if d is equal to 0. If it is, it checks if x is equal to 0. If x is 0, it prints 1. Otherwise, it prints n + 1.
If d is not equal to 0, it creates a HashMap called "segments" to store segments of type Seg.
It then iterates from 0 to n and performs the following operations:
- Calculates the value of grp by multiplying x and i.
- Calculates the value of offset by dividing grp by d and taking the floor value.
- Calculates the value of grp by taking the modulo of grp and d and adding d to it and then taking the modulo of d.
- Checks if the segments HashMap contains the key grp. If it doesn't, it adds a new ArrayList of type Seg to the HashMap.
- Adds a new Seg object to the ArrayList with the values of offset + i * (i - 1) / 2 and -1.
- Adds another new Seg object to the ArrayList with the values of offset + (2 * n - 1 - i) * i / 2 and 1.
After the iteration, it initializes a variable ans to 0.
It then iterates over the values of the segments HashMap and performs the following operations:
- Sorts the ArrayList of Seg objects in ascending order based on the value of v. If the values of v are equal, it sorts based on the value of t.
- Initializes a variable cnt to 0 and a variable begin to 0.
- Iterates over the Seg objects in the ArrayList and performs the following operations:
  - If cnt is equal to 0 and the value of t is -1, it sets the value of begin to the value of v.
  - Adds the value of t to cnt.
  - If cnt is equal to 0, it adds the difference between the value of v and begin plus 1 to ans.
After the iteration, it prints the value of ans.
