<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string as input and converts it into a character array. It initializes an array 'd' of size 2^26 (2 raised to the power of 26) and fills it with the length of the input string. It also initializes a variable 'mask' to 0 and a variable 'ans' to the length of the input string.

Then, it iterates over each character in the input string. For each character, it calculates the index 'c' by subtracting 'a' from the character. It then updates the 'mask' by XORing it with 1 shifted left by 'c'. 

Next, it iterates over all possible values of 'j' from -1 to 25. For each value of 'j', it calculates the index 'm' by shifting 1 left by 'j'. It then calculates the value of 'cur' by adding 1 to the value at index 'm XOR mask' in the 'd' array. It updates the value at index 'mask' in the 'd' array with the minimum of its current value and 'cur'. If the current iteration is the last iteration (i.e., i is equal to the length of the input string minus 1), it updates the 'ans' with the minimum of its current value and 'cur'.

Finally, it prints the value of 'ans' as the output.
