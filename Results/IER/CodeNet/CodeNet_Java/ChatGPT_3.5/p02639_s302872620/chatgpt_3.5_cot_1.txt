<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a line of input and splits it into an array of integers. In this case, the input is "0 2 3 4 5", so the array x will contain [0, 2, 3, 4, 5].
Then, it iterates over each element of the array x. If the current element is equal to 0, it prints the index of that element plus 1.
In this case, the first element of the array is 0, so the code will print 1 as the output.
