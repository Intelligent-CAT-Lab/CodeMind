<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two long integers X and Y from the input. It then checks if X is less than Y. If it is, it swaps the values of X and Y. 
After that, it checks if the difference between X and Y is greater than or equal to 2. If it is, it prints "Alice". Otherwise, it prints "Brown".
In this case, X = 2 and Y = 1. The difference between X and Y is 1, which is not greater than or equal to 2. So, the code will print "Brown".
<<<Output>>>
Brown
