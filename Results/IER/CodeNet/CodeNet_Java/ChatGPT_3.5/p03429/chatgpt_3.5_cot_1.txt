<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable M, variable A and variable B are initialized with 3, 4, 4 and 2 respectively according to the input. And the 2D character array ans is initialized with '.'.
It checks if both N and M are even. If they are, it calls the evenSolver method passing the values of N, M, A, B, 0 and 0 as arguments. The evenSolver method checks if the product of N and M is greater than or equal to 2 times the sum of A and B. If it is, it starts filling the ans array with '<', '>', '^' and 'v' characters based on the values of A and B. If it is not, it returns false.
If either N or M is odd, it checks if N is even. If it is, it fills the first column of the ans array with '^' and 'v' characters based on the value of B. Then it calls the evenSolver method passing the values of N, M-1, A, B, 0 and 1 as arguments.
If N is odd, it fills the first row of the ans array with '<' and '>' characters based on the value of A. Then it calls the evenSolver method passing the values of N-1, M, A, B, 1 and 0 as arguments.
If both N and M are odd, it fills the last column of the ans array with '^' and 'v' characters based on the value of B. Then it fills the last row of the ans array with '<' and '>' characters based on the value of A. If both A and B are odd, it fills the last 3 rows and last 3 columns of the ans array with the pattern '<', '>', '^' and 'v'. Then it calls the evenSolver method passing the values of N-1, M-1, A, B, 0 and 0 as arguments. If either A or B is even, it calls the evenSolver method passing the values of N-1, M-1, A, B, 0 and 0 as arguments.
After the method calls, it prints "YES" if the method returns true, followed by the ans array. If the method returns false, it prints "NO".
