<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable M, variable A and variable B are initialized with 3, 4, 4 and 2 respectively according to the input. And the 2D character array ans is initialized with '.'.
Since N is odd and M is even, it enters the else block. It iterates over the rows of the ans array and assigns '^' and 'v' to alternate cells in the first column until B becomes 0.
Then it calls the evenSolver method with parameters N-1, M, A, B, 1, 0. In the evenSolver method, it checks if the product of N-1 and M is less than 2 times the sum of A and B. If it is, it returns false.
Otherwise, it enters a while loop and assigns '<' and '>' to alternate cells in the first two columns until A becomes 0. Then it returns true.
The printSolve method is called with the return value of evenSolver as the argument. Since the return value is true, it prints "YES" and then prints the ans array.
