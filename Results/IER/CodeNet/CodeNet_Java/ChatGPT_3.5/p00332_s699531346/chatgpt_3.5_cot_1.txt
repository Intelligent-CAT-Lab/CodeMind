<<<Analysis>>>
The variable E is initialized with 0 and variable Y is initialized with 2015 according to the input.
It enters an if-else statement to check the value of variable E.
Since E is 0, it enters the first if block.
Inside the if block, it checks the value of variable Y.
Since Y is greater than 1911, it enters the else-if block.
Inside the else-if block, it checks the value of variable Y again.
Since Y is greater than 1925, it enters the second else-if block.
Inside the second else-if block, it checks the value of variable Y again.
Since Y is greater than 1988, it enters the third else-if block.
Inside the third else-if block, it prints "H" and the difference between Y and 1988 as output.
The difference between Y and 1988 is 27, so the output is "H27".
