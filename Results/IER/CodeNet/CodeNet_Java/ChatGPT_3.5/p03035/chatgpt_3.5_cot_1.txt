<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input and assigns them to variables a and b respectively.
Then it checks the value of a using if-else statements.
If a is less than or equal to 5, it prints 0.
If a is greater than 5 but less than or equal to 12, it prints the integer division of b by 2.
If a is greater than 12, it prints the value of b.
In this case, a is 30 which is greater than 12, so the output will be 100.
<<<Output>>>
100
