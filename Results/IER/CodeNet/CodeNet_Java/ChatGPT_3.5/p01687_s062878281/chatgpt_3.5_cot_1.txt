<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string as input and converts it into a character array. Then it iterates through each character in the array. Inside the loop, it checks if the current character and the next 7 characters form the word "AIDUNYAN". If they do, it replaces those characters with "AIZUNYAN". The loop continues until it reaches the end of the character array. Finally, it prints the modified character array as a string.
<<<Output>>>
AIZUNYAN
