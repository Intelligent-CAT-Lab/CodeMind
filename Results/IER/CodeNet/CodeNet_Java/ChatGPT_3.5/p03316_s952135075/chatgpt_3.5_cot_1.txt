<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 12 according to the input. The variable c is assigned the value of n and the variable s is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates 11 times. Inside the loop, it checks if n is equal to 0. If it is, it breaks out of the loop.
Then it calculates the sum of the digits of the current number n by repeatedly extracting the last digit of n using the modulo operator and adding it to variable s. It also updates the value of n by removing the last digit.
After the loop finishes, it checks if the original value of n (stored in variable c) is divisible by the sum of its digits (stored in variable s). If it is, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
In this case, the sum of the digits of 12 is 1 + 2 = 3. Since 12 is not divisible by 3, the output would be "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
