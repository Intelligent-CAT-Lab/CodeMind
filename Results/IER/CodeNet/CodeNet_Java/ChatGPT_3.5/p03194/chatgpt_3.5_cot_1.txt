<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and variable p are initialized with 3 and 24 respectively according to the input. 
It checks if n is equal to 1. Since n is not equal to 1, it continues to the next step.
It initializes the variable res with 1.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to the point where Math.pow(i, n) is less than or equal to p. In each iteration, it checks if p is divisible by Math.pow(i, n). If it is, it updates the value of res with i.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of res as output, which is 2.
