<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs, n and p, using the Scanner class. It then checks if n is equal to 1. If it is, it prints the value of p and returns from the main method.
If n is not equal to 1, it initializes a variable res with the value 1. It then enters a for loop that iterates from 2 until the value of i raised to the power of n is greater than or equal to p.
Inside the loop, it checks if p is divisible by i raised to the power of n. If it is, it updates the value of res to i.
After the loop finishes, it prints the value of res as the output.
In this case, n is 3 and p is 24. The loop will iterate for i = 2 and i = 3. Since 2^3 = 8 and 3^3 = 27, the loop will not execute for i = 3. Therefore, the value of res will be 2.
