<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string S and checks if its length is 1. If it is, it prints the string and exits the program.
If the length of S is greater than 1, it initializes an integer array N with the same length as S.
Then it enters a for loop to iterate through each character of S. It converts each character to an integer and stores it in the array N.
Inside the loop, it also updates the patternCount variable by multiplying it by 2 and appends a "1" to the tmpBit string.
After the loop, it initializes a variable sum with 0.
Then it enters another for loop to iterate through each pattern from 0 to patternCount-1.
Inside this loop, it converts the current pattern to a binary string and ensures that it has the same length as tmpBit by adding leading zeros if necessary.
It then initializes a string add with the first element of array N.
Next, it enters another loop to iterate through each character of the binary string.
If the current character is '1', it adds the value of add to the sum and resets add to an empty string.
Finally, it appends the next element of array N to add.
After the inner loop, it checks if add is not empty. If it is not empty, it adds the value of add to the sum.
After the outer loop finishes, it prints the final value of sum as the output.
