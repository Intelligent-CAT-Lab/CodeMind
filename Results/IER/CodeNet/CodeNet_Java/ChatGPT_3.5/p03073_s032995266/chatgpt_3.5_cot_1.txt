<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input from the user, which is "000". It initializes two integer variables intCnt1 and intCnt2 to 0. It also initializes a boolean variable bIsWhite to true.
Then it enters a for loop that iterates through each character in the input string. Inside the loop, it checks if the current character is equal to '0' if bIsWhite is true, or '1' if bIsWhite is false.
If the condition is true, it increments intCnt1 by 1. Otherwise, it increments intCnt2 by 1. After that, it toggles the value of bIsWhite.
After the loop finishes, it prints the smaller value between intCnt1 and intCnt2 as the output.
In this case, the input string "000" consists of all '0' characters. Since bIsWhite is initially true, the condition in the loop will always be true and intCnt1 will be incremented for each character. Therefore, the output will be intCnt1, which is 3.
