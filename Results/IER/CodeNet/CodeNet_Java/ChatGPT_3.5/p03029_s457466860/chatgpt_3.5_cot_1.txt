<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input using the Scanner class. The first integer is assigned to variable a and the second integer is assigned to variable p. Then the Scanner is closed.
After that, the value of variable p is updated by multiplying variable a by 3 and adding the original value of variable p to it.
Finally, the code prints the result of dividing variable p by 2.
Given the input "1 3", the value of variable a will be 1 and the value of variable p will be 3.
So, p = 1 * 3 + 3 = 6.
And the output will be 6 / 2 = 3.
<<<Output>>>
