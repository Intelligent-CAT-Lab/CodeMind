<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three long integers as input: a, b, and n.
It calculates the minimum value between (b - 1) and n and assigns it to variable x.
Then it calculates the value of ans by multiplying a and x and dividing it by b.
Finally, it prints the value of ans as the output.
In this case, a = 5, b = 7, and n = 4.
The minimum value between (7 - 1) and 4 is 4, so x = 4.
The value of ans is calculated as (5 * 4) / 7 = 20 / 7 = 2.
Therefore, the output would be 2.
