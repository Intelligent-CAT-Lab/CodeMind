<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input `n` and calculates the prime factorization of `n`. It iterates from 2 to the square root of `n` and checks if `n` is divisible by `i`. If it is, it divides `n` by `i` and increments the count of `i` in the prime factorization map. After the loop, if `n` is greater than 1, it adds `n` to the prime factorization map with a count of 1. Then it calculates the number of divisors of `n` by multiplying the count of each prime factor plus 1. Finally, it subtracts 1 from the number of divisors to exclude the case where `n` itself is a divisor. The final result is the number of distinct prime factors and the number of divisors of `n` minus 1.
