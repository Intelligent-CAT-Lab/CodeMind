<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 18 according to the input. A map pf is created to store the prime factors of n and their counts. 
The code then iterates from 2 to the square root of n and checks if i is a factor of n. If it is, it divides n by i and increments the count of i in the map pf.
After the loop, if n is still greater than 1, it means n is a prime number and it adds n to the map pf with count 1.
Then it calculates the answer by multiplying the count of each prime factor in pf plus 1.
Finally, it prints the size of pf and the answer minus 1 as output.
In this case, the prime factors of 18 are 2 and 3, and their counts are both 1. So the size of pf is 2 and the answer is (1+1) * (1+1) - 1 = 3.
