The variable l is initialized with 4 according to the input. The variable n is initialized with 1 and the variable m is initialized with 0. The variable sb is initialized as an empty StringBuilder.
It enters a while loop and it checks if (1<<n-1)-1 is less than l. In this case, it is true because (1<<1-1)-1 = 1-1 = 0 is less than 4. So it increments n by 1. Now n is 2.
Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to n-1, which is from 1 to 1. Inside the loop, it appends the string representation of i, i+1 and 0 to the StringBuilder sb. It also increments m by 2.
After the loop finishes, it calculates the value of max as (1<<n-1)-1, which is (1<<2-1)-1 = 1-1 = 0.
Then it enters a while loop and it checks if l-max is greater than 1. In this case, it is true because 4-0 = 4 is greater than 1. So it enters the loop.
Inside the loop, it calculates the value of k as 1 because (1<<k-1) is less than l-max. Then it appends the string representation of k, n and max+1 to the StringBuilder sb. It also increments m by 1 and max by (1<<k-1).
After the loop finishes, it prints the values of n and m as output. n is 2 and m is 3.
Then it prints the string representation of sb as output.
