<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads three integers from the input using the Scanner class and assigns them to variables ab, bc, and ca respectively. Then it calculates the value of the variable cal by multiplying ab and bc and dividing the result by 2. Finally, it prints the value of cal as the output.
In this case, the input is "3 4 5", so ab will be assigned the value 3, bc will be assigned the value 4, and ca will be assigned the value 5. The value of cal will be (3 * 4) / 2 = 6 / 2 = 3.
