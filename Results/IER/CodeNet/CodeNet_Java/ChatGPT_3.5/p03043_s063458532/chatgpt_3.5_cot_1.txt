<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 3 and variable k is initialized with 10 according to the input. 
It creates a Scanner object to read input from the user.
It reads a double value from the user and assigns it to variable n.
It reads an integer value from the user and assigns it to variable k.
It closes the Scanner object.
It initializes variable winRatio with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to n (3 in this case) to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable x.
Inside the for loop, it initializes variable m with 1.
Then it enters a while loop and it checks if the value of x is less than k (10 in this case). If it is, it multiplies the value of x by 2 and multiplies the value of m by 2.
After the while loop finishes, it calculates the winRatio by adding (1/n)/m to the current value of winRatio.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of winRatio as output.
<<<Output>>>
0.375
