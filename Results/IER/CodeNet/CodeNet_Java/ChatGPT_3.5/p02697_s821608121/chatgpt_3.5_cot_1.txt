<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 4 and variable m is initialized with 1 according to the input. The variables a and b are initialized with 1 and 1 respectively. Since m is not divisible by 2, the value of b remains 1. The variable c is also initialized with 1.
Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 1. Inside the loop, it checks if a is equal to b. Since a is equal to b, it assigns the value of c+1 to a and assigns the value of 2*m+1 to b. Then it prints the values of a and b. The values printed are 2 and 3.
After the loop finishes, the program ends.
