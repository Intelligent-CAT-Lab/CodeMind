<<<Analysis>>>
The code first reads an integer n from the input. Then it checks if n is equal to 1 or 2. If it is, it prints 1 or 3 respectively and returns. Otherwise, it continues to execute the rest of the code.
The code initializes an array of primes using the sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm. It then multiplies n by 2 and calculates the divisors of the result using the enumDivisors method.
The code then iterates over each divisor d and calculates the corresponding divisor e. It uses the exgcd method to find the values of x and y such that dx + ey = 1. If x or y is negative, it calculates the corresponding value of k and updates the minimum value of ret if necessary.
Finally, the code prints the value of ret as the output.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of `11` is 11.
