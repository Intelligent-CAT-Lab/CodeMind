<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 11 according to the input. 
It checks if n is equal to 1 or 2. If it is, it prints 1 or 3 respectively and returns.
Otherwise, it initializes an array of primes using the sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm.
Then it multiplies n by 2 and calculates the divisors of the result using the enumDivisors method.
For each divisor d, it calculates the corresponding divisor e by dividing n by d.
Then it calculates the extended greatest common divisor (exgcd) of d and e using the exgcd method.
If the first element of the exgcd result is not equal to 1, it continues to the next iteration.
Otherwise, it calculates the values of x and y using the exgcd result.
If x is negative, it calculates the value of k as d multiplied by the absolute value of x and compares it with the current minimum value of ret.
If y is negative, it calculates the value of k as e multiplied by the absolute value of y and compares it with the current minimum value of ret.
Finally, it prints the value of ret as the output.
