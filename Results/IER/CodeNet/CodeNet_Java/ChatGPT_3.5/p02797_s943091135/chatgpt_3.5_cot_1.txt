<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, K, and S are initialized with 4, 2, and 3 respectively according to the input.
Then, an array of size N is created and stored in the variable ans.
Next, a for loop is used to iterate through each element of the ans array.
If the current index i is less than K, the value of S is assigned to ans[i].
Otherwise, if S is equal to 1000000000, the value of 1 is assigned to ans[i].
Otherwise, the value of S+1 is assigned to ans[i].
After the loop finishes, the elements of the ans array are printed as output.
In this case, the elements of the ans array are [3, 3, 4, 4].
<<<Output>>>
3 3 4 4
