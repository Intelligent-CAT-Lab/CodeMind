<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input: m, f, and b. It compares the value of m with b. If m is greater than or equal to b, it prints 0. Otherwise, it checks if the sum of m and f is greater than or equal to b. If it is, it prints the difference between b and m. If neither of these conditions is met, it prints "NA".
In this case, m = 1000, f = 3000, and b = 3000. Since m is not greater than or equal to b, the condition m + f >= b is true. Therefore, the output will be 2000.
<<<Output>>>
