<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers a and b as input. It initializes a variable count to 0.
Then it enters a for loop which iterates from a to b. For each iteration, it initializes an integer array of size 5.
It assigns the last digit of the current number i to array[0], the second last digit to array[1], and so on.
Then it checks if the first digit (array[0]) is equal to the last digit (array[4]) and if the second digit (array[1]) is equal to the fourth digit (array[3]).
If both conditions are true, it increments the count variable.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of count as the output.
