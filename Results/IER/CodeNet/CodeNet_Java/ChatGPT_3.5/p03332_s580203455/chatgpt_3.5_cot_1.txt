The variable n, variable A, variable B and variable K are initialized with 4, 1, 2 and 5 respectively according to the input. And variable ans is initialized with 0. Variable comb is an array of long with size n+1 and it is initialized with 1 at index 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 5 to calculate the values of comb[i] for each i. The value of comb[i] is calculated using the formula comb[i] = comb[i-1] * (n - i + 1) % MOD * pow(i, MOD - 2) % MOD. The pow() function is used to calculate the power of a number. The calculated value of comb[i] is stored in the array comb.
After the for loop, it initializes the variable q with the sum of K and A. Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to n to check each value of x. Inside the loop, it subtracts the value of A from q and checks if q is divisible by B. If it is divisible, it calculates the value of y by dividing q by B. If y is greater than n, it continues to the next iteration. If y is less than 0, it breaks out of the loop. Otherwise, it calculates the value of ans by multiplying comb[x] and comb[y] and adding it to ans. The calculated value of ans is stored in the variable ans.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of ans as output.
