<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string `s` and extracts two integers `m` and `y` from it. `m` is extracted from the 3rd and 4th characters of `s`, and `y` is extracted from the 1st and 2nd characters of `s`.
Then it checks the following conditions:
1. If both `y` and `m` are less than or equal to 12 and greater than 0, it prints "AMBIGUOUS".
2. If `m` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 12, it prints "YYMM".
3. If `y` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 12, it prints "MMYY".
4. Otherwise, it prints "NA".
Based on the input `1905`, `m` is 5 and `y` is 19. Since both `y` and `m` are greater than 0 and `m` is less than or equal to 12, the output will be "YYMM".
