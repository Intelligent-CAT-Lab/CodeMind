<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes an object of class Main2 and calls its yesNo() method.
Inside the yesNo() method, it creates a Scanner object to read input from the user.
Then it creates an integer array abc of size 3.
It enters a for loop and iterates 3 times to read 3 integers from the user and store them in the array abc.
After that, it checks if the first element of abc is less than the second element and the second element is less than the third element.
If the condition is true, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
In this case, the condition is false because 1 is not less than 3. So the output will be "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
