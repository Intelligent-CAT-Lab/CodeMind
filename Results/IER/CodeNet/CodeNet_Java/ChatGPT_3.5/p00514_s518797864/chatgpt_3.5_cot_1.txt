<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n, variable m and variable r are initialized with 2, 0 and 3 respectively according to the input. And variable ans is initialized with 1.
It subtracts the product of n and m from r and stores the result in variable r. In this case, r remains 3.
It checks if r is less than 0. Since r is not less than 0, it does not enter the if condition.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to n-1, which is from 0 to 1. In each iteration, it multiplies the current value of ans with (r + n - 1 - i) and divides it by (i + 1). In the first iteration, ans becomes 3 and in the second iteration, ans becomes 6.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable ans as output, which is 6.
<<<Output>>>
6
