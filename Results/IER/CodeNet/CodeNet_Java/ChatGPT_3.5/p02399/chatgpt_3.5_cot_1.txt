<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input using the Scanner class. The first integer is stored in variable a and the second integer is stored in variable b. Then the Scanner is closed.
Next, the code calculates the integer division of a by b and stores it in variable d. It also calculates the remainder of the division and stores it in variable r. 
Then, the code calculates the floating-point division of a by b and formats it to have 5 decimal places using the String.format() method. The result is stored in variable f.
Finally, the code prints the values of d, r, and f using the printf() method.

Given the input "3 2", the value of a is 3 and the value of b is 2.
The integer division of 3 by 2 is 1, so d = 1.
The remainder of the division is 1, so r = 1.
The floating-point division of 3 by 2 is 1.5, so f = "1.50000".

<<<Output>>>
1 1 1.50000
