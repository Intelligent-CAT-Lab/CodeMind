<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a class `Main` and a class `hayami`. The `Main` class has a main method that takes an integer input `n` and initializes it with the value 90. Then it creates an instance of the `hayami` class and calls the `saori_hayami()` method to read an integer input from the user. The value of `n` is then multiplied by `i` in a while loop until `i*n % 360 == 0` is true. Once the condition is met, the value of `i` is printed and the program terminates.

The `hayami` class implements the `Closeable` interface and has several helper methods for reading input. The `saori_hayami()` method reads an integer input from the user and returns it. The `close()` method closes the input stream.
