<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a class `Main` and a class `hayami`. The `Main` class has a main method that creates an instance of the `hayami` class and calls its `saori_hayami()` method to get an integer input. Then it enters a while loop that checks if `i*n % 360 == 0` for each value of `i` starting from 1. If the condition is true, it prints the value of `i` and returns. The `hayami` class is a helper class that implements the `Closeable` interface and provides methods for reading input from the user. The `saori_hayami()` method reads an integer input from the user and returns it.

The code does not provide any input, so it is not possible to determine the return value of `90`.

<<<Output>>>
Cannot determine the return value without input.
