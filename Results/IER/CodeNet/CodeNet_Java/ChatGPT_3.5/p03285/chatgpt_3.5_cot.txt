The variable N is initialized with 11 according to the input. And variable limit7 is initialized with N/7, which is 1. Variable check is initialized with false.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also used to calculate the value of variable left, which is N-(i*7). In the first iteration, i is 0, so left is 11. In the second iteration, i is 1, so left is 4.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the calculated variable left is divisible by 4. If it is, it sets the value of variable check to true. In the first iteration, left is not divisible by 4, so check remains false. In the second iteration, left is divisible by 4, so check becomes true.
After the loop finishes, it checks the value of variable check. If it is true, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No". In this case, since check is true, it prints "Yes" as output.
