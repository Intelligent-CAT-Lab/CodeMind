<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 11 according to the input. The variable limit7 is calculated as N divided by 7. The variable check is initialized as false.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to limit7. In each iteration, it calculates the value of variable left as N minus i multiplied by 7.
Then it checks if the value of left is divisible by 4. If it is, it sets the value of check as true.
After the loop finishes, it checks the value of check. If it is true, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
In this case, the value of N is 11. The value of limit7 is 1. In the first iteration of the loop, the value of left is 11. Since 11 is not divisible by 4, the value of check remains false.
After the loop finishes, it prints "No" as output.
<<<Output>>>
No
