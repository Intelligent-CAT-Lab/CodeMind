<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads input from the user using the Scanner class. It then enters a for loop that iterates as long as there is more input available. Inside the loop, it reads a line of input and splits it into an array of characters.

The code then initializes two variables, resultNum1 and resultNum2, with -1. These variables will store the indices of the characters that satisfy the given conditions.

Next, the code enters another for loop that iterates over the characters in the array. It checks two conditions for each character:

1. If the current character is equal to the next character, it sets resultNum1 to the index of the current character plus 1, and resultNum2 to the index of the next character plus 1. It then breaks out of the loop.

2. If the current character is equal to the character two positions ahead, it sets resultNum1 to the index of the current character plus 1, and resultNum2 to the index of the character two positions ahead plus 1. It then breaks out of the loop.

After the loop finishes, the code prints the values of resultNum1 and resultNum2.

<<<Output>>>
The output will depend on the input provided. Since the code reads input in a loop, it will continue to execute until there is no more input. For each line of input, the code will print the values of resultNum1 and resultNum2.
