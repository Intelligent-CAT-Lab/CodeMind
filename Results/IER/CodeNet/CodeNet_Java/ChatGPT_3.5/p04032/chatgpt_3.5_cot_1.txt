<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads input from the user using the Scanner class. It then enters a for loop that iterates as long as there is more input available. Inside the loop, it reads a line of input and splits it into an array of characters.

The code then initializes two variables, resultNum1 and resultNum2, with -1. These variables will store the indices of the characters that are repeated in the input string.

Next, the code enters another for loop that iterates over the characters in the input string. It checks if the current character is equal to the next character. If it is, it sets resultNum1 to the index of the current character plus 1, and resultNum2 to the index of the next character plus 1. It then breaks out of the loop.

If the current character is not equal to the next character, the code checks if the current character is equal to the character two positions ahead. If it is, it sets resultNum1 to the index of the current character plus 1, and resultNum2 to the index of the character two positions ahead plus 1. It then breaks out of the loop.

After the loop finishes, the code prints the values of resultNum1 and resultNum2 as output.

In the given input "needed", the character 'e' at index 1 is equal to the character 'e' at index 2. Therefore, the output will be "1 2".
