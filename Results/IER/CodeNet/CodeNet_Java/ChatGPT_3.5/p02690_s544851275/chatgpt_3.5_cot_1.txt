<<<Analysis>>>
The variable X is initialized with 33 according to the input. And variables A and B are initialized with 0.
It creates an array fiveExp of size 1000 and initializes each element with the value of i^5, where i ranges from 0 to 999.
Then it enters a nested for loop to search for values of A and B that satisfy the conditions.
Inside the nested for loop, it subtracts the value of fiveExp[j] from X and checks if the result is equal to fiveExp[i]. If it is, it assigns the values of i and -j to variables A and B respectively and breaks out of the loop.
If the condition is not met, it adds the value of fiveExp[j] to X and checks if the result is equal to fiveExp[i]. If it is, it assigns the values of i and j to variables A and B respectively and breaks out of the loop.
After the loop finishes, it prints the values of A and B as output.
