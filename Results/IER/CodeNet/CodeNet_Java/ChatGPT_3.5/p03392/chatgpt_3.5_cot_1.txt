<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input and checks for different conditions to determine the output. 
First, it checks if the length of the string is less than or equal to 2. If it is, it checks if the characters at index 0 and index 1 are the same. If they are, it prints 1. Otherwise, it prints 2.
If the length of the string is greater than 2, it checks if the string is one of the six possible combinations of "abc", "acb", "bac", "bca", "cab", "cba". If it is, it prints 3.
If the string is not one of the six combinations, it checks if there are any adjacent characters in the string that are the same. If there are, it sets the answer to 0.
Then, it calculates the sum of the ASCII values of the characters in the string modulo 3.
It initializes a 3D array dp and dp_no_dpl with dimensions n, 3, and 3.
It sets the initial values of dp and dp_no_dpl based on the first character of the string.
Then, it iterates through the remaining characters of the string and updates the values of dp_no_dpl based on the previous values.
Finally, it calculates the answer by adding the exponentiation of 3 to the power of n-1, subtracting the values of dp_no_dpl for the sum modulo 3, and taking the modulo of the result.
The final answer is printed as the output.
