<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers n and k as input. It then creates an instance of the Combinatrics class passing n+k-1 as the parameter to the constructor.
The Combinatrics class initializes three arrays: fact, inv, and finv. It calculates the factorial, inverse, and factorial inverse values for each number from 0 to n+k-1.
Then it calls the homogeneous method of the Combinatrics class passing k and n as parameters. The homogeneous method calculates the value of nHr (n+r-1Cr) and returns it.
Finally, the code prints the value returned by the homogeneous method as the output.
