<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers n and k as input. It then creates an instance of the Combinatrics class and initializes it with n+k-1. 
The Combinatrics class has methods to calculate various combinatorial values such as factorial, combination, permutation, and homogeneous.
The code then calls the homogeneous method of the Combinatrics class with the values of k and n as arguments and prints the result.
The homogeneous method calculates the value of nHr, which is the number of ways to choose r items from n items with repetition allowed.
