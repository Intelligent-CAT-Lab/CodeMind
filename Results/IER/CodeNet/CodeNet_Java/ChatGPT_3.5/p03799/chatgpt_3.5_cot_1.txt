The variable N is initialized with 1 and variable M is initialized with 6 according to the input. And variable ans is initialized with 0.
It checks the following conditions one by one:
1. If N is greater than M, it prints M/2 and exits the program. But in this case, N is not greater than M.
2. If N is equal to 1 and M is equal to 1, it prints 0 and exits the program. But in this case, N is not equal to 1 and M is not equal to 1.
3. If N is equal to 2 and M is equal to 1, it prints 0 and exits the program. But in this case, N is not equal to 2 and M is not equal to 1.
4. If N * 2 is greater than M, it prints M/2 and exits the program. But in this case, N * 2 is not greater than M.
After checking all the conditions, it calculates the value of ans using the formula ans = N + ((M - N * 2) / 4). In this case, N is 1 and M is 6, so ans = 1 + ((6 - 1 * 2) / 4) = 1 + (4 / 4) = 1 + 1 = 2.
Finally, it prints the value of ans as output, which is 2.
