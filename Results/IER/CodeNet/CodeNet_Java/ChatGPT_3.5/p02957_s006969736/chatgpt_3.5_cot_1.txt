<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, x and y. It then calls the solution() method passing x and y as arguments.
Inside the solution() method, it checks if the sum of x and y is divisible by 2. If it is, it prints the average of x and y. If it is not, it prints "IMPOSSIBLE".
In this case, the sum of 2 and 16 is 18, which is divisible by 2. So, the code will print the average of 2 and 16, which is 9.
<<<Output>>>
9
