<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 4 and variable D is initialized with 3 according to the input. And variable ans is initialized.
It checks if D is equal to 1. Since D is not equal to 1, it goes to the else block.
It calculates the value of variable dense as N - D, which is 1.
Then it calculates the value of variable ans as dense * (dense - 1) / 2, which is 0.
Then it adds 2 * dense to ans, which is 2.
Finally, it adds D - 2 to ans, which is 1.
So the final value of ans is 3.
It prints the final value of ans as output, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>
