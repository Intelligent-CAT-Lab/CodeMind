<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input: zeroes, ones, and k. It then calculates the depth as (zeroes + ones - 1) / (k - 1). It initializes an array called ways with size ones + 1 and sets the first element to 1. It also initializes a variable called res to 0. It creates a boolean array called nice with size ones + 1. 

The code then enters a for loop that iterates from 1 to depth. Inside this loop, it fills the nice array with false values. It then enters another for loop that iterates from 0 to depth - i. Inside this loop, it calculates the value of now as ones - extra * (k - 1) and if now is greater than or equal to 0, it sets the nice[now] to true.

Next, it enters another for loop that iterates from ones to 0. Inside this loop, it checks if the value of ways[old] is not equal to 0. If it is not equal to 0, it enters another for loop that iterates from 1 to k - 1. Inside this loop, it checks if nice[old + cur] is true. If it is true, it adds ways[old] to res and if res is greater than or equal to MODULO, it subtracts MODULO from res. It then adds ways[old] to ways[old + cur] and if ways[old + cur] is greater than or equal to MODULO, it subtracts MODULO from ways[old + cur].

After the loops finish, it prints the value of res as the output.
