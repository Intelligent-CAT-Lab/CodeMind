<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes several variables and then calls the `get13f` method twice with different input values. The `get13f` method calculates the number of occurrences of the 13th day falling on a Friday between two given dates. The method uses a loop to iterate through each day and checks if the current day is the 13th and if it is a Friday. If so, it increments a counter variable. The loop continues until it reaches the second input date. Finally, the code calculates the total number of occurrences of the 13th day falling on a Friday by subtracting the counter values for the two input dates and multiplying the result by 688 (the number of occurrences in a 400-year period). The result is then printed as the output.

In this case, the input dates are the same, so the output will be 0.
