<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs using the Scanner class. The first input is multiplied by 500 and stored in the variable "coins". Then it checks if the value of "coins" is greater than or equal to the second input. If it is, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".
In this case, the first input is 2, so "coins" will be 2 * 500 = 1000. The second input is 900. Since 1000 is greater than 900, the output will be "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
