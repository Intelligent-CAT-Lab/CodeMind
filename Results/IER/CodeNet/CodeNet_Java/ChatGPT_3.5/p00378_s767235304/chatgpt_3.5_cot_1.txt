The variables A, B, and X are initialized with 180, 100, and 2400 respectively according to the input. The variables n, O, T, G, z, and y are also initialized. 

The value of T is calculated by dividing X by 500. The value of n is calculated by dividing X by 1000. If X is divisible by 1000, the value of O is calculated by multiplying A with n. Otherwise, the value of O is calculated by multiplying A with (n + 1). If X is divisible by 500, the value of G is calculated by multiplying B with T. Otherwise, the value of G is calculated by multiplying B with (T + 1).

A variable mini is initialized with a large value. A variable nedan is also initialized.

A for loop is used to iterate from 0 to 999. Inside the loop, it checks if X is greater than or equal to i * 1000. If it is, it calculates the value of z by subtracting i * 1000 from X. It then calculates the value of y by dividing z by 500. If z is divisible by 500, the value of nedan is calculated by multiplying i with A and y with B. Otherwise, the value of nedan is calculated by multiplying i with A and (y + 1) with B. If mini is greater than or equal to nedan, the value of mini is updated to nedan.

Finally, it compares the values of O, G, and mini. If O is less than G and mini, it prints O. If G is less than O and mini, it prints G. Otherwise, it prints mini.
