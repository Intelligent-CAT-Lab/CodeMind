<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers x and y from the input using the Scanner class. The input values are 81 and 58.
Then it calls the put() method with the value of x+y/2 as the argument.
The value of y/2 is calculated first, which is 29. Then x+y/2 is calculated, which is 81+29 = 110.
Finally, the put() method is called with the value 110 as the argument, which prints the value to the console.
<<<Output>>>
110
