<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers x and y from the input using the Scanner class. Then it calls the put() method with the value of x+y/2 as the argument. The put() method prints the argument value on a new line.
So, the output would be the value of x+y/2, which is 81+58/2 = 81+29 = 110.
<<<Output>>>
110
