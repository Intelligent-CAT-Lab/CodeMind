<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads four integers from the input: 3, 8, 7, and 1. It then performs the following operations:
1. It adds the first two integers (3 + 8) and assigns the result to variable a.
2. It adds the last two integers (7 + 1) and assigns the result to variable b.
3. It compares the values of a and b using the ternary operator.
4. If a is greater than b, it prints "Left".
5. If a is equal to b, it prints "Balanced".
6. If a is less than b, it prints "Right".

In this case, a = 3 + 8 = 11 and b = 7 + 1 = 8. Since a is greater than b, the output will be "Left".
