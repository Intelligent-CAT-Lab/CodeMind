<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string as input and converts it into a character array. It then initializes variables n, cur, and ans. It also initializes an array d with size n+1 and an array f with size 2019. It sets f[0] to 1.
The code then enters a for loop that iterates from n-1 to 0. Inside the loop, it calculates the value of d[i] by multiplying the current character with cur and adding it to d[i+1]. It then updates the values of cur and d[i] by taking modulo 2019. It adds the value of f[d[i]] to ans and increments f[d[i]].
Finally, it prints the value of ans.
