<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 4 and variable m is initialized with 7 according to the input. The variable mod is initialized with 998244353.
Then it initializes an array f of size 2*n+3 and sets the first two elements of the array to 1. Then it calculates the Fibonacci numbers using a for loop and stores them in the array f. The Fibonacci numbers are calculated modulo mod.
Next, it initializes two variables prod and s to 1 and 0 respectively. It also initializes an array invs using the enumInvs method.
Then it enters a for loop that iterates from n-1 to 0. In each iteration, it calculates the sum s by multiplying the Fibonacci number f[2*i+1] with prod and adding it to s. It also updates the value of prod by multiplying it with (m+n-i-1) modulo mod and invs[n-i] modulo mod.
After the loop finishes, it calculates the value of ret by subtracting s from the Fibonacci number fib(m+2*n, mod). It then takes the modulo mod of ret and if ret is negative, it adds mod to it.
Finally, it prints the value of ret as the output.
