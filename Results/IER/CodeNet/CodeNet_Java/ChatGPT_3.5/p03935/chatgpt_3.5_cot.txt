<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 4 and variable m is initialized with 7 according to the input. The variable mod is initialized with 998244353.
Then it initializes an array f of size 2*n+3 and sets the first two elements of the array to 1. Then it calculates the Fibonacci numbers using a for loop and stores them in the array f. The Fibonacci numbers are calculated modulo mod.
Then it initializes two variables prod and s to 1 and 0 respectively.
Then it calculates the inverse of numbers from 1 to n+1 modulo mod and stores them in an array invs using the enumInvs method.
Then it enters a for loop and iterates from n-1 to 0. In each iteration, it calculates the sum s by adding f[2*i+1] multiplied by prod modulo mod. Then it updates the value of prod by multiplying it with (m+n-i-1) modulo mod, (n-i) modulo mod and the inverse of (n-i) modulo mod.
Finally, it calculates the value of ret by subtracting s from the Fibonacci number fib(m+2*n, mod) modulo mod. If ret is negative, it adds mod to it. Then it prints the value of ret as output.
