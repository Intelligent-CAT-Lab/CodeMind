The variable N is initialized with 12 according to the input. The variable X is also initialized with the same value as N. The variable fx is initialized with 0.
It enters a while loop and it continues as long as N is greater than or equal to 10. Inside the loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current integer N by repeatedly extracting the digits of the number with the modulus operator and adding it to variable fx. Then it divides N by 10 to remove the last digit.
After the loop finishes, it adds the last remaining digit of N to variable fx. Then it checks if the original value of N is divisible by fx. If it is, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
In this case, the sum of the digits of 12 is 1 + 2 = 3. Since 12 is not divisible by 3, the output would be "No".
