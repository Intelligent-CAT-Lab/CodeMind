<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input using the `gs()` method and assigns it to the variable `s`. 
Then it calculates the number of occurrences of the letter 'o' in the string `s` by subtracting the length of `s` after replacing all occurrences of 'o' with an empty string from the original length of `s`. 
It multiplies the count of 'o' by 100 and adds 700 to it. 
Finally, it prints the result as the output.
In this case, the input string is "oxo", which contains 2 occurrences of 'o'. 
So, the output would be (2 * 100) + 700 = 900.
<<<Output>>>
900
