<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string and converts it into a character array. It then initializes variables oneSum and indexes. It then iterates through the character array and checks if the current character is '1'. If it is, it calculates the length of the consecutive '1's starting from the current index. If the length is odd, it adds the current index minus the difference between oneSum and the size of indexes to the indexes list. It then updates oneSum by adding the length and increments the loop variable by the length. After the loop, it calculates the zeroSum by subtracting oneSum from the length of the character array. It then calculates the ans by multiplying (zeroSum+1) with (oneSum minus the size of indexes) and dividing it by 2. It then iterates through the indexes list and for each index, it calculates a value and adds it to ans. Finally, it iterates from oneSum-1 to 1 and for each value, it calculates a value and adds it to ans. The final value of ans is printed as the output.
In this case, the input string is "1101". The code will calculate the ans based on the given input.
