<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string and converts it into a character array. It then initializes variables oneSum and indexes. It iterates through the character array and checks if the current character is '1'. If it is, it calculates the length of the consecutive '1's starting from the current index. If the length is odd, it adds the current index minus the difference between oneSum and the size of indexes to the indexes list. It then updates oneSum by adding the length and increments the loop variable by the length. After the loop, it calculates the zeroSum by subtracting oneSum from the length of the character array. It calculates the initial value of ans by multiplying (zeroSum+1) with (oneSum minus the size of indexes) and dividing it by 2. It then iterates through the indexes list and calculates the additional values of ans by adding (zeroSum+1) minus (index minus i plus (1 plus i modulo 2)) divided by 2. Finally, it iterates from oneSum-1 to 1 and adds (i+1) divided by 2 to ans. The final value of ans is printed as the output.
