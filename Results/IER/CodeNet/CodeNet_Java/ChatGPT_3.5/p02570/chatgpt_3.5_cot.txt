<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input: d, t, and s. It calculates the value of d/s and assigns it to the variable ans. 
If ans is less than or equal to t, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
In this case, d=1000, t=15, and s=80. 
The value of ans is calculated as 1000/80 = 12.5.
Since 12.5 is greater than 15, the output will be "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
