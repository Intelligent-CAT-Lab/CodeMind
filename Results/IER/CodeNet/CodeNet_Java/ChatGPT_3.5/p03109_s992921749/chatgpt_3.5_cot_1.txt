<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string in the format "yyyy/mm/dd" and splits it into three parts: year, month, and day. It then converts the month and day into integers. 
Next, it checks if the month is less than or equal to 4. If it is, it sets the string variable "ans" to "Heisei". Otherwise, it sets "ans" to "TBD".
Finally, it prints the value of "ans" as the output.
In this case, the month is 4, which is less than or equal to 4, so the output will be "Heisei".
<<<Output>>>
Heisei
