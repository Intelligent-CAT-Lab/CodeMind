<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input using the Scanner class. These integers are assigned to variables a, b, and c respectively.
Then it checks if the sum of a, b, and c is greater than or equal to 22. If it is, it prints "bust". Otherwise, it prints "win".
In this case, the sum of 5, 7, and 9 is 21, which is less than 22. Therefore, the output will be "win".
<<<Output>>>
win
