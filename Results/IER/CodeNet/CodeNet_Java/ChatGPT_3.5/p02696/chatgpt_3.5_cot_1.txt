<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three long integers as input: a, b, and n.
It checks if n is greater than or equal to b. If it is, it calculates and prints the value of (a*(b-1)/b).
If n is less than b, it calculates and prints the value of (a*n/b).
In this case, n=4 which is less than b=7, so it calculates and prints the value of (a*n/b).
The value of a is 5, n is 4, and b is 7.
So, the output will be (5*4/7) = 20/7 = 2.
