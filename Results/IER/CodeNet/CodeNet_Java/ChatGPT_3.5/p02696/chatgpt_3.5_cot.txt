<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three long integers as input: a, b, and n.
It checks if n is greater than or equal to b. If it is, it calculates and prints the value of (a*(b-1)/b).
If n is less than b, it calculates and prints the value of (a*n/b).
In this case, a=5, b=7, and n=4.
Since n is less than b, the code will calculate and print the value of (a*n/b).
The value of (a*n/b) will be (5*4/7) = 20/7 = 2.857142857142857.
However, since the code is using long data type, the decimal part will be truncated and the output will be 2.
