<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers H and R from the input. It then checks three conditions:
1. If H*(-1) is equal to R, it prints "0".
2. If H*(-1) is greater than R, it prints "-1".
3. If H*(-1) is less than R, it prints "1".

In this case, H is -3 and R is 3. So, H*(-1) is 3. Since 3 is equal to R, the first condition is true and it will print "0" as the output.
<<<Output>>>
