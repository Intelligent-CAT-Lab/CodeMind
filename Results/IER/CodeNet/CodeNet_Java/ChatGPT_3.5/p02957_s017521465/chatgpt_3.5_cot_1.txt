<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input and assigns them to variables a and b respectively.
Then it checks if the difference between a and b is divisible by 2. If it is, it calculates the average of a and b and prints it as output. If it is not divisible by 2, it prints "IMPOSSIBLE" as output.
In this case, the difference between 2 and 16 is 14, which is not divisible by 2. Therefore, the output will be "IMPOSSIBLE".
