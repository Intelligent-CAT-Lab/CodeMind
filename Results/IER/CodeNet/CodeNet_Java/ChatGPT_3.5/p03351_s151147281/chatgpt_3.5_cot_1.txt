<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a class `Main` and a class `hayami`. The `Main` class has a main method that performs the following steps:
1. Creates an instance of the `hayami` class.
2. Calls the `saori_hayami` method four times to read four integers from the input and assigns them to variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`.
3. Initializes a boolean variable `flg` to `true`.
4. Checks if the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is greater than `d` or the absolute difference between `b` and `c` is greater than `d`. If either condition is true, `flg` is set to `false`.
5. If `flg` is `false`, it checks if the absolute difference between `a` and `c` is less than or equal to `d`. If true, `flg` is set to `true`.
6. Finally, it prints "Yes" if `flg` is `true`, otherwise it prints "No".

The `hayami` class implements the `Closeable` interface and provides methods for reading input. It has the following methods:
1. `HayamiSaori`: Checks if there is more input to read.
2. `SaoriHayami`: Reads the next integer from the input.
3. `hayami_saori`: Checks if a given integer is within the range of printable ASCII characters.
4. `hayamisaori`: Skips non-printable ASCII characters in the input.
5. `nextHayami`: Reads the next string from the input.
6. `saorihayami`: Reads the next long from the input.
7. `saori_hayami`: Reads the next integer from the input.
8. `Hayamin`: Reads the next double from the input.
9. `close`: Closes the input stream.
