<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 30 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 30 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable x.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current integer x is divisible by 3. If it is, it prints the value of i.
If the current integer x is not divisible by 3, it enters a while loop. In the while loop, it checks if the last digit of x is equal to 3. If it is, it prints the value of i and breaks out of the loop.
If the last digit of x is not equal to 3, it removes the last digit of x by dividing it by 10. If x becomes 0, it breaks out of the loop.
After the loop finishes, it prints a new line.
<<<Output>>>
