<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes 6 integers as input: r, c, a1, a2, b1, b2. The input values are 4, 4, 0, 0, 3, 3 respectively.
It calculates the absolute difference between a1 and b1 and stores it in variable x. It also calculates the absolute difference between a2 and b2 and stores it in variable y.
Then it calculates the minimum value between x and r-x and stores it in x. Similarly, it calculates the minimum value between y and c-y and stores it in y.
Then it initializes variable z with 1 and variable C with the minimum value between x and y.
If x is equal to r-x, it multiplies z by 2. Similarly, if y is equal to c-y, it multiplies z by 2.
Then it initializes a BigInteger variable b with the value 1.
It enters a for loop that iterates from 0 to C-1. In each iteration, it multiplies b by (x+y-i) and divides it by (i+1).
Finally, it multiplies b by z and takes the modulo with 100000007. The result is printed as the output.
