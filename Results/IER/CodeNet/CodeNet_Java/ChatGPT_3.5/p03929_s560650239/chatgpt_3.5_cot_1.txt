<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 7 and variable k is initialized with 7 according to the input. 
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 11 to check each integer i in this range. 
Inside the first for loop, it enters another for loop which iterates from 1 to 5 to check each integer j in this range.
Inside the second for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current integer base by nested for loops and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum modulo 11 is equal to k. If it does, it increments the variable cnt by 1.
After the loop finishes, it subtracts 2 from variable n and assigns the result to n.
Then it calculates the variable ans by dividing n by 11 and multiplying it with cnt.
Then it takes the modulo of n with 11 and assigns the result to n.
Then it enters another for loop which iterates from 1 to n to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the third for loop, it enters another for loop which iterates from 1 to 5 to check each integer j in this range.
Inside the fourth for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current integer base by nested for loops and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum modulo 11 is equal to k. If it does, it increments the variable ans by 1.
Finally, it prints the value of variable ans as output.
