<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes 6 integers as input. It initializes a variable sum with 0. Then it enters a for loop and iterates 6 times. In each iteration, it takes an integer input and based on the value of i, it performs a specific operation on the input and adds it to the sum. The operations are as follows:
- For i = 0, it adds the input as it is to the sum.
- For i = 1, it multiplies the input by 5 and adds it to the sum.
- For i = 2, it multiplies the input by 10 and adds it to the sum.
- For i = 3, it multiplies the input by 50 and adds it to the sum.
- For i = 4, it multiplies the input by 100 and adds it to the sum.
- For i = 5, it multiplies the input by 500 and adds it to the sum.

After the loop finishes, it checks if the sum is greater than or equal to 1000. If it is, it prints 1. Otherwise, it prints 0.

Based on the given input, the values of the inputs are as follows:
- For i = 0, tmp = 3
- For i = 1, tmp = 1
- For i = 2, tmp = 4
- For i = 3, tmp = 0
- For i = 4, tmp = 4
- For i = 5, tmp = 1

So, the sum would be: 3 + 1*5 + 4*10 + 0*50 + 4*100 + 1*500 = 3 + 5 + 40 + 0 + 400 + 500 = 948

Since the sum is less than 1000, the output would be 0.
