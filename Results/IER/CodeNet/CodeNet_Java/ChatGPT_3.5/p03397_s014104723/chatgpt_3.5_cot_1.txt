<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string of characters as input. It initializes a 3D array dp with dimensions n, 3, and 3, where n is the length of the input string. The array dp stores the number of ways to form a valid string up to a certain index i, with the last two characters being (k, t), where k and t are integers between 0 and 2.

The code then iterates through each character in the input string and updates the dp array accordingly. For each character, it checks if it is equal to '1' or '?'. If it is, it increments the corresponding element in dp by 1. Similarly, if the character is equal to '0' or '?', it increments another element in dp by 1.

After updating the dp array, the code calculates the final answer by summing up the values in dp[n-1][1][0], dp[n-1][2][0], dp[n-1][2][1], and dp[n-1][2][2]. The answer is then printed as the output.
