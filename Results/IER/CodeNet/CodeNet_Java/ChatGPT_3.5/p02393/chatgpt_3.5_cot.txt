<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string and splits it into an array of strings using the space as a delimiter. The array is then sorted in ascending order using the Arrays.sort() method. The first element of the sorted array is parsed into an integer variable intNumSmall, the second element is parsed into intNumMiddle, and the third element is parsed into intNumLarge. Finally, the values of intNumSmall, intNumMiddle, and intNumLarge are printed with spaces in between.
In this case, the input string is "3 8 1". After splitting and sorting, the array becomes ["1", "3", "8"]. The values are then parsed into intNumSmall = 1, intNumMiddle = 3, and intNumLarge = 8. The output is "1 3 8".
