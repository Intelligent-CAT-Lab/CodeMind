<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes input as a string and splits it into an array of strings using the space as a delimiter. The array is then sorted in ascending order using the Arrays.sort() method. The sorted array is then converted back to integers and assigned to variables intNumSmall, intNumMiddle, and intNumLarge. Finally, the values of these variables are printed in the format "intNumSmall intNumMiddle intNumLarge".

In this case, the input "3 8 1" will be split into the array ["3", "8", "1"]. After sorting, the array becomes ["1", "3", "8"]. The values are then converted to integers and assigned to the variables intNumSmall = 1, intNumMiddle = 3, and intNumLarge = 8. The output will be "1 3 8".

<<<Output>>>
1 3 8
