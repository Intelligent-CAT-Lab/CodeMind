The variable N, V, X, and Y are initialized with 0, 7, 3, and 1 respectively according to the input. And the arrays L, B, R, and T are initialized with the input values.
The code then calls the check() method passing the values of X and Y as arguments. Inside the check() method, it calculates the values of a, b, c, and D based on the input values and checks if D is less than 0. If D is less than 0, it returns false.
Then it enters a for loop with d starting from -1 and incrementing by 2 in each iteration. Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of t2 using the quadratic formula and checks if t2 is less than 0. If t2 is less than 0, it continues to the next iteration.
If t2 is greater than or equal to 0, it calculates the values of t, vx, and vy based on the values of qx, qy, and V. It then calculates the value of yt using the calc() method.
If yt is less than Y - EPS, it continues to the next iteration. Otherwise, it enters another for loop to iterate through the obstacles.
Inside the second for loop, it checks if the current obstacle is to the right of the bird. If it is, it continues to the next iteration.
If the current obstacle is above the bird and the bird's height at time t is greater than or equal to the bottom of the obstacle, it sets ok to false.
It then checks if the bird's height at time t is between the top and bottom of the obstacle. If it is, it sets ok to false.
It also checks if the bird's height at the highest point of its trajectory is greater than or equal to the bottom of the obstacle and the bird's height at the left of the obstacle is less than 0. If it is, it sets ok to false.
After the second for loop finishes, it checks if ok is true. If it is, it returns true. Otherwise, it continues to the next iteration of the for loop.
If the for loop finishes without returning true, it returns false.
Finally, the code prints "Yes" if ok is true and "No" if ok is false.
