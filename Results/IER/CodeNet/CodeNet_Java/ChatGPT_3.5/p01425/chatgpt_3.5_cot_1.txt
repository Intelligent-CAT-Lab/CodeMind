<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, V, X, and Y are initialized with 0, 7, 3, and 1 respectively according to the input. 
Then it creates four arrays L, B, R, and T with size N.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to N-1 to read the values of L, B, R, and T from the input and store them in the corresponding arrays.
Then it checks if the value of R[i] is greater than X, if it is, it assigns the value of X to R[i].
Then it calls the check method passing the values of X and Y as arguments and assigns the result to the variable ok.
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to N-1 to call the check method passing the values of L[i] and T[i] as arguments and assigns the result to the variable ok.
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to N-1 to call the check method passing the values of R[i] and T[i] as arguments and assigns the result to the variable ok.
Finally, it checks the value of ok and if it is true, it prints "Yes", otherwise, it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
