The variable n, variable a, variable b and variable k are initialized with 4, 1, 2 and 5 respectively according to the input. And variable ans is initialized with 0.
An array nck of size n+1 is created to store the values of n choose k. The value of nck[0] is initialized with 1. Then a for loop is used to calculate the values of n choose k for each k from 1 to n. The formula used is nck[i]=nck[i-1]*(n-i+1)%M*modI(i, M)%M, where M=998244353. This formula calculates the value of n choose k using modular arithmetic.
Another for loop is used to iterate through each possible value of i from 0 to n. Inside this loop, it checks if the value of k-a*i is divisible by b and if the quotient is less than or equal to n. If both conditions are true, it adds the product of nck[i] and nck[(k-a*i)/b] to the variable ans.
Finally, it prints the value of ans%M as the output.
