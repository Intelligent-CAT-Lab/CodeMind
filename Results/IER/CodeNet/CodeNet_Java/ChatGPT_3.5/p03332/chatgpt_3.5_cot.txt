<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four long integers as input: n, a, b, and k. It initializes the variable ans to 0. It also initializes an array nck of size n+1 and sets the first element to 1. Then it calculates the values of nck[i] for i from 1 to n using a loop. 

Next, it iterates from 0 to n and checks if a*i is less than or equal to k. If it is, it checks if (k-a*i) is divisible by b and if the quotient is less than or equal to n. If both conditions are true, it adds nck[i]*nck[(k-a*i)/b] to ans.

Finally, it prints ans modulo M.
