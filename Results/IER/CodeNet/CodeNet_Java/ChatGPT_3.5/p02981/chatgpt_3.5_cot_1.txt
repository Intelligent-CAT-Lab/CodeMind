<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads three integers n, a, and b from the input. Then it calculates the minimum value between a multiplied by n and b. Finally, it prints the result.
In this case, n = 4, a = 2, and b = 9. The minimum value between 2 * 4 and 9 is 8. Therefore, the output will be 8.
<<<Output>>>
8
