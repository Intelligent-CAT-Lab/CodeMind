<<<Analysis>>>
The variable num, variable blue and variable red are initialized with 8, 3 and 4 respectively according to the input. And variable remainder, variable countBlue are initialized with 0.
It calculates the remainder of num divided by the sum of blue and red and stores it in variable remainder.
It calculates the number of blue sets that can be placed by dividing num by the sum of blue and red and multiplying it by blue, and stores it in variable countBlue.
Then it checks if the remainder is greater than or equal to blue. If it is, it adds the value of blue to countBlue. Otherwise, it adds the value of remainder to countBlue.
Finally, it prints the value of countBlue as output, which is 3.
