<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integer inputs N, X, and T.
It checks if N is divisible by X using the condition N%X == 0.
If N is divisible by X, it prints the result of N/X * T.
If N is not divisible by X, it prints the result of N/X * T + T.
In this case, N = 20, X = 12, and T = 6.
Since 20 is not divisible by 12, the else block is executed.
The result will be (20/12) * 6 + 6 = 12 + 6 = 18.
<<<Output>>>
18
