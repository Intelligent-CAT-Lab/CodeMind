<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads an integer N from the input. It then calculates the number of digits in the binary representation of N using the Integer.toBinaryString() method and stores it in the variable binaryNumDigits. 

Next, it checks if N is equal to 2 raised to the power of binaryNumDigits minus 1. If it is, it assigns binaryNumDigits to the variable ans. Otherwise, it assigns binaryNumDigits minus 1 to ans.

Finally, it prints the value of ans as the output.

In this case, N is 2. The binary representation of 2 is "10", which has 2 digits. Since 2 is not equal to 2 raised to the power of 2 minus 1 (3), the value of ans will be 2 - 1 = 1.
