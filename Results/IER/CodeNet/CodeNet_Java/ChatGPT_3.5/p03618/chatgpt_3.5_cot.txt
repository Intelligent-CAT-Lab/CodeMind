<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string and converts it into a character array. It then calculates the length of the array and stores it in the variable N. 
It initializes an integer array cnt of size 26 to store the count of each character in the input string. 
It then iterates over each character in the input string and increments the count of that character in the cnt array. 
Next, it calculates the value of ans using the formula (N*(N+1)/2)+1. 
Finally, it iterates over each element in the cnt array and subtracts the value of (cnt[i]*(cnt[i]+1)/2) from ans if cnt[i] is greater than 0. 
The final value of ans is printed as the output.
In this case, the input string is "aatt". The length of the string is 4. 
The cnt array will have the count of each character in the string as [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. 
The value of ans will be (4*(4+1)/2)+1 = 11. 
Since cnt[0] is 2, the value of ans will be decreased by (2*(2+1)/2) = 3. 
Therefore, the final output will be 11 - 3 = 8.
