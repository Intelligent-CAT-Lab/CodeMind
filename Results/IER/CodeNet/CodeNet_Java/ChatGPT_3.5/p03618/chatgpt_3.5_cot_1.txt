<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string and converts it into a character array. It then calculates the length of the array and initializes an integer array called "cnt" with a size of 26. 

Next, it iterates through each character in the array and increments the count of that character in the "cnt" array. For example, if the input is "aatt", the count of 'a' will be 2 and the count of 't' will be 2.

After counting the occurrences of each character, it calculates the answer using the formula (N*(N+1))/2 + 1, where N is the length of the input string. In this case, N is 4, so the answer is (4*(4+1))/2 + 1 = 11.

Then, it iterates through the "cnt" array and checks if the count of a character is greater than 0. If it is, it subtracts the count*(count+1)/2 from the answer. In this case, the count of 'a' and 't' is 2, so it subtracts (2*(2+1))/2 = 3 from the answer.

Finally, it prints the final value of the answer, which is 11 - 3 = 8.
