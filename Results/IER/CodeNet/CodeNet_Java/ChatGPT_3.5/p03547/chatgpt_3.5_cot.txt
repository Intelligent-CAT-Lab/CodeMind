The code reads two characters, X and Y, from the input. It then compares the ASCII values of X and Y to determine the relationship between them. If X - Y is less than 0, it sets the value of ans to "<". If X - Y is greater than 0, it sets the value of ans to ">". Otherwise, it sets the value of ans to "=".
