<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input from the user, which is "ATCODER". It then initializes a priority queue called "pq" with a custom comparator that sorts integers in reverse order. It also initializes an integer variable "cnt" with 0.
The code then enters a for loop that iterates through each character in the input string. Inside the loop, it checks if the current character is 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T'. If it is, it increments the "cnt" variable by 1. If it is not, it adds the current value of "cnt" to the priority queue "pq" and resets "cnt" to 0.
After the loop finishes, it adds the final value of "cnt" to "pq" and prints the highest value in "pq" using the "poll()" method, which removes and returns the highest element in the priority queue.
In this case, the input string "ATCODER" has no characters other than 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T', so the value of "cnt" remains 7. Therefore, the highest value in "pq" is 7, and the output of the code execution would be 7.
