<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string as input and stores it in the variable s. Then it creates an array of strings, str, with the same length as the input string. It then iterates over the input string and assigns each character to a corresponding element in the str array. 

Next, it initializes a counter variable to 0. It then iterates over the str array, comparing each element with the next element. If they are not equal, it increments the counter variable. 

Finally, it prints the value of the counter variable as the output.

In this case, the input string is "BBBWW". The code will iterate over the str array and compare each element with the next element. The first three elements ("B") are equal, so the counter variable remains 0. The fourth element ("W") is not equal to the fifth element ("B"), so the counter variable is incremented to 1. 

Therefore, the output of the code will be 1.
