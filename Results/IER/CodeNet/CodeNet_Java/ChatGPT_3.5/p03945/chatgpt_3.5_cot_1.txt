<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string input "BBBWW" and initializes a counter variable to 0. It then creates an array of strings, where each element of the array is a single character from the input string.

Next, it iterates over the array and checks if the current element is equal to the next element. If they are not equal, it increments the counter variable.

In this case, the array would be ["B", "B", "B", "W", "W"]. The first iteration of the loop would compare "B" with "B" and increment the counter. The second iteration would compare "B" with "B" again and not increment the counter. The third iteration would compare "B" with "W" and increment the counter. The fourth iteration would compare "W" with "W" and not increment the counter.

Therefore, the final value of the counter would be 2.
