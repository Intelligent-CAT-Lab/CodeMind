<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 2 according to the input. And the variable found is initialized with false.
It enters a nested for loop and it iterates from 1 to 3500 for both variables h and w to check each combination of h and w in this range.
Inside the nested for loop, it calculates the values of variables Num and Den based on the current values of h and w.
Then it checks if the calculated variable Den is greater than 0 and if the calculated variable Num is divisible by Den without any remainder.
If both conditions are met, it calculates the value of variable ans by dividing Num by Den and prints the values of h, ans, and w as output.
After printing the output, it sets the variable found to true and breaks out of the nested for loop.
Finally, it checks the value of found and if it is true, it breaks out of the outer for loop as well.
