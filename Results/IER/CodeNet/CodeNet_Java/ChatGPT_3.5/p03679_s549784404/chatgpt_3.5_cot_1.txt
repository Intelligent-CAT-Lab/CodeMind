<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integer inputs X, A, and B using the Scanner class.
It then checks the following conditions:
1. If B is less than or equal to A, it prints "delicious".
2. If the difference between B and A is less than or equal to X, it prints "safe".
3. If none of the above conditions are met, it prints "dangerous".

In this case, X = 4, A = 3, and B = 6.
Since B is greater than A, the first condition is not met.
The difference between B and A is 3, which is less than X.
Therefore, the second condition is met and it prints "safe".

<<<Output>>>
safe
