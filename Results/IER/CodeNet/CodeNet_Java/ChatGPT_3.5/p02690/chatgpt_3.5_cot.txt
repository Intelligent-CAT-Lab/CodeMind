<<<Analysis>>>
The variable x is initialized with 33 according to the input. 
A HashMap powMap is created to store the powers of base 2 raised to the power of 5. The initial values in the map are (0, 0) and (1, 1).
Then, a while loop is executed to calculate the powers of base 2 raised to the power of 5 and store them in the powMap. The loop continues until the difference between the current power and the previous power is greater than x.
Inside the loop, the current power is calculated using the pow() method and stored in the powMap with the corresponding base value.
After the loop, a for-each loop is used to iterate over the entries in the powMap.
For each entry, the difference between x and the current power is calculated and stored in the variable diff.
If the powMap contains an entry with the calculated difference, the base values corresponding to the current power and the difference are printed.
If the difference is positive, the base value for the difference is printed with a negative sign.
If the difference is negative, the base value for the difference is printed without a negative sign.
Finally, the method returns.
