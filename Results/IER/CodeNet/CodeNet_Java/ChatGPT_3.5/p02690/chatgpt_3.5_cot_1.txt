The variable x is initialized with 33 according to the input.
A HashMap powMap is created to store the powers of base 2 raised to the power of 5. The initial values in the map are (0, 0) and (1, 1).
A while loop is used to calculate the powers of base 2 raised to the power of 5 and store them in the powMap. The loop continues until the difference between two consecutive powers is greater than x.
Inside the loop, the powVal is calculated as pow(base, 5) and added to the powMap with the value of base.
After the loop, a for-each loop is used to iterate through the entries in the powMap.
For each entry, the difference between x and the powVal is calculated and stored in the variable diff.
If the powMap contains the key diff, it means that there is a pair of powers whose difference is x.
The output is printed as the value of powVal followed by the value of diff, with a space in between. If the difference is negative, a minus sign is added before the value of diff.
If no pair of powers is found, no output is printed.
