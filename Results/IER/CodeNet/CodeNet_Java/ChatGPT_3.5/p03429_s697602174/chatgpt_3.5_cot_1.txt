<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads four integers n, m, a, and b from the input. It then initializes a boolean variable ans to true and creates a 2D character array called map with dimensions n x m, filled with '.' characters.

The code then checks if n is odd. If it is, it enters a loop that iterates over the columns of the first row of the map. In each iteration, it checks if the value of a is 0. If it is, it breaks out of the loop. Otherwise, it sets the characters at position (0, i) and (0, i+1) of the map to '<' and '>', respectively, and decrements the value of a by 1.

Next, the code checks if m is odd. If it is, it enters a loop that iterates over the rows of the last column of the map. In each iteration, it checks if the value of b is 0. If it is, it breaks out of the loop. Otherwise, it sets the characters at position (i, m-1) and (i+1, m-1) of the map to '^' and 'v', respectively, and decrements the value of b by 1.

After that, the code initializes a variable max to the value of n modulo 2, and variables y and x to the values of n modulo 2 and 0, respectively. It then enters a loop that continues as long as the value of a is greater than 1. In each iteration, it checks if n-y is less than or equal to 1-max. If it is, it sets the value of ans to false and breaks out of the loop. Otherwise, it sets the characters at position (y, x) and (y+1, x) of the map to '<' and '>', respectively, decrements the value of a by 2, and increments the value of x by 2. If the value of m-x is less than or equal to 1, it increments the value of y by 2 and sets the value of x to 0.

Next, the code enters a loop that continues as long as the value of b is greater than 1. In each iteration, it checks if n-y is less than or equal to 1-max. If it is, it sets the value of ans to false and breaks out of the loop. Otherwise, it sets the characters at position (y, x) and (y, x+1) of the map to '^' and 'v', respectively, decrements the value of b by 2, and increments the value of x by 2. If the value of m-x is less than or equal to 1, it increments the value of y by 2 and sets the value of x to 0.

After that, the code checks if n-y is less than or equal to 1-max and if the sum of a and b is greater than 0. If both conditions are true, it sets the value of ans to false. Otherwise, it checks if a is equal to 1 and if n-y is not less than or equal to 1-max. If both conditions are true, it sets the characters at position (y, x) of the map to '<', decrements the value of a by 1, increments the value of x by 2, and if the value of m-x is less than or equal to 1, it increments the value of y by 2 and sets the value of x to 0. Finally, it checks if b is equal to 1. If it is, it checks if n-y is less than or equal to 1-max. If it is, it sets the value of ans to false. Otherwise, it sets the characters at position (y, x) of the map to '^', decrements the value of b by 1, increments the value of x by 2, and if the value of m-x is less than or equal to 1, it increments the value of y by 2 and sets the value of x to 0.

Finally, the code prints "YES" if ans is true and "NO" otherwise. If ans is true, it also prints each row of the map.
