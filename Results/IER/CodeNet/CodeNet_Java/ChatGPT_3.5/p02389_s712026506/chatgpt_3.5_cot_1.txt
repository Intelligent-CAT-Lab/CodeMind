<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input using the Scanner class. The first integer is assigned to variable a and the second integer is assigned to variable b.
Then, it creates a new String object called res and assigns it the value of the product of a and b, converted to a string using the Integer.toString() method.
Next, it appends a space character to the string res.
Finally, it appends the sum of 2 times a and 2 times b to the string res.
The final value of res is printed as the output.
