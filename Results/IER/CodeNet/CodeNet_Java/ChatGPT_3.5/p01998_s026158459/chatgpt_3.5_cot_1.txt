<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a boolean array isPrime of size MAX+1 with all elements set to true. Then it sets the first two elements of isPrime to false, as 0 and 1 are not prime numbers.

Then it enters a for loop that iterates from 2 to MAX. If isPrime[i] is false, it continues to the next iteration. Otherwise, it enters an inner for loop that starts from i+i and increments by i in each iteration. In each iteration of the inner loop, it sets isPrime[j] to false. This inner loop marks all multiples of i as non-prime numbers.

After the for loop finishes, it enters a while loop that continues as long as there is an integer input from the scanner. Inside the while loop, it reads an integer N from the scanner and initializes ans to 0.

Then it enters another for loop that iterates from 3 to N. If isPrime[p] is false, it continues to the next iteration. Otherwise, it checks if isPrime[p+2] is true. If it is, it increments ans by 2.

Finally, it prints the value of ans.
