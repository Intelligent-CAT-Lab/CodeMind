<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes input from the user using the Scanner class and splits it into an array of strings using the space as a delimiter. The input "atcoder beginner contest" will be split into ["atcoder", "beginner", "contest"].
Then, it creates a StringBuilder object to store the uppercase first letter of each word. It iterates through each word in the array and extracts the first character using the substring method. It then converts the first character to uppercase and appends it to the StringBuilder object.
Finally, it prints the contents of the StringBuilder object as the output, which will be "ABC" in this case.
<<<Output>>>
ABC
