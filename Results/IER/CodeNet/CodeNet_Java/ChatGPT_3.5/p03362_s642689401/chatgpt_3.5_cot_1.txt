<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 5 according to the input. An instance of the Prime class is created. The variable count is initialized with 0.
It enters a while loop that runs indefinitely until a break statement is encountered. Inside the loop, it calls the nextPrime() method of the Prime class to get the next prime number.
If the obtained prime number is of the form 5k + 1, where k is an integer, it increments the count variable and prints the prime number. If the count variable is equal to n, it breaks out of the loop.
After the loop finishes, it does not print anything else.
