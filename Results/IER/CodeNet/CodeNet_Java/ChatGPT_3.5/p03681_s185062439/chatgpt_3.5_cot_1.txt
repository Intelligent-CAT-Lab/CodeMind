<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 2 and variable m is also initialized with 2 according to the input.
It checks if the absolute difference between n and m is greater than 1. Since the difference is 0, it does not enter the if condition.
Then it initializes the variable answer with 0.
Since n is equal to m, it enters the if condition and calls the solve() method twice with the arguments n and m.
Inside the solve() method, it initializes the variable answer with 1.
Then it enters a while loop and multiplies the value of max with answer and assigns the result to answer.
Then it multiplies the value of x with answer and assigns the result to answer.
It decrements the value of max and x by 1 in each iteration of the loop.
After the loop finishes, it returns the value of answer to the main method.
In the main method, it adds the returned value of solve() method to answer and assigns the result to answer.
Then it takes the modulo of answer with 1000000007 and assigns the result to answer.
Finally, it prints the value of answer as output, which is 4.
<<<Output>>>
4
