<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes an array e of size 5. Then it enters a for loop that iterates from 1 to 4. Inside the loop, it takes input from the user and assigns it to the corresponding index of the array e. So, the values of e[1], e[2], e[3], and e[4] are assigned as 1, 1, 3, and 4 respectively.
After the loop, it checks three conditions using logical OR operator. If any of the conditions is true, it prints "yes". Otherwise, it prints "no".
The conditions are:
1. e[1] is equal to e[2] and e[3] is equal to e[4]
2. e[1] is equal to e[4] and e[2] is equal to e[3]
3. e[1] is equal to e[3] and e[2] is equal to e[4]
In this case, the first condition is true because e[1] is equal to e[2] (both are 1) and e[3] is equal to e[4] (both are 3 and 4 respectively). So, the output will be "yes".
<<<Output>>>
yes
