<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and variable p are initialized with 3 and 24 respectively according to the input.
It checks if n is equal to 1. Since n is not equal to 1, it continues to execute the code inside the if statement.
It initializes the variable ans with 1.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to 23 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of t by raising i to the power of n using the Math.pow() method.
Then it checks if p is divisible by t. If it is, it updates the value of ans to i.
It also checks if t is greater than p. If it is, it breaks out of the for loop.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of ans as output, which is 2.
