<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two long integers as input, x and y.
It initializes four long variables ans1, ans2, ans3, and ans4 to 0.
It also initializes four long variables x1, x2, y1, and y2 with the values of x, -x, y, and -y respectively.
Then it checks four conditions using if-else statements:
1. If x1 is less than or equal to y1, it calculates ans1 as the absolute difference between y1 and x1.
2. If x2 is less than or equal to y1, it calculates ans2 as the absolute difference between y1 and x2 plus 1.
3. If x1 is less than or equal to y2, it calculates ans3 as the absolute difference between y2 and x1 plus 1.
4. If x2 is less than or equal to y2, it calculates ans4 as the absolute difference between y2 and x2 plus 2.
Finally, it calculates the minimum value among ans1, ans2, ans3, and ans4 using the Math.min() function and assigns it to the variable ans.
The code then prints the value of ans as the output.
