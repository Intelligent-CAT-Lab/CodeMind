<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four integers as input: a, b, c, and d. It then calculates the number of times b can be divided into c and stores it in cntT. If there is a remainder, cntT is incremented by 1. Similarly, it calculates the number of times d can be divided into a and stores it in cntA. If there is a remainder, cntA is incremented by 1. Finally, it checks if cntT is less than or equal to cntA. If it is, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".

In this case, the input values are a=10, b=9, c=10, and d=10. 
cntT = c/b = 10/9 = 1 (with remainder 1)
cntA = a/d = 10/10 = 1 (with no remainder)
Since cntT is equal to cntA, the output will be "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
