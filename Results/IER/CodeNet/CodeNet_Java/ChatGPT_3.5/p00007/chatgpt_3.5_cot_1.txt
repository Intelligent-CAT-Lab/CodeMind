<<<Analysis>>>
The variable weeks is initialized with 5 according to the input. And variable sum is initialized with 100000.
It enters a for loop and it iterates 5 times. In each iteration, it calculates the yield by multiplying the current value of sum by 0.05.
Then it checks if the yield is divisible by 1000. If it is, it adds the yield to the current value of sum. If it's not, it calculates the number of thousands in the yield, adds 1 to it, multiplies it by 1000, and adds the result to the current value of sum.
After the loop finishes, it print the final value of sum as output.
<<<Output>>>
105000
