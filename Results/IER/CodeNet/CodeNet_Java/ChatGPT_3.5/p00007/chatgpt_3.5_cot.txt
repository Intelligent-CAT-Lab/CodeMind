<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `weeks`. Then it calls the `debtHell` method with the initial total debt as 100000 and the number of weeks as the input value.

Inside the `debtHell` method, it initializes the variable `sum` with the initial total debt. Then it enters a for loop that iterates `weeks` number of times. In each iteration, it calculates the yield by multiplying the current value of `sum` by 0.05. 

If the yield is divisible by 1000 (i.e., `yield % 1000 == 0`), it adds the yield to the `sum`. Otherwise, it calculates the number of thousands in the yield by dividing it by 1000 and adding 1, and then multiplies it by 1000. This value is then added to the `sum`.

After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of `sum` as the output.

In this case, the input value is 5. So, the `debtHell` method will be called with `total` as 100000 and `weeks` as 5. The for loop will iterate 5 times and calculate the yield and update the `sum` accordingly. Finally, the value of `sum` will be printed as the output.

105000
