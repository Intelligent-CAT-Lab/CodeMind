The variable n is initialized with 2 and variable m is initialized with 2 according to the input. 
It creates an object of Combinations class with n + 3 * m and MODF as parameters.
It initializes the variable answer with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 * m to 3 * m with a step of 2. The value of variable i is also passed to variable answer.
Inside the loop, it calculates the value of c(n - 1 + i / 2, n - 1) * c(n, 3 * m - i) % MODF and adds it to variable answer.
After the loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 2 * m + 1 to 3 * m. The value of variable i is also passed to variable delta.
Inside the loop, it calculates the value of c(n + 3 * m - i - 2, n - 2) and adds it to variable delta.
After the loop, it calculates the value of delta % MODF and assigns it to variable delta.
It subtracts delta * n from answer and assigns it to answer.
It calculates answer % MODF and assigns it to answer.
It adds MODF to answer and assigns it to answer.
It calculates answer % MODF and assigns it to answer.
It prints the value of answer as output.
