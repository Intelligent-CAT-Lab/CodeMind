<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a line of input and splits it into an array of strings. Then it converts each string to an integer and stores them in an array called "arr". The array "arr" is then sorted in ascending order. 

Next, the code checks if the difference between the second and the first element of "arr" is greater than 3. If it is, it enters a loop and increments the second element by 2 until the difference becomes less than or equal to 3. The number of steps taken in this loop is stored in the variable "step". 

Then, the code checks if the difference between the first and the second element of "arr" is greater than 3. If it is, it enters a loop and increments the first element by 2 until the difference becomes less than or equal to 3. The number of steps taken in this loop is also stored in the variable "step". 

After that, a new object of the class "Tuple3" is created with the first, second, and third elements of "arr" as parameters. The "step" variable is assigned to the "step" field of the "Tuple3" object. 

Finally, the "bfs" method is called with the "Tuple3" object as an argument. 

In the "bfs" method, a deque (double-ended queue) called "que" is created. The "Tuple3" object is added to the deque. 

Then, a loop is started until the deque is empty. In each iteration, the first element of the deque is removed and assigned to the variable "cur". 

If the "isEq" method of "cur" returns true, the "step" field of "cur" is printed and the loop is terminated. 

Otherwise, several new "Tuple3" objects are created and added to the deque, each with different values for the first, second, and third elements. The "step" field of each new object is assigned the value of "cur.step" plus 1. 

The loop continues until a "Tuple3" object with equal elements is found or the deque becomes empty. 

If the loop terminates without finding a "Tuple3" object with equal elements, no output is printed.
