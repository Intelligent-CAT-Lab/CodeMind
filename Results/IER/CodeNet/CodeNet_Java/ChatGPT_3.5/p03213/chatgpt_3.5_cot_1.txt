The variable N is initialized with 9 according to the input. A HashMap variable map is initialized. Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to N to check each integer i in this range. Inside the for loop, it calls the factorization method passing the current integer i as an argument. The factorization method calculates the prime factorization of i and returns a list of arrays, where each array contains a prime factor and its corresponding exponent. Then it iterates through each array in the list and calls the add_map method to add the prime factor and its exponent to the map. After the for loop finishes, it creates an ArrayList values containing the values of the map. Then it sorts the values in descending order. It initializes a variable ans with 0. Then it enters a for loop and it iterates through each value in the values list. If the value is greater than or equal to 74, it increments the ans variable. Then it enters another for loop and it iterates through each value in the values list. If the value is greater than or equal to 24, it enters another for loop and it iterates through each value in the values list. If the current index is not equal to the outer loop index and the value is greater than or equal to 2, it increments the ans variable. Then it enters another for loop and it iterates through each value in the values list. If the value is greater than or equal to 14, it enters another for loop and it iterates through each value in the values list. If the current index is not equal to the outer loop index and the value is greater than or equal to 4, it increments the ans variable. Then it enters another for loop and it iterates through each value in the values list. If the value is greater than or equal to 4, it enters another for loop and it iterates through each value in the values list starting from the next index. If the current value is greater than or equal to 4, it enters another for loop and it iterates through each value in the values list. If the current index is not equal to the outer loop index and the value is greater than or equal to 2, it increments the ans variable. Finally, it prints the value of the ans variable as output, which is the number of ways to choose four integers from the prime factors of the numbers from 1 to N such that their product is a perfect square.
