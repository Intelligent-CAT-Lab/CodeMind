The code takes an integer N as input and initializes a HashMap called map. It then iterates from 2 to N and for each number i, it calls the factorization function to get the prime factorization of i. The factorization function returns a list of arrays, where each array contains a prime factor and its corresponding exponent. The code then updates the map by adding the prime factors and their exponents to the map.

After iterating through all the numbers from 2 to N, the code creates a list called values, which contains the values from the map. It then sorts the values in descending order.

The code then initializes a variable ans to 0 and starts four nested loops. The first loop checks if any value in the values list is greater than or equal to 74. If it is, it increments ans by 1.

The second loop checks if any value in the values list is greater than or equal to 24. If it is, it starts another loop to check if any other value in the values list is greater than or equal to 2. If it is, it increments ans by 1.

The third loop checks if any value in the values list is greater than or equal to 14. If it is, it starts another loop to check if any other value in the values list is greater than or equal to 4. If it is, it increments ans by 1.

The fourth loop checks if any value in the values list is greater than or equal to 4. If it is, it starts another loop to check if any other value in the values list is also greater than or equal to 4. If it is, it starts another loop to check if any other value in the values list is greater than or equal to 2. If it is, it increments ans by 1.

Finally, the code prints the value of ans as the output.
