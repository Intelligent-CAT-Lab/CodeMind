<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 3 and variable K is initialized with 2 according to the input. The variable ans is initialized with the cube of the division of N by K. 
Then it checks if K is even and if the remainder of the division of N by K is less than half of K. If both conditions are true, it adds the cube of the division of N by K to ans again. 
Otherwise, if K is even and the remainder of the division of N by K is greater than or equal to half of K, it adds the cube of the division of N by K plus 1 to ans. 
Finally, it prints the value of ans as output.
