<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers n and k from the input. It then initializes a variable ans with 0.
It enters a for loop that iterates from k to n+1. In each iteration, it calculates the values of f, l, and add.
The value of f is calculated by multiplying i with (i-1) and then dividing it by 2.
The value of l is calculated by multiplying (n*2-i+1) with i and then dividing it by 2.
The value of add is calculated by subtracting f from l and then adding 1 to it.
Finally, the value of add is added to ans and then ans is taken modulo 1000000007.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of ans as the output.
