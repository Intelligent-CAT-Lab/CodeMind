<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads input from the user using BufferedReader and InputStreamReader. It then splits the input into an array of integers using the split() method and converts each element of the array to an integer using the mapToInt() method. The resulting array is then processed using forEach() method.

Inside the forEach() method, the code assigns the values of the array to variables a, b, c, and d. It then calculates the start and end values by taking the maximum of a and c, and the minimum of b and d respectively. Finally, it prints the difference between end and start if it is greater than 0, otherwise it prints 0.

In this case, the input is "0 75 25 100". The code assigns 0 to a, 75 to b, 25 to c, and 100 to d. The start value is the maximum of 0 and 25, which is 25. The end value is the minimum of 75 and 100, which is 75. The difference between end and start is 75 - 25 = 50. Therefore, the output is 50.
