<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads input from the user using BufferedReader and InputStreamReader. It then splits the input line by space and converts the resulting strings into integers. The integers are stored in an array called 'in'. The code then assigns the values of the array elements to variables a, b, c, and d.

Next, the code calculates the start and end values. The start value is the maximum of a and c, and the end value is the minimum of b and d. 

Finally, the code checks if the difference between end and start is greater than 0. If it is, it prints the difference. Otherwise, it prints 0.

In this case, the start value is 25 and the end value is 75. The difference between them is 50, so the output will be 50.
