<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes variables a, b, c, and d with the input values 0, 75, 25, and 100 respectively.
Then it initializes the variable ans with 0.
It enters a for loop that iterates from a to b (0 to 75 in this case).
Inside the loop, it checks if the current value of i falls within the range [c, d] (25 to 100 in this case).
If it does, it increments the variable ans by 1.
After the loop finishes, it checks if the value of ans is greater than 0.
If it is, it decrements the value of ans by 1.
Finally, it prints the value of ans as the output.
In this case, the value of ans is 51.
<<<Output>>>
51
