<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two long integers n and m from the input. It then calculates the absolute value of (n-2) multiplied by (m-2) and stores the result in a variable. Finally, it prints the value of the variable as the output.

In this case, the input values are 2 and 2. So, the code will calculate the absolute value of (2-2) multiplied by (2-2), which is 0. Therefore, the output will be 0.
