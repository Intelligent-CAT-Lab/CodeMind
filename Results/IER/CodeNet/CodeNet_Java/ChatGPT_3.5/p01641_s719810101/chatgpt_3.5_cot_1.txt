<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input from the user and then calls the solve() method. 
Inside the solve() method, it initializes some variables and arrays. 
Then it creates a 2D array called d to store the brainf*ck code for each pair of characters. 
It uses nested loops to calculate the brainf*ck code for each pair of characters and stores it in the d array. 
After that, it creates two more 2D arrays called p and w to store the shortest path and the length of the shortest path between each pair of characters. 
It uses the Floyd-Warshall algorithm to calculate the shortest path and the length of the shortest path between each pair of characters. 
Finally, it constructs the brainf*ck code for the given input string by following the shortest path in the p array and appends it to a StringBuilder. 
The final brainf*ck code is then printed as the output.
<<<Output>>>
The output will be the brainf*ck code for the given input string.
