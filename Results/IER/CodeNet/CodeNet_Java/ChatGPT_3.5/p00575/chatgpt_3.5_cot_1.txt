<<<Analysis>>>
The variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized with 3, 0 and 10 respectively according to the input. And variable i and variable cnt are initialized with 0.
It enters a while loop and it keeps iterating until the value of variable cnt is less than c. In each iteration, it increments the value of variable i by 1 and adds the value of variable a to variable cnt.
Then it checks if the value of variable i is divisible by 7. If it is, it adds the value of variable b to variable cnt.
The loop continues until the value of variable cnt is greater than or equal to c.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable i as output.
