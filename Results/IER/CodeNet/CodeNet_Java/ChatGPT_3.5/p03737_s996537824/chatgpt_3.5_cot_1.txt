<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three inputs from the user using the Scanner class. The inputs are stored in variables s1, s2, and s3 respectively. Then it uses the substring method to extract the first character of each input string and converts it to uppercase using the toUpperCase method. Finally, it concatenates the three uppercase characters and prints the result as the output.
In this case, the input strings are "atcoder", "beginner", and "contest". So the first characters of each string are "a", "b", and "c". After converting them to uppercase, we get "A", "B", and "C". The final output will be "ABC".
<<<Output>>>
