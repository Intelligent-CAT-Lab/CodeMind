<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers a and b as input. It initializes variables r1, x1, y1, r2, x2, y2 with the values of a, 1, 0, b, 0, 1 respectively. It also initializes variables r3, q, x3, y3 with 0. 

Then it enters a while loop which continues until r2 becomes 0. Inside the loop, it calculates the quotient q and remainder r3 when r1 is divided by r2. It also calculates the new values of x3 and y3 using the formula x3 = x1 - q * x2 and y3 = y1 - q * y2. Then it updates the values of r1, r2, x1, x2, y1, y2 with the values of r2, r3, x2, x3, y2, y3 respectively.

After the loop finishes, it prints the values of x1 and y1 as output.

In this case, a is 4 and b is 12. The initial values of r1, x1, y1, r2, x2, y2 are 4, 1, 0, 12, 0, 1 respectively. 

In the first iteration of the loop, q is 0, r3 is 4, x3 is 1, y3 is 0. The values of r1, r2, x1, x2, y1, y2 are updated to 12, 4, 0, 1, 1, 0 respectively.

In the second iteration of the loop, q is 3, r3 is 0, x3 is -3, y3 is 1. The values of r1, r2, x1, x2, y1, y2 are updated to 4, 0, 1, -3, 0, 1 respectively.

Since r2 is now 0, the loop terminates. The final values of x1 and y1 are 1 and -3 respectively.

<<<Output>>>
