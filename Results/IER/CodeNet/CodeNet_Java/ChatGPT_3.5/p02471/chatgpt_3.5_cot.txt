<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers a and b as input. It initializes variables r1, x1, y1, r2, x2, y2 with the values of a, 1, 0, b, 0, 1 respectively. It also initializes variables r3, q, x3, y3 with 0. 

Then it enters a while loop which continues until r2 becomes 0. Inside the loop, it calculates the quotient q and remainder r3 when r1 is divided by r2. It also calculates the new values of x3 and y3 using the formula x3 = x1 - q * x2 and y3 = y1 - q * y2. Then it updates the values of r1, r2, x1, x2, y1, y2 with the values of r2, r3, x2, x3, y2, y3 respectively.

After the loop finishes, it prints the values of x1 and y1 as output.

In this case, the input values are 4 and 12. The code will calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 4 and 12 using the extended Euclidean algorithm. The GCD of 4 and 12 is 4. Therefore, the output will be "1 0".
