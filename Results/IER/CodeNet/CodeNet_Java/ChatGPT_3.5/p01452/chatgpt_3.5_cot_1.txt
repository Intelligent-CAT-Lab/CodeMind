<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n, variable m and variable k are initialized with 6, 4 and 0 respectively according to the input.
The code initializes an array called fact with size n + m + 2 * k + 1 and sets the first two elements to 1.
Then it enters a for loop and iterates from 1 to n + m + 2 * k. In each iteration, it calculates the factorial of the current number i and stores it in the fact array.
Next, it initializes a variable ans to 0.
Then it enters another for loop and iterates from 0 to k. In each iteration, it calculates two variables a and b.
The value of a is calculated by calling the nCk method with parameters n + 2 * i and i, and subtracting the result of calling the nCk method with parameters n + 2 * i and i - 1. The result is then modulo MOD.
The value of b is calculated in a similar way, but with different parameters.
Then it calculates the product of three values: nCk(n + m + 2 * k, n + 2 * i), a, and b. The result is added to ans and then modulo MOD.
After the loop finishes, it enters a while loop to make sure ans is not negative. If ans is negative, it adds MOD to it.
Finally, it prints the value of ans as output.
