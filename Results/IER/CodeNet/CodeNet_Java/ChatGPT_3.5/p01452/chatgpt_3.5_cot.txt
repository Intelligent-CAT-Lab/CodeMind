<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers n, m, and k as input. It then initializes an array called fact with size n + m + 2 * k + 1 and sets the first two elements to 1. It then calculates the factorial of each element in the array fact using a for loop. The factorial of each element is calculated by multiplying the current element with the previous element modulo MOD. 

After calculating the factorial, the code initializes a variable ans to 0. It then enters a for loop that iterates from 0 to k. Inside the loop, it calculates two variables a and b. The value of a is calculated by subtracting the binomial coefficient nCk(n + 2 * i, i - 1) from the binomial coefficient nCk(n + 2 * i, i). The value of b is calculated in a similar way. 

The code then adds the product of three values: nCk(n + m + 2 * k, n + 2 * i), a, and b, to the variable ans. The result is then taken modulo MOD. This process is repeated for each value of i in the loop. 

Finally, the code checks if ans is negative and adds MOD to it until it becomes positive. The final value of ans is then printed as the output.
