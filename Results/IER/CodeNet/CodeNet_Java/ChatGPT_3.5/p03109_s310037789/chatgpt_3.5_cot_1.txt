<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string in the format "yyyy/mm/dd" and splits it into three parts: year, month, and day. It then converts these parts into integers using the parseInt() method. 

Next, it checks the value of the year. If the year is less than 2019, it prints "Heisei". If the year is equal to 2019, it checks the value of the month. If the month is greater than or equal to 5, it prints "TBD". Otherwise, it prints "Heisei". 

If the year is greater than 2019, it prints "TBD". 

In this case, the year is 2019, the month is 04, and the day is 30. Since the year is equal to 2019 and the month is less than 5, the output will be "Heisei".

<<<Output>>>
Heisei
