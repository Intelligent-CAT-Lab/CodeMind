<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two long integers n and k from the input. It then checks if k is greater than or equal to n. If it is, it calculates the value of nCrs(n+n-1, n-1, mod) using the Maths.nCrs() method and prints the result. Otherwise, it initializes a variable ans to 0 and calls the gen() method. The gen() method initializes two arrays, fact and factinv, and calculates their values based on the value of n. Then, it enters a for loop that iterates from 0 to k. Inside the loop, it calculates the values of up, den1, den2, and den using the fact, factinv, and nCrs methods. It then adds the product of up and den to ans. Finally, it prints the value of ans.
