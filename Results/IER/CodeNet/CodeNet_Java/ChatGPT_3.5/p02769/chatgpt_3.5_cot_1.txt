<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers n and k from the input. It then checks if k is greater than or equal to n. If it is, it calculates the value of nCrs(n+n-1, n-1, mod) using the Maths.nCrs() method and prints the result. Otherwise, it initializes a variable ans to 0 and calls the gen() method. The gen() method initializes the fact and factinv arrays and calculates their values. Then, it enters a for loop from i = 0 to i <= k. Inside the loop, it calculates the values of up, den1, den2, and den using the fact, factinv, and n variables. It then adds the value of (up * den) to ans and takes the modulo of ans with mod. Finally, it prints the value of ans.
