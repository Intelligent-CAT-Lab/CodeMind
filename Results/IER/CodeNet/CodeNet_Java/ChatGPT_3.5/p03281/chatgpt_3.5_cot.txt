<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input `n` and initializes a variable `ans` with 0.
Then it enters a for loop that iterates from 1 to `n`.
Inside the loop, it checks if the current value of `i` is odd (i.e., `i % 2 == 1`).
If `i` is odd, it initializes a variable `divcount` with 0 and enters another for loop that iterates from 1 to `n`.
Inside the nested loop, it checks if `i` is divisible by `k` (i.e., `i % k == 0`) and increments `divcount` if the condition is true.
After the nested loop, it checks if `divcount` is equal to 8.
If `divcount` is 8, it increments `ans` by 1.
Finally, it prints the value of `ans` as the output.
