<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 105 according to the input. And variable ans is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 105 to check each integer i in this range. 
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current integer i is odd by checking if i % 2 == 1. If it is odd, it enters another for loop to count the number of divisors of i.
It initializes a variable divcount with 0 and iterates from 1 to n to check each integer k in this range. If i is divisible by k, it increments the value of divcount by 1.
After the inner loop finishes, it checks if the value of divcount is equal to 8. If it is, it increments the value of ans by 1.
After the outer loop finishes, it prints the final value of ans as output, which is the number of integers in the range [1, 105] that have exactly 8 divisors.
