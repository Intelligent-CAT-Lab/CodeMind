<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads three integers a, b, and c from the input. It then checks if the difference between b and a is equal to the difference between c and b. If the condition is true, it prints "YES", otherwise it prints "NO".

In this case, the values of a, b, and c are 2, 4, and 6 respectively. The difference between b and a is 2, and the difference between c and b is also 2. Therefore, the condition is true and the output will be "YES".
<<<Output>>>
YES
