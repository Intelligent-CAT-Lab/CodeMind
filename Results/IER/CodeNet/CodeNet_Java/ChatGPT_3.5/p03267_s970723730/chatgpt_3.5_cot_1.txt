<<<Analysis>>>
The variable l is initialized with 4 according to the input. And variable n and variable m are initialized with 0.
It enters a while loop and it keeps left shifting 1 to n until the value of l is less than (1<<n). After the loop, the value of n is decremented by 1.
Then it initializes a StringBuilder object sb.
It initializes a variable sum with 0.
Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to n-2. The value of variable bit is also incremented by 1 in each iteration.
Inside the loop, it appends three integers to the StringBuilder object sb. The first two integers are bit+1 and bit+2, and the third integer is 0. Then it increments the value of m by 1.
Then it appends three integers to the StringBuilder object sb. The first two integers are bit+1 and bit+2, and the third integer is (1<<bit). Then it increments the value of m by 1.
Then it checks if the bitwise AND of l and (1<<bit) is not equal to 0. If it is true, it appends three integers to the StringBuilder object sb. The first two integers are bit+1 and n, and the third integer is (l-sum-(1<<bit)). Then it increments the value of sum by (1<<bit) and increments the value of m by 1.
After the loop finishes, it prints the values of n and m as output. And then it prints the content of the StringBuilder object sb.
