<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, A, B, C, and D are initialized with 5, 1, 5, 2, and 4 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 4 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the maximum and minimum values based on the formula given in the code.
Then it checks if the absolute difference between B and A falls within the range [min, max]. If it does, it prints "YES" and returns.
If the for loop finishes without finding a match, it prints "NO".
<<<Output>>>
YES
