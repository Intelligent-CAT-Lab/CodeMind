<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, A, B, C, and D are initialized with 5, 1, 5, 2, and 4 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to N-1 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the maximum and minimum values based on the current value of i.
Then it checks if the absolute difference between B and A falls within the range [min, max]. If it does, it prints "YES" and returns.
After the loop finishes, it prints "NO" as output.
<<<Output>>>
YES
