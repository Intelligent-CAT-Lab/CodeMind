<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 1 and variable M is initialized with 1 according to the input. The variable X is calculated as 1900 * M + 100 * (N - M), which is 1900 * 1 + 100 * (1 - 1) = 1900. The variable rate is initialized with 1. Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to M, which is 1. In each iteration, it multiplies the current value of rate by 2. After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of rate multiplied by X as output, which is 1900.
<<<Output>>>
