<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input and assigns them to variables a and b respectively.
Then it checks if a is equal to 1. If it is, it checks if b is not equal to 1. If this condition is true, it prints "Alice".
Next, it checks if b is equal to 1. If it is, it checks if a is not equal to 1. If this condition is true, it prints "Bob".
Then it checks if a is greater than b and if a and b are not equal to 1. If this condition is true, it prints "Alice".
Next, it checks if a is less than b and if a and b are not equal to 1. If this condition is true, it prints "Bob".
Finally, it checks if a is equal to b. If this condition is true, it prints "Draw".
In this case, a is 8 and b is 6. None of the conditions in the code are true, so it does not print anything.
