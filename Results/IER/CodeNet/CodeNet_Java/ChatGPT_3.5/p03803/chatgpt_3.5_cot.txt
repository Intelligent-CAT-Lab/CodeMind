<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, a and b. It then checks if a is equal to 1. If it is, it checks if b is not equal to 1. If this condition is true, it prints "Alice".
Next, it checks if b is equal to 1. If it is, it checks if a is not equal to 1. If this condition is true, it prints "Bob".
Then, it checks if a is greater than b and if a and b are not equal to 1. If this condition is true, it prints "Alice".
Next, it checks if a is less than b and if a and b are not equal to 1. If this condition is true, it prints "Bob".
Finally, it checks if a is equal to b. If this condition is true, it prints "Draw".
In this case, a is 8 and b is 6. Since a is greater than b and both a and b are not equal to 1, the condition in the third if statement is true. Therefore, the output will be "Alice".
<<<Output>>>
Alice
