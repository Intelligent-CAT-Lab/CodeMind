<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a line of input and splits it into an array of strings using the space as a delimiter. Then it converts each string element into an integer and stores them in an integer array called num. The array num is then sorted in ascending order using the Arrays.sort() method. 

Next, it checks if the sum of the first two elements of the sorted array is equal to the third element. If it is, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".

In this case, the input is "10 30 20". After splitting and converting to integers, the array num will be [10, 30, 20]. After sorting, the array becomes [10, 20, 30]. The sum of the first two elements (10 + 20) is not equal to the third element (30), so the output will be "No".
