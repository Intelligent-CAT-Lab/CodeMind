<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a line of input and splits it into an array of strings called words. Then it initializes a 2D array called nums with dimensions 4x3 and a boolean array called used with size 10. It also initializes a variable count to 0.
Then it enters a for loop to iterate through the words array. For each element in the words array, it converts it to an integer and checks if it is -1. If it is not -1, it sets the corresponding index in the used array to true. If it is -1, it increments the count variable. It also sets the corresponding index in the nums array to the converted integer.
After that, it calls the solve method with the count variable as an argument and prints the return value of the solve method as output.

The solve method takes an integer c as a parameter. If c is 0, it checks if the current arrangement of numbers in the nums array satisfies the alphametic equation. If it does, it returns 1. If it doesn't, it returns 0.
If c is not 0, it enters a nested for loop to iterate through the nums array. If it finds a -1 in the nums array, it enters another for loop to iterate from 1 to 9. For each number k, it checks if k is not used. If it is not used, it sets the current index in the nums array to k, marks k as used, recursively calls the solve method with c - 1 as an argument, and adds the return value of the recursive call to the ret variable. Then it resets the current index in the nums array to -1 and marks k as not used.
After the nested for loop, it returns the value of the ret variable.

The check method checks if the current arrangement of numbers in the nums array satisfies the alphametic equation. It calculates the values of a[0], a[1], a[2], and a[3] based on the numbers in the nums array. It checks if the sum of a[0], a[1], and a[2] is equal to a[3]. If it is, it returns true. If it isn't, it returns false.
