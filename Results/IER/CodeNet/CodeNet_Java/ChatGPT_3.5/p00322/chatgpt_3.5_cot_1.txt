<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a line of input and splits it into an array of strings called words. Then it initializes a 2D array called nums with dimensions 4x3 and a boolean array called used with size 10. It also initializes a variable count to 0.
Then it enters a for loop to iterate through the words array. For each word, it converts it to an integer and checks if it is -1. If it is not -1, it sets the corresponding index in the used array to true. If it is -1, it increments the count variable. It also sets the corresponding index in the nums array to the converted integer.
After that, it calls the solve method with the count variable as an argument and prints the returned value.
The solve method is a recursive method that takes an integer c as a parameter. If c is 0, it checks if the current arrangement of numbers in the nums array satisfies the alphametic equation. If it does, it returns 1. If it doesn't, it returns 0.
If c is not 0, it enters a nested for loop to iterate through the nums array. If it finds a -1, it enters another for loop to iterate through the numbers 1 to 9. For each number, it checks if it is not used. If it is not used, it sets the current index in the nums array to the number, marks the number as used, recursively calls the solve method with c-1 as an argument, and adds the returned value to the ret variable. Then it resets the current index in the nums array to -1 and marks the number as not used.
After the nested for loops, it returns the ret variable.
The check method checks if the current arrangement of numbers in the nums array satisfies the alphametic equation. It calculates the values of the four numbers by multiplying the corresponding indices in the nums array and adding them together. Then it checks if the sum of the first three numbers is equal to the fourth number. If it is, it returns true. If it isn't, it returns false.
