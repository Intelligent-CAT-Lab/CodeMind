<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N and variable K are initialized with 5 and 3 respectively according to the input.
It checks if N is equal to 2. If it is, it checks if K is equal to 0. If it is, it prints 1 and "1 2". Otherwise, it prints -1.
If N is not equal to 2, it calculates the maximum number of combinations of 2 elements from N-1 elements using the combination method.
If K is greater than the maximum number of combinations, it prints -1.
Otherwise, it calculates the value of M by adding N-1 and the difference between the maximum number of combinations and K.
Then it prints the value of M.
After that, it prints the combinations of 1 and i for each i from 2 to N.
If the difference between the maximum number of combinations and K is greater than 0, it prints the remaining combinations of i and j for each i from 2 to N-1 and each j from i+1 to N.
