<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 5 and variable K is initialized with 3 according to the input.
It checks if N is equal to 2. If it is, it checks if K is equal to 0. If it is, it prints 1 and "1 2". Otherwise, it prints -1 and returns.
If N is not equal to 2, it calculates the maximum number of combinations of 2 elements from N-1 elements using the combination method.
If K is greater than the maximum number of combinations, it prints -1 and returns.
Otherwise, it calculates the value of M by adding N-1 and the difference between the maximum number of combinations and K.
It prints the value of M.
Then it prints the edges of the tree by iterating from 2 to N and printing "1 i" for each i.
If the difference between the maximum number of combinations and K is greater than 0, it iterates from 2 to N-1 and for each i, it iterates from i+1 to N and prints "i j" for each j. It stops when the difference becomes less than or equal to 0.
<<<Output>>>
5
1 2
1 3
1 4
1 5
