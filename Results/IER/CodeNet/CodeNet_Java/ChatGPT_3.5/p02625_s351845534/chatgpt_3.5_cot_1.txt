<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 2 and variable m is initialized with 2 according to the input.
It initializes an array fac with size m+1 and sets fac[0] to 1.
Then it enters a for loop and iterates from 1 to m. In each iteration, it calculates the factorial of i and stores it in fac[i].
After the loop, it initializes a variable ans to 0.
Then it enters another for loop and iterates from 0 to n. In each iteration, it calculates the combination of n and i using the combi() method and stores it in variable res.
Then it calculates the permutation of m and i using the perm() method and stores it in variable can.
It calculates res * can * can and takes the modulo mod.
If i is even, it adds res to ans and takes the modulo mod. Otherwise, it adds mod - res to ans and takes the modulo mod.
After the loop, it prints the value of ans as output.
