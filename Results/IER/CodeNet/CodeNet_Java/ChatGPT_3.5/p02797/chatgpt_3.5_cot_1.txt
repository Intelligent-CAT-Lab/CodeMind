<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, K, and S are initialized with 4, 2, and 3 respectively according to the input.
It checks if K is equal to 0. Since K is not equal to 0, it enters the else block.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to N-1. In this case, it iterates 4 times.
For the first iteration, since i is less than K, it prints the value of S followed by a space.
For the second iteration, since i is equal to K, it prints the value of S followed by a space.
For the third and fourth iterations, since i is greater than K, it checks if S is equal to 1000000000. Since it is not equal to 1000000000, it prints the value of S+1 followed by a space.
After the loop finishes, it flushes the output and closes the scanner.
