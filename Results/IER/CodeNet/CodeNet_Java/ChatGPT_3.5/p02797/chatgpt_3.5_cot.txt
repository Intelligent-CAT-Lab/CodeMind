<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, K, and S are initialized with 4, 2, and 3 respectively according to the input.
Since K is not equal to 0, it enters the else block.
It then enters a for loop that iterates from 0 to N-1 (i.e., 0 to 3).
For the first two iterations (i < K), it prints the value of S followed by a space.
For the remaining iterations, it checks if S is equal to 1000000000. If it is, it prints "1 ".
Otherwise, it prints the value of S+1 followed by a space.
After the loop finishes, it flushes the output and closes the scanner.
