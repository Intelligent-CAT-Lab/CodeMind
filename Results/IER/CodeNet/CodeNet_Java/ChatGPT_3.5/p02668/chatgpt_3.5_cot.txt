<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, N and M. It then initializes two arrays, pot2 and invPot2, with size M+1. It calculates the values of these arrays using a loop. It also initializes two 2D arrays, table and table2, with size M+1 and N+1. It fills these arrays with -1. 

The code then calls the calc method with arguments M and N. The calc method is a recursive method that calculates the value of table[rem][bits] using the values of table[rem-1][bits-1] and table[rem][bits-1]. It also uses the values of pot2 and invPot2 to calculate the result. The calc2 method is a helper method that is called by the calc method. It calculates the value of table2[rem][bits] using the values of table2[rem-1][bits] and table[rem][bits]. 

The calc method and calc2 method use memoization to avoid redundant calculations. They store the calculated values in the table and table2 arrays. 

The code then prints the value of table[M][N] as the output.

<<<Output>>>
The output would be the value of table[M][N].
