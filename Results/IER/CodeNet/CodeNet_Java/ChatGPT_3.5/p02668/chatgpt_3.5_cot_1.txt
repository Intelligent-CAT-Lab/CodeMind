<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers N and M from the input. It then initializes two arrays, pot2 and invPot2, with size M+1. It calculates the values of these arrays using a loop. The pot2 array stores the powers of 2 modulo MOD, and the invPot2 array stores the inverses of these powers modulo MOD.

The code then initializes two 2D arrays, table and table2, with size (M+1) x (N+1). It fills these arrays with -1.

The code then calls the calc method with arguments M and N. This method calculates the number of valid sequences of length N using M bits. It uses dynamic programming to calculate the result. It first checks if the result is already stored in the table array. If it is, it returns the stored result. Otherwise, it calculates the result using the formula:

ret = (calc2(rem - 1, bits - 1) * pot2[rem]) % MOD + (rem + 1) * calc(rem, bits - 1) % MOD

The calc2 method is similar to the calc method, but it calculates the number of valid sequences of length N using M bits and the first bit set to 1. It uses the same dynamic programming approach.

The calc method and calc2 method call each other recursively to calculate the results.

The code then prints the result of the calc method.
