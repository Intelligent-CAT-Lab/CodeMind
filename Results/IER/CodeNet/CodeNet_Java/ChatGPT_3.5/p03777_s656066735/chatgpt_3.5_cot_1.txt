<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a line of input and splits it into an array of strings using the space as a delimiter. The first element of the array is assigned to the variable atCoDeerSpeak and the second element is assigned to the variable topCoDeerSpeak.
Then it checks if the value of atCoDeerSpeak is equal to the value of topCoDeerSpeak. If they are equal, it prints "H". Otherwise, it prints "D".
In this case, the values of atCoDeerSpeak and topCoDeerSpeak are both "H", so the condition is true and it will print "H".
<<<Output>>>
H
