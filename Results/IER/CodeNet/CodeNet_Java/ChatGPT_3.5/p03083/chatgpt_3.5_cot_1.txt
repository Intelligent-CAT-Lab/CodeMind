<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers b and w as input. It then calculates the sum of b and w and stores it in the variable n. It initializes two arrays dpw and dpb of size n+1 with all elements as 0. It also initializes an array fif using the enumFIF method. It initializes an array inv of size n and calculates the inverse of each element using the formula inv[i] = inv[mod%i] * (mod - mod/i) % mod. It initializes an array inv_pow of size n+1 and calculates the inverse power of 2 for each element using the formula inv_pow[i] = inv_pow[i-1]*inv[2] % mod. It then enters a for loop from 0 to n-1 and calculates the values of dpw and dpb using the formula dpw[i+1] = dpw[i] + inv[2]*C(i,w-1,mod,fif)%mod*inv_pow[i]%mod and dpb[i+1] = dpb[i] + inv[2]*C(i,b-1,mod,fif)%mod*inv_pow[i]%mod. It then calculates the answer using the formula ans = (mod+(1+dpw[i+1]-dpb[i+1])%mod)*inv[2]%mod and prints it. The loop runs for n-1 times and prints n-1 answers.
