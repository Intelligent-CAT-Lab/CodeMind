<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers b and w as input. It calculates the sum of b and w and stores it in the variable n. It then initializes two arrays dpw and dpb with size n+1. It also initializes an array fif with size 1000000 and an array inv with size n. It calculates the inverse of 2 modulo mod and stores it in the array inv. It also calculates the inverse power of 2 modulo mod and stores it in the array inv_pow. Then it enters a for loop from 0 to n-1 and calculates the values of dpw and dpb using the formula dpw[i+1] = dpw[i] + inv[2]*C(i,w-1,mod,fif)%mod*inv_pow[i]%mod and dpb[i+1] = dpb[i] + inv[2]*C(i,b-1,mod,fif)%mod*inv_pow[i]%mod. It then calculates the answer using the formula ans = (mod+(1+dpw[i+1]-dpb[i+1])%mod)*inv[2]%mod and prints it. The loop continues until i reaches n-1.
