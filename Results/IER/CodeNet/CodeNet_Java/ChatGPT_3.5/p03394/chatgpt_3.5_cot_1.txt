<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 3 according to the input.
It checks if n is equal to 3. If it is, it prints "2 5 63" and returns.
If n is not equal to 3, it checks if n is equal to 4. If it is, it prints "2 5 20 63" and returns.
If n is neither 3 nor 4, it initializes an empty list called ans, and initializes variables _2, _3, _23, i with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates until the size of ans is less than n - 2.
Inside the loop, it checks if the current number i is divisible by both 2 and 3, if it is, it increments the variable _23.
If the current number i is divisible by 2 but not by 3, it adds i to the variable _2.
If the current number i is divisible by 3 but not by 2, it adds i to the variable _3.
If the current number i is divisible by either 2 or 3, it adds i to the list ans.
After the loop finishes, it initializes a variable k with the value of i.
It enters an infinite loop.
Inside the loop, it checks if the current number i is divisible by 2, if the sum of _2 and i is divisible by 3, and if the sum of _2 and i is divisible by 3.
If all the conditions are met, it assigns the value of i to the variable sn, adds i to the list ans, and breaks the loop.
After the loop finishes, it initializes the variable i with the value of k.
It enters another infinite loop.
Inside the loop, it checks if the current number i is divisible by 3, if the sum of _3 and i is divisible by 2, and if the current number i is not equal to sn.
If all the conditions are met, it adds i to the list ans and breaks the loop.
After the loop finishes, it enters a for loop to print the elements of the list ans.
It prints each element followed by a space.
<<<Output>>>
2 5 63
