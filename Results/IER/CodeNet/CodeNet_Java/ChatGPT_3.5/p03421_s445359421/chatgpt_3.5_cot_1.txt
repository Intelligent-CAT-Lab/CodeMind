<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized with 5, 3 and 2 respectively according to the input. And a StringBuilder object sb is initialized.
It checks if the product of A and B is less than N or N is less than the sum of A and B minus 1. If the condition is true, it appends -1 to the StringBuilder object sb.
Otherwise, it enters an else block and initializes a variable n with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to A. In each iteration, it checks if the sum of n, B and A minus i is greater than N. If it is, it decreases the value of B by 1.
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from n + B to n. In each iteration, it appends the current value of j to the StringBuilder object sb.
After the inner loop finishes, it increases the value of n by B.
After the outer loop finishes, it deletes the last character of the StringBuilder object sb.
Finally, it prints the StringBuilder object sb as output.
<<<Output>>>
