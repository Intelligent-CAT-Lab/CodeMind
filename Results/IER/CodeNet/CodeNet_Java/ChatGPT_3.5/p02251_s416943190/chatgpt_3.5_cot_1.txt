The variable n is initialized with 100 according to the input. And an array a is initialized with {25, 10, 5, 1}.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 3 to check each element in the array a. The value of variable i is also used as an index to access the elements in the array.
Inside the for loop, it checks if n is not equal to 0. If it is not, it performs integer division of n by the current element in the array a[i] and adds the result to variable count. It then updates the value of n by taking the remainder of the division n % a[i].
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable count as output, which is 4.
<<<Output>>>
4
