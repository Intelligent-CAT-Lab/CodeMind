<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads three integers from the input using the Scanner class and assigns them to variables a, b, and c respectively. 
Then it checks if the sum of variables a and b is greater than or equal to variable c. 
If the condition is true, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
In this case, the sum of 50 and 100 is 150, which is greater than 120. So the condition is true and the output will be "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
