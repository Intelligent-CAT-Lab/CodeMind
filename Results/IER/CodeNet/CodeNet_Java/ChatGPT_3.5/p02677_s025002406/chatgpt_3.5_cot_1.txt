<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four double values as input: A, B, H, and M.
It calculates the coordinates of two points on a circle using trigonometric functions.
The first point is calculated using the formula H1 = A * sin(H * 30 + M * 0.5) for the x-coordinate and H2 = A * cos(H * 30 + M * 0.5) for the y-coordinate.
The second point is calculated using the formula M1 = B * sin(M * 6) for the x-coordinate and M2 = B * cos(M * 6) for the y-coordinate.
Finally, it calculates the distance between the two points using the formula sqrt((H1 - M1)^2 + (H2 - M2)^2) and prints the result.
In this case, A = 3, B = 4, H = 9, and M = 0.
Plugging in these values into the formulas, we get:
H1 = 3 * sin(9 * 30 + 0 * 0.5) = 3 * sin(270) = 3 * (-1) = -3
H2 = 3 * cos(9 * 30 + 0 * 0.5) = 3 * cos(270) = 3 * (0) = 0
M1 = 4 * sin(0 * 6) = 4 * sin(0) = 4 * (0) = 0
M2 = 4 * cos(0 * 6) = 4 * cos(0) = 4 * (1) = 4
The distance between the two points is sqrt((-3 - 0)^2 + (0 - 4)^2) = sqrt(9 + 16) = sqrt(25) = 5.
Therefore, the output of the code execution would be 5.
