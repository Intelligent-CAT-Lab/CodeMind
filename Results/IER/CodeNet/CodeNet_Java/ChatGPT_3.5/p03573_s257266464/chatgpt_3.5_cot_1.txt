<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input and assigns them to variables a, b, and c respectively.
Then it checks if a is equal to b. If it is, it prints the value of c.
Next, it checks if b is equal to c. If it is, it prints the value of a.
Finally, it checks if c is equal to a. If it is, it prints the value of b.
In this case, a=5, b=7, and c=5. The condition a==b is false, so it does not print anything.
The condition b==c is false, so it does not print anything.
The condition c==a is true, so it prints the value of b, which is 7.
The final output is:
7
