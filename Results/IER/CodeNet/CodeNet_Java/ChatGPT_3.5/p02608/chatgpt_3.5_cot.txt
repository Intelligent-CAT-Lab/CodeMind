<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 20 according to the input. An array eratosu of size 100000 is created to store the count of occurrences of each value.
Then, there are three nested for loops that iterate from 1 to 100. These loops generate all possible combinations of i, j, and k from 1 to 100.
Inside the innermost loop, it calculates the value of result using the formula: i * i + j * j + k * k + i * j + j * k + k * i.
If the value of result is greater than or equal to 100000, it continues to the next iteration of the loop.
Otherwise, it increments the count of eratosu[result] by 1.
After the loops finish, it creates a StringBuilder object sb and initializes it with the value of eratosu[1].
Then, it appends a newline character followed by the value of eratosu[i] for each i from 2 to n.
Finally, it prints the string representation of sb.
