<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 20 according to the input. An array eratosu of size 100000 is created to store the count of occurrences of certain values.
Then, there are three nested for loops that iterate from 1 to 100. These loops are used to calculate the sum of squares and products of three variables i, j, and k.
Inside the innermost loop, the sum of squares and products is calculated and stored in the variable result. Then, the count of occurrences of this result is incremented in the eratosu array.
After the loops finish, a StringBuilder sb is created to store the output. The first element of eratosu is appended to sb as a string. Then, a for loop iterates from 2 to n and appends each element of eratosu to sb with a newline character in between.
Finally, the StringBuilder sb is converted to a string and printed as the output.
