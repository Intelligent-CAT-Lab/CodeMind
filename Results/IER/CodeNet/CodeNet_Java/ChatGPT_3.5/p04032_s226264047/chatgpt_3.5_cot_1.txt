<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input and converts it into a character array. It then checks if the first two characters are the same. If they are, it prints "1 2" and returns. Otherwise, it enters a for loop that iterates from 0 to n-2, where n is the length of the character array. Inside the loop, it checks if any three consecutive characters are the same. If they are, it prints the indices of the first and third characters and returns. If no such three consecutive characters are found, it prints "-1 -1" as the output.
<<<Output>>>
-1 -1
