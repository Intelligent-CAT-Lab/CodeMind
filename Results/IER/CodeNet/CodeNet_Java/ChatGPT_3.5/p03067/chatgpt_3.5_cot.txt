<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input: a, b, and c. It then checks if c falls within the range [a, b] or [b, a]. If it does, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".
In this case, the input is 3, 8, and 5. Since 5 falls within the range [3, 8], the code will print "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
