<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a, b, and c are initialized with 3, 8, and 5 respectively according to the input.
The code then checks if c falls within the range [a, b] or [b, a]. If it does, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".
In this case, c = 5 falls within the range [3, 8], so the output would be "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
