<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads the input from the user using BufferedReader and StringTokenizer. It splits the input string into three parts: a long integer i, a character ch, and another long integer j.
Then it checks the value of ch. If ch is '+', it adds i and j and prints the result. If ch is '-', it subtracts j from i and prints the result.
In this case, ch is '+', so the code will add i and j and print the result.
