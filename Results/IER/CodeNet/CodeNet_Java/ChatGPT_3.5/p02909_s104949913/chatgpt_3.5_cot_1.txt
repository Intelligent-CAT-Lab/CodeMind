<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string from the user and stores it in the variable `str`. 
Then, it creates a `HashMap` called `map` and adds three key-value pairs to it. The keys are "Sunny", "Cloudy", and "Rainy", and the corresponding values are "Cloudy", "Rainy", and "Sunny" respectively.
Finally, it prints the value associated with the input string `str` using the `get()` method of the `map` object.
In this case, the input string is "Sunny", so the code will retrieve the value "Cloudy" from the `map` and print it as the output.
<<<Output>>>
Cloudy
