<<<Analysis>>>
The variable w and variable h are initialized with 4 and 5 respectively according to the input.
It checks if either w or h is equal to 1. If either of them is 1, it prints 1 and returns.
Since neither w nor h is 1, it calculates the value of variable c. If the product of w and h is even, it assigns the value of (w*h)/2 to c. Otherwise, it assigns the value of (w*h)/2+1 to c.
In this case, the product of w and h is 20, which is even. So, c is assigned the value of 20/2, which is 10.
Finally, it prints the value of c as output, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
