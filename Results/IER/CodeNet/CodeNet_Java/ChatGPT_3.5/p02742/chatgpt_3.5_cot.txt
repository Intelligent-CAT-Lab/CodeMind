<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two long integers as input, w and h.
It checks if either w or h is equal to 1. If so, it prints 1 and returns.
Otherwise, it calculates the value of c based on the following condition:
- If the product of w and h is even, c is equal to the product of w and h divided by 2.
- If the product of w and h is odd, c is equal to the product of w and h divided by 2 plus 1.
Finally, it prints the value of c as the output.
In this case, w = 4 and h = 5. The product of w and h is 20, which is even. Therefore, c is equal to 20 divided by 2, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
