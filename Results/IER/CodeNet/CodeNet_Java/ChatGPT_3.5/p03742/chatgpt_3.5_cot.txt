<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two long integers X and Y from the input. Then it calls the method `printlnYN` passing the result of the expression `Math.abs(X-Y) <= 1` as an argument. The `printlnYN` method prints "Brown" if the argument is true and "Alice" otherwise.
So, the return value of `2 1` would be "Brown".
<<<Output>>>
Brown
