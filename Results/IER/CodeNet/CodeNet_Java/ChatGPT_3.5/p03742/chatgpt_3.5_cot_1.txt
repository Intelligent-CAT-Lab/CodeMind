<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two long integers X and Y from the input. It then calls the method `printlnYN` with the argument `Math.abs(X-Y) <= 1`. The `printlnYN` method prints "Brown" if the argument is true, and "Alice" otherwise.
In this case, X = 2 and Y = 1. The absolute difference between X and Y is 1, which is less than or equal to 1. Therefore, the argument passed to `printlnYN` is true, and the output will be "Brown".
<<<Output>>>
Brown
