<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 6 according to the input. It then checks if n is equal to 2. If it is, it prints -1 and returns. Otherwise, it initializes a 2D character array called ans with size n x n and fills it with '.' characters.
If n is divisible by 3, it fills the array in a specific pattern using the fill3() method. If n is 7, it fills the array in a specific pattern using the fill7() method. If n is 11, it fills the array in a specific pattern using the fill7() method for the first 7 rows and the fill4() method for the remaining 4 rows.
If n is not divisible by 3, 4, or 11, it fills the array in a specific pattern based on the remainder of n divided by 4. It uses the fill4(), fill5(), and fill7() methods to fill the array accordingly.
Finally, it prints the filled array as the output.
