<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input integer and converts it to a string. Then it initializes an empty string called "ans". It enters a for loop that iterates through each character in the input string. Inside the loop, it checks if the current character is '1'. If it is, it appends '9' to the "ans" string. Otherwise, it appends '1'. After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of the "ans" string as the output.

In this case, the input is "119". The code will iterate through each character: '1', '1', and '9'. For the first two characters, it will append '9' to the "ans" string. For the last character, it will append '1'. Therefore, the output will be "991".
