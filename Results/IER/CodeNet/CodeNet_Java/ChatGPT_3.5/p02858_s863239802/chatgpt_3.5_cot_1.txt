<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three long integers as input: h, w, and t. It then calls the solve() method passing these three values as arguments. 
Inside the solve() method, it calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of h and t and stores it in the variable hg. It also calculates the gcd of w and t and stores it in the variable wg.
Then, it calculates the answer using the formula: 
ans = 2^(w/wg) + 2^(h/hg) + 2^(gcd(h/hg, w/wg)) - 3
Finally, it returns the value of ans raised to the power of (wg * hg) % (MOD - 1), where MOD is a constant defined in the code.
The solve() method returns the final answer, which is then printed as the output.
