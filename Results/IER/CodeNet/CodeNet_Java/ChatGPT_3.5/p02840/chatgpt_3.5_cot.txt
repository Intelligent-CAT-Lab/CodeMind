<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n, variable x and variable d are initialized with 3, 4 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It checks if d is equal to 0. If it is, it checks if x is equal to 0. If it is, it prints 1 and returns. Otherwise, it prints n+1 and returns.
If d is not equal to 0, it checks if x is equal to 0. If it is, it prints 1 + n * (n - 1) / 2 and returns.
If both d and x are not equal to 0, it creates a map m to store the values of b % d and a list of long arrays.
It iterates from 0 to n and calculates the values of b, sum and rsum based on the current value of take.
It calculates the value of c by dividing b by d and adds the values of c + sum and c + rsum to the map m with the key b % d.
After the loop finishes, it initializes the variable ans to 0.
It iterates through the entries of the map m and sorts the list of long arrays in each entry based on the values of the arrays.
It initializes the variables l and r to 0 and f to false.
It iterates through the list of long arrays and checks if the current array overlaps with the previous array.
If it does, it updates the values of l and r accordingly. If it doesn't, it adds the length of the previous range to ans and updates the values of l and r to the current array.
After the loop finishes, it adds the length of the last range to ans.
Finally, it prints the value of ans as the output.
