<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n, variable x and variable d are initialized with 3, 4 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It checks if d is 0 and x is 0. If it is, it prints 1 and returns. Otherwise, it checks if x is 0. If it is, it calculates the sum of the arithmetic progression from 1 to n and prints it. Otherwise, it creates a map m to store the values of b%d and corresponding values of c and r. It iterates from 0 to n and calculates the values of b, sum, rsum and c. Then it adds the values of c+sum and c+rsum to the map m with the key b%d. After that, it calculates the final answer by iterating through the entries of map m. For each entry, it sorts the corresponding list of values in ascending order. Then it iterates through the sorted list and checks if the current value overlaps with the previous value. If it does, it updates the range of the current value. If it doesn't, it adds the length of the previous range to the answer and updates the range of the current value. Finally, it adds the length of the last range to the answer and prints the answer.
