<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes the variable odd with 0. Then it enters a for loop that iterates 3 times. In each iteration, it takes an integer input from the user using the Scanner object sc and calculates the remainder when the input is divided by 2. If the remainder is 1, it means the number is odd and it increments the variable odd by 1. After the loop finishes, it checks if the value of odd is greater than or equal to 2. If it is, it prints "Hom", otherwise it prints "Tem".
In this case, the input is "1 1 10". The first number is odd, so odd becomes 1. The second number is also odd, so odd becomes 2. The third number is even, so odd remains 2. Since odd is equal to 2, the output will be "Hom".
