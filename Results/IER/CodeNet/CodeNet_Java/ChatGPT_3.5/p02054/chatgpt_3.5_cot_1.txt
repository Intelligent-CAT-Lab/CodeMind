<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes the variable odd with 0. Then it enters a for loop that iterates 3 times. In each iteration, it takes an integer input from the user using the Scanner object sc and calculates the remainder when the input is divided by 2. If the remainder is 1, it means the number is odd and it increments the variable odd by 1. After the loop finishes, it checks if the value of odd is greater than or equal to 2. If it is, it prints "Hom", otherwise it prints "Tem".
In this case, the input is 1 1 10. So, in the first iteration, the input is 1 and the remainder is 1, so odd becomes 1. In the second iteration, the input is 1 and the remainder is 1, so odd becomes 2. In the third iteration, the input is 10 and the remainder is 0, so odd remains 2. Finally, it prints "Hom" because the value of odd is greater than or equal to 2.
