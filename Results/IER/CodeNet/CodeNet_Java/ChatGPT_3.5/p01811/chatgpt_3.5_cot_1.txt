<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string input S. It then enters a while loop which continues until the length of S is less than or equal to 3.
Inside the while loop, it checks if the substring "ABC" exists in S. If it does, it replaces the first occurrence of "ABC" with "X" in S.
If "ABC" does not exist in S, it prints "No" and returns.
After replacing "ABC" with "X", it checks if there are exactly 2 distinct characters in S. If there are not, it prints "No" and returns.
If there are exactly 2 distinct characters in S, it replaces all occurrences of "X" in S with the missing character.
The while loop continues until the length of S is less than or equal to 3.
Finally, it checks if S is equal to "ABC". If it is, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
