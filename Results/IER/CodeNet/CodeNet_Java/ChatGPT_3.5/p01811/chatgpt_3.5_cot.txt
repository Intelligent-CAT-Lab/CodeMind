<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string input `S` and checks if it contains the substring "ABC". If it does, it replaces "ABC" with "X" in the string `S`. This process continues until the length of `S` is less than or equal to 3.
After that, it checks if the string `S` is equal to "ABC". If it is, it returns "Yes", otherwise it returns "No".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
