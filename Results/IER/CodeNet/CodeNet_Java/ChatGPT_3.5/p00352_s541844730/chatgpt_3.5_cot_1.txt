<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers from the input using the Scanner class and stores them in variables a and b. Then it calculates the average of these two integers by adding them and dividing the sum by 2. Finally, it prints the calculated average as the output.
In this case, the input is "1000 3000", so the values of a and b will be 1000 and 3000 respectively. The average of these two numbers is (1000 + 3000) / 2 = 2000.
<<<Output>>>
2000
