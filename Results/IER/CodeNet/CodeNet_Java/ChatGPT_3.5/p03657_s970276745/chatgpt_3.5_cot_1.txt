<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input and assigns them to variables a and b respectively.
Then it calculates the remainder of a divided by 3 and assigns it to variable c.
Similarly, it calculates the remainder of b divided by 3 and assigns it to variable d.
Then it calculates the remainder of the sum of a and b divided by 3 and assigns it to variable e.
Next, it checks if any of the variables c, d, or e is equal to 0. If any of them is 0, it prints "Possible". Otherwise, it prints "Impossible".
In this case, the remainder of 4 divided by 3 is 1, the remainder of 5 divided by 3 is 2, and the remainder of the sum of 4 and 5 divided by 3 is 2.
Since none of these variables is equal to 0, the output will be "Impossible".
<<<Output>>>
Impossible
