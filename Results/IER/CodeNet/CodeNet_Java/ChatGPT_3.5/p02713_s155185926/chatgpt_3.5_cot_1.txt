<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 2 according to the input. And variable sum is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. 
Inside the first for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 1 to 2 to check each integer j in this range.
Inside the second for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 1 to 2 to check each integer k in this range.
Inside the third for loop, it calls the function get_GCD(i, j, k) and adds the returned value to variable sum.
The function get_GCD(a, b, c) calculates the gcd of three numbers a, b, and c by finding the minimum of the three numbers and checking if each number is divisible by i from 1 to the minimum. If all three numbers are divisible by i, then i is the gcd. The function returns the gcd.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable sum as output, which is 12.
<<<Output>>>
12
