<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input from the user using the Scanner class. It then checks if the input string is equal to "ABC". If it is, it prints "ARC", otherwise it prints "ABC".
In this case, the input string is "ABC", so the condition is true and the code will print "ARC".
<<<Output>>>
ARC
