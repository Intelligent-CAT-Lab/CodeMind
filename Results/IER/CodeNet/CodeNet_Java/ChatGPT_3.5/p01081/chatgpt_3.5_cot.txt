<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string as input and converts it into a character array. It then initializes an array of ArrayDeque objects to store the positions of each character in the string. It iterates through the character array and adds the positions of each character to the corresponding ArrayDeque object. 
Next, it checks if the size of any ArrayDeque object is odd. If it is, it prints -1 and returns.
Then, it creates two ArrayList objects to store the prefix and suffix characters. It iterates through the ArrayDeque objects and adds the characters and their positions to the prefix and suffix ArrayLists.
The prefix ArrayList is sorted in reverse order based on the positions of the characters.
Next, it creates an array called prefix to store the characters from the prefix ArrayList.
It then adds the positions of the suffix characters to their corresponding ArrayDeque objects.
The suffix ArrayList is sorted based on the positions of the characters.
Next, it initializes a FenwickTree object called bit with the length of the string.
It iterates through the suffix ArrayList and calculates the answer by adding the difference between the position and the sum of the suffix characters in the FenwickTree object.
Finally, it prints the answer.
<<<Output>>>
-1
