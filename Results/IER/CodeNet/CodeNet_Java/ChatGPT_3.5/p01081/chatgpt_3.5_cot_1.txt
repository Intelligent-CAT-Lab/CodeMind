<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string as input and converts it into a character array. It then initializes an array of ArrayDeque objects to store the positions of each character in the string. It iterates through the character array and adds the positions of each character to the corresponding ArrayDeque object.

Next, it checks if the size of any ArrayDeque object is odd. If it is, it means that there is an odd number of occurrences of that character in the string, and the code prints -1 and returns.

If all the ArrayDeque objects have even sizes, the code proceeds to create two ArrayList objects: prefixList and suffixList. These lists will store pairs of characters and their positions. The prefixList will store the first half of the pairs, while the suffixList will store the second half.

The code then sorts the prefixList in descending order based on the positions of the characters. It also sorts the suffixList in ascending order based on the positions of the characters.

Next, the code calculates the answer by iterating through the prefixList and adding the difference between the position and the index to the answer variable.

Then, the code creates two arrays: prefix and suffix. The prefix array stores the characters from the prefixList, while the suffix array stores the positions of the characters from the suffixList.

The code then creates a FenwickTree object called bit and uses it to calculate the answer. It iterates through the suffix array and adds the difference between the index and the sum of the positions in the bit object to the answer.

Finally, the code prints the answer.
