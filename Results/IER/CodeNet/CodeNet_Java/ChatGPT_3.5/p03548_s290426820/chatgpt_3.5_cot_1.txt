The variable x, variable y and variable z are initialized with 13, 3 and 1 respectively according to the input. 
Then it subtracts 2 times the value of z from x and stores the result in x. So, x becomes 11.
Then it initializes a variable cnt with 0.
Then it enters a while loop with condition true.
Inside the while loop, it checks if the value of x minus the sum of y and z is greater than or equal to 0. If it is, it subtracts the sum of y and z from x and increments the value of cnt by 1.
If the condition is not met, it checks if the value of x minus y is greater than or equal to 0. If it is, it increments the value of cnt by 1 and breaks out of the loop.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of cnt as output, which is 4.
<<<Output>>>
4
