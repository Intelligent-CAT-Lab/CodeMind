<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 1118 according to the input. 
Then it calculates the value of n1, n10, n100, and n1000 based on the value of n.
n1 is the last digit of n, n10 is the second last digit of n, n100 is the third last digit of n, and n1000 is the first digit of n.
Then it checks if either all the digits are the same (n1 = n10 = n100) or the last three digits are the same (n10 = n100 = n1000).
If either of the conditions is true, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
In this case, n1 = 8, n10 = 1, n100 = 1, and n1000 = 1. So, the condition (n1 = n10 = n100) is not true. But the condition (n10 = n100 = n1000) is true. Therefore, it prints "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
