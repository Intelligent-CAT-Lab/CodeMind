<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input and assigns it to variable n. Then it extracts the individual digits of the number n by using modulo and division operations.
The variable n1 stores the last digit of n, n10 stores the second last digit, n100 stores the third last digit, and n1000 stores the first digit.
Then it checks if all the digits are equal. If all the digits are equal, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
In this case, the number is 1118. The last digit is 8, the second last digit is 1, the third last digit is 1, and the first digit is 1.
Since all the digits are not equal, the code will print "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
