The variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized with 3, 0 and 10 respectively according to the input. And variable day is initialized with 0 and variable coins is initialized with 0.
It enters a while loop and it keeps iterating until the value of variable coins is greater than or equal to c. In each iteration, it increments the value of variable day by 1 and adds the value of variable a to variable coins.
Then it checks if the value of variable day is divisible by 7. If it is, it adds the value of variable b to variable coins.
The loop continues until the value of variable coins is greater than or equal to c.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable day as output.
