<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input: a, b, and c. It checks if c is greater than or equal to a and less than or equal to b. If the condition is true, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
In this case, the values of a, b, and c are 1, 3, and 2 respectively. Since 2 is greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 3, the condition is true and the output will be "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
