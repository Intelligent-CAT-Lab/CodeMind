<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a line of input and splits it into an array of strings using the space character as the delimiter. The second element of the array is then accessed and its first character is extracted and stored in the variable 'upper'. Finally, the code prints the string "A" followed by the value of 'upper' followed by the string "C".

Based on the given input "AtCoder Beginner Contest", the value of 'upper' will be 't'. Therefore, the output will be "AtC".

<<<Output>>>
AtC
