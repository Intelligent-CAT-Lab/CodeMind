<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a line of input and splits it into an array of strings using the space character as the delimiter. The first element of the array is ignored. The second element is accessed and its first character is extracted and stored in the variable 'upper'. Finally, the code prints the string "A" followed by the value of 'upper' followed by the string "C".

In this case, the input is "AtCoder Beginner Contest". After splitting the input, the array will contain ["AtCoder", "Beginner", "Contest"]. The second element is "Beginner" and its first character is 'B'. Therefore, the output will be "ABC".

<<<Output>>>
ABC
