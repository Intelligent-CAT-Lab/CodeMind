<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 3 according to the input. And variable l is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates until l is less than N. In each iteration, it subtracts the value of l from N.
After the loop finishes, it checks if N is not equal to l. If it is not equal, it prints "No" and returns.
If N is equal to l, it prints "Yes" and l+1.
Then it initializes a 2D array called answer with dimensions (l+1) x l.
It initializes a variable Index with 1.
Then it enters a nested for loop. The outer loop iterates from 0 to l. The inner loop iterates from 0 to i.
Inside the inner loop, it appends the value of answer[j][i-1] to a StringBuilder object called string.
Then it enters another inner loop which iterates from j to l. Inside this loop, it appends the value of Index to string and increments Index by 1.
After the inner loops finish, it prints the string representation of the StringBuilder object.
Finally, it flushes the output and returns.
