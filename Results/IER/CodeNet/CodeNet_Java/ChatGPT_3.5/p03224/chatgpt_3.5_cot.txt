<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input N and initializes a variable l. It then enters a for loop where it subtracts the value of l from N in each iteration until N becomes less than or equal to l. The value of l is incremented by 1 in each iteration. After the loop, it checks if N is not equal to l. If it is not equal, it prints "No" and returns. Otherwise, it prints "Yes" and the value of l+1. 

Then, it initializes a 2D array called answer with dimensions (l+1) x l. It also initializes a variable Index with the value 1. It enters a nested for loop where it iterates over the rows and columns of the answer array. It creates a StringBuilder object called string and appends the value of l to it. Then, it appends the elements of the answer array to the string, starting from the first row and column up to the current row and column. It also assigns the value of Index to the current element of the answer array. After each iteration of the inner loop, it prints the string. 

Finally, it flushes the output and returns.
