<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 7 according to the input. 
The code then creates an empty IntList called list.
It enters a while loop and it continues until n becomes 0.
Inside the while loop, it iterates from 0 to the size of the list and checks if n is less than 2^(i+1). If it is, it breaks the loop.
Then it subtracts 2^i from n and inserts the value i+1 at the end of the list.
After the while loop finishes, it prints the size of the list multiplied by 2.
Then it prints the numbers from 1 to the size of the list, followed by the numbers in the list.
<<<Output>>>
