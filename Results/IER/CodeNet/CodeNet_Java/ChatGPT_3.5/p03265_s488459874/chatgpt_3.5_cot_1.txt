<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four integers as input: x1, y1, x2, and y2. These values are assigned to the corresponding variables.
Then, it calculates the values of v1x and v1y by subtracting x1 from x2 and y1 from y2, respectively.
Next, it calculates the values of x4 and y4 by taking the negative of v1y and adding it to x1, and taking the positive of v1x and adding it to y1, respectively.
After that, it calculates the values of v2x and v2y by subtracting x4 from x1 and y4 from y1, respectively.
Finally, it calculates the values of x3 and y3 by taking the negative of v2y and adding it to x4, and taking the positive of v2x and adding it to y4, respectively.
The values of x3, y3, x4, and y4 are then printed as the output.

In this case, the input is "0 0 0 1". 
So, x1 = 0, y1 = 0, x2 = 0, and y2 = 1.
Using these values, we can calculate the values of x3, y3, x4, and y4.

x3 = -v2y + x4 = -(-1) + 0 = 1 + 0 = 1
y3 = v2x + y4 = 0 + 1 = 1
x4 = -v1y + x1 = -1 + 0 = -1
y4 = v1x + y1 = 0 + 0 = 0

Therefore, the output would be "1 1 -1 0".
