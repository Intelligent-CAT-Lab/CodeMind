<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 3 according to the input. The variable MOD is initialized with 1000000007.
A 4-dimensional array dp is initialized with dimensions [n][4][4][4].
The variable ans is initialized with 0.
If n is equal to 1, ans is set to 4.
If n is equal to 2, ans is set to 16.
If n is greater than 2, a nested for loop is used to initialize the values of dp[2][i][j][k] for all i, j, k except for the combinations (0, 2, 1), (2, 0, 1), and (0, 1, 2).
Then, another nested for loop is used to calculate the values of dp[m][i][j][k] for m from 3 to n-1 and all i, j, k.
Inside this loop, there are conditions based on the value of k.
If k is equal to 0 or 3, another nested for loop is used to calculate the value of dp[m][i][j][k] by adding dp[m-1][t][i][j] for all t.
If k is equal to 1, there is an additional condition to check if the combination (i, j) is equal to (0, 2) or (2, 0). If not, another nested for loop is used to calculate the value of dp[m][i][j][k] by adding dp[m-1][t][i][j] for all t except for the combinations (0, 2) and (0, 1).
If k is equal to 2, there is an additional condition to check if the combination (i, j) is equal to (0, 1). If not, another nested for loop is used to calculate the value of dp[m][i][j][k] by adding dp[m-1][t][i][j] for all t.
Finally, a nested for loop is used to calculate the value of ans by adding dp[n-1][i][j][k] for all i, j, k.
The final value of ans is printed as the output.
