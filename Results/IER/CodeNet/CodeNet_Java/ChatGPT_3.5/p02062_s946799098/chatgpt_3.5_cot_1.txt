<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string and parses it to create a logical expression tree. The input string is in the form of a logical expression with operators '&' and '|'. The code uses recursive parsing to create the expression tree.

The code starts by initializing the input string and a position variable. It then calls the parseOr() method to parse the logical expression.

The parseOr() method creates an ExprOr object and adds the parsed ExprAnd objects to its list of ands. It continues parsing ExprAnd objects as long as there are '|' operators in the input string.

The parseAnd() method creates an ExprAnd object and adds the parsed Term objects to its list of terms. It continues parsing Term objects as long as there are '&' operators in the input string.

The parseTerm() method creates a Term object. If the current character is '(', it recursively calls parseOr() to parse the sub-expression inside the parentheses. It then increments the position variable to move to the next character.

The Expr, ExprOr, ExprAnd, and Term classes are used to represent the logical expression tree. Each class has a calcCost() method that calculates the cost of evaluating the expression. The cost is calculated based on the number of '0's and '1's in the expression.

Finally, the main method calls parseOr() to parse the input string and then calls calcCost() on the resulting ExprOr object. It prints the cost of evaluating the expression.
