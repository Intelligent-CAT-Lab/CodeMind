<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads three integers A, B, and C from the input. It then checks if A is equal to B and A is equal to C. If both conditions are true, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
In this case, the input is "2 2 2". So, A=2, B=2, and C=2. Since A is equal to B and A is equal to C, the condition is true and the code will print "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
