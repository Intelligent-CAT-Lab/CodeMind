<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads three integers A, B, and N from the input. It then initializes a variable ans with the absolute difference between A and B.
Next, it enters a nested for loop where the outer loop iterates from 1 to N and the inner loop also iterates from 1 to N.
Inside the inner loop, it checks if the product of i and B is divisible by j. If it is not divisible, it continues to the next iteration.
If it is divisible, it calculates the absolute difference between A and the division of i * B by j, and updates the value of ans if this difference is smaller than the current value of ans.
After the nested loop finishes, it prints the final value of ans as the output.
