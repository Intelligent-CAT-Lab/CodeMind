<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string from the user and stores it in the variable "helix". Then it uses a switch statement to check the value of "helix". If "helix" is equal to "A", it prints "T". If "helix" is equal to "T", it prints "A". If "helix" is equal to "C", it prints "G". If "helix" is equal to "G", it prints "C". Since the input is "A", the output will be "T".
<<<Output>>>
T
