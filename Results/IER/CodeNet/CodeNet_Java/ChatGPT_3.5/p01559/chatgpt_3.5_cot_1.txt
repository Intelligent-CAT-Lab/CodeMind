The variable n is initialized with 3 and variable m is initialized with 0 according to the input. The variable xs and ys are empty arrays.
Then it calls the solve() method.
Inside the solve() method, it checks if n is less than or equal to 200. If it is, it calls the solveNaive() method and returns.
Otherwise, it initializes the variables factMod and factInvMod with arrays of size 2000000.
Then it calls the bfsLim() method twice, once with pathsS and dsS as parameters and another time with pathsG and dsG as parameters.
Inside the bfsLim() method, it initializes a HashSet called wall and adds the coordinates (xs[i], ys[i]) to it for each i from 0 to m-1.
Then it initializes the TreeMap path and ds with the initial position p0 and puts 1L and 0 as their values respectively.
Then it initializes a LinkedList called que and adds p0 to it.
Then it enters a for loop that continues until que is empty.
Inside the for loop, it removes the first element from que and assigns it to p.
If the value of d at p is equal to LIM, it breaks the loop.
Then it enters another for loop that iterates from 0 to 3.
Inside this loop, it calculates the coordinates of the next position q based on the current position p and the direction i.
If the coordinates of q are within the grid and q is not in the wall set, it checks if q is already in the ds map.
If it is not, it puts d[p]+1 as the value of d at q and adds q to que.
Then it checks if d[p]+1 is equal to d[q].
If it is, it checks if q is already in the path map.
If it is not, it puts 0L as the value of path at q.
Then it adds the value of path at p to the value of path at q and takes the modulo of the sum with mod and puts the result as the value of path at q.
After the loop finishes, it checks if the path map contains the coordinate (n-1, n-1).
If it does, it prints the value of path at (n-1, n-1) as the output.
Otherwise, it prints "0" as the output.
