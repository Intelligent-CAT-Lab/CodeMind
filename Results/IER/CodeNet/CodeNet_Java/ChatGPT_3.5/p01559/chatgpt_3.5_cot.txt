<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and variable m are initialized with 3 and 0 respectively according to the input. And the arrays xs and ys are initialized as empty arrays.
Then it calls the solve() method.
Inside the solve() method, it checks if n is less than or equal to 200. If it is, it calls the solveNaive() method and returns.
Otherwise, it initializes the variables factMod and factInvMod as arrays of size 2000000 and initializes the first element of both arrays as 1.
Then it calls the bfsLim() method twice, once with pathsS and dsS as parameters and another time with pathsG and dsG as parameters.
Then it initializes the variable dMin as INF.
Then it iterates through each entry in dsS and dsG and checks if the sum of the values of dsS and dsG is equal to LIM. If it is, it updates the value of dMin to be the minimum of dMin and the sum of dsS, the absolute difference between the x-coordinates of the keys of dsS and dsG, the absolute difference between the y-coordinates of the keys of dsS and dsG, and dsG.
If dMin is still INF, it prints 0 and returns.
Otherwise, it initializes two hash sets, setS and setG.
Then it iterates through each entry in dsS and dsG again and checks if the sum of the values of dsS and dsG is equal to LIM and if the sum of dsS, the absolute difference between the x-coordinates of the keys of dsS and dsG, the absolute difference between the y-coordinates of the keys of dsS and dsG, and dsG is equal to dMin. If it is, it adds the keys of dsS and dsG to setS and setG respectively.
Then it initializes an array of P objects, ps, with size m and assigns the values of xs and ys to the x and y coordinates of each P object respectively. Then it sorts the array ps.
Then it initializes an array of longs, dp, with size m and sets each element to 0.
Then it iterates through each P object in setS and for each P object, it iterates through each element in dp and updates the value of dp at that index by adding the product of the value of pathsS at the current P object and the value of nPath() method with the current P object and the P object at the current index of ps as parameters.
Then it iterates through each element in dp starting from the second element and for each element, it subtracts the product of the value of dp at the previous index and the value of nPath() method with the P object at the previous index and the P object at the current index of ps from the current element and takes the result modulo mod.
Then it initializes a long variable ans as 0.
Then it iterates through each P object in setG and for each P object, it initializes a long variable sum as 0 and iterates through each P object in setS and for each P object, it updates the value of sum by adding the product of the value of pathsS at the current P object, the value of nPath() method with the current P object and the current P object in setG, and the value of pathsG at the current P object and takes the result modulo mod.
Then it iterates through each element in dp and for each element, it updates the value of sum by subtracting the product of the current element, the value of nPath() method with the P object at the current index of ps and the current P object in setG, and the value of pathsG at the current P object and takes the result modulo mod.
Then it updates the value of ans by adding the value of sum and takes the result modulo mod.
Finally, it prints the value of ans.
