<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string as input and initializes an empty list called "list" to store arrays of strings. 
Then it iterates through each character of the input string and checks if it is 'I', 'O', or 'J'. 
If it is 'I', 'O', or 'J', it creates a new array of strings with two elements. The first element is set to the character itself ('I', 'O', or 'J') and the second element is set to 1. 
If the current character is the same as the next character, it increments a counter variable "cnt" and moves to the next character. This is done to count the consecutive occurrences of the same character. 
After processing each character, the array is added to the "list". 
Next, it initializes a variable "answer" to 0. 
Then it iterates through the "list" from the second element to the second-to-last element. 
For each element, it checks if the current element is 'O', the previous element is 'J', and the next element is 'I'. 
If these conditions are met, it compares the count of 'O' with the counts of 'J' and 'I'. 
If the counts of 'J' and 'I' are both greater than or equal to the count of 'O', it updates the "answer" variable if the count of 'O' is greater than the current value of "answer". 
Finally, it prints the value of "answer" as the output.
