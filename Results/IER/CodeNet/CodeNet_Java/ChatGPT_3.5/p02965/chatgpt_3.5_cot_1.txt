<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and variable m are initialized with 2 and 2 respectively according to the input. 
Then it initializes an array facts with length n + 3 * m / 2 + 1 and sets facts[0] = 1. 
Then it iterates from 1 to facts.length and calculates the factorial of each number and stores it in the facts array.
Then it initializes an array factsInv with the same length as facts and sets factsInv[facts.length - 1] = inv(facts[facts.length - 1]).
Then it iterates from facts.length - 1 to 0 and calculates the inverse factorial of each number and stores it in the factsInv array.
Then it initializes a variable ans with 0.
Then it enters a for loop and iterates from nOdd = m % 2 to m with a step of 2.
Inside the loop, it calculates the value of cans, cans1 and cans2 using the c function and the values of nOdd, n and m.
Then it calculates the value of ans by adding the product of cans and the difference between cans1 and cans2.
After the loop finishes, it prints the value of ans as output.
