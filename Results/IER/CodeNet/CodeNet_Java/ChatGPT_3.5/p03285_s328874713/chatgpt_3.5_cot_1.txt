<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 11 according to the input. And variable flag is initialized with false.
It checks if N is divisible by 4 or 7. If it is, it sets flag to true.
If N is not divisible by 4 or 7, it enters a for loop and it iterates from 4 to N with a step of 4. It checks if (N-i) is divisible by 7. If it is, it sets flag to true and breaks out of the loop.
After the loop finishes, it checks the value of flag. If it is true, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
In this case, 11 is not divisible by 4 or 7. So it enters the for loop and checks if (11-4) is divisible by 7, which is true. So it sets flag to true and breaks out of the loop.
Finally, it prints "Yes" as output.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
