<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads three integers N, A, and B from the input. It then checks if the product of N and A is less than B. If it is, it prints the product of N and A. Otherwise, it prints B.
In this case, N = 7, A = 17, and B = 120. The product of N and A is 119, which is less than B. Therefore, the code will print 119 as the output.
<<<Output>>>
119
