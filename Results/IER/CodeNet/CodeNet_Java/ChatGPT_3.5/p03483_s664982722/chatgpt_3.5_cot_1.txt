<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string as input and checks if it is a palindrome. It first initializes an array f of size 26 to store the frequency of each character in the string. Then it calculates the number of characters with odd frequency and stores it in the variable su. If su is greater than or equal to 2, it means that the string cannot be rearranged into a palindrome and the code prints -1 as the output. Otherwise, it proceeds to create a 2D array g to store the indices of each character in the string. It then creates another 2D array ft to store the Fenwick tree representation of g. Next, it iterates through the string and calculates the minimum distance between each character and its corresponding position in the palindrome. It updates the frequency array f and the Fenwick tree array ft accordingly. Finally, it prints the total minimum distance as the output.
