<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads three integers from the input: 50, 100, and 120. It then checks if the sum of the first two integers is greater than or equal to the third integer. If it is, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No". In this case, 50 + 100 = 150, which is greater than 120, so the output would be "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
