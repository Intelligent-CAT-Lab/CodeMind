<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input: a, b, and c. It then checks if the sum of the first two integers (a + b) is greater than or equal to the third integer (c). If the condition is true, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".
In this case, the input is 50, 100, and 120. The sum of the first two integers (50 + 100) is 150, which is greater than the third integer (120). Therefore, the condition is true and the code will print "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
