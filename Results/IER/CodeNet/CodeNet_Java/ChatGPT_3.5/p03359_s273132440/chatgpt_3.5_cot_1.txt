<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, a and b. It then checks if a is less than or equal to b. If it is, it adds 1 to the variable ans. Otherwise, it does not add anything. Finally, it prints the value of ans.

In this case, a is 5 and b is 5. Since a is equal to b, the condition a <= b is true. Therefore, 1 is added to ans. The final value of ans is 5.

<<<Output>>>
5
