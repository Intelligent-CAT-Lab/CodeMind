<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 3 according to the input. Then it checks if n is even or odd. Since 3 is odd, it enters the else block and assigns a value of n/2 + 1 to variable a and n/2 to variable b. So a = 3/2 + 1 = 2 and b = 3/2 = 1. Finally, it prints the product of a and b, which is 2 * 1 = 2.
<<<Output>>>
