<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads an integer input from the user using the Scanner class and stores it in the variable x. Then it calculates the cube of x and stores it in the variable kakeru. Finally, it prints the value of kakeru as the output.
In this case, the input is 2. So, the code will calculate 2^3, which is 8.
<<<Output>>>
8
