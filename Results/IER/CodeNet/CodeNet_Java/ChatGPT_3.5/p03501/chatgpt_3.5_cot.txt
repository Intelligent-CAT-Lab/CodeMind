<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads three integers N, A, and B from the input. It then calculates the minimum value between A*N and B and prints it as the output.
In this case, N=7, A=17, and B=120. The minimum value between A*N (17*7=119) and B (120) is 119. Therefore, the return value would be 119.
<<<Output>>>
119
