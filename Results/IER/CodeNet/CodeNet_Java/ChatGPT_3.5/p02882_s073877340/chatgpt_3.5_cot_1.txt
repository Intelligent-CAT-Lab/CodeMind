<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three double values as input: a, b, and x. It calculates the bottle capacity using the formula a*a*b and stores it in the variable bottleCapacity.
Then it checks if x*2 is less than bottleCapacity. If it is, it calculates the angle in degrees using the formula Math.toDegrees(Math.atan(a*b*b/(2*x))) and prints it.
If x*2 is greater than or equal to bottleCapacity, it calculates the angle in degrees using the formula Math.toDegrees(Math.atan(2*(bottleCapacity-x)/(a*a*a))) and prints it.
In this case, x*2 is equal to bottleCapacity, so it will calculate the angle using the second formula.
