<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three inputs: N, X, and D. It then calls the solve() method passing these inputs and prints the returned value.
In the solve() method, it first checks if D is negative. If it is, it multiplies X and D by -1. If D is 0, it checks if X is 0 and returns 1 if it is, otherwise it returns N+1.
Next, it creates a HashSet called set to store unique values. It iterates from 1 to N and calculates the modulo of (X * i) and D. It adds this value to the set.
After that, it adds 0 to the set and converts the set to an array called id. It sorts the id array in ascending order.
Then, it creates an array of PriorityQueue called pq with the same size as the set. Each PriorityQueue is initialized with a custom Comparator that compares two long arrays based on their first and second elements.
Next, it initializes a variable ans to 0. It iterates from 1 to N and calculates the modulo of (X * i) and D. It finds the index of this value in the id array using binary search.
Then, it calculates the start and end values based on the current index and i. It adds a long array containing the start and end values multiplied by D and added to X * i to the corresponding PriorityQueue in pq.
After that, it adds a long array containing 0 and 0 to the first PriorityQueue in pq.
Finally, it iterates over each PriorityQueue in pq and processes the long arrays in each PriorityQueue. It calculates the difference between the end and start values, adds D to it, and divides it by D. This value is then added to ans.
The final value of ans is returned as the result of the solve() method.
In the main() method, the solve() method is called with the given inputs and the returned value is printed.
