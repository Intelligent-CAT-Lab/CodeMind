<<<Analysis>>>
The variable X is initialized with 6 according to the input. And variable pow is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates until the value of pow is greater than or equal to X. In each iteration, it adds the current value of time to pow.
Inside the loop, it checks if X is less than or equal to pow. If it is, it prints the current value of time and returns from the main method.
After the loop finishes, it does not print anything because the condition X <= pow is not met.
