<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n, variable m and variable d are initialized with 2, 3 and 1 respectively according to the input.
Then it calculates the value of variable v2 as the maximum of 0 and (n - d - d). In this case, v2 = max(0, 2 - 1 - 1) = 0.
If d is equal to 0, then v2 is set to 0.
Then it calculates the value of variable v1 as (n - v2). In this case, v1 = 2 - 0 = 2.
Finally, it prints the value of ((v2 * 2 + v1) * (m - 1) / Math.pow(n, 2)) with 10 decimal places. In this case, the output is 0.3333333333.
