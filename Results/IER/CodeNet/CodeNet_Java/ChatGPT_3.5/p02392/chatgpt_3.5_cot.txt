<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes input from the user in the form of a string and splits it into an array of strings using the space as a delimiter. Then it converts the elements of the array into integers and assigns them to variables a, b, and c respectively. 
After that, it checks if a is less than b and b is less than c. If this condition is true, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
In this case, a=1, b=3, and c=8. The condition a<b<c is not satisfied, so the code will print "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
