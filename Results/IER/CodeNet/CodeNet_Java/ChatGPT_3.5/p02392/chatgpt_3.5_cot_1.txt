<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes input from the user and splits it into three integers a, b, and c. It then checks if a is less than b and b is less than c. If this condition is true, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".
In this case, a=1, b=3, and c=8. The condition a<b<c is not satisfied, so the code will print "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
