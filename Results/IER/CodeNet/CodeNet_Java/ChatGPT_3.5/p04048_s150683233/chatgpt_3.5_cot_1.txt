<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 5 and variable x is initialized with 2 according to the input. The variable a is assigned the maximum value between x and n-x, which is 3. The variable b is assigned the minimum value between x and n-x, which is 2. The variable sum is initialized with a+b, which is 5.
Then it enters a while loop with condition true. Inside the loop, it calculates the remainder of a divided by b and assigns it to the variable rest. It also calculates the integer division of a by b and assigns it to the variable times.
It adds b*times*2 to the variable sum. If rest is equal to 0, it subtracts b from the variable sum.
Then it assigns the value of b to a and the value of rest to b.
The loop continues until rest is equal to 0.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of the variable sum as output, which is 11.
<<<Output>>>
11
