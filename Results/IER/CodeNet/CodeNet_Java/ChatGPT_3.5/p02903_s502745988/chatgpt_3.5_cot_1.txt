The variable h, w, a, and b are initialized with 3, 3, 1, and 1 respectively according to the input.
A StringBuilder object sb is created to store the output.
The code then enters a nested for loop. The outer loop iterates from 0 to b-1, and the inner loop iterates from 0 to a-1.
Inside the inner loop, the code appends "0" to the StringBuilder object sb.
After the inner loop finishes, another inner loop is executed. This inner loop iterates from 0 to w-a-1.
Inside this inner loop, the code appends "1" to the StringBuilder object sb.
After both inner loops finish, the code appends a new line separator to the StringBuilder object sb.
This process is repeated b times, resulting in b rows of "0" followed by "1" in the StringBuilder object sb.
After the first nested loop finishes, another nested loop is executed. The outer loop iterates from 0 to h-b-1, and the inner loop iterates from 0 to a-1.
Inside the inner loop, the code appends "1" to the StringBuilder object sb.
After the inner loop finishes, another inner loop is executed. This inner loop iterates from 0 to w-a-1.
Inside this inner loop, the code appends "0" to the StringBuilder object sb.
After both inner loops finish, the code appends a new line separator to the StringBuilder object sb.
This process is repeated h-b times, resulting in h-b rows of "1" followed by "0" in the StringBuilder object sb.
Finally, the code prints the contents of the StringBuilder object sb, which represents the desired output.
