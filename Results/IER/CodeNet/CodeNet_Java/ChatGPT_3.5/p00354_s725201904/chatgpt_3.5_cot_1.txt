<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input X from the user. It then calculates the remainder of X divided by 7 using the modulus operator (%). Based on the value of the remainder, it enters one of the cases in the switch statement and prints the corresponding day of the week.

In this case, the input is 1. When 1 is divided by 7, the remainder is 1. So, the code enters the case 1 and prints "fri" as the output.

<<<Output>>>
fri
