<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads an integer input from the user and stores it in variable k. 
Then it checks if k is divisible by 2 (i.e., k%2==0). If it is, it calculates the square of k/2 and prints it as the output. 
If k is not divisible by 2, it calculates the product of (k/2+1) and (k/2) and prints it as the output.
In this case, k=3 which is not divisible by 2. So, it calculates (3/2+1)*(3/2) = 2*1 = 2 and prints it as the output.
<<<Output>>>
2
