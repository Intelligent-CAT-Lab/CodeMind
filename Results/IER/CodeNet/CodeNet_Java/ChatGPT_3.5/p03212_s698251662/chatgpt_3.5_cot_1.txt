The variable n is initialized with 575 according to the input. And variable ans is initialized with 0.
It calls the dfs method with the initial value "0".
Inside the dfs method, it checks if the current value val is greater than n. If it is, it returns.
Then it checks if the current value val contains the digits 3, 5, and 7. If it does, it increments the value of ans by 1.
After that, it recursively calls the dfs method with three different values: val + "3", val + "5", and val + "7".
The dfs method is called multiple times with different values of val until the condition val > n is met.
Finally, it prints the value of ans as output.
