<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three long integers as input: a, b, and c. It then calculates the value of d as c - a - b. 
If d is greater than 0 and 4 * a * b is less than d * d, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
In this case, a = 2, b = 3, and c = 9. So, d = 9 - 2 - 3 = 4.
Since 4 * 2 * 3 = 24 is not less than 4 * 4 = 16, the condition is not satisfied and the output will be "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
