The variable N is initialized with 25 according to the input. And a 2D array numArray is initialized with all elements as 0.
It enters a nested for loop and it iterates from 0 to 9 for both i and j to initialize all elements of numArray with 0.
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from 1 to N to calculate the topNum and bottomNum for each integer i in this range.
Inside the loop, it increments the value of numArray[topNum][bottomNum] by 1.
After that, it initializes a variable res with 0.
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from 1 to N to calculate the topNum and bottomNum for each integer i in this range.
Inside the loop, it adds the value of numArray[bottomNum][topNum] to the variable res.
Finally, it prints the value of res as output, which is the final result.
