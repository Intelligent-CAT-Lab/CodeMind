<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a variable LIMIT with the value 100000010 and an array div of size LIMIT with all elements initialized to 1.
Then it enters a nested for loop. The outer loop iterates from 2 to LIMIT-1 and the inner loop iterates from i to LIMIT-1 with a step size of i.
Inside the inner loop, it increments the value of div[j] by 1 for each j that is a multiple of i.
After the nested loop finishes, it initializes a variable res with 0 and reads an integer n from input.
Then it enters a for loop that iterates from 1 to n. Inside the loop, it calculates the product of i and div[i] and adds it to res.
Finally, it prints the value of res as output.
