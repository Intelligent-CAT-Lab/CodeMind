<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes an array `div` of size `LIMIT` with all elements set to 1. Then it iterates from 2 to `LIMIT` and for each number `i`, it increments the value of `div[j]` by 1 for all multiples of `i` up to `LIMIT`. This effectively counts the number of divisors for each number from 1 to `LIMIT`.

After that, it initializes a variable `res` to 0 and reads an integer `n` from input. Then it iterates from 1 to `n` and for each number `i`, it adds `i * div[i]` to `res`. Finally, it prints the value of `res`.

So, the code calculates the sum of `i * div[i]` for all numbers from 1 to `n`.

<<<Output>>>
The return value of `4` would depend on the value of `n` and the calculated `div` array.
