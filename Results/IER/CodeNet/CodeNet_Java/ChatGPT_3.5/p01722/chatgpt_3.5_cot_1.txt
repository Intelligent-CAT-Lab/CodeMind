<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads an integer input from the user and stores it in the variable n. Then it uses a switch statement to check the value of n. If n is 0, it prints 1. If n is 1, it prints 2. If n is 2, it prints 1. Otherwise, it prints 0. In this case, the input is 0, so the code will print 1.
