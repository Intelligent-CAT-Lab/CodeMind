<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and variable k are initialized with 3 and 2 respectively according to the input. And an array num of size k is initialized with all elements as 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. The value of i modulo k is calculated and the corresponding element in the num array is incremented by 1.
After the loop finishes, it initializes a variable res with 0. Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to k-1. Inside the loop, it calculates the values of b and c as (k-a)%k. Then it checks if (b+c)%k is not equal to 0. If it is not equal to 0, it continues to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, it multiplies the values of num[a], num[b] and num[c] and adds the result to the variable res.
Finally, it prints the value of res as output.
