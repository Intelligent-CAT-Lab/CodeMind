<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and variable k are initialized with 3 and 2 respectively according to the input. 
An array num of size k is initialized with all elements as 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. 
Inside the for loop, it increments the value at index i%k in the num array.
After the loop finishes, it initializes a variable res with 0.
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to k-1.
Inside this loop, it calculates the values of variables b and c as (k-a)%k.
Then it checks if (b+c)%k is not equal to 0. If it is not equal to 0, it continues to the next iteration of the loop.
If (b+c)%k is equal to 0, it adds the product of num[a], num[b] and num[c] to the variable res.
After the loop finishes, it prints the value of res as output.
In this case, the value of res would be 3.
<<<Output>>>
3
