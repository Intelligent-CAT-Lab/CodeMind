The variable N is initialized with the value 1 according to the input. The variable count is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop with variable i starting from 1 and incrementing indefinitely.
Inside the outer for loop, it enters another for loop with variable j starting from 1 and iterating up to the value of i.
Inside the inner for loop, it checks if i is divisible by j. If it is, it increments the count variable.
After the inner for loop finishes, it checks if the count variable is equal to N. If it is, it prints the value of i and breaks out of the outer for loop.
If the count variable is not equal to N, it resets the count variable to 0 and continues to the next iteration of the outer for loop.
Since the value of N is 1, the count variable will only be equal to 1 when i is also 1. Therefore, the output will be 1.
