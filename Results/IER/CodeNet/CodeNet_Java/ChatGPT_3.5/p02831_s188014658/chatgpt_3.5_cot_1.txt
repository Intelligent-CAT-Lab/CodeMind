<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers A and B as input using the Scanner class.
Then it calls the lcm() method passing A and B as arguments.
Inside the lcm() method, it calls the gcd() method passing A and B as arguments.
Inside the gcd() method, it checks if m is less than n. If it is, it swaps the values of m and n.
Then it checks if n is equal to 0. If it is, it returns the value of m.
Otherwise, it recursively calls the gcd() method passing n and the remainder of m divided by n as arguments.
Once the gcd() method returns the greatest common divisor of A and B, the lcm() method calculates the least common multiple by multiplying A and B and dividing it by the greatest common divisor.
Finally, the lcm() method returns the least common multiple.
The lcm() method returns the least common multiple to the main() method, which then prints it as the output.
