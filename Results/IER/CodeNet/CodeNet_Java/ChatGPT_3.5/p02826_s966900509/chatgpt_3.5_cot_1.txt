<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 2 and variable mod is initialized with 998244353 according to the input.
It calculates the value of variable firstHalf as (n + 1) / 2, which is 1.
It calculates the value of variable secondHalfStart as n - firstHalf + 1, which is 2.
It initializes an array dp of size n and sets the last element of dp as 1.
It initializes an array ndp of size n.
Then it enters a for loop and iterates from 1 to n-1.
Inside the loop, it fills the ndp array with 0.
It calculates the value of variable toFirstHalf as Math.max(0, firstHalf - pos), which is 0.
It calculates the value of variable toLastHalf as n - Math.max(secondHalfStart, pos), which is 1.
It calculates the value of variable cost as toLastHalf - toFirstHalf, which is 1.
It enters a nested for loop and iterates through the dp array.
Inside the nested loop, it calculates the value of variable ways as dp[more].
If ways is 0, it continues to the next iteration.
Inside the nested loop, it enters another for loop and iterates from 0 to dp.length.
Inside the innermost loop, it calculates the value of variable nMore as more - cnt * (cost + 1).
It adds ways to ndp[nMore].
After the nested loops finish, it swaps the dp and ndp arrays.
After the for loop finishes, it initializes the variable res as 0.
It enters a for loop and iterates through the dp array.
Inside the loop, it calculates the value of variable ways as dp[more].
It calculates the value of variable res as res + ways * (1 + more).
After the for loop finishes, it prints the value of res % mod as output.
