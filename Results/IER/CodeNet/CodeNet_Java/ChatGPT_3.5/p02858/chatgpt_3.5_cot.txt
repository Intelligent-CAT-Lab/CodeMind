<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input: h, w, and t. It then calculates the values of hh and ww by dividing h and w by their greatest common divisor with t, respectively. 
Next, it initializes a Modular object with a modulus of 1e9 + 7 and a Power object with the Modular object. 
It calculates the value of way by performing several operations using the Modular and Power objects. 
Finally, it calculates the value of p by multiplying h / hh and w / ww. 
The code returns the result of pow.pow(way, p) as the output.
