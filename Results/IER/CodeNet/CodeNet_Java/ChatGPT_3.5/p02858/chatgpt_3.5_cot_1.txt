<<<Analysis>>>
The variable h, variable w and variable t are initialized with 2, 2 and 1 respectively according to the input. 
Then it calculates the values of variable hh and variable ww by dividing h and w by their greatest common divisor with t using the GCDs.gcd() method.
Then it initializes a Modular object with a modulus of 1e9 + 7 and a Power object with the Modular object.
Then it calculates the value of variable way by performing several modular arithmetic operations using the Modular and Power objects.
Finally, it calculates the value of variable p by multiplying h / hh and w / ww using the Modular object.
Then it calculates the final value of variable way by raising the value of variable way to the power of p using the Power object.
Finally, it prints the final value of variable way as output.
