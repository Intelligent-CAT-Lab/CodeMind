<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes input from the user using the Scanner class and stores it in the variable 's'. It then initializes a variable 'count' to 0.
The code then enters a for loop that iterates over each character in the string 's'. For each character, it checks if it is equal to '+'. If it is, it increments the 'count' variable by 1. Otherwise, it decrements the 'count' variable by 1.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of the 'count' variable as the output.
In this case, the input string is "+-++". The code will increment 'count' by 1 for the first character '+', decrement 'count' by 1 for the second character '-', and increment 'count' by 1 for the last two characters '+'. Therefore, the final value of 'count' will be 1.
