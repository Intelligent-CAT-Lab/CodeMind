<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input from the user and stores it in the variable `str`. It then calculates the length of the string and stores it in the variable `size`. 

The code then enters a for loop that iterates from 1 to `size-1`. It checks if the character at index `i` is equal to the character at index `i-1`. If they are equal, it prints the values of `i` and `i+1` and exits the program.

If the first for loop does not find any consecutive equal characters, the code enters a second for loop that iterates from 2 to `size-1`. It checks if the character at index `i` is equal to the character at index `i-2`. If they are equal, it prints the values of `i-1` and `i+1` and exits the program.

If both for loops do not find any consecutive equal characters, the code prints `-1 -1` as the output.

In this case, the input string is "needed". There are no consecutive equal characters in the string, so the code will print `-1 -1` as the output.
<<<Output>>>
-1 -1
