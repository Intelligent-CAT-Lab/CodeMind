<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 54 according to the input. And variable x is initialized with 1.
It enters a while loop and it keeps multiplying the value of variable x by 2 until x becomes greater than N.
In each iteration of the loop, the value of x is doubled.
After the loop finishes, it prints the value of x divided by 2 as output, which is 32.
<<<Output>>>
