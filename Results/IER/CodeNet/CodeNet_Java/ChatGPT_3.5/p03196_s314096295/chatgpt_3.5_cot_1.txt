<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and variable P are initialized with 3 and 24 respectively according to the input. 
It checks if n is equal to 1. Since n is not equal to 1, it continues to the next step.
It calculates the square root of P and adds 1 to it. The result is stored in the variable upper.
It initializes the variable ans with 1.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to upper or P, whichever is smaller. The value of variable i is also passed to variable cnt.
Inside the for loop, it checks if P is divisible by i. If it is not divisible, it continues to the next iteration of the loop.
If P is divisible by i, it enters a while loop. It increments the variable cnt and divides P by i repeatedly until P is no longer divisible by i.
It calculates the value of variable now by dividing cnt by n.
It multiplies the variable ans by i raised to the power of now.
After the loop finishes, it prints the value of variable ans as output.
