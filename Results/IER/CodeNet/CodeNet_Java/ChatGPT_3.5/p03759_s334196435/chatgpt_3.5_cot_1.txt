<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input: a, b, and c. The values of a, b, and c are 2, 4, and 6 respectively according to the input.
Then it checks if the difference between b and a is equal to the difference between c and b. If it is, it assigns the string "YES" to the variable result. Otherwise, it assigns the string "NO" to the variable result.
Finally, it prints the value of the variable result, which is "YES" in this case.
<<<Output>>>
YES
