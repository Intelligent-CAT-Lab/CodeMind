<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads the input values A, B, C, and D from the input. Then it initializes a 2D array DP with dimensions (C+1) x (D+1) and fills it with -1. It also sets DP[C][D] to 1.
Then it calls the solve() method passing A and B as arguments. Inside the solve() method, it checks if DP[a][b] is not equal to -1. If it is not equal to -1, it returns the value of DP[a][b].
Otherwise, it initializes a variable v to 0. It checks if (C - a) is greater than 0 and if (D - b) is greater than 0. If both conditions are true, it adds b multiplied by the result of calling solve(a+1, b) to v. It also adds a multiplied by the result of calling solve(a, b+1) to v. Finally, it subtracts a multiplied by b multiplied by the result of calling solve(a+1, b+1) from v.
After calculating v, it takes the modulo of v with MOD and assigns it to v. Then it assigns v to DP[a][b] and returns v.
Finally, it prints the result of calling solve(A, B).
