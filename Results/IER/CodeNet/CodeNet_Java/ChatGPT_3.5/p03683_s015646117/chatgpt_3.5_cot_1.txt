The variable n is initialized with 2 and variable m is also initialized with 2 according to the input. The variable x is an array of long type with size 100001. The variable a is initialized with 1000000007.
It checks if the absolute difference between n and m is greater than 1. If it is, it prints 0 and returns. In this case, the condition is not met, so it continues to execute the code.
It initializes the first element of array x with 1. Then it enters a for loop and iterates from 1 to 100000. In each iteration, it calculates the value of x[i] by multiplying x[i-1] with i and taking the modulo a. This is done to calculate the factorial of i modulo a. After the loop finishes, the array x contains the factorials modulo a from 0 to 100000.
It calculates the value of ans by multiplying x[n] with x[m] and taking the modulo a. This is done to calculate the product of the factorials of n and m modulo a.
Then it checks if n is equal to m. If it is, it multiplies ans by 2 and takes the modulo a. This is done to account for the case when n is equal to m, where the answer needs to be multiplied by 2.
Finally, it prints the value of ans as output.
