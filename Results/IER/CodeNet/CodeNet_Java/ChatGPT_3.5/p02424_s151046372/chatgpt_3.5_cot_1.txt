<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two long integers as input, x and y.
It then performs bitwise operations on x and y and converts the result to a binary string.
For the bitwise AND operation (x & y), it converts the result to a binary string and pads it with leading zeros to make it 32 bits long. It then prints the last 32 bits of the binary string.
For the bitwise OR operation (x | y), it performs the same steps as above and prints the last 32 bits of the binary string.
For the bitwise XOR operation (x ^ y), it performs the same steps as above and prints the last 32 bits of the binary string.
The output will be the binary representation of the results of the bitwise AND, OR, and XOR operations on x and y, each with leading zeros and only the last 32 bits.
