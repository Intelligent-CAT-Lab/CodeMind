<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads an integer N from the input. It then calculates the remainder of N divided by 500 using the modulus operator (%). It subtracts this remainder from N and prints the result as the output.
In this case, N is 5700. The remainder of 5700 divided by 500 is 200. So, the output will be 5700 - 200 = 5500.
<<<Output>>>
5500
