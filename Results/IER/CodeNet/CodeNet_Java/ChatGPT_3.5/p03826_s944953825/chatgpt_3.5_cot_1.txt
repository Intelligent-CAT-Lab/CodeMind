<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes an integer array `a` of size 4. Then it enters a for loop and iterates 4 times. In each iteration, it reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the corresponding index of the array `a`. After the loop finishes, it calculates the maximum value between `a[0]*a[1]` and `a[2]*a[3]` using the `Math.max()` function. Finally, it prints the maximum value as the output.

In this case, the input is `3 5 2 7`. So, the array `a` will be [3, 5, 2, 7]. The maximum value between `3*5` and `2*7` is 15. Therefore, the output will be 15.
