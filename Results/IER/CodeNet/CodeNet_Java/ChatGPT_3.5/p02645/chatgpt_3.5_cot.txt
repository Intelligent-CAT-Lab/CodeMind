<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input from the user using the Scanner class. It then uses the substring method to extract a substring from the input string. The substring method takes two parameters: the starting index (inclusive) and the ending index (exclusive). In this case, the substring method is called with the parameters 0 and 3, which means it will extract the characters at indices 0, 1, and 2 from the input string. Finally, the extracted substring is printed as the output.
