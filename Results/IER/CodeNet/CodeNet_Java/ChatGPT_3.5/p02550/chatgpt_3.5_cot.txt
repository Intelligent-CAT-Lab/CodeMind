<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, X and M are initialized with 6, 2 and 1001 respectively according to the input. And variable ans is initialized with 0. 
It creates a Scanner object to read the input from the user.
Then it creates a HashSet called used to store the integers that have been used.
It creates an ArrayList called A to store the integers in the sequence.
It adds the value of X to the ArrayList A and adds X to the HashSet used.
It initializes the variables K, L and ans with 0 and breakflag with false.

Then it enters a for loop that iterates from 0 to M-1 or N-1, whichever is smaller.
Inside the loop, it gets the previous value from the ArrayList A and calculates the next value by squaring the previous value and taking the modulo M.
If the next value is 0, it enters a nested for loop that iterates from 0 to i and adds the values in the ArrayList A to the variable ans.
Then it sets the breakflag to true and breaks out of the loop.
If the next value is already present in the HashSet used, it sets the variable L to i+1 and enters another nested for loop.
Inside this nested loop, it checks if the current value in the ArrayList A is equal to the next value.
If it is, it sets the variable K to the current index and breaks out of the loop.
Then it adds the values in the ArrayList A to the variable ans up to the index i.
It calculates the value of sub by adding the values in the ArrayList A from index K to index L.
It calculates the value of m by taking the modulo of (N-K) with (L-K).
Then it initializes the variable left to 0 and enters another for loop that iterates from 0 to m-1.
Inside this loop, it adds the values in the ArrayList A from index K to index K+j to the variable left.
Finally, it calculates the value of ans by adding ((N-K)/(L-K))*sub and left.
It sets the breakflag to true and breaks out of the loop.
If none of the conditions are met, it adds the next value to the HashSet used and the ArrayList A.

After the loop finishes, it checks if the breakflag is still false.
If it is, it sets the variable ans to 0 and enters a for loop that iterates over the values in the ArrayList A and adds them to the variable ans.

Finally, it prints the value of ans as the output.
