<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable X and variable M are initialized with 6, 2 and 1001 respectively according to the input. And variable used is initialized as an empty HashSet, variable A is initialized as an empty ArrayList and variable ans is initialized with 0. The variable K, L and breakflag are initialized with 0, 0 and false respectively.

Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to M-2 or N-2, whichever is smaller. In each iteration, it calculates the next value in the sequence by squaring the previous value and taking the modulo M. If the calculated value is 0, it enters a nested for loop and calculates the sum of all the elements in the ArrayList A up to the current index. It then sets the breakflag to true and breaks out of the loop.

If the calculated value is not 0, it checks if the value is already present in the HashSet used. If it is, it sets the variable L to the current index + 1 and enters another nested for loop. In this loop, it calculates the sum of all the elements in the ArrayList A up to the index where the value is first encountered. It also sets the variable K to the index where the value is first encountered. It then calculates the value of the variable sub by summing all the elements in the ArrayList A from index K to index L-1.

Next, it calculates the value of the variable m by taking the modulo of (N-K) with (L-K). It then calculates the value of the variable left by summing all the elements in the ArrayList A from index K to index K+m-1. Finally, it calculates the value of the variable ans by adding the product of ((N-K)/(L-K)) and sub to left. It sets the breakflag to true and breaks out of the loop.

If the calculated value is not 0 and is not already present in the HashSet used, it adds the value to the HashSet used and the ArrayList A.

After the loop finishes, it checks if the breakflag is false. If it is, it enters another for loop and calculates the sum of all the elements in the ArrayList A and assigns it to the variable ans.

Finally, it prints the value of the variable ans as the output.
