The variable S is initialized with 46979 according to the input. Then it calculates the number of hours by dividing S by 3600 and assigns the result to variable h. The remainder of the division is stored in variable hi. Then it calculates the number of minutes by dividing hi by 60 and assigns the result to variable m. The remainder of the division is stored in variable s. Finally, it prints the values of h, m, and s separated by colons as output, which is "13:2:59".
