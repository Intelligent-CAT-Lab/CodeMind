<<<Analysis>>>
The variable S is initialized with the value 46979.
Then it calculates the number of hours by dividing S by 3600 and assigns the result to variable h.
Next, it calculates the remaining seconds after calculating the hours by taking the modulus of S with 3600 and assigns the result to variable hi.
Then it calculates the number of minutes by dividing hi by 60 and assigns the result to variable m.
Finally, it calculates the remaining seconds after calculating the minutes by taking the modulus of S with 60 and assigns the result to variable s.
It then prints the values of h, m, and s separated by colons as the output, which would be "13:2:59".
<<<Output>>>
13:2:59
