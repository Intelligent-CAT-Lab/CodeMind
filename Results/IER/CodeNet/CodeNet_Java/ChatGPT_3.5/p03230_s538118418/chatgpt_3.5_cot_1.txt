The variable n is initialized with 3 according to the input. And variable els is initialized with 0.
It checks if n is equal to 1. If it is, it prints "Yes" and then prints "2", "1 1" and "1 1" and returns.
Since n is not equal to 1, it enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to 100000 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable canner is also initialized with 1.
Inside the for loop, it adds the current integer i to variable canner and checks if canner is equal to n. If it is, it prints "Yes" and assigns the value of i to variable els and breaks the loop.
After the loop finishes, it checks if els is equal to 0. If it is, it prints "No" and returns.
If els is not equal to 0, it prints the value of els+1.
Then it initializes a 2D array called table with dimensions els x (els+1).
It initializes the variables curstart and curend with 1 and 0 respectively.
It enters two nested for loops to fill in the values of the table array.
After filling in the values of the table array, it creates a StringBuilder object called sb.
It enters a for loop to append the values of the table array to the StringBuilder object.
Finally, it prints the StringBuilder object as output.
