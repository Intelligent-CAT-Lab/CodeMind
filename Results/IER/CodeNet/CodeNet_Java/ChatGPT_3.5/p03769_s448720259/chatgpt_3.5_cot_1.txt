The variable n is initialized with 7 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 50 to check each integer d in this range. The value of variable d is also used to calculate the value of variable pw.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the calculated variable pw is greater than n. If it is, it calls the method doit() passing n and d-1 as arguments.
Inside the method doit(), it initializes variable B and variable now with some values based on the value of variable base.
It initializes a list called bone and adds some elements to it based on the value of variable base.
It initializes variable ln with 99 and variable bi with base-1.
It enters a while loop and it checks if the condition now + (1L<<bi) <= n is true. If it is, it adds some elements to the list bone and updates the values of variables now, ln and bi.
After the while loop finishes, it converts the list bone to an array called ret and returns it.
Back in the main method, it prints the length of the array ret as output.
Then it enters a for loop to iterate through the elements of the array ret and print them as output.
Finally, it flushes the output stream.
