<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads three integers N, A, and B from the input. It then calculates the minimum value between A*N and B and assigns it to the variable ans. Finally, it prints the value of ans as the output.

In this case, N = 4, A = 2, and B = 9. Therefore, the minimum value between A*N (2*4 = 8) and B (9) is 8. So, the output will be 8.
