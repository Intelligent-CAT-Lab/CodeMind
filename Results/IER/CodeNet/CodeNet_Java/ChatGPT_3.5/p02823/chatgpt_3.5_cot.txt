<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three long integers as input: n, a, and b.
If a is greater than b, it swaps the values of a and b.
Then it checks if the difference between b and a is odd.
If it is odd, it calculates two possible answers: ans1 and ans2.
ans1 is calculated by adding a-1 to half of the difference between b and a.
Then it updates the values of a and b by subtracting them from n+1.
Again, it checks if a is greater than b and swaps their values if necessary.
ans2 is calculated in the same way as ans1.
Finally, it prints the minimum of ans1 and ans2.
If the difference between b and a is even, it simply prints the difference divided by 2.
