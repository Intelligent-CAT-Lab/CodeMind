<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input integer N and converts it to a string. It then initializes a 2D array dp with dimensions (l+1) x 3, where l is the length of the string N. The array dp is used to store the minimum number of operations required to make change for each digit in N.

The code sets the initial values of dp[0][0] and dp[0][2] to 1, indicating that it takes 1 operation to make change for 0 yen and for a value greater than 9 yen.

The code then enters a for loop that iterates from 1 to l-1. In each iteration, it calculates the minimum number of operations required to make change for the current digit c. It updates the values of dp[i][0], dp[i][1], and dp[i][2] based on the previous values of dp[i-1][0], dp[i-1][1], and dp[i-1][2].

Finally, the code adds 1 to dp[l-1][0] and prints the minimum value among dp[l-1][0], dp[l-1][1], and dp[l-1][2].
