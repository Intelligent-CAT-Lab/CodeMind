<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a class called Main with three instance variables a, b, and c. It also defines two methods: input() and output(). 

In the input() method, it creates a Scanner object to read input from the user. It reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables a, b, and c.

In the output() method, it checks if a is less than b and b is less than c. If this condition is true, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".

In the main() method, it creates an instance of the Main class, calls the input() method to read the input, and then calls the output() method to print the output.

So, given the input "1 3 8", the output will be "Yes" because 1 is less than 3 and 3 is less than 8.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
