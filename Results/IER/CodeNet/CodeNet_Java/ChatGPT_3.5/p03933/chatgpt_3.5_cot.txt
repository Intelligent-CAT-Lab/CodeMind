<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 4 and variable K is initialized with 3 according to the input. 
Then it initializes an array sins of size n+1 and calculates the sine of each angle in the range [0, 2π] with step size 2π/n and stores it in the array.
Then it initializes the variables low and high with 0 and 2π respectively.
It enters a for loop which runs for 50 iterations.
Inside the loop, it calculates the midpoint h of low and high.
Then it calls the count() function passing h and n as arguments.
Inside the count() function, it initializes the variable ret with 0.
Then it enters a for loop which runs from 1 to n-1.
Inside the loop, it initializes the variables low and high with 0 and (n-len)/2+1 respectively.
Then it enters a while loop which runs until high-low > 1.
Inside the while loop, it calculates the midpoint q of low and high.
Then it calls the function S() passing len, q and n-len-q as arguments and checks if the return value is less than or equal to h.
If it is, it updates the value of low to q, otherwise it updates the value of high to q.
After the while loop, it adds low*2 to ret.
Then it checks if low is equal to (n-len)/2 and (n-len)%2 is 0.
If it is, it decrements the value of ret by 1.
After the for loop, it asserts that ret*n % 3 is 0.
Finally, it returns the value of ret*n/3.
After the for loop, it prints the value of high with 14 decimal places.
