<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input `n` and initializes a variable `result` with 0. Then it enters a for loop that iterates from `n-1` to 1. In each iteration, it adds the value of `i` to `result`. Finally, it prints the value of `result` as the output.
In this case, the input is 2. So the for loop will iterate only once with `i` being 1. Therefore, the value of `result` will be 1.
