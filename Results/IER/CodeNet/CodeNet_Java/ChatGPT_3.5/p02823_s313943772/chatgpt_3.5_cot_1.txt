<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three long integers as input: N, A, and B.
It first checks if A is equal to B. If they are equal, it prints 0.
If A is not equal to B, it checks if the difference between B and A is even. If it is, it prints (B-A)/2.
If the difference between B and A is not even, it checks if (A-1) is less than (N-B). If it is, it prints (A+B-1)/2.
If (A-1) is not less than (N-B), it prints (N*2-A-B+1)/2.
In this case, A=2, B=4, and N=5. The difference between B and A is 2, which is even. So, it prints (B-A)/2, which is 1.
