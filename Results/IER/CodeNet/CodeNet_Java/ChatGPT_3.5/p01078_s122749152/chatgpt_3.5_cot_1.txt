<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 5 and variable K is initialized with 2 according to the input. 
Then it calculates the radian difference between each point on a circle with N points using the formula Math.PI * 2 / N and stores it in the variable radDiff.
It creates four Point objects p1f, p1t, p2f, and p2t. The coordinates of p1f are (1, 0). The coordinates of p1t are calculated using the cosine and sine of radDiff * K. The coordinates of p2f are calculated using the cosine and sine of radDiff. The coordinates of p2t are calculated using the cosine and sine of -radDiff * (K - 1).
It then calls the getIntersectPoint method passing p1f, p1t, p2f, and p2t as arguments and stores the result in the variable cross.
Inside the getIntersectPoint method, it calculates the intersection point of two lines using the given coordinates of the points and returns a new Point object with the coordinates of the intersection point.
If the intersection point is null, it returns null.
If the intersection point is not null, it calculates the area of the triangle formed by p1f, p1t, and cross using the formula (dx1 * dy2 - dx2 * dy1) / 2 and stores it in the variable area.
It also calculates the area of the triangle formed by p1f, p2f, and cross using the formula (p1f.x * p2f.y - p2f.x * p1f.y) / 2 and stores it in the variable all.
Finally, it prints the value of (all - area) * N with 9 decimal places using System.out.printf.
