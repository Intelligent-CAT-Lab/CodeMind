The variable m and variable n are initialized with 2 and 3 respectively according to the input.
Then it calls the power method passing the values of m, n and modP as arguments.
Inside the power method, it initializes the variable ret with 1.
Then it enters a for loop where it iterates until e becomes 0. In each iteration, it divides e by 2.
Inside the loop, it checks if e is odd (e % 2 != 0). If it is, it multiplies ret with a and takes the modulo with modP.
Then it multiplies a with itself and takes the modulo with modP.
After the loop finishes, it returns the final value of ret as output.
In this case, the loop iterates 2 times. In the first iteration, e becomes 1 and ret becomes 2. In the second iteration, e becomes 0 and ret remains 2.
So, the output will be 2.
