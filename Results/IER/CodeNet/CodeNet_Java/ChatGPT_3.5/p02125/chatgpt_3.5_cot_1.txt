<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 2 according to the input. 
It checks if N is equal to 1. If it is, it prints 1 and returns.
Otherwise, it initializes variable c with 1.
Then it enters a while loop and multiplies c by 2 until 2 * c - 1 is greater than N.
After the loop, it subtracts 1 from c.
Then it creates a PrintWriter object and prints the number of set bits in the binary representation of c.
Finally, it closes the PrintWriter.
