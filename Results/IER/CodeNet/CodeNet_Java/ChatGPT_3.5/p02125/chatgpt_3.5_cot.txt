<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads an integer N from the input. If N is equal to 1, it prints 1 and returns. Otherwise, it initializes a variable c with the value 1. Then it enters a while loop that continues as long as 2 * c - 1 is less than or equal to N. In each iteration of the loop, it multiplies c by 2. After the loop, it subtracts 1 from c. Then it creates a PrintWriter object to print the output. It prints the number of set bits in the binary representation of c using the Long.bitCount() method. Finally, it closes the PrintWriter.

To determine the return value of `2`, we need to know the value of N.

<<<Output>>>
The return value of `2` depends on the value of N.
