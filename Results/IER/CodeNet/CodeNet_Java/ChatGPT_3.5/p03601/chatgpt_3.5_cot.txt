<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes 6 integers as input: a, b, c, d, e, and f. These values are assigned to variables a, b, c, d, e, and f respectively.
Then, the code initializes variables waterX, ansWater, and ansSugar with 0, 100, and 0 respectively.
The code enters a while loop that runs as long as 100 * a * waterX is less than or equal to f.
Inside this while loop, another while loop runs as long as 100 * a * waterX + 100 * b * waterY is less than or equal to f.
Inside this second while loop, the code calculates the value of water as 100 * a * waterX + 100 * b * waterY.
Then, the code enters another while loop that runs as long as water + c * sugarX is less than or equal to f.
Inside this third while loop, another while loop runs as long as water + c * sugarX + d * sugarY is less than or equal to f.
Inside this fourth while loop, the code calculates the value of sugar as c * sugarX + d * sugarY.
If the condition sugar * (100 + e) <= e * (water + sugar) is true, the code checks if sugar * (ansWater + ansSugar) >= ansSugar * (water + sugar).
If this condition is true, the code updates the values of ansWater and ansSugar with the current values of water and sugar respectively.
Finally, the code increments the values of sugarY and sugarX in the inner while loops, and waterY in the second while loop, and waterX in the first while loop.
After all the while loops finish, the code prints the values of ansWater + ansSugar and ansSugar as the output.
