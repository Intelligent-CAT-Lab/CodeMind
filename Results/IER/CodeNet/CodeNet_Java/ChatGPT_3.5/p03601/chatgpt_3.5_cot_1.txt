The variables a, b, c, d, e, and f are initialized with the values 1, 2, 10, 20, 15, and 200 respectively according to the input.
The code then enters a while loop that iterates until the condition 100 * a * waterX <= f is false. Inside this loop, another while loop is executed until the condition 100 * a * waterX + 100 * b * waterY <= f is false. Inside this loop, a nested while loop is executed until the condition water + c * sugarX + d * sugarY <= f is false. Inside this nested loop, another nested while loop is executed until the condition sugar * (100 + e) <= e * (water + sugar) is false. If this condition is true, it checks if sugar * (ansWater + ansSugar) >= ansSugar * (water + sugar) is true. If this condition is also true, it updates the values of ansWater and ansSugar with the current values of water and sugar respectively. After each iteration of the nested loops, the variables sugarY and sugarX are incremented. After each iteration of the second while loop, the variable waterY is incremented. After each iteration of the first while loop, the variable waterX is incremented. Once the condition 100 * a * waterX <= f is false, the code prints the values of ansWater + ansSugar and ansSugar as the output.
