<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a 2D character array called "map" with a predefined pattern. It also defines a method called "rotate90" that rotates a specific section of the map by 90 degrees clockwise. 

In the "solve" method, it creates a Scanner object to read input. It then enters a while loop that continues as long as there is more input. Inside the loop, it reads a string from the input. 

For each character in the string, it checks its ASCII value to determine the action to perform. If the ASCII value is 85, it performs a rotation on the "U" face of the map. If the ASCII value is 68, it performs a rotation on the "D" face. If the ASCII value is 82, it performs a rotation on the "R" face. If the ASCII value is 76, it performs a rotation on the "L" face. If the ASCII value is 70, it performs a rotation on the "F" face. If the ASCII value is 66, it performs a rotation on the "B" face. 

After performing the rotation, it prints the updated map. 

In this case, the input is "R", so it will perform a rotation on the "R" face of the map. This will result in the following updated map:

..rr....
..rr....
gyybyyww
gyybyyww
..oo....
..oo....

<<<Output>>>
..rr....
..rr....
gyybyyww
gyybyyww
..oo....
..oo....
