<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to variable x. It also initializes variable i with 1.
Then it enters a for loop. The loop condition is `i * (i + 1) / 2 < x`. This condition checks if the sum of the first i natural numbers is less than x.
Inside the loop, it increments the value of i by 1 in each iteration.
When the loop condition becomes false, it means that the sum of the first i natural numbers is greater than or equal to x.
Finally, it prints the value of i as the output.
In this case, the loop will iterate until i = 3, because 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, which is equal to x.
