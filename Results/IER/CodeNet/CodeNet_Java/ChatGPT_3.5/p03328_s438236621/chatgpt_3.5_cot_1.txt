<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers a and b as input. It then calls the solve() method passing a and b as arguments. Inside the solve() method, it calculates the sum of the arithmetic series from a to b using the formula (b - a + 1) * (b - a) / 2. It then subtracts b from the sum and returns the result. Finally, the main method prints the output of the solve() method.

In this case, a = 8 and b = 13. So, the solve() method will calculate the sum of the arithmetic series from 8 to 13, which is (13 - 8 + 1) * (13 - 8) / 2 = 6 * 5 / 2 = 15. Then it subtracts 13 from the sum, resulting in 15 - 13 = 2. Therefore, the output of the code execution will be 2.
