<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string as input and converts each character in the string to its opposite case. It iterates through each character in the string and checks its case using the `Character.isLowerCase()` and `Character.isUpperCase()` methods. If the character is lowercase, it converts it to uppercase using `Character.toUpperCase()`. If the character is uppercase, it converts it to lowercase using `Character.toLowerCase()`. If the character is neither lowercase nor uppercase, it leaves it unchanged. Finally, it prints the modified string.

For the given input "fAIR, LATER, OCCASIONALLY CLOUDY.", the code will convert each character to its opposite case, resulting in the output "Fair, later, occasionally cloudy."

<<<Output>>>
Fair, later, occasionally cloudy.
