<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string as input and stores it in variable n. Then it calculates the length of the string and stores it in variable num.
Then it enters a for loop and iterates from 0 to num-1. Inside the loop, it checks each character of the string.
If the character is lowercase, it converts it to uppercase and prints it.
If the character is uppercase, it converts it to lowercase and prints it.
If the character is neither lowercase nor uppercase, it prints it as it is.
After the loop finishes, it prints a new line.
So, the code converts all lowercase letters to uppercase and all uppercase letters to lowercase, while leaving other characters unchanged.
<<<Output>>>
Fair, lATER, occasionally cloudy.
