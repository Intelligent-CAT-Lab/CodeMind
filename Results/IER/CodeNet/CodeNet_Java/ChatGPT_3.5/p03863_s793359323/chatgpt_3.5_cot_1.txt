<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string input and checks if the first character of the string is equal to the last character. If they are equal, it checks if the length of the string is even or odd. If the length is even, it prints "First", otherwise it prints "Second". If the first and last characters are not equal, it checks if the length of the string is odd or even. If the length is odd, it prints "First", otherwise it prints "Second".

In this case, the input string is "aba". The first and last characters are equal, so it checks if the length of the string is even or odd. Since the length is odd, it prints "First".

<<<Output>>>
First
