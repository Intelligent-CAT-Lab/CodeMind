<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, a and b. It then calculates the difference between b and a and assigns it to the variable n. 
Next, it calculates the sum of the numbers from 1 to n using the formula n * (n + 1) / 2. It subtracts b from this sum and prints the result as the output.
In this case, the difference between 8 and 13 is 5. So, the sum of the numbers from 1 to 5 is 15. Subtracting 13 from 15 gives us 2.
<<<Output>>>
