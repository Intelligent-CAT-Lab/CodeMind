<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, a and b. It then calculates the difference between b and a and assigns it to the variable n. 
Next, it calculates the sum of the numbers from 1 to n using the formula n * (n + 1) / 2. 
Finally, it subtracts b from the sum and prints the result as the output.
In this case, a is 8 and b is 13. So, n = 13 - 8 = 5. 
The sum of the numbers from 1 to 5 is 5 * (5 + 1) / 2 = 15. 
Subtracting b (13) from the sum (15) gives the output -2.
<<<Output>>>
-2
