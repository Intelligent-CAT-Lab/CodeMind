<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 10 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to the square root of n to check each integer i in this range. If the square of i is equal to n, it prints (i-1)*2 and returns.
If the square of i is not equal to n, it enters another for loop and it iterates from the square root of n to 1. If n is divisible by i, it prints (i-1) + (n/i) - 1 and breaks the loop.
If none of the conditions are met, it does not print anything.
