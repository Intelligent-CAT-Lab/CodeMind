<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads four integers n1, n2, n3, and n4 from the input. Then it creates an array cnt of size 10 to keep track of the count of each digit. It increments the count of each digit based on the values of n1, n2, n3, and n4.

After that, it checks if the count of digits 1, 9, 7, and 4 is equal to 1. If all four digits have a count of 1, it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".

In this case, the input is "1 7 9 4", so the count of digits 1, 9, 7, and 4 will be 1. Therefore, the output will be "YES".
<<<Output>>>
YES
