<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input: a, b, and c. It then checks if the sum of a and b is equal to 0. If it is, it prints -1 and exits the program. Otherwise, it enters a for loop that iterates from 0 to 120. Inside the loop, it calculates the value of when as 60 multiplied by i plus c. It then calculates the number of times the sum of a and b can fit into when and stores it in the variable roop. If the value of when falls within the range of roop multiplied by the sum of a and b and roop multiplied by the sum of a and b plus a, it prints the value of when and exits the program. If the loop finishes without finding a valid value for when, it prints -1 and exits the program.
