<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads three integers from the input using the Scanner class. It assigns the first integer to variable a, the second integer to variable b, and the third integer to variable c. Then it prints the values of c, a, and b in that order, separated by spaces.
In this case, the input is "1 2 3". The first integer is 1, which is assigned to variable a. The second integer is 2, which is assigned to variable b. The third integer is 3, which is assigned to variable c. Then it prints the values of c, a, and b, which are 3, 1, and 2 respectively.
<<<Output>>>
3 1 2
