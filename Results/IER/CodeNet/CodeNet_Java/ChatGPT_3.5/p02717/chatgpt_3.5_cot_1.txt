<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads three integers from the input using the Scanner class. The first integer is assigned to variable a, the second integer is assigned to variable b, and the third integer is assigned to variable c. Then, it prints the values of variables c, a, and b separated by spaces. 
In this case, the input is "1 2 3", so variable a will be assigned the value 1, variable b will be assigned the value 2, and variable c will be assigned the value 3. Then, it prints "3 1 2" as the output.
<<<Output>>>
3 1 2
