<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers A, B, and K as input. It then initializes an empty TreeSet called nums to store the numbers.

In the first for loop, it iterates K times. If A + i is greater than B, it breaks out of the loop. Otherwise, it adds A + i to the nums set.

In the second for loop, it iterates from K - 1 to 0. If B - i is less than A, it breaks out of the loop. Otherwise, it adds B - i to the nums set.

Finally, it prints each element in the nums set.

Given the input 3 8 2, the code will add the numbers 3, 4, 7, and 8 to the nums set. The set will be printed in ascending order.

<<<Output>>>
3
4
7
8
