<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 2 according to the input. And variable starth is initialized with 0.
It checks if N is divisible by 4. Since 2 is not divisible by 4, it goes to the else block and assigns the value of 3*N/4+1 to variable starth, which is 2.
Then it enters a nested for loop. The outer loop iterates from starth to 3500 and the inner loop iterates from 1 to 3*N/4.
Inside the nested loop, it checks if the condition 4*h*w-N*w-N*h==0 is true. If it is true, it breaks out of the inner loop.
Then it calculates the value of variable n using the formula N*h*w/(4*h*w-N*w-N*h).
If the value of n is greater than 0 and the condition 4*h*n*w==N*(h*n+n*w+h*w) is true, it prints the values of h, n, and w and returns from the method.
If no such values of h, n, and w are found, it continues to the next iteration of the outer loop.
Since the outer loop starts from 2 and the inner loop starts from 1, the condition 4*h*w-N*w-N*h==0 will never be true and the code will not print anything.
