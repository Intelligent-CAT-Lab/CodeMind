<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 1 according to the input. 
Then it checks the remainder of n divided by 7. If the remainder is 1, it prints "fri". If the remainder is 2, it prints "sat". If the remainder is 3, it prints "sun". If the remainder is 4, it prints "mon". If the remainder is 5, it prints "tue". If the remainder is 6, it prints "wed". Otherwise, it prints "thu".
In this case, the remainder of 1 divided by 7 is 1, so it prints "fri".
<<<Output>>>
fri
