<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n, variable a and variable b are initialized with 10, 3 and 5 respectively according to the input. And variable max and variable min are initialized with 0.
It checks if the sum of variable a and variable b is greater than or equal to variable n. If it is, it subtracts variable n from the sum and assigns the result to variable min.
Then it assigns the minimum value between variable a and variable b to variable max.
Finally, it prints the values of variable max and variable min as output, which are 5 and 0 respectively.
<<<Output>>>
