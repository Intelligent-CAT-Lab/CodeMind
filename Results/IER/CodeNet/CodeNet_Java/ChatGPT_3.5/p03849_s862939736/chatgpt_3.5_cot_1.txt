<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a class Task with a method solve that takes a FastScanner object and a PrintWriter object as input. Inside the solve method, it reads a long integer N from the input using the nextLong() method of the FastScanner class. Then it calls the func() method with N as both arguments and prints the returned value.

The func() method is a recursive function that takes two long integers S and X as input. It first checks if S is equal to 0. If it is, it returns 1. Otherwise, it checks if the TreeMap dp contains a TreeMap with key S. If it does not, it creates a new TreeMap and adds it to dp. If it does, it checks if the TreeMap with key S contains a value with key X. If it does, it returns the value. 

If the value is not found in the TreeMap, the function calculates the value by recursively calling itself with modified arguments. It calculates the value by taking the modulo of the sum of the results of three recursive calls to func() with modified arguments. The modified arguments are obtained by dividing S and X by 2, subtracting 1 from S and X and dividing the result by 2, and subtracting 2 from S and dividing the result by 2. The calculated value is then added to the TreeMap with key X and returned.

In the main method, an instance of the Task class is created and the solve method is called with a FastScanner object and a PrintWriter object as arguments. The solve method reads the input, calls the func() method, and prints the result.
