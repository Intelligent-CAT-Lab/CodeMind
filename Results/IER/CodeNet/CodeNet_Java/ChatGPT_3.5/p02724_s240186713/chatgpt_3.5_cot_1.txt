The variable x is initialized with 1024 according to the input. And variable count is initialized with 0.
It enters a while loop and it continues to execute until the condition is false. Inside the loop, it checks if x is greater than or equal to 500. If it is, it subtracts 500 from x and adds 1000 to count. If x is not greater than or equal to 500, it checks if x is greater than or equal to 5. If it is, it subtracts 5 from x and adds 5 to count. If neither condition is true, it breaks out of the loop.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable count as output, which is 2000.
<<<Output>>>
2000
