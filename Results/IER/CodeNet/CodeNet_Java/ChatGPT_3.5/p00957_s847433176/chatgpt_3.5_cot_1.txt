The variable l and variable k are initialized with 5 and 3 respectively according to the input. And an array dp of size MAX_L + 1 is initialized with all elements as 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to 4 to check each integer i in this range. 
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of dp[i] based on the values of dp[i-2] and dp[i-k-1]. If i-k-1 is less than 0, then num is set to 0, otherwise it is set to dp[i-k-1].
Then dp[i] is calculated as dp[i-2] + num + 1.
After the loop finishes, it calculates the value of dp[l] based on the values of dp[l-1] and dp[l-k]. If l is greater than or equal to k, then dp[l-k] is added to dp[l], otherwise 0 is added.
Finally, it prints the value of dp[l] as output, which is 5.

5
