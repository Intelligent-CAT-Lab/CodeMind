<<<Analysis>>>
The variable M is initialized with 21 according to the input. 
Then it calculates the value of variable result by subtracting M from 24 and adding 24 to it. 
So, result = (24 - 21) + 24 = 3 + 24 = 27.
Finally, it prints the value of variable result as output, which is 27.
<<<Output>>>
