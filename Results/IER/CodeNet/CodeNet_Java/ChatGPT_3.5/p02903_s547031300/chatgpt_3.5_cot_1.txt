The variables h, w, a, and b are initialized with 3, 3, 1, and 1 respectively according to the input. The 2D array "array" is initialized with dimensions h x w, which is 3 x 3. 

The code then enters a nested for loop to fill the array with 1s and 0s. The outer loop iterates over the rows of the array (i), and the inner loop iterates over the columns of the array (j). 

For each row, if the row index (i) is greater than or equal to b, it fills the first a columns of that row with 1s using the Arrays.fill() method. Otherwise, it fills the last (w - a) columns of that row with 1s. 

After filling the array, the code enters another nested for loop to print the array. It iterates over each row and column of the array and prints the corresponding element. After printing each row, it prints a new line.
