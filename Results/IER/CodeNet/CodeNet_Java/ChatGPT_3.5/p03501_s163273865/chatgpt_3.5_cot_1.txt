<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads three integers N, A, and B from the input. It then calculates the product of N and A and stores it in the variable pp. 
Next, it checks if pp is greater than B. If it is, it prints B. Otherwise, it prints pp.
In this case, N=7, A=17, and B=120. So, pp = 7 * 17 = 119.
Since pp is less than B, the code will print pp, which is 119.
<<<Output>>>
119
