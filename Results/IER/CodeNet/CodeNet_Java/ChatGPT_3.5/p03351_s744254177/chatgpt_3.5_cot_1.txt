<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four integers as input: a, b, c, and d. The input values are 4, 7, 9, and 3 respectively.
It then checks two conditions:
1. If the absolute difference between a and c is less than or equal to d, or
2. If the absolute difference between a and b is less than or equal to d and the absolute difference between b and c is less than or equal to d.
If either of these conditions is true, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
In this case, the absolute difference between a and c is 5, which is greater than d. Also, the absolute difference between a and b is 3 and the absolute difference between b and c is 2, both of which are less than or equal to d. Therefore, the condition in the if statement is true and the output will be "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
