<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 7 according to the input. 
The code then calls the method `permutationWhoseNumberOfIncreasingSequenceIsK(n)` passing the value of n as an argument. 
Inside the method `permutationWhoseNumberOfIncreasingSequenceIsK`, it calculates the value of `cur` as the highest power of 2 less than or equal to n+1 minus 1. 
Then it initializes an empty list `list`. 
It iterates from 0 to the number of bits set in `cur` and adds the value of `i` to the list. 
Then it initializes a variable `p` with the number of bits set in `cur`. 
Then it iterates from the number of bits set in `cur` minus 1 to 0. 
Inside the loop, it calculates the value of `x` as 2 raised to the power of `d`. 
If `cur + x` is less than or equal to `K`, it adds `x` to `cur` and adds `p` to the list at index `d`. 
Finally, it returns the list. 
The code then prints the size of the list multiplied by 2. 
Then it prints the elements of the list followed by the elements of the list incremented by 1.
