<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, a and b. It then calculates the sum of a and b and assigns it to the variable k. 
If k is divisible by 2 (i.e., k % 2 == 0), it prints the result of k divided by 2. Otherwise, it prints "IMPOSSIBLE".
In this case, a = 2 and b = 16. The sum of a and b is 18. Since 18 is divisible by 2, the code will print 9 as the output.
<<<Output>>>
9
