The variable n, variable x and variable m are initialized with 6, 2 and 1001 respectively according to the input. 
An ArrayList ar and a HashMap hash are initialized.
The value of x is added to the ArrayList ar and the key-value pair (x, 1) is added to the HashMap hash.
Then a for loop is executed from i = 2 to n.
Inside the loop, the value of prev is updated to (prev * prev) % m.
The value of prev is added to the ArrayList ar and the key-value pair (prev, i) is added to the HashMap hash.
If the HashMap hash already contains the key prev, then the values of index, index1, and value are updated accordingly.
The sum is updated by adding the value of prev.
After the loop, if the value of index is still -1, then the sum is printed as the output.
Otherwise, the value of rem is calculated as (n - index + 1).
The value of tmp is calculated by summing up all the elements in the ArrayList ar before the index.
The value of remsum is calculated as (sum - tmp).
The value of count is calculated as (rem / (index1 - index)).
The sum is updated by adding ((count - 1) * remsum).
The value of extrarem is calculated as (rem % (index1 - index)).
The value of prev is updated to the element at index (index - 1) in the ArrayList ar.
A for loop is executed from i = 0 to extrarem - 1.
Inside the loop, the sum is updated by adding the value of prev.
The value of prev is updated to (prev * prev) % m.
Finally, the sum is printed as the output.
