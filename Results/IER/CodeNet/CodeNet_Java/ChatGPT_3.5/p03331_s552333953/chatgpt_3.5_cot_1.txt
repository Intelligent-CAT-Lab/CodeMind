The variable N is initialized with 15 according to the input. Then two arrays a and b of size N are initialized. The elements of array a are assigned values from 1 to N-1 and the elements of array b are assigned values from N-1 to 1. Then a new array c of size N is initialized. The elements of array c are calculated by calling the sum() method with corresponding elements from arrays a and b as arguments. The sum() method calculates the sum of the digits of the two input numbers and returns the sum. After calculating the elements of array c, the array is sorted in ascending order using the Arrays.sort() method. Finally, the second element of array c is printed as the output.
