<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers n and k as input. It then calculates the total sum and subtracts a certain value from it to get the final answer. The total sum is calculated using the calcSum() method, which multiplies k*(k+1)/2 with (k+1)^(n-1) and then multiplies it with n. The subtracted value is calculated using the calcSubtract() method, which uses dynamic programming to calculate the sum of the product of each index and its corresponding value in the last array. Finally, the code prints the final answer.
In this case, n=2 and k=2. 
The total sum is calculated as follows:
sum = 2*(2+1)/2 * (2+1)^(2-1) * 2 = 6 * 3 * 2 = 36
The subtracted value is calculated as follows:
last = [1, 0, 0, ..., 0] (8000 elements)
cur = [0, 0, 0, ..., 0] (8000 elements)
For i = 2 to 1:
    For j = 0 to 7999:
        For t = 0 to 2:
            to = t > i ? j : j + (j + t) / i
            cur[to] = cur[to] + last[j]
    Swap last and cur arrays
ans = 0
For i = 0 to 7999:
    ans = ans + i * last[i]
The final answer is calculated as follows:
ans = total - subtracted = 36 - ans = 36 - 0 = 36
