<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read input from the console. It then reads a double value from the input and assigns it to the variable l. 
Next, it calculates the cube of l divided by 3 using the Math.pow() method and prints the result.
The input value is 3, so the calculation would be (3/3)^3 = 1^3 = 1.
Therefore, the output would be 1.
