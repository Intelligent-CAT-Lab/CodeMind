The variable n is initialized with 3 and variable k is initialized with 2 according to the input.
The code then calls the solve() method passing n and k as arguments.
Inside the solve() method, a 3D array wayNums is initialized with dimensions (n+1) x (n+1) x (k+1).
The value at index [0][0][0] of wayNums is set to 1.
Then, a nested for loop is used to iterate through the indices of wayNums.
For each index (i, j, p), the value at that index is calculated using the following formula:
wayNums[i][j][p] = (2j+1) * wayNums[i-1][j][p-2j] + (j+1)^2 * wayNums[i-1][j+1][p-2j] + wayNums[i-1][j-1][p-2j]
The values of j and p are used to access the corresponding indices in wayNums.
The method getWayNum() is used to handle cases where the indices are out of bounds.
After the nested for loop finishes, the value at index [n][0][k] of wayNums is returned as the output.
In this case, wayNums[3][0][2] = 5.
