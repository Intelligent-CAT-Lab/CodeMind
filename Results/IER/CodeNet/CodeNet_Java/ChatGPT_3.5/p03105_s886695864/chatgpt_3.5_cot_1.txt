<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integer inputs a, b, and c using the Scanner class.
It initializes a variable count with 0.
Then it enters a while loop with the condition b >= a.
Inside the loop, it increments the count by 1, subtracts a from b, and checks if the count is greater than or equal to c. If it is, it breaks out of the loop.
Finally, it prints the value of count as the output.
In this case, the value of a is 2, b is 11, and c is 4.
The loop will run 5 times because b is initially 11 and a is 2, so it can be subtracted 5 times before becoming less than a.
Therefore, the output will be 5.
