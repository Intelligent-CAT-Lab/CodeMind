<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input from the user and stores it in the variable n. It then checks if the value of n is between 1 and 9 (inclusive). If it is, it calculates the cube of n and stores it in the variable i. Finally, it prints the value of i as the output.

In this case, the value of n is 2, which falls within the range [1, 9]. Therefore, the code will calculate the cube of 2, which is 8. The output will be 8.
<<<Output>>>
8
