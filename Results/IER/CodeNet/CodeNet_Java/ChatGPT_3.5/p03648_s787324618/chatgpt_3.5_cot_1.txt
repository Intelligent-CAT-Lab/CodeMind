<<<Analysis>>>
The variable K is initialized with 0 according to the input. And variable N is initialized with 50.
It prints the value of N, which is 50.
Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 49. For each iteration, it calculates the value of variable r using the formula: r = N - 1 - i + K / N + (K % N > i ? 1 : 0).
Finally, it prints the value of r for each iteration.
