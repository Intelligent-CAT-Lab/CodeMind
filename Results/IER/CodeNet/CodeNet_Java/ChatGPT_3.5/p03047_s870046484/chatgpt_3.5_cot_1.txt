<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers from the input using the Scanner class and assigns them to variables a and b. Then it calculates the value of ans by subtracting b-1 from a. Finally, it prints the value of ans as the output.
In this case, the input is "3 2", so a will be assigned the value 3 and b will be assigned the value 2. The calculation of ans will be 3 - (2-1) = 2. Therefore, the output will be 2.
