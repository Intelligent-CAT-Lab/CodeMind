<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string input and stores it in variable a. Then it splits the string into an array of individual characters and stores it in variable b. The length of the string is stored in variable c.
If the length of the string is 3, it swaps the first and last characters in the array b.
Finally, it prints each character in the array b.
In this case, the input string is "abc" which has a length of 3. So, the first and last characters are swapped. The output will be "cba".
<<<Output>>>
cba
