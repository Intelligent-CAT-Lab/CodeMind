<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads three long integers k, a, and b from the input. It then checks three conditions:
1. If k is less than or equal to a, it prints 1.
2. If a - b is less than or equal to 0, it prints -1.
3. Otherwise, it calculates the number of steps required to reach k from b, with each step increasing the value by a - b. It then prints the number of steps plus 1.

In this case, k = 4000, a = 2000, and b = 500. Since k is greater than a, it does not satisfy the first condition. The second condition is also not satisfied since a - b is greater than 0. Therefore, it calculates the number of steps required to reach 4000 from 500, with each step increasing the value by 2000 - 500 = 1500. The number of steps is (4000 - 500 - 1) / (2000 - 500) = 2. Therefore, the output is 2 + 1 = 3.
