<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 2 according to the input. 
Then it creates an instance of the PrimeGenerator class and initializes the array a with size (n+2) x (n+2).
It initializes two arrays d1 and d2 with size 2n+3 and fills them with prime numbers generated by the PrimeGenerator class.
Then it initializes the elements of array a based on the values of d1 and d2.
After that, it enters a nested for loop to calculate the values of the remaining elements of array a.
For each element a[i][j], if (i+j) is odd, it calculates the least common multiple (lcm) of a[i+mx[x]][j+my[x]] for x in [0, 3] and stores it in a[i][j].
Then it increments a[i][j] by 1.
If a[i][j] is greater than 1e15, it prints the values of i and j and throws a RuntimeException.
Finally, it prints the elements of array a.
