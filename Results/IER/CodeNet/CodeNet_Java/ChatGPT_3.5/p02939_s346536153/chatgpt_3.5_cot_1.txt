<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string as input and initializes a variable ans with 0. It then enters a for loop that iterates over each character of the string. 
Inside the loop, it checks if the current character is equal to the next character. If it is, it increments the variable ans and skips the next character by incrementing the loop variable i by 2. 
If the current character is not equal to the next character, it simply increments the variable ans. 
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of ans as the output. 
In this case, the string is "aabbaa". The first two characters "aa" are equal, so the variable ans is incremented by 1. 
The next two characters "bb" are also equal, so the variable ans is incremented by 1 again. 
Finally, the last two characters "aa" are equal, so the variable ans is incremented by 1 again. 
Therefore, the final value of ans is 3.
