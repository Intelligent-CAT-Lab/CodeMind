<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads input from the user using the parseStdin() method. It then processes the input character by character. For each character, it calls the Encode() method in the MyConv class to convert the character into a binary string. It concatenates all the binary strings together to form a single string called "work". 

Next, it checks if the length of "work" is divisible by 5. If not, it appends zeros to the end of "work" until its length is divisible by 5.

Then, it splits the "work" string into substrings of length 5 and calls the Decode() method in the MyConv class to convert each substring back into a character. It concatenates all the characters together to form a single string called "out".

Finally, it prints the "out" string as the output.
