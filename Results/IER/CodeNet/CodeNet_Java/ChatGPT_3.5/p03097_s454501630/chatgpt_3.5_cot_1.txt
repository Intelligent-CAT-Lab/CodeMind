<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input: n, a, and b. It then checks if the number of different bits between a and b is even. If it is, it prints "NO" and returns. Otherwise, it prints "YES" and proceeds to solve the problem.

The code initializes an ArrayList called "ans" to store the answer. It then calls the solve() method passing in the values of a, b, and (1 << n) - 1 as arguments.

The solve() method is a recursive function that solves the problem. It takes three arguments: A, B, and mask. The base case is when the number of set bits in the mask is 1. In this case, it adds A and B to the "ans" ArrayList and returns.

Otherwise, it finds the rightmost different bit between A and B by iterating over the bits of (A ^ B) & mask. It then updates the mask by XORing it with (1 << div), where div is the position of the rightmost different bit.

It then recursively calls solve() twice: once with A and C as arguments, and once with C ^ (1 << div) and B as arguments. This effectively splits the problem into two subproblems.

After the solve() method finishes, the code prints the elements of the "ans" ArrayList followed by the value of b.
