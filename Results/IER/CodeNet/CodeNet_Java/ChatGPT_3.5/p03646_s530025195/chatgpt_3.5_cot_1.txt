The variable K is initialized with 0 according to the input. 
Inside the solve() method, an array a of size N (50) is created and filled with the value N - 1 + K / N, which is 49.
Then, a nested for loop is used to modify the values of the array a. The outer loop iterates K % N (0) times, and the inner loop iterates over each element of the array a.
In each iteration of the inner loop, if the current index j is equal to the current iteration i, the value at index j is increased by N. Otherwise, the value at index j is decreased by 1.
Finally, the method returns a formatted string that includes the length of the array a and the elements of the array joined by a space.
The main method reads the input value K and calls the solve() method, then prints the returned string as the output.
