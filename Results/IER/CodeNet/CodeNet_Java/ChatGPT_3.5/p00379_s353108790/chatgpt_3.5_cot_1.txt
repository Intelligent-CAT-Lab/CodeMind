<<<Analysis>>>
The variable a, variable n and variable m are initialized with 16, 2 and 1000 respectively according to the input. And variable an is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 1000 to check each integer x in this range. The value of variable x is also passed to variable y.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger x by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a for loop and adding it to variable y.
Then it calculates y_plus_a by adding variable a to variable y.
Then it calculates xx by multiplying variable y_plus_a by itself n times.
Then it checks if the calculated variable xx is equal to x. If it does, it increments the value of variable an by 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable an as output.
