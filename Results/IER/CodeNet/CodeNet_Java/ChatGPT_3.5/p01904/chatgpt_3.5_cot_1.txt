<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 1 according to the input. 
It reads two arrays sqi and sqj of size n from the input. The values of sqi and sqj are calculated based on the values of x and d read from the input.
It creates an array pp of size n*4 and populates it with Vector2 objects based on the values of sqi and sqj arrays.
It calculates the convex hull of the pp array and stores it in the v array.
It calculates the angles between consecutive points in the v array and stores them in the theta array.
It sorts the theta array in ascending order.
It initializes the min variable with positive infinity.
It iterates over the theta array and for each angle, it performs a ternary search to find the minimum area of the convex hull.
Finally, it prints the minimum area with 6 decimal places.
