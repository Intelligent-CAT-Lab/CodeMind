<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads an integer n from the input. Then it initializes two arrays sqi and sqj with size n. It then enters a for loop that iterates from 1 to n-1. In each iteration, it reads two integers x and d from the input. It calculates the values of sqi[i] and sqj[i] based on the values of sqi[x] and sqj[x] and the value of d. It then constructs an array pp of size n*4 and fills it with Vector2 objects based on the values of sqi and sqj. It then calls the convexHull method of the Vector2 class to get an array v of Vector2 objects representing the convex hull of the points in pp. It then calculates the angles between consecutive points in v and stores them in an array theta. It sorts the array theta in ascending order. It then initializes a variable min with positive infinity. It enters a for loop that iterates over the elements of theta. In each iteration, it initializes variables l and r with the current angle and the next angle in theta. It then enters a while loop that iterates 90 times. In each iteration, it calculates two new angles x1 and x2 based on l and r. It then checks if the area of the convex hull with angle x1 is smaller than the area of the convex hull with angle x2. If it is, it updates r with x2. Otherwise, it updates l with x1. After the while loop, it calculates the area of the convex hull with angle (r + l) / 2 and updates min if the calculated area is smaller than min. Finally, it prints the value of min with 6 decimal places.
