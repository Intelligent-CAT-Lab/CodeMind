<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string as input and converts it into a character array. It then sorts the character array in ascending order. 
After that, it checks if there are any consecutive characters in the sorted array that are the same. If it finds any, it sets the boolean variable bl to false and breaks out of the loop.
Finally, it prints "yes" if bl is true, indicating that there are no consecutive repeated characters in the input string. Otherwise, it prints "no".

In this case, the input string is "uncopyrightable". After converting it into a character array and sorting it, we get the array ['a', 'b', 'c', 'e', 'i', 'l', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'r', 't', 'u', 'y'].
There are no consecutive repeated characters in this sorted array, so the output will be "yes".

<<<Output>>>
