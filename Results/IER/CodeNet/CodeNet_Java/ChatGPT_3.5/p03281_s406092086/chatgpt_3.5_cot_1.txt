<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 105 according to the input. And variable ans is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 105 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable tmp.
Inside the for loop, it initializes an array div with size n+1 and sets all elements to 0.
Then it enters a while loop and it continues until tmp becomes 1. Inside the while loop, it checks if tmp is divisible by any number j from 2 to tmp. If it is divisible, it increments the corresponding element in array div and updates tmp by dividing it by j. It breaks the inner for loop after finding the first divisor.
After the while loop, it calculates the count by multiplying all elements in array div plus 1.
Then it checks if the count is equal to 8. If it is, it increments the variable ans.
After the loop finishes, it print the final value of variable ans as output, which is 1.
