<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a class Main with a nested class AOJ1320. The AOJ1320 class implements the Runnable interface and overrides the run() method. Inside the run() method, it reads an integer N from the input and checks if it is 0. If N is 0, it breaks the loop and ends the program. Otherwise, it calls the solve() method.

The solve() method reads N strings from the input and stores them in an array called str[]. It then initializes an array eq[] of booleans with the same length as str[] and sets all elements to false. It then iterates through each element in str[] and checks if there is a match with any other element in str[]. If there is a match, it sets the corresponding element in eq[] to true. This is done to identify equivalent strings.

Next, it creates a new ArrayList called str2[] and adds all the strings from str[] that are not equivalent to any other string. It also stores the size of str2[] in the variable N2.

Then, it creates a 2D array called len[][] with dimensions N2 x N2 and initializes all elements to 0. It then iterates through each pair of strings in str2[] and calculates the length of the common suffix between the two strings. This is done by finding the offset at which the second string starts with the substring of the first string. The length of the common suffix is then calculated by subtracting the offset from the length of the second string.

After that, it creates another 2D array called dp[][] with dimensions (1 << N2) x N2 and initializes all elements to a large value (INF). It then sets the elements in the first row of dp[][] to the length of the corresponding string in str2[]. This is done to initialize the dynamic programming table.

Next, it iterates through each row and column of dp[][] and checks if the current element is less than the large value (INF). If it is, it iterates through each column and checks if the current column is already included in the current row. If it is not, it calculates the new index by bitwise ORing the current row with the current column. It then updates the element at the new index and current column in dp[][] by taking the minimum of the current element and the sum of the current element and the length between the current column and the new column in len[][].

Finally, it initializes a variable ans to a large value (INF) and a variable tmp to (1 << N2) - 1. It then iterates through each column in the last row of dp[][] and takes the minimum of ans and the current element. The final value of ans is then printed as the output.
