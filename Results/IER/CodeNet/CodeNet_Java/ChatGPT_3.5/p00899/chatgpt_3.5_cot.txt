<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a class `Main` with a nested class `AOJ1320` that implements the `Runnable` interface. The `AOJ1320` class has a `run` method that reads input from the scanner and calls the `solve` method to process the input.

The `solve` method reads an integer `N` from the scanner and checks if it is equal to 0. If `N` is 0, the method returns. Otherwise, it continues to process the input.

The method reads `N` strings from the scanner and stores them in an array `str`. It then initializes a boolean array `eq` with the same length as `str` to keep track of whether each string is equivalent to any other string. 

Next, the method iterates over each string in `str` and checks if it matches any other string in `str` using a regular expression. If a match is found, the corresponding element in `eq` is set to `true`.

The method creates a new `ArrayList` called `str2` and adds all the strings from `str` that are not equivalent to any other string to `str2`. It also updates the value of `N2` to the size of `str2`.

The method then initializes a 2D array `len` with dimensions `N2`x`N2` to store the lengths of the common suffixes between each pair of strings in `str2`. It uses a nested loop to iterate over each pair of strings and calculates the length of the common suffix by comparing substrings.

Next, the method initializes a 2D array `dp` with dimensions `1<<N2`x`N2` to store the minimum length of the concatenated string for each subset of strings in `str2`. It sets all elements of `dp` to a large value `INF` initially. 

The method then iterates over each string in `str2` and sets the corresponding element in `dp` to the length of the string. This represents the base case where each string is considered individually.

Finally, the method uses a nested loop to iterate over each subset of strings in `str2` and calculates the minimum length of the concatenated string for each subset by considering all possible extensions. It updates the value of `dp` accordingly.

After the loop finishes, the method finds the minimum length of the concatenated string among all subsets of strings in `str2` and prints it as the output.

<<<Output>>>
The return value of `3` would be the minimum length of the concatenated string among all subsets of strings in `str2`.
