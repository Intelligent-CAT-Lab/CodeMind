<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads the input values for variables w, h, v, t, x, y, p, and q using the UserScanner class.
Then it creates an instance of the Wave class with the input values.
It calls the attack() method of the Wave class, which calculates and returns the number of targets that can be attacked by a wave.
The attack() method uses a series of loops and conditions to calculate the number of targets in different directions and reflections.
Finally, the code prints the result of the attack() method.
