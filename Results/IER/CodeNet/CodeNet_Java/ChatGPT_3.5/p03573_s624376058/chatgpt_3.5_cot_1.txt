<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers A, B, and C as input using the Scanner class.
It then checks if A is equal to B. If it is, it prints the value of C.
If A is not equal to B, it checks if A is equal to C. If it is, it prints the value of B.
If neither of the above conditions is true, it prints the value of A.
In this case, A is equal to C, so the output will be the value of B, which is 7.
<<<Output>>>
7
