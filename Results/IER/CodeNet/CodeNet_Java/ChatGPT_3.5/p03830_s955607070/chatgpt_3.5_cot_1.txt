<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 3 according to the input. An array x of size 1001 is initialized to store the count of prime factors of each number from 2 to n. The variable sum is initialized with 1.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to n to check each number i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable t.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 2 to i to check each number j in this range. It checks if j is a factor of t. If it is, it increments the count of prime factor j in array x and divides t by j.
After the loop finishes, it calculates the value of variable sum by multiplying the count of each prime factor in array x plus 1. It also takes the modulo of the result with 1e9+7 to avoid overflow.
Finally, it prints the value of variable sum as output, which is 4.
<<<Output>>>
