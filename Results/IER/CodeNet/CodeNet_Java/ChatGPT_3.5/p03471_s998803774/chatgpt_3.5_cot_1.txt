<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs, n and y, and initializes two variables, i and j, as 0. It then enters a nested for loop that iterates from 0 to 2000 for both i and j. Inside the loop, it checks if the expression `10000L * i + 5000L * j + 1000L * (n - i - j) == y` is true. If it is, it prints the values of i, j, and (n - i - j) and returns. If the loop finishes without finding a solution, it prints "-1 -1 -1".
In this case, n is 9 and y is 45000. The loop will iterate through all possible combinations of i and j from 0 to 2000 and check if the expression is true. If a solution is found, it will print the values of i, j, and (n - i - j) and return. If no solution is found, it will print "-1 -1 -1".
