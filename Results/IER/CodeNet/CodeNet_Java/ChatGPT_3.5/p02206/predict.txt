The variable n and variable k are initialized with 1 and 1 respectively according to the input. And variable left is initialized with 1 and variable right is initialized with k + 1, which is 2.
It enters a while loop and it continues until the condition right - left > 1 is false. In the first iteration, the value of variable m is calculated as (left + right) / 2, which is 1. Then the value of variable x is set to m, which is 1.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable total by adding the value of variable x to it and then dividing the value of variable x by 2. The loop continues until the condition i < n && x > 0 && total <= k is false. Since n is 1, the loop only runs once. The value of variable total is 1 and the value of variable x becomes 0 after the loop.
Then it checks if the value of variable total is less than or equal to k. Since total is 1 and k is 1, the condition is true. It updates the value of variable left to m, which is 1.
Since the condition right - left > 1 is still true, it goes back to the beginning of the while loop. In the second iteration, the value of variable m is calculated as (left + right) / 2, which is 1. Then the value of variable x is set to m, which is 1.

The value of variable total is 1 and the value of variable x becomes 0 after the loop.
Then it checks if the value of variable total is less than or equal to k. Since total is 1 and k is 1, the condition is true. It updates the value of variable left to m, which is 1.
Since the condition right - left > 1 is still true, it goes back to the beginning of the while loop. In the third iteration, the value of variable m is calculated as (left + right) / 2, which is 1. Then the value of variable x is set to m, which is 1.

Then it checks if the value of variable total is less than or equal to k. Since total is 1 and k is 1, the condition is true. It updates the value of variable left to m, which is 1.
Since the condition right - left > 1 is still true, it goes back to the beginning of the while loop. In the fourth iteration, the value of variable m is calculated as (left + right) / 2, which is 1. Then the value of variable x is set to m, which is 1.

Then it checks if the value of variable total is less than or equal to k. Since total is 1 and k is 1, the condition is true. It updates the value of variable left to m, which is 1.
Since the condition right - left > 1 is still true, it goes back to the beginning of the while loop. In the fifth iteration, the value of variable m is calculated as (left + right) / 2, which is 1. Then the value of variable x is set to m, which is 1.
