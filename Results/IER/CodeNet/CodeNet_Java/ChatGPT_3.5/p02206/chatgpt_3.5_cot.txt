<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two long integers as input, n and k. It initializes the variables left and right with 1 and k+1 respectively.
Then it enters a while loop which continues until the difference between right and left is greater than 1.
Inside the while loop, it calculates the middle value m as the average of left and right.
Then it initializes the variable x with the value of m and total with 0.
It enters a for loop which iterates n times or until x becomes 0 or total becomes greater than k.
Inside the for loop, it adds the value of x to total and divides x by 2.
After the for loop, it checks if total is less than or equal to k. If it is, it updates the value of left to m. Otherwise, it updates the value of right to m.
The while loop continues until the condition is no longer satisfied.
Finally, it prints the value of left as the output.
