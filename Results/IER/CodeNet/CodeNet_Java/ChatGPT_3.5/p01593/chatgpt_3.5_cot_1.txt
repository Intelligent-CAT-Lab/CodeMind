<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and variable m are initialized with 2 and 1 respectively according to the input.
It enters the solve() method.
Inside the solve() method, an array dp of size n+1 is created and initialized with 0. dp[0] is set to 1.
Then it enters a nested for loop. The outer loop iterates from 1 to n and the inner loop iterates from 1 to the minimum of m and j.
Inside the inner loop, it calculates dp[j] by adding dp[j-i]/j to it.
After the loop finishes, it prints the value of dp[n] with 12 decimal places.
<<<Output>>>
0.500000000000
