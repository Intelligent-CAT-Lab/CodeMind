<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and variable m are initialized with 2 and 1 respectively according to the input.
It calls the solve() method.
Inside the solve() method, it initializes an array dp of size n+1 and sets dp[0] to 1.
Then it enters a nested for loop. The outer loop iterates from 1 to n and the inner loop iterates from 1 to the minimum of m and j.
Inside the inner loop, it adds dp[j-i]/j to dp[j].
After the loops finish, it prints the value of dp[n] with 12 decimal places.
<<<Output>>>
