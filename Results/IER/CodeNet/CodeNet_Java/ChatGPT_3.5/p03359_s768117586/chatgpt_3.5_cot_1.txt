<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers a and b from the input. It then checks if a is less than or equal to b. If it is, it prints the value of a. Otherwise, it prints the value of a minus 1.
In this case, a is equal to b, so the condition a <= b is true. Therefore, the code will print the value of a, which is 5.
<<<Output>>>
5
