<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string and processes it character by character. It initializes several variables including an array of longs called "keis" with size 6, which will store the coefficients of the polynomial equation. It also initializes a boolean variable "plus" as true, which indicates whether the current term is positive or negative. It also initializes a boolean variable "si" and "xs" as false, which are used to keep track of whether the current character represents the exponent or the variable "x" respectively.

The code then iterates through each character in the input string. If the character is '+', it checks if the previous term was a term with "x" and updates the corresponding coefficient in the "keis" array. It then resets the "num" variable to 0 and sets "plus" to true. If the character is '-', it performs similar operations but sets "plus" to false. If the character is '^', it sets "si" to true and "xs" to false. If the character is 'x', it checks if the current "num" is 0 and sets it to 1 if it is. It then sets "xs" to true. If the character is a digit, it checks if "si" is true, indicating that the current character represents the exponent. It then calculates the value of the coefficient based on the "num" and "plus" variables and updates the corresponding element in the "keis" array. If "si" is false, it updates the "num" variable by multiplying it by 10 and adding the value of the current digit.

After processing all the characters, the code checks the value of "plus" and updates the coefficient of the constant term in the "keis" array. It then initializes a variable "ji" to 0 and iterates through the "keis" array from the highest index to the lowest index. It finds the highest index "ji" where the coefficient is non-zero.

The code then initializes an array "ans" with size "ji" and iterates from 1 to the absolute value of the constant term in the "keis" array. For each value of "i", it calculates two results: one by substituting "i" into the polynomial equation and one by substituting "-i". If either result is 0, it decrements "ji" and assigns the corresponding value of "i" or "-i" to the "ans" array.

Finally, the code sorts the "ans" array in ascending order and creates a StringBuilder to build the output string. It iterates through the "ans" array and appends the corresponding term to the StringBuilder. If the term is positive, it appends a "+" sign before the coefficient. The final output is then printed.
