<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input: w, a, and b. It then checks several conditions and prints the corresponding output based on the values of a, b, and w.

1. If a <= b and b <= a+w, it means that the interval [a, a+w] contains b. In this case, the output will be 0.

2. If a <= b+w and b+w <= a+w, it means that the interval [b, b+w] contains a. In this case, the output will be 0.

3. If a+w <= b, it means that the interval [a, a+w] is completely to the left of the interval [b, b+w]. In this case, the output will be (b-a-w).

4. If a > b+w, it means that the interval [a, a+w] is completely to the right of the interval [b, b+w]. In this case, the output will be (a-b-w).
