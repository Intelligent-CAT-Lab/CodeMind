<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads three integers from the input: w, a, and b. It then checks several conditions and prints the corresponding output based on the values of a, b, and w.

1. If a <= b and b <= a+w, it means that the interval [a, b] is completely contained within the interval [a, a+w]. In this case, the output is 0.

2. If a <= b+w and b+w <= a+w, it means that the interval [b, b+w] is completely contained within the interval [a, a+w]. In this case, the output is also 0.

3. If a+w <= b, it means that the interval [a, a+w] is completely to the left of the interval [b, b+w]. In this case, the output is (b-a-w), which represents the distance between the two intervals.

4. If none of the above conditions are met, it means that the interval [b, b+w] is completely to the right of the interval [a, a+w]. In this case, the output is (a-b-w), which represents the distance between the two intervals.
