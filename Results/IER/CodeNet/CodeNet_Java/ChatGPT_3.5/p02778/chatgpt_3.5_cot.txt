<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input from the user using the Scanner class. It then iterates over each character in the string and prints "x" for each character. The loop runs for the length of the input string, which is 7 in this case. Therefore, the output will be "xxxxxxx".
<<<Output>>>
xxxxxxx
