The variable K is initialized with the value 6 according to the input. An array dp of size K is created and all its elements are initialized with Integer.MAX_VALUE. A deque (double-ended queue) is also created.
The first element of dp is set to 1 and added to the deque. Then, a while loop is executed as long as the deque is not empty. Inside the loop, the first element of the deque is removed and stored in the variable curr.
Two variables v1 and v2 are calculated based on curr. v1 is the remainder of (curr + 1) divided by K, and v2 is the remainder of (curr * 10) divided by K.
If dp[v1] is greater than dp[curr] + 1, v1 is added to the front of the deque and dp[v1] is updated to dp[curr] + 1.
If dp[v2] is greater than dp[curr], v2 is added to the end of the deque and dp[v2] is updated to dp[curr].
This process continues until the deque is empty.
Finally, the value of dp[0] is printed as the output.
