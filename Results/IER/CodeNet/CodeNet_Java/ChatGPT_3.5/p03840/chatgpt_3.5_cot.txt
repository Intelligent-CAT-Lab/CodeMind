<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads 7 long integers from the input and assigns them to variables ai, ao, at, aj, al, as, and az respectively.
Then it initializes a variable ans with 0 and adds the value of ao to it.
Next, it checks the sum of the remainders of ai, aj, and al when divided by 2. If the sum is 3, it means all three numbers are odd, so it adds the values of ai, aj, and al to ans.
If the sum is 2, it checks if all three numbers are non-zero. If they are, it subtracts 1 from the sum and adds the values of ai, aj, and al to ans. Otherwise, it subtracts 2 from the sum and adds the values of ai, aj, and al to ans.
If the sum is 1, it subtracts 1 from the sum and adds the values of ai, aj, and al to ans.
If the sum is 0, it adds the values of ai, aj, and al to ans.
Finally, it prints the value of ans.
