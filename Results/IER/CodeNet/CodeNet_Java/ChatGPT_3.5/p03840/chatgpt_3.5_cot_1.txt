<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads 7 integers from the input and assigns them to variables ai, ao, at, aj, al, as, and az respectively.
Then it initializes a variable ans with 0 and adds the value of ao to it.
Next, it checks the sum of the remainders of ai, aj, and al when divided by 2.
If the sum is 3, it means all three numbers are odd, so it adds the values of ai, aj, and al to ans.
If the sum is 2, it means two of the numbers are odd and one is even.
If all three numbers are non-zero, it adds the values of ai, aj, and al to ans and subtracts 1.
If any of the numbers is zero, it adds the values of ai, aj, and al to ans and subtracts 2.
If the sum is 1, it means one of the numbers is odd and two are even, so it adds the values of ai, aj, and al to ans and subtracts 1.
If the sum is 0, it means all three numbers are even, so it adds the values of ai, aj, and al to ans.
Finally, it prints the value of ans as the output.
