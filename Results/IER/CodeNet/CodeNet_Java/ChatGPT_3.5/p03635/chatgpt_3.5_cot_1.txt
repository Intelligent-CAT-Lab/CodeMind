<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers n and m from the input. It then calculates the product of (n-1) and (m-1) and stores it in a variable. Finally, it prints the value of the variable as the output.
In this case, the input is "3 4". So, n will be 3 and m will be 4. The code will calculate (3-1)*(4-1) which is equal to 2*3 = 6. Therefore, the output will be 6.
