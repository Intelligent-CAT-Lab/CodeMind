<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input: a, b, and c. It then initializes a variable "result" with the value "No". 
Next, it checks if c is between a and b (inclusive). If it is, it updates the value of "result" to "Yes".
Finally, it prints the value of "result" as the output.
In this case, the values of a, b, and c are 1, 3, and 2 respectively. Since 2 is between 1 and 3, the value of "result" will be "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
