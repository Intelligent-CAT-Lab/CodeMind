<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input: a, b, and c. It compares the value of c with the range [a, b]. If c is greater than or equal to a and less than or equal to b, it sets the value of the result variable to "Yes". Otherwise, it remains "No". Finally, it prints the value of the result variable as the output.

In this case, the input values are a=1, b=3, and c=2. Since 1 <= 2 <= 3, the condition is true and the value of the result variable is set to "Yes". Therefore, the output will be "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
