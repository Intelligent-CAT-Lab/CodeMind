The code reads an integer n from the input. Then it calls the solve() method passing n as an argument. 
Inside the solve() method, an array f of size n+1 is initialized. The first three elements of f are set to 1, n, and f[1] + (n-1)*n respectively. 
Another array sum of size n+2 is initialized. The first three elements of sum are set to 0, f[0], and f[0]+f[1] respectively.
Then a for loop is executed from k=3 to n. Inside the loop, the minimum of n and k-2 is calculated and stored in m. The values of l and r are calculated as k-1-m and k-1-2 respectively.
A variable x is calculated as f[k-1] + (n-1)*n - (m-2+1). If l is less than or equal to r, then x is incremented by sum[r+1] - sum[l].
The value of x is then taken modulo MOD and stored in f[k]. The value of sum[k+1] is calculated as sum[k] + f[k]. If sum[k+1] is greater than or equal to MOD, then MOD is subtracted from sum[k+1].
Finally, the value of f[n] is returned as the output.
