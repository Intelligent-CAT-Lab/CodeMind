<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a class called Solver that implements the Runnable interface. Inside the run() method of the Solver class, it reads three long integers N, M, and K from the input. It then creates an instance of the Mod class and calculates the value of C using the comb() method of the Mod class. 

Next, it calculates the value of ans by adding two terms. The first term is calculated by dividing the product of N, N-1, N+1, C, M, and M by 6. The second term is calculated by dividing the product of M, M-1, M+1, C, N, and N by 6. 

Finally, it prints the value of ans.

The main() method creates a new instance of the Solver class and starts a new thread to run the Solver class.
