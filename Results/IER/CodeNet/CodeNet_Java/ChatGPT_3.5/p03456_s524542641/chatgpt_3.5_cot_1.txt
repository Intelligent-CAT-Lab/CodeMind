<<<Analysis>>>
The variable a is initialized with 1 and variable b is initialized with 21 according to the input. The length of a and b are calculated and stored in variables aa and bb respectively.
There are three if statements that check the combination of aa and bb. In this case, aa is 1 and bb is 2, so the second if statement is executed.
Inside the second if statement, the variable c is calculated as 100*a+b, which is 121. Then a for loop is executed from i=0 to i<c.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the square of i is equal to c. If it is, it prints "Yes" and breaks out of the loop. If i reaches c-1 and the condition is still not met, it prints "No".
In this case, the condition is not met and the loop finishes without printing "Yes". So, it prints "No" as the output.
<<<Output>>>
No
