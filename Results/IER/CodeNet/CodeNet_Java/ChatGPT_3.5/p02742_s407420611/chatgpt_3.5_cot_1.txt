<<<Analysis>>>
The variable H is initialized with 4 and variable W is initialized with 5 according to the input.
It checks if either H or W is equal to 1. Since neither of them is equal to 1, it continues to the next step.
It calculates the value of variable h as (H + 1) / 2, which is 2.
It initializes the variable ans with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 5. The value of variable i is also passed to the loop.
Inside the loop, it checks if i is even and H is odd. Since i is not even and H is not odd, it goes to the else block.
It adds the value of h to the variable ans.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable ans as output, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
