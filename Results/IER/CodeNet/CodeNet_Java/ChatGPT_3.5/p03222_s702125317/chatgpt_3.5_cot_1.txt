The variable H, W and K are initialized with 1, 3 and 2 respectively according to the input.
Then it creates an instance of the Main class with H and W as parameters.
Then it calls the countIt method of the Main class with K as parameter and assigns the returned value to the variable result.
Inside the countIt method, it calls the countSub method with height, 1 and goal as parameters and assigns the returned value to the variable result.
Inside the countSub method, it checks if the absolute difference between start and goal is greater than height. If it is, it returns 0.
If height is greater than 1, it calculates h1 and h2 as half of height and recursively calls the countSub method with h1, start and k+1 as parameters and assigns the returned value to the variable r1.
Then it recursively calls the countSub method with h2, k+1 and goal as parameters and assigns the returned value to the variable r2.
Then it calculates the result as r1 * r2 and returns the result modulo MOD.
If height is 0, it calculates the right mask and left mask based on start.
Then it initializes rCase, lCase and mCase as 0.
Then it iterates through each unitAmida in unitAmidas and checks if the unitAmida has a bit set in the right mask or left mask or neither.
Based on the condition, it increments the corresponding case variable.
Then it calculates the result based on the value of start and goal.
Finally, it prints the value of result.
