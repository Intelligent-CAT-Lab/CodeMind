<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers from the input using the Scanner class and assigns them to variables a and b respectively. Then it calculates the maximum value among a+b, a-b, and a*b using the Math.max() method and prints the result.
In this case, a is -13 and b is 3. So, a+b is -10, a-b is -16, and a*b is -39. The maximum value among these three is -10. Therefore, the output will be -10.
<<<Output>>>
-10
