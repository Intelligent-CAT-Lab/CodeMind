The variable s is initialized with the input value "02". The length of s is calculated and stored in variable n. 
A 2D array dp is initialized with dimensions (n+n+1) x (n+n+1).
Two arrays c1 and c2 are initialized with size n+1.
A for loop is used to iterate through each character of s. Inside the loop, it checks the value of each character and updates the values of arrays c1 and c2 accordingly.
Another for loop is used to iterate through each possible combination of i and j, where i represents the number of '0' characters and j represents the number of '2' characters.
Inside the nested loop, it checks if the values of c1 and c2 satisfy certain conditions. If they do, it updates the value of dp[i][j] based on the values of dp[i-1][j] and dp[i][j-1].
Finally, it prints the value of dp[c1[n]][c2[n]] as the output.
