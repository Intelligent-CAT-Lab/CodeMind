<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input from the user and stores it in the variable 's'. 
Then it checks if the character at index 2 of the string is equal to the character at index 3, and if the character at index 4 is equal to the character at index 5. 
If both conditions are true, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
In this case, the character at index 2 is 'p' and the character at index 3 is 'p', and the character at index 4 is 'u' and the character at index 5 is 'u'. 
So, both conditions are true and the output will be "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
