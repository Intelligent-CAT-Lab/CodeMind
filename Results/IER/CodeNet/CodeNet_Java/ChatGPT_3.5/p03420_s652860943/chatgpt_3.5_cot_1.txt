<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N and variable K are initialized with 5 and 2 respectively according to the input. And variable ans is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to N-K+1 to check each integer alpha in this range. The value of variable alpha is also passed to variable b.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable n by dividing (N-K) by b. Then it adds n*alpha to variable ans.
Then it checks if the condition K+n*b<=N is true. If it is, it adds the value of Math.min(N, K+n*b+alpha-1) - (K+n*b)+1 to variable ans.
After the loop finishes, it checks if K is equal to 0. If it is, it subtracts N from variable ans.
Finally, it prints the final value of variable ans as output.
<<<Output>>>
