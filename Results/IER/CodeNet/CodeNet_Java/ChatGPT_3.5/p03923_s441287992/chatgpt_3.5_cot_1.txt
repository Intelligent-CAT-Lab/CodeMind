<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and variable a are initialized with 8 and 1 respectively according to the input. And variable ans is initialized with n.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 40 to check each integer take in this range. 
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable lo and variable hi based on the current value of take.
Then it enters a while loop and it compares the value of variable lo and variable hi. If lo is less than hi, it calculates the value of variable mid as the average of lo and hi.
Then it checks if mid^(take+1) is less than n. If it is, it updates the value of lo to mid+1. Otherwise, it updates the value of hi to mid.
After the while loop, it calculates the value of variable same as lo-1.
Then it calculates the value of variable total as 1 and it multiplies it by same for take times.
Then it calculates the value of variable tmp as a*take + same*(take+1).
Then it enters a while loop and it checks if total is less than n. If it is, it divides total by same and multiplies it by same+1. And it increments the value of tmp by 1.
After the while loop, it updates the value of ans to the minimum of ans and tmp.
After the for loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable ans as output.
