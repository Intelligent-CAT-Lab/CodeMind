<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a line of input and stores it in the variable nyu. Then it removes all the spaces from the string nyu and stores the result in the variable res. It checks if the integer value of res is divisible by 4. If it is, it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".
In this case, the input is "4 3 2". After removing the spaces, the value of res becomes "432". Since 432 is not divisible by 4, the output will be "NO".
<<<Output>>>
NO
