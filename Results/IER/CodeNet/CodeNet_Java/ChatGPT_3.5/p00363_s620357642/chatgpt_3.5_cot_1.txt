<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes input from the user in the form of a string and then uses the StringTokenizer class to split the string into three parts: yoko, tate, and moji. The values of yoko, tate, and moji are then assigned to the corresponding variables. 

Next, an array called hata is created with a length of tate. Each element of the array is initialized as an empty string.

Then, a nested for loop is used to iterate through each row and column of the hata array. The first and last rows are filled with "+" symbols, and the first and last columns are filled with "|" symbols. For the remaining cells, if the current row is the middle row and the current column is the middle column, the moji value is added to the cell. Otherwise, the cell is filled with ".".

Finally, the contents of the hata array are printed, with each element on a new line.
