<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 6 according to the input. And variable ans and variable sum are initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to n. In each iteration, it adds the current value of i to variable sum and increments variable ans by 1.
The loop continues until the value of sum becomes greater than or equal to n.
After the loop finishes, it print the final value of variable ans as output, which is 3.
