<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 6 according to the input. And variables x and i are initialized with 0 and 1 respectively.
It enters a while loop and it keeps adding the value of i to x until x becomes greater than or equal to n.
In each iteration, it increments the value of i by 1.
The loop stops when x becomes greater than or equal to n. At this point, the value of i is decremented by 1 and printed as output.
In this case, the loop runs for 3 iterations and the value of i becomes 3.
<<<Output>>>
