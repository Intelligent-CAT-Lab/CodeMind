<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two long integers as input, N and K. It initializes a variable ans with 0.
Then it enters a for loop that iterates from 0 to N-2. Inside the loop, it updates the value of ans using the following formula:
ans = K * ((long)(ans / (K - 1))) + ans % (K - 1) + 1
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of ans as the output.
In this case, N = 4 and K = 2. So the loop will iterate 3 times.
In the first iteration, ans = 2 * ((long)(0 / (2 - 1))) + 0 % (2 - 1) + 1 = 1
In the second iteration, ans = 2 * ((long)(1 / (2 - 1))) + 1 % (2 - 1) + 1 = 3
In the third iteration, ans = 2 * ((long)(3 / (2 - 1))) + 3 % (2 - 1) + 1 = 7
So the final value of ans is 7.
<<<Output>>>
7
