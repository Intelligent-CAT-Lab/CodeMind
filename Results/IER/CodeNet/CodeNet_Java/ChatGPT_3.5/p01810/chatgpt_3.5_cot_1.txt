The variable N and variable K are initialized with 4 and 2 respectively according to the input. And variable ans is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 3 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of ans using the formula:
ans = K * ((long)(ans / (K - 1))) + ans % (K - 1) + 1;
In the first iteration, ans = 2 * ((long)(0 / (2 - 1))) + 0 % (2 - 1) + 1 = 1.
In the second iteration, ans = 2 * ((long)(1 / (2 - 1))) + 1 % (2 - 1) + 1 = 3.
In the third iteration, ans = 2 * ((long)(3 / (2 - 1))) + 3 % (2 - 1) + 1 = 7.
After the loop finishes, it print the final value of variable ans as output, which is 7.
