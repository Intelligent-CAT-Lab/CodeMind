<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input: n, a, and b. It then calculates the value of `all` by raising 2 to the power of n. 

Next, it calculates the value of `answer` using the following formula:
answer = (all + 2 * m - sub(n, a) - sub(n, b) - 1) % m

The `sub` function is used to calculate the binomial coefficient. It takes two parameters: n and a. It calculates the binomial coefficient using the formula:
s1 = n! / ((n-a)! * a!)

The `pow` function is used to calculate the power of a number. It takes two parameters: a and b. It calculates a^b using the binary exponentiation algorithm.

Finally, it prints the value of `answer` as the output.

In this case, the input values are n=4, a=1, and b=3.
