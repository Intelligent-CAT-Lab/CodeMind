<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n, variable a and variable b are initialized with 4, 1 and 3 respectively according to the input. The variable m is initialized with 1000000007.
The code defines a function pow() which calculates the power of a number using modular exponentiation. It also defines a function reverse() which calculates the modular inverse of a number using pow() function.
Inside the main() function, it reads the input values of n, a and b using Scanner class.
Then it calculates the value of variable all as 2 raised to the power of n using pow() function.
Next, it calculates the value of variable answer using the following formula:
answer = (all + 2 * m - sub(n, a) - sub(n, b) - 1) % m
The sub() function calculates the binomial coefficient using factorial and modular inverse. It calculates the value of s1 as the factorial of n divided by the factorial of (n-a). It calculates the value of s2 as the factorial of a. It calculates the value of s3 as the modular inverse of s2 using reverse() function. Finally, it returns the value of (s1 * s3) % m.
The answer is then printed as output.
