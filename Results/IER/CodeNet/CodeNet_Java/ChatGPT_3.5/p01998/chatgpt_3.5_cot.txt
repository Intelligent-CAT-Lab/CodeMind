<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input `n` and initializes a boolean array `arr` of size `n+3`. It sets the first two elements of `arr` to `true`. Then it initializes a variable `count` to 0.
The code then enters a for loop that iterates from 2 to the length of `arr`. Inside the loop, it checks if the current element `arr[i]` is `false`. If it is `false`, it enters another for loop that iterates from 2 to `arr.length` and sets `arr[i*j]` to `true` for each multiple of `i`. 
After the inner loop finishes, it checks if both `arr[i]` and `arr[i-2]` are `false`. If they are both `false`, it increments the `count` variable.
Finally, it prints the value of `count` multiplied by 2 as the output.
