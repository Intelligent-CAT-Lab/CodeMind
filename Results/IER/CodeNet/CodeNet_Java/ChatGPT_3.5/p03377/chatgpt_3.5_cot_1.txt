<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integer inputs a, b, and x using the Scanner class.
It then checks if the sum of a and b is greater than or equal to x and if a is less than or equal to x.
If both conditions are true, it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".
In this case, a=3, b=5, and x=4.
The sum of a and b is 8, which is greater than x.
Also, a is less than x.
Therefore, both conditions are true and the output will be "YES".
<<<Output>>>
YES
