<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads three integers n, x, and y from the input. It then initializes an array ans of size n with all elements set to 0.
The code then enters a nested for loop. The outer loop iterates from 1 to n, and the inner loop iterates from i+1 to n.
Inside the inner loop, the code calculates the minimum of three values: Math.abs(i - j), Math.abs(i - x) + Math.abs(j - y) + 1, and Math.abs(j - x) + Math.abs(i - y) + 1.
The calculated minimum value is then used as an index to increment the corresponding element in the ans array.
After the loops finish, the code prints the elements of the ans array, starting from index 1 and ending at index n-1.
