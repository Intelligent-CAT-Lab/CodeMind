The variable x is initialized with 11009 and variable y is initialized with 11332 according to the input. And variable count2 is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 11009 to 11332 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable k and variable count is initialized with 0.
Inside the for loop, it converts the current integer i to a character array and stores it in variable arr.
Then it iterates through the first half of the character array and checks if the character at index j is equal to the character at the corresponding index from the end of the array.
If they are equal, it increments the value of variable count.
After the loop finishes, it checks if the value of variable count is equal to the ceiling of half the length of the character array.
If it is, it increments the value of variable count2.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable count2 as output, which is 3.
