<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and variable m are initialized with 2 and 2 respectively according to the input. 
It enters an if-else statement to check the absolute difference between n and m. Since the absolute difference is 0, it goes to the else block.
Inside the else block, it calls the method factorialsModBillion(n, m) and assigns the returned value to variable result.
In the method factorialsModBillion, it initializes variable result with 1.
Then it enters a for loop to calculate the factorial of n. It multiplies the current value of result with the current value of i and takes the modulo 1000000007L.
After the first for loop, it enters another for loop to calculate the factorial of m. It multiplies the current value of result with the current value of i and takes the modulo 1000000007L.
Finally, it returns the value of result.
After the method call, it multiplies the value of result with 2 and takes the modulo 1000000007L.
Then it prints the final value of result as output, which is 4.
