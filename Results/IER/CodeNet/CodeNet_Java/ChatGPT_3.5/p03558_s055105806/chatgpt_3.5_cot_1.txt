The variable k is initialized with 6 according to the input. The variable INF is initialized with 1001001001. An ArrayList of ArrayLists of Edges is created and the variable dist is initialized as an array of size k, with each element set to INF.
Then, a for loop is used to populate the ArrayList of ArrayLists of Edges. For each index i, two edges are added to the corresponding ArrayList. The first edge connects to the vertex (i+1)%k with a cost of 1, and the second edge connects to the vertex (i*10)%k with a cost of 0.
The calc() method is called with an argument of 1. Inside the calc() method, a PriorityQueue of P objects is created. A P object with the argument r and a distance of 0 is added to the PriorityQueue. The distance of vertex r is set to 0 in the dist array.
Then, a while loop is used to process the elements in the PriorityQueue. The top element is removed from the PriorityQueue and stored in a P object p. If the distance of vertex p.v is less than p.dist, the loop continues to the next iteration. Otherwise, for each Edge e in the ArrayList of Edges corresponding to vertex p.v, if the distance of vertex e.to is greater than the distance of vertex p.v plus the cost of edge e, the distance of vertex e.to is updated and a new P object with vertex e.to and distance dist[e.to] is added to the PriorityQueue.
After the while loop finishes, the value of dist[0]+1 is printed as the output.
