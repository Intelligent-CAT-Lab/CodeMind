<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string as input and converts it into a character array. It then initializes a variable min with a large value of 100.
It enters a for loop that iterates from 0 to 25, representing the 26 lowercase alphabets. Inside the loop, it initializes a variable key with the current alphabet.
It also initializes a variable cnt with 0 and creates a new character array str with the same length as the input string.
It then copies the characters from the input string to the new array str.
It enters a while loop that continues until a certain condition is met. Inside the loop, it checks if any character in the array str is different from the current alphabet key.
If all characters in the array str are equal to the current alphabet key, it updates the variable min with the minimum value between cnt and min.
It then breaks out of the loop.
If there is at least one character in the array str that is different from the current alphabet key, it creates a new character array next with a length one less than the length of str.
It then iterates through the array str and checks if each character is equal to the current alphabet key or the next character is equal to the current alphabet key.
If either condition is true, it assigns the current alphabet key to the corresponding index in the array next. Otherwise, it assigns the previous alphabet key (current alphabet key - 1) to the corresponding index in the array next.
It increments the variable cnt by 1 and checks if the length of the array next is equal to 1. If it is, it breaks out of the loop.
Finally, it assigns the array next to the array str and continues to the next iteration of the while loop.
After the for loop finishes, it prints the value of the variable min as the output.
