<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers from the input using the Scanner class and stores them in BigInteger objects A and B respectively. Then it adds the values of A and B using the add() method of the BigInteger class. Finally, it prints the result of the addition as output.
In this case, the input is "5 8", so A will have the value 5 and B will have the value 8. The code will add these two values and print the result, which is 13.
<<<Output>>>
13
