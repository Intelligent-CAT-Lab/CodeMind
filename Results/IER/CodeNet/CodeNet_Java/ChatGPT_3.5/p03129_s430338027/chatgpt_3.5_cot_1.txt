<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers n and k from the input. It then checks if n is greater than or equal to k * 2 - 1. If this condition is true, it prints "YES", otherwise it prints "NO".
In this case, n is 3 and k is 2. So, k * 2 - 1 is equal to 3. Since n is equal to k * 2 - 1, the condition is true and the code will print "YES".
<<<Output>>>
YES
