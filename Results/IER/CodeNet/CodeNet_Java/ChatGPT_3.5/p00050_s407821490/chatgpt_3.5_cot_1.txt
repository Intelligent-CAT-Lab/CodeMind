<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads input from the user using the Scanner class. It enters a while loop and continues to read input as long as there is more input available. Inside the loop, it reads a line of input and assigns it to the variable t. 
Then it replaces all occurrences of the word "apple" with a newline character ("\n") in the string t. 
Next, it replaces all occurrences of the word "peach" with the word "apple" in the string t. 
Finally, it replaces all occurrences of the newline character ("\n") with the word "peach" in the string t. 
After all the replacements, it prints the modified string t as output. 
In this case, the input string "the cost of one peach is higher than that of one apple." will be modified to "the cost of one apple is higher than that of one peach." and printed as output.
<<<Output>>>
the cost of one apple is higher than that of one peach.
