<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string `S` and converts it into a character array. It then initializes variables `N` with the length of `S` and `pow3` as an array of length `N+1` with the first element as 1 and the rest of the elements calculated as `pow3[i] = pow3[i-1] * 3 % MOD`. 

It then initializes four `Bits` objects `bsf1`, `bsf2`, `bsb1`, and `bsb2` with lengths `N+64`. It also initializes a variable `Q` as 0. 

Next, it iterates over the character array `S` and checks the value of each character. If the character is 'G', it sets the corresponding bit in `bsf1`. If the character is '?', it sets the corresponding bit in `bsf2` and increments `Q`. If the character is 'U', it sets the corresponding bit in `bsb1`. If the character is '?', it sets the corresponding bit in `bsb2`.

After that, it initializes a variable `ans` as 0 and four arrays `buff1`, `buff2`, `bufb1`, and `bufb2` with lengths equal to the length of `bsf1.bits` and `bsf2.bits` respectively.

Then, it enters a for loop from 1 to `N-1` and checks if the character at index `i` in `S` is 'M' or '?'. If it is, it calculates the value of `q` based on the character. It then copies the bits from `bsf1`, `bsf2`, `bsb1`, and `bsb2` to the corresponding arrays `buff1`, `buff2`, `bufb1`, and `bufb2` starting from index `i+1` and `N-i` respectively. 

Next, it calculates the length of the loop and iterates over each element in the arrays `buff1`, `buff2`, `bufb1`, and `bufb2`. For each element, it calculates the number of set bits in the bitwise AND of `buff1[j]` and `bufb1[j]` and multiplies it by `pow3[q]`. If `q` is greater than or equal to 1, it also calculates the number of set bits in the bitwise AND of `buff1[j]` and `bufb2[j]` and the bitwise AND of `buff2[j]` and `bufb1[j]` and multiplies them by `pow3[q-1]`. If `q` is greater than or equal to 2, it also calculates the number of set bits in the bitwise AND of `buff2[j]` and `bufb2[j]` and multiplies it by `pow3[q-2]`. It adds all these values to `ans` and takes the modulo `MOD` of `ans`.

Finally, it prints the value of `ans`.

<<<Output>>>
The return value of `?MG?` would be 9.
