<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads three integers a, b, and c from the input. It then checks if a is equal to b and b is equal to c. If this condition is true, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
In this case, the input is "2 2 2". So, all three variables a, b, and c will have the value 2. Since a is equal to b and b is equal to c, the condition is true and the code will print "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
