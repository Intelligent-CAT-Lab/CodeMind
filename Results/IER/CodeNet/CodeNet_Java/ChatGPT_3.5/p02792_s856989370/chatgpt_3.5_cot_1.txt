The variable n is initialized with 25 according to the input. And variable ans is initialized with 0.
A 2D array count of size 10x10 is created to store the count of numbers that have the same first and last digit.
A for loop is used to iterate from 1 to n. Inside the loop, the variable j is initialized with the value of i and then divided by 10 until it becomes less than 10. This is done to get the first digit of the number i.
Then, the count of the number i is incremented in the count array at the position [j][i%10]. This is done to store the count of numbers that have the same first and last digit.
After the loop finishes, another nested for loop is used to iterate through the count array and calculate the answer. The answer is incremented by the product of count[i][j] and count[j][i] for each pair of indices i and j.
Finally, the value of ans is printed as the output.
