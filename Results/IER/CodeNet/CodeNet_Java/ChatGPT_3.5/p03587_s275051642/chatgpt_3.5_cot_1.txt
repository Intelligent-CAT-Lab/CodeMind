<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string and converts it into a character array. It then initializes a variable `ans` with 0. 
It then iterates through each character in the character array and checks if the character is equal to '1'. If it is, it increments the `ans` variable by 1.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of `ans` as the output.
In this case, the input string is "111100". The loop iterates through each character and finds that there are 4 occurrences of '1'. Therefore, the output would be 4.
