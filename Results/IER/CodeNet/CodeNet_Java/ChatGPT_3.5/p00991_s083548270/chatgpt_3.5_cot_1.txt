<<<Analysis>>>
The variable r, variable c, variable a1, variable a2, variable b1 and variable b2 are initialized with 4, 4, 0, 0, 3 and 3 respectively according to the input. And variable b1_ is initialized with the absolute difference between b1 and a1, which is 3. Variable b2_ is initialized with the absolute difference between b2 and a2, which is 3.
It checks if b1_ is equal to r - b1_, which is true. So it multiplies pow by 2, which becomes 2.
It also checks if b2_ is equal to c - b2_, which is true. So it multiplies pow by 2 again, which becomes 4.
Then it updates b1_ to the minimum value between b1_ and r - b1_, which is 3. It updates b2_ to the minimum value between b2_ and c - b2_, which is 3.
It initializes a 2D array dp with size r * c and fills it with values according to the following rules:
- If i is 0 and j is 0, dp[i][j] is set to 1.
- If i is 0 and j is not 0, dp[i][j] is set to dp[i][j-1].
- If i is not 0 and j is 0, dp[i][j] is set to dp[i-1][j].
- If i is not 0 and j is not 0, dp[i][j] is set to dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1] modulo 100000007.
Finally, it prints the value of dp[b1_][b2_] multiplied by pow modulo 100000007 as the output, which is 4.
