<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers n and k from the input. Then it creates an instance of the Combinatrics class passing k as a parameter.
It then calls the bell method of the Combinatrics class passing n and k as parameters and prints the result.
The bell method calculates the Bell number, which represents the number of ways to partition a set of n elements into k non-empty subsets.
