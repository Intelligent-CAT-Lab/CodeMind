<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers n and k from the input. Then it creates an instance of the Combinatrics class with k as the parameter. 
It calls the bell method of the Combinatrics class with n and k as the parameters and stores the return value in a variable ans.
Finally, it prints the value of ans as the output.
The bell method calculates the Bell number, which represents the number of ways to partition a set of n elements into k non-empty subsets.
