The variable n is initialized with 2 and variable k is initialized with 1 according to the input. The variable base is calculated as n - k + 1, which is 2 - 1 + 1 = 2.
The arrays answer and sum are initialized with -1. Then the method go(n, n) is called, which returns the value of go(n, n) multiplied by 2 raised to the power of max(n - k - 1, 0) modulo 1e9 + 7.
Inside the go method, it checks if the value of answer[n][lim] is already calculated. If it is, it returns the value. If not, it checks if n is equal to base. If it is, it returns 1.
Otherwise, it calculates the value of answer[n][lim] as the sum of go(n - 1, lim) and goSum(n - 1, lim - 1) modulo 1e9 + 7.
Inside the goSum method, it checks if the value of sum[n][lim] is already calculated. If it is, it returns the value. If not, it checks if lim is less than or equal to 1. If it is, it returns 0.
Otherwise, it calculates the value of sum[n][lim] as the sum of go(n, lim) and goSum(n, lim - 1) modulo 1e9 + 7.
Finally, it prints the value of answer as output.
