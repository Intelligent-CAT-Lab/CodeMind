<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes input from the user in the form of a string and splits it into two separate strings using the space as a delimiter. The first string is then parsed into an integer variable A and the second string is parsed into an integer variable B.

The code then checks three conditions:
1. If A is divisible by 3, it prints "Possible".
2. If B is divisible by 3, it prints "Possible".
3. If the sum of A and B is divisible by 3, it prints "Possible".

If none of the above conditions are true, it prints "Impossible".

In this case, A is 4 and B is 5. Neither A nor B is divisible by 3, and the sum of A and B is 9 which is divisible by 3. Therefore, the output will be "Possible".
<<<Output>>>
Possible
