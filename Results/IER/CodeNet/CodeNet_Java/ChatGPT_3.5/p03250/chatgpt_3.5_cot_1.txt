The code takes three integers as input: a, b, and c. It then converts these integers into strings using the `valueOf` method. 

Next, it checks which of the three integers is the largest. If a is the largest, it checks if b is larger than c. If it is, it concatenates the strings StringA and StringB and adds c to the resulting integer value. If b is not larger than c, it concatenates the strings StringA and StringC and adds b to the resulting integer value.

If b is the largest, it checks if a is larger than c. If it is, it concatenates the strings StringB and StringA and adds c to the resulting integer value. If a is not larger than c, it concatenates the strings StringB and StringC and adds a to the resulting integer value.

If neither a nor b is the largest, it checks if a is larger than b. If it is, it concatenates the strings StringC and StringA and adds b to the resulting integer value. If a is not larger than b, it concatenates the strings StringC and StringB and adds a to the resulting integer value.

Finally, it prints the resulting integer value as the output.

In this case, a=1, b=5, and c=2. Since b is the largest, and a is smaller than c, it concatenates the strings "5" and "2" and adds 1 to the resulting integer value. Therefore, the output would be 52+1=53.
