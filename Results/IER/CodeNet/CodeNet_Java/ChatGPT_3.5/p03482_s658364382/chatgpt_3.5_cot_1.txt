<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string `S` and calculates the length of the longest substring in `S` that is symmetric around its center. It does this by iterating through the string and checking if the characters on the left and right sides of the center are the same. If they are, it expands the substring and continues checking until it reaches the ends of the string or the characters are not the same.

In this case, the input string is "010". The length of the string is 3. Since the length is odd, it enters the else block of the `centerLength` method. It sets the center character to be '1' and initializes the left and right pointers to be the indices before and after the center character respectively. It also initializes the length to be 1.

The while loop checks if the left pointer is greater than or equal to 0 and if the characters at the left and right pointers are the same. In this case, the left pointer is 0 and the characters at indices 0 and 2 are not the same, so the loop exits.

Finally, the code calculates the output by subtracting the length of the longest symmetric substring from the length of the input string and dividing by 2. In this case, the length of the longest symmetric substring is 1, so the output is (3 - 1) / 2 = 1.
