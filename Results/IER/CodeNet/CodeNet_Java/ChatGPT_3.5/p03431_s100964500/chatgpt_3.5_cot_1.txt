The variable n is initialized with 2 and variable K is initialized with 4 according to the input. The variable mod is initialized with 998244353. The variable fif is initialized with the result of calling the enumFIF method with parameters 1000005 and mod. The variable ans is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from n to K to check each integer one in this range. The value of variable one is also passed to variable bal. Inside the for loop, it checks the value of bal. If bal is greater than or equal to n, it adds the result of calling the C method with parameters K, one, mod and fif to ans. If bal is greater than 0, it calculates the values of variables zero, x and y. It adds the result of calling the C method with parameters K, one, mod and fif to ans. If y is greater than or equal to 0 and x is greater than or equal to 0, it subtracts the result of calling the C method with parameters x+y, y, mod and fif from ans. If bal is equal to 0, it adds the result of subtracting the result of calling the C method with parameters 2*(K/2)-1, K/2-1, mod and fif from the result of calling the C method with parameters 2*(K/2)-1, n-2, mod and fif to ans. After the loop finishes, it takes the modulo of ans with mod and assigns the result back to ans. If ans is less than 0, it adds mod to ans. Finally, it prints the value of ans.
