<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 2 according to the input. 
The code then creates an empty list called pos.
It then enters a series of for loops to populate the list pos with integers based on the value of n.
The first for loop iterates from 0 to n-1 with a step of 6. Inside this loop, it enters another for loop that iterates from 1 to n-1 with a step of 2. It adds the value of (i*n + j) to the list pos.
The second for loop iterates from 3 to n-1 with a step of 6. Inside this loop, it enters another for loop that iterates from 0 to n-1 with a step of 2. It adds the value of (i*n + j) to the list pos.
The third for loop iterates from 1 to n-1 with a step of 6. It adds the value of (i*n) to the list pos.
The fourth for loop iterates from 5 to n-1 with a step of 6. It adds the value of (i*n) to the list pos.
After the for loops, it checks if the value of (n-1)%6 is equal to 2. If it is, it enters another for loop that iterates from 1 to n-1 with a step of 2. It adds the value of ((n-1)*n + j) to the list pos.
After that, it checks if the value of (n-1)%6 is equal to 5. If it is, it enters another for loop that iterates from 2 to n-1 with a step of 2. It adds the value of ((n-1)*n + j) to the list pos.
Then it creates an empty set called used.
It prints the size of the list pos as output.
Then it enters a for loop that iterates over each element t in the list pos. Inside the loop, it calculates the values of i and j based on the value of t. It prints the values of j and i as output. It also checks if the value of t is already in the set used. If it is, it prints "NyaN" and returns.
Finally, it flushes the output.
