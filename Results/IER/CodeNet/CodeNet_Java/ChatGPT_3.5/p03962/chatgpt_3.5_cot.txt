<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads three integers from the input and adds them to a HashSet called paintCans. Since a HashSet does not allow duplicate elements, it will only store unique values. After adding the three integers, it prints the size of the HashSet, which represents the number of unique elements in it. In this case, the input is "3 1 4", so the HashSet will contain three unique integers: 3, 1, and 4. Therefore, the size of the HashSet will be 3.
