<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a HashSet called paintCans to store unique values. It then reads three integers from the input and adds them to the paintCans set. Since a set only stores unique values, any duplicate values will be ignored. Finally, it prints the size of the paintCans set, which represents the number of unique values in the set.

In this case, the input is "3 1 4". The code will add these three integers to the paintCans set. Since all three integers are unique, the set will contain all three values. Therefore, the size of the set will be 3.

<<<Output>>>
3
