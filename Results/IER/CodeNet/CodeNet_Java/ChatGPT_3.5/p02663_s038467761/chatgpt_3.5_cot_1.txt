<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes 5 integers as input: H1, M1, H2, M2, and K.
It calculates the difference in minutes between the two given times (H2-H1)*60+(M2-M1) and subtracts K from it.
Finally, it prints the result as output.
In this case, the difference between the two times is 300 minutes (15:00 - 10:00 = 5 hours = 300 minutes), and K is 30.
So, the output would be 270 (300 - 30).
<<<Output>>>
