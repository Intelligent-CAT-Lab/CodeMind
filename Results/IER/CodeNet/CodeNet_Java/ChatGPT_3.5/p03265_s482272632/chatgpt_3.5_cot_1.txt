<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four integers as input: x1, y1, x2, and y2. The input values are 0, 0, 0, and 1 respectively.
It then calculates the differences between x2 and x1, and y2 and y1, and stores them in the variables diffX and diffY.
Next, it calculates the values of x3 and y3 by subtracting diffY from x2 and adding diffX to y2.
Finally, it calculates the values of x4 and y4 by subtracting diffX from x3 and subtracting diffY from y3.
The code then prints the values of x3, y3, x4, and y4 as output, separated by spaces.
Based on the given input, the values of x3, y3, x4, and y4 would be 1, 0, 1, and -1 respectively.
<<<Output>>>
1 0 1 -1
