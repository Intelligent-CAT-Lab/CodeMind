The variable N is initialized with 1 and variable M is initialized with 6 according to the input. And variable res is initialized with 0.
It checks if N*2 is greater than or equal to M. In this case, N*2 is 2 and M is 6, so the condition is not met.
Therefore, it goes to the else block and calculates the value of res as N+((M-2*N)/4). 
Here, M-2*N is 6-2*1 = 4. So, (M-2*N)/4 is 4/4 = 1. 
Therefore, res is N+1 = 1+1 = 2.
Finally, it prints the value of res as output, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
