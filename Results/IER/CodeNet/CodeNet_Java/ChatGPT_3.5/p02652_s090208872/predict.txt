The code reads a string input and stores it in an array of characters called 's'. It then initializes two 2D arrays 'l2r' and 'r2l' with size [2][n], where n is the length of the input string. It also initializes three variables 'ans1', 'ans2', and 'ans3' with 0.

The code then calls the 'solve' method twice, once with the character '0' and once with the character '1', passing the input string, its length, the character, and the 'l2r' and 'r2l' arrays as parameters. The 'solve' method calculates the maximum length of consecutive characters equal to the given character in the input string and stores it in the 'l2r' array. It also calculates the maximum length of consecutive characters equal to the given character in the reverse order of the input string and stores it in the 'r2l' array. The 'solve' method returns the maximum length of consecutive characters.

After calling the 'solve' method, the code checks if the lengths returned by the 'solve' method for '0' and '1' are equal. If they are equal and the maximum length of consecutive characters equal to '0' in the 'l2r' array at index 'i' is equal to the maximum length of consecutive characters equal to '0' in the 'r2l' array at index 'i' and the maximum length of consecutive characters equal to '1' in the 'suffix' array at index '1' and 'i' is greater than 0, then it updates 'ans3' to the maximum of 'ans1 + 1', 'ans2 + 1', and 'ans3'. It also checks if the maximum length of consecutive characters equal to '0' in the 'l2r' array at index 'i' is equal to the maximum length of consecutive characters equal to '0' in the 'suffix' array at index '0' and the maximum length of consecutive characters equal to '1' in the 'suffix' array at index '1' and 'i' is greater than 0, then it updates 'ans3' to the maximum of 'ans1 + 1', 'ans2 + 1', and 'ans3'. It also checks if the maximum length of consecutive characters equal to '1' in the 'l2r' array at index 'i' is equal to the maximum length of consecutive characters equal to '1' in the 'suffix' array at index '1' and 'i' is greater than 0, then it updates 'ans3' to the maximum of 'ans1 + 1', 'ans2 + 1', and 'ans3'. It also checks if the lengths returned by the 'solve' method for '0' and '1' are equal and the maximum length of consecutive characters equal to '1' in the 'l2r' array at index 'i' is equal to the maximum length of consecutive characters equal to '1' in the 'r2l' array at index 'i' and the maximum length of consecutive characters equal to '0' in the 'suffix' array at index '0' and 'i' is greater than 0, then it updates 'ans3' to the maximum of 'ans1 + 1', 'ans2 + 1', and 'ans3'.

After that, the code iterates from the last character of the input string to the first character. If the current character is not a question mark, it checks if the lengths returned by the 'solve' method for '0' and '1' are equal and the maximum length of consecutive characters equal to '0' in the 'l2r' array at index 'i' is equal to the maximum length of consecutive characters equal to '0' in the 'r2l' array at index 'i' and the maximum length of consecutive characters equal to '1' in the 'suffix' array at index '1' and 'i' is greater than 0, then it updates 'ans3' to the maximum of 'ans1 + 1', 'ans2 + 1', and 'ans3'. It also checks if the maximum length of consecutive characters equal to '0' in the 'l2r' array at index 'i' is equal to the maximum length of consecutive characters equal to '0' in the 'suffix' array at index '0' and the maximum length of consecutive characters equal to '1' in the 'suffix' array at index '1' and 'i' is greater than 0, then it updates 'ans3' to the maximum of 'ans1 + 1', 'ans2 + 1', and 'ans3'. It also checks if the
