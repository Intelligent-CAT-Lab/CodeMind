<<<Analysis>>>
The variable k is initialized with 2 according to the input. 
It checks if k is equal to 1. Since k is not equal to 1, it continues to the next step.
It calculates the value of variable n using the formula 2 * ((k+3)/4). In this case, k+3 = 5 and (k+3)/4 = 1. So n = 2 * 1 = 2.
It calculates the value of variable curt using the formula n*2 - k. In this case, curt = 2*2 - 2 = 2.
It initializes a 2D array mat with size n x n.
It enters a nested for loop to fill the elements of the array mat.
For each element at position (r, c), it checks if r is odd and (r+c)%n is less than n - curt. If the condition is true, it assigns the value n + (r+c)%n + 1 to mat[r][c]. Otherwise, it assigns the value (r+c)%n + 1 to mat[r][c].
After filling the array mat, it prints the value of variable n.
Then it enters another for loop to print each row of the array mat.
Finally, it prints an empty line.
