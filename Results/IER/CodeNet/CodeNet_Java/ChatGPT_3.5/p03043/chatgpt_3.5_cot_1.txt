<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers N and K from the input. It then calls the `calc` method to calculate the value of `cnt` for each value of `i` from 1 to N. The `calc` method calculates the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to K, and returns it. It also multiplies `cnt` by `N` and takes the reciprocal of the product. This value is added to `ans` for each value of `i`. Finally, the value of `ans` is printed as the output.
In this case, N = 3 and K = 10. The `calc` method is called with `i` values of 1, 2, and 3. For `i = 1`, `cnt` is calculated as 16 and `wk` is calculated as 1 / (16 * 3) = 0.020833333333333332. For `i = 2`, `cnt` is calculated as 16 and `wk` is calculated as 1 / (16 * 3) = 0.020833333333333332. For `i = 3`, `cnt` is calculated as 16 and `wk` is calculated as 1 / (16 * 3) = 0.020833333333333332. The final value of `ans` is the sum of these three values, which is 0.0625.
