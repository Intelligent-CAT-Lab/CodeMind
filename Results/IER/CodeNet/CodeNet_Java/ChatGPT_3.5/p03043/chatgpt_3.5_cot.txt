<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers N and K as input. It then calls the `calc` method with K and i as arguments, where i ranges from 1 to N. The `calc` method calculates the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to K, starting from i. It does this by multiplying val by 2 and ans by 2 in each iteration until val is greater than or equal to K. The method returns the value of ans.

In the `solve` method, for each value of i from 1 to N, it calculates the value of cnt by calling the `calc` method with K and i as arguments. It then calculates the value of wk as 1 divided by (cnt * N). Finally, it adds wk to the variable ans.

The final value of ans is printed as the output.
