The code reads the input values N, A, B, C, and D using the FastScanner class.
Then it calls the solve() method to calculate the answer.
Inside the solve() method, it initializes the COMB object of the FermatCombination class with a size of 1000 and a mod value of 1_000_000_007.
It also initializes the MEMO array with size N+2 and fills it with the value EMP (-2).
Then it calls the dfs() method with parameters N and A to calculate the answer.
Inside the dfs() method, it checks if the value of MEMO[n][g] is not EMP. If it is not EMP, it returns the value stored in MEMO[n][g].
Otherwise, it calls the _dfs() method with parameters n and g to calculate the answer.
Inside the _dfs() method, it checks if n is equal to 0. If it is, it returns 1.
It also checks if g is greater than B. If it is, it returns INF (-1).
Then it calculates the value of ans_g by performing a series of calculations using the comb() method of the COMB object and the dfs() method recursively.
If the value of ans_g is greater than 0, it assigns it to the variable ans_g. Otherwise, it assigns INF to ans_g.
Then it calculates the value of ans_h by calling the dfs() method recursively with parameters n and g+1.
Finally, it checks the values of ans_g and ans_h and returns their sum modulo MOD (1_000_000_007) if both values are not INF. Otherwise, it returns INF.
The solve() method returns the final answer and it is printed as the output.
