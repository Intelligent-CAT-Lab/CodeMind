<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers H and W as input. It checks if either H or W is divisible by 3. If either of them is divisible by 3, it prints 0 and returns.
If neither H nor W is divisible by 3, it calculates the values of h1, h2, w1, and w2 based on the values of H and W.
Then it calculates the values of a1, a2, and a3 based on the values of W and h1/h2.
It calculates the value of cur as the maximum difference between the products of a1*H, a2, and a3 and the minimum difference between the products of a1*H, a2, and a3.
Then it increments the value of a1 and recalculates the values of a2 and a3. It updates the value of cur if the new difference is smaller than the previous one.
Next, it calculates the values of a1, a2, and a3 based on the values of H and w1/w2.
It updates the value of cur if the new difference is smaller than the previous one.
Finally, it calculates the minimum value between cur and the minimum of H and W and prints it as the output.
