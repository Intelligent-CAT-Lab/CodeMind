<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads four long integers L, A, B, and M from the input. It then sets the value of MOD to M.
If L is equal to 1, it prints the value of A modulo M and returns.
Otherwise, it initializes an array didx of size 19 with all elements set to 0.
Then, it iterates from 1 to 18 and calculates the value of didx[i] by calling the findDigit method with parameters A, B, L, and i+1.
Next, it initializes a 2D array a with a single row and three columns. The first element of the row is set to 0, the second element is set to A modulo M, and the third element is set to 1.
It also initializes a variable ten to 1.
Then, it iterates from 0 to 17 and updates the value of a by multiplying it with a matrix b.
The matrix b is a 3x3 matrix with the following elements:
- The first row contains the value of ten, 0, and 0.
- The second row contains the value of 1, 1, and 0.
- The third row contains the value of 0, B modulo M, and 1.
The matrix b is raised to the power of didx[i+1] - didx[i] + (didx[i] == 0 ? 1 : 0) using the pow method.
Finally, it prints the value of a[0][0].
