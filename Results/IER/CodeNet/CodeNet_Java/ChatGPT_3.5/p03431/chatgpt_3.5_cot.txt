<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers n and k as input. It then calculates the value of ans based on the values of n and k. The value of ans is then printed as the output.
The code uses a combination formula to calculate the value of ans. It uses the comb() method to calculate the combination of two numbers. The comb() method uses the fact[] and ifact[] arrays to calculate the combination.
The code iterates over the values of diff from k%2 to k with a step of 2. Inside the loop, it calculates the values of nr and nb based on the value of diff. It then checks if nr is less than n. If it is, it continues to the next iteration of the loop.
If diff is 0, it calculates the value of ans based on the combination of k-1 and nr, and the combination of k-1 and nb-1-(nr-n+1).
If diff is not 0, it calculates the values of r2 and b2 based on the value of diff and nr-n. It then calculates the value of ans based on the combination of nr+nb and nb, and the combination of r2+b2 and r2.
The final value of ans is printed as the output.
