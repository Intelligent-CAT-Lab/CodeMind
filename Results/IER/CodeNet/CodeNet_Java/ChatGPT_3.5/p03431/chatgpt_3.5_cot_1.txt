<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers n and k from the input. It then calculates the factorial and inverse factorial arrays using the Factorials class. 
It initializes the variable ans to 0. 
Then it enters a for loop with variable diff starting from k % 2 and incrementing by 2 until it reaches k. 
Inside the loop, it calculates the values of nr and nb based on diff and k. 
If nr is less than n, it continues to the next iteration of the loop. 
If diff is 0, it calculates the value of ans by subtracting the combination of (k-1, nb-1-(nr-n+1)) from the combination of (k-1, nr). 
Otherwise, it calculates the values of r2 and b2 based on diff and nr-n. 
It then calculates the value of ans by subtracting the combination of (r2+b2, r2) from the combination of (nr+nb, nb). 
Finally, it prints the value of ans as the output.
