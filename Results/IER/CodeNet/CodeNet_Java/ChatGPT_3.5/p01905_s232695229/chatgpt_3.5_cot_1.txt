<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and variable m are initialized with 2 and 0 respectively according to the input. 
Then it creates an array a of size m and an array b of size n.
Since m is 0, the for loop to populate array a is not executed.
Then it initializes all elements of array b with -1 at the indices specified by array a.
Since array a is empty, the for loop to populate array b is not executed.
Then it calls the recursive function rec with parameters b, 0 and n.
Inside the recursive function, it checks if the difference between right and left is 2. Since n is 2, the condition is met.
Then it checks if both elements at indices left and left+1 in array b are -1. Since array b is empty, the condition is not met.
Then it checks if either element at indices left or left+1 in array b is -1. Since array b is empty, the condition is not met.
Finally, it returns 1.
After the recursive function call, it prints the returned value, which is 1.
