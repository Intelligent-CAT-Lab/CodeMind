<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two long integers X and Y as input. It initializes a variable i with 0.
Then it enters a while loop which continues until X becomes greater than Y.
Inside the loop, it increments the value of i by 1 and multiplies X by 2.
The loop continues until X becomes greater than Y.
Finally, it prints the value of i as the output.
In this case, X is 3 and Y is 20.
The loop will run 4 times because X will become 6, 12, 24, and 48.
After the loop finishes, the value of i will be 4.
<<<Output>>>
4
