<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two long integers X and Y as input. It initializes a variable i with 0.
Then it enters a while loop which continues until X becomes greater than Y.
Inside the loop, it increments the value of i by 1 and multiplies X by 2.
The loop continues until X becomes greater than Y.
Finally, it prints the value of i as the output.
In this case, X starts with 3 and it is multiplied by 2 in each iteration of the loop until it becomes greater than 20.
So, the loop runs for 4 iterations and the value of i becomes 4.
<<<Output>>>
4
