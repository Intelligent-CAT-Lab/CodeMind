<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 4 and variable x is initialized with 4 according to the input. The variables left and right are initialized with 1 and 7 respectively.
Since n is not equal to 2, it does not enter the if condition.
Then it checks if the condition x + 1 <= right && left <= x - 2 is true. Since x is 4, the condition is not true.
Then it checks if the condition x + 2 <= right && left <= x - 1 is true. Since x is 4, the condition is not true.
Finally, it prints "No" as output.
<<<Output>>>
