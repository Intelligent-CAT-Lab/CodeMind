<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input `s` and performs some calculations based on its value.
First, it calculates the square root of `s` using the `sqrtL` method.
If the square of the calculated square root is equal to `s`, it means that `s` is a perfect square. In this case, it prints the square root value followed by three sets of 0s.
Otherwise, it calculates the difference between the square of the square root and `s` and assigns it to variable `t`.
Then, it prints the square root value followed by 1, `t`, and three sets of 0s.
<<<Output>>>
2 1 1 2 0 0
