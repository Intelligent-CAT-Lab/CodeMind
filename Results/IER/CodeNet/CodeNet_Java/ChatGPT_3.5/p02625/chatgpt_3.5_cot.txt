<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a variable num with the value 1000000007. It then initializes an array fact of size 500001 and sets the first element to 1. It also initializes a variable ans1 to 1. It then enters a for loop that iterates from 1 to 500000. In each iteration, it calculates ans1 as (ans1 * i) % num and assigns it to fact[i]. This loop calculates the factorial of each number from 1 to 500000 and stores it in the fact array.

Next, it initializes another array inv of size 500001 and sets the first element to 1. It enters another for loop that iterates from 1 to 500000. In each iteration, it calculates inv[i] as the modular inverse of fact[i] using the power function. The power function calculates x^y % mod using a while loop. This loop calculates the modular inverse of each factorial in the fact array and stores it in the inv array.

Then, it reads two integers n and m from the input. It calculates ans as fact[m] * inv[m-n] % num. This calculates the number of ways to choose n elements from a set of m elements.

Next, it initializes a variable anss to 0 and a variable pos to 1. It enters a for loop that iterates from 1 to n. In each iteration, it calculates prod as the product of several factors using the fact and inv arrays. It then adds prod to anss and updates pos as -pos. This loop calculates the sum of several products based on the values of n, m, and pos.

Finally, it calculates actualans as ans^2 - anss * ans % num. This calculates the final answer by subtracting the product of anss and ans from the square of ans.

The code then prints the value of actualans as the output.
