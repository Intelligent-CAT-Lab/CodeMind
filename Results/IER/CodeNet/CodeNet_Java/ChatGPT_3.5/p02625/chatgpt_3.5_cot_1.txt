<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a variable num with the value 1000000007 and creates an array fact of size 500001 to store factorial values. It then initializes the first element of fact as 1 and a variable ans1 as 1. It enters a for loop from 1 to 500000 and calculates the factorial of each number i and stores it in the fact array. It also calculates ans1 as the product of ans1 and i modulo num and stores it in the fact array. 

Next, it creates another array inv of size 500001 to store the inverse factorial values. It initializes the first element of inv as 1. It enters another for loop from 1 to 500000 and calculates the inverse factorial of each number i using the power function and stores it in the inv array.

Then, it reads two integers n and m from the input. It calculates ans as the product of fact[m] and inv[m-n] modulo num.

Next, it initializes a variable anss as 0 and a variable pos as 1. It enters a for loop from 1 to n and calculates prod as the product of several values including fact[n], inv[i], inv[n-i], fact[m-i], inv[m-n], and pos. It adds prod to anss and takes the modulo of num. It then updates pos as -pos.

After the loop, it calculates actualans as the product of ans and ans modulo num. It subtracts the product of anss and ans modulo num from actualans. It takes the modulo of num and adds num to actualans. Finally, it prints actualans as the output.
