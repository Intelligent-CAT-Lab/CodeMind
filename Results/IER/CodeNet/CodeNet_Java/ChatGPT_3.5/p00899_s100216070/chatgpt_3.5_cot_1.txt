The variable n is initialized with 3 according to the input. It enters a while loop and keeps iterating until n becomes 0.
Inside the while loop, it reads n strings from the input and stores them in an array called s.
Then it creates an empty ArrayList called list.
It iterates through each string in s and checks if there is any other string in s that contains the current string as a substring. If there is no such string, it adds the current string to the list.
After that, it updates the value of n to be the size of the list.
Then it creates a 2D array called pass with size n x n and initializes all its elements to 0.
It iterates through each pair of strings in the list and finds the longest common suffix between them. It stores the length of the suffix in the corresponding element of the pass array.
Next, it creates a 2D array called dp with size n x (2^n) and initializes all its elements to a large value (INF).
Then it iterates through each subset of the set of all possible subsets of the list (represented by a binary number) and for each subset, it iterates through each string in the list.
If the current string is not already included in the subset, it calculates the value of the next subset by adding the current string to the subset.
Then it calculates the value of the next subset by adding the current string to the subset and updates the corresponding element of the dp array with the minimum value between its current value and the sum of the current value of dp[j][i] and the value of pass[j][k].
Finally, it finds the minimum value in the last row of the dp array and prints it as the output.
