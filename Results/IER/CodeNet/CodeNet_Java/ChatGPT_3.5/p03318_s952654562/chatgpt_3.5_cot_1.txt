The variable n is initialized with 10 according to the input. And variable sunukeNum is initialized with 1.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 9 to check each integer i in this range. 
Inside the for loop, it converts the current value of sunukeNum to a string and assigns it to variable sunukeString.
Then it initializes variable min with the maximum value of double and variable sunukecand with 0.
It enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of sunukeString + 1. 
Inside this loop, it creates a string nine which is a string of 9s with length j.
Then it creates a string compose by concatenating the substring of sunukeString from index 0 to sunukeString.length() - j with the string nine.
Then it parses the string compose to a long and multiplies it with the result of calling the calc method with the parsed long as argument. The result is assigned to variable sunukecandidate.
If the value of min is greater than sunukecandidate, it updates the value of min with sunukecandidate and updates the value of sunukecand with the parsed long compose.
After the loop finishes, it prints the value of sunukecand as output.
Then it updates the value of sunukeNum to sunukecand + 1.
The process repeats for 10 times.
