The variable N is initialized with 3 and variable M is initialized with 3 according to the input. A 3D array dp is created with dimensions [2][N+2][N+2]. The initial value of dp[0][1][1] is set to 1.
Then a for loop is executed from 0 to M-1. In each iteration, a new 2D array is created to store the updated values of dp. Then, a nested for loop is executed to update the values of dp based on the previous values.
Inside the nested for loop, the values of dp are updated using the formula:
dp[(i + 1) % 2][j][k] += dp[i % 2][j][k] * (k - j);
dp[(i + 1) % 2][k][k] += dp[i % 2][j][k] * j;
dp[(i + 1) % 2][j][k + 1] += dp[i % 2][j][k] * (N - k);
After the loop finishes, it prints the value of dp[M % 2][N][N] as output.
