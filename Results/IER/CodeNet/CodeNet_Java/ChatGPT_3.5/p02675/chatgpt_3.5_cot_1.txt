<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 16 according to the input.
It calculates the remainder of N divided by 10 using the modulus operator (%).
Then it uses a switch statement to check the value of the remainder.
If the remainder is 2, 4, 5, 7, or 9, it prints "hon".
If the remainder is 0, 1, 6, or 8, it prints "pon".
If the remainder is 3, it prints "bon".
In this case, the remainder of 16 divided by 10 is 6, so it will print "pon".
<<<Output>>>
pon
