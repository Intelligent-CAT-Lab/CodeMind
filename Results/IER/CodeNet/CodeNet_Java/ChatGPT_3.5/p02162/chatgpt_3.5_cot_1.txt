<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four integer inputs t1, t2, r1, and r2 using the Scanner class.
It then checks if r1 or r2 is equal to -1. If either of them is -1, it assigns the negative value of t1 to r1 and the negative value of t2 to r2.
Next, it checks if r1 is equal to r2. If they are equal, it prints "Draw".
If r1 is less than r2, it prints "Bob".
If r1 is greater than r2, it prints "Alice".
In this case, r1 is greater than r2, so the output will be "Alice".
<<<Output>>>
Alice
