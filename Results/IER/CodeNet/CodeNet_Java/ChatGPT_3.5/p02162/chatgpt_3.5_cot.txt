<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four integers as input: t1, t2, r1, and r2. It then checks if r1 or r2 is equal to -1. If either of them is -1, it assigns the negative value of t1 to r1 and the negative value of t2 to r2. 
After that, it checks if r1 is equal to r2. If they are equal, it prints "Draw". If r1 is less than r2, it prints "Bob". Otherwise, it prints "Alice".
In this case, the values of t1, t2, r1, and r2 are 9, 8, 1000, and 999 respectively. Since neither r1 nor r2 is -1, the code does not change their values. 
Then it checks if r1 is equal to r2. Since r1 is greater than r2, it prints "Alice".
<<<Output>>>
Alice
