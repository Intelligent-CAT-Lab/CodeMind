<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads an integer value from the input and stores it in the variable `n`. 
If `n` is equal to 1, it prints "Hello World". 
Otherwise, it reads two more integer values from the input and stores them in variables `a` and `b`. 
Then it prints the sum of `a` and `b`. 
Finally, it closes the scanner. 

In this case, the input value is 1. So, the code will print "Hello World".

<<<Output>>>
Hello World
