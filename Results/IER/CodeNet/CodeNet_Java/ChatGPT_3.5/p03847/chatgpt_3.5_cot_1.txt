The variable N is initialized with 3 according to the input. The variable MOD is initialized with 1000000007. The variable n is an array of size 61, which will store the binary representation of N. The for loop iterates from 0 to 60 and assigns the remainder of N divided by 2 to the corresponding index of the array n. Then N is divided by 2. This process converts N to its binary representation.

The variable dp is a 2D array of size 61x3. The first row of dp is initialized based on the value of n[60]. If n[60] is 0, then dp[60][0] is set to 1. Otherwise, dp[60][0] and dp[60][1] are set to 1.

Then there is a nested for loop that iterates from 59 to 0. Inside this loop, the value of dp[i][2] is calculated as 3 times the value of dp[i+1][2]. Then there is another nested for loop that iterates from 0 to 2. Inside this loop, the variable c is calculated as 2 plus the value of n[i] minus j. If c is greater than or equal to 2, then dp[i][2] is updated by adding the value of dp[i+1][1]. Otherwise, dp[i][c] is updated by adding the value of dp[i+1][1].

After that, there is another nested for loop that iterates from 0 to 2. Inside this loop, the variable c is calculated as the value of n[i] minus j. If c is less than 0, then nothing happens. Otherwise, dp[i][c] is updated by adding the value of dp[i+1][0].

Finally, the variable ans is calculated as the sum of dp[0][0], dp[0][1], and dp[0][2]. The value of ans is then printed as the output.
