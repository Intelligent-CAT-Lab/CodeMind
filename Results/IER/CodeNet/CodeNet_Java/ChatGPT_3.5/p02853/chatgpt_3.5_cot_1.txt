<<<Analysis>>>
The variable X is initialized with 1 and variable Y is initialized with 1 according to the input. And variable ans is initialized with 0.
It checks if both X and Y are equal to 1. If they are, it assigns the value 1000000 to variable ans.
If X is equal to 1, it adds 300000 to variable ans.
If Y is equal to 1, it adds 300000 to variable ans.
If X is equal to 2, it adds 200000 to variable ans.
If Y is equal to 2, it adds 200000 to variable ans.
If X is equal to 3, it adds 100000 to variable ans.
If Y is equal to 3, it adds 100000 to variable ans.
After all the conditions are checked, it prints the final value of variable ans as output, which is 1000000.
<<<Output>>>
