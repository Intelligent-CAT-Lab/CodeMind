<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers X and Y as input. It initializes the variable ans with 0.
It checks if X is equal to 1 and Y is equal to 1. If both conditions are true, it assigns the value 1000000 to ans.
If the above condition is not true, it checks if X is equal to 1 and adds 300000 to ans if it is true.
Then it checks if Y is equal to 1 and adds 300000 to ans if it is true.
Then it checks if X is equal to 2 and adds 200000 to ans if it is true.
Then it checks if Y is equal to 2 and adds 200000 to ans if it is true.
Then it checks if X is equal to 3 and adds 100000 to ans if it is true.
Then it checks if Y is equal to 3 and adds 100000 to ans if it is true.
Finally, it prints the value of ans as the output.
In this case, X=1 and Y=1, so the condition X==1 and Y==1 is true and ans is assigned the value 1000000.
<<<Output>>>
1000000
