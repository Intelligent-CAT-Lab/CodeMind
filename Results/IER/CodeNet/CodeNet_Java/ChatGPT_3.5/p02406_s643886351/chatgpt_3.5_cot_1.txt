<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 30 according to the input. And a StringBuilder object count is created to store the numbers that meet the conditions.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 30 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable x.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current integer i is divisible by 3. If it is, it appends the current integer i to the StringBuilder object count and continues to the next iteration.
If the current integer i is not divisible by 3, it enters a do-while loop. In the do-while loop, it checks if the last digit of the current integer x is equal to 3. If it is, it appends the current integer i to the StringBuilder object count and breaks out of the loop.
If the last digit of the current integer x is not equal to 3, it divides the current integer x by 10 to remove the last digit and continues the loop until x becomes 0.
After the loop finishes, it prints the StringBuilder object count as output, which contains the numbers that meet the conditions.
