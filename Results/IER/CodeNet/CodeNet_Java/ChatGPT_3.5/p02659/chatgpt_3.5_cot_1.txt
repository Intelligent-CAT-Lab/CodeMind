<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs: a long integer a and a double b. It then converts the double b to a long bb by multiplying it by 100 and adding 0.1. 
Next, it calculates the product of a and bb and divides it by 100 to get the final answer. 
Finally, it prints the value of ans as the output.
In this case, a is 198 and b is 1.10. 
bb is calculated as (long)((double)100 * 1.10 + 0.1) = (long)(110.0 + 0.1) = (long)110.1 = 110.
ans is calculated as (198 * 110) / 100 = 21780 / 100 = 217.
<<<Output>>>
217
