<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs: a long integer a and a double b. It then converts the double b to a long integer bb by multiplying it by 100 and adding 0.1. 
Next, it calculates the product of a and bb and divides it by 100 to get the final answer. 
Finally, it prints the value of ans as the output.
In this case, the input values are 198 and 1.10. 
The value of bb would be (long)((double)100 * 1.10 + 0.1) = (long)(110.0 + 0.1) = (long)110.1 = 110. 
The value of ans would be (198 * 110) / 100 = 217.8. 
Therefore, the output would be 217.
