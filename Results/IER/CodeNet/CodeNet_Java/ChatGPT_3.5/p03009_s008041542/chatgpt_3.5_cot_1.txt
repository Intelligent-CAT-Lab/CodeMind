<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads three integers n, h, and d from the input. It also initializes a variable mod with the value 1e9 + 7.
Then it initializes an array dp of size h+1 with all elements set to 0, and sets dp[0] to 1.
Next, it initializes two variables fs and f to 0 and 1 respectively.
Then it enters a for loop that iterates from 1 to n. In each iteration, it multiplies f by i and takes the modulo mod. It also adds f to fs and takes the modulo mod.
After the for loop, it initializes a variable sum to 0.
Then it enters another for loop that iterates from 1 to h. In each iteration, it adds dp[i-1] to sum and takes the modulo mod. It sets dp[i] to sum.
If i is greater than or equal to d, it subtracts dp[i-d] from sum and takes the modulo mod.
Then it multiplies dp[i] by fs and takes the modulo mod.
After the for loop, it initializes a variable ret to 0.
Then it enters another for loop that iterates from 1 to d. In each iteration, it adds dp[h-i] to ret and takes the modulo mod.
Finally, it prints the value of ret multiplied by f modulo mod.
