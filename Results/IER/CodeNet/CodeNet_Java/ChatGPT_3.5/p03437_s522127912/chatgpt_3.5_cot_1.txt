<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a class Answer inside the Main class. The Answer class has two instance variables X and Y. It also has a solve() method that returns an integer. The solve() method checks if X is divisible by Y. If it is, it returns -1. Otherwise, it iterates from 2 to Integer.MAX_VALUE and checks if X multiplied by the current iteration value is not divisible by Y. If it finds such a value, it returns X multiplied by that value. If it doesn't find such a value, it returns -1.

In the main() method, an instance of the Answer class is created and its main() method is called. The main() method takes input using a FastScanner object and prints the result of calling the solve() method.

So, the code takes two integers as input, X and Y, and checks if there is a positive integer i such that X multiplied by i is not divisible by Y. If such an i exists, it prints X multiplied by i. Otherwise, it prints -1.

In the given input, X = 8 and Y = 6.

-1
