<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes an array `num` of size 100 to store Fibonacci numbers. It then enters a for loop that iterates from 0 to 99. Inside the loop, it checks the value of `i` and assigns the corresponding Fibonacci number to `num[i]`. The Fibonacci sequence starts with 2 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two numbers. After the loop finishes, it prints the value of `num[n]`, where `n` is the input value. In this case, `n` is 5. So the code will print the 5th Fibonacci number, which is 8.
<<<Output>>>
8
