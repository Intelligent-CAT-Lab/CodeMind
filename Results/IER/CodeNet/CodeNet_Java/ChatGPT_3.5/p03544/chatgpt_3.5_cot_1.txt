<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 5 according to the input. An array num of size 100 is created to store the Fibonacci sequence.
The for loop iterates from 0 to 99. In each iteration, it checks the value of i. If i is 0, it assigns 2 to num[i]. If i is 1, it assigns 1 to num[i].
For all other values of i, it calculates the Fibonacci number by adding the previous two numbers in the sequence (num[i-1] and num[i-2]).
After the loop finishes, it prints the value of num[n] as output, which is the nth Fibonacci number.
In this case, num[5] is 8, so the output would be 8.
<<<Output>>>
8
