<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads three strings A, B, and C from the input. It then checks if the last character of string A is equal to the first character of string B, and if the last character of string B is equal to the first character of string C. If both conditions are true, it prints "YES", otherwise it prints "NO".
In this case, the last character of string A is 'a', the first character of string B is 'g', and the last character of string B is 'a'. Therefore, the conditions are not met and the output will be "NO".
<<<Output>>>
NO
