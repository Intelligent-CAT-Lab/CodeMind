The code takes two integers X and Y as input. It initializes a variable i with 0.
Then it enters a while loop with the condition ((X-1)*i +1 )<Y. In each iteration of the loop, it increments the value of i by 1.
The loop continues until the condition ((X-1)*i +1 )<Y is false. This means that it will continue until ((X-1)*i +1 ) is greater than or equal to Y.
After the loop finishes, it prints the value of i as output.
In this case, X is 4 and Y is 10. The loop will iterate until ((4-1)*i +1 ) is greater than or equal to 10.
Let's calculate the value of ((4-1)*i +1 ) for each iteration of the loop:
- For i = 0, ((4-1)*0 +1 ) = 1, which is less than 10.
- For i = 1, ((4-1)*1 +1 ) = 4, which is less than 10.
- For i = 2, ((4-1)*2 +1 ) = 7, which is less than 10.
- For i = 3, ((4-1)*3 +1 ) = 10, which is equal to 10. The condition is no longer true, so the loop stops.
Therefore, the value of i at the end of the loop is 3.
