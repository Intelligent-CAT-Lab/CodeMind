<<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized with the input string `<>>`. 
The variable n is initialized with the length of string s.
The array a is initialized with size n+1.
The first for loop iterates from 0 to n-1. It checks each character of string s. If the character is '<', it updates the value of a[i+1] to be the maximum of a[i+1] and a[i]+1.
The second for loop iterates from 0 to n-1. It checks each character of string s in reverse order. If the character is '>', it updates the value of a[n-1-i] to be the maximum of a[n-1-i] and a[n-i]+1.
Finally, it prints the sum of all elements in array a as output.
