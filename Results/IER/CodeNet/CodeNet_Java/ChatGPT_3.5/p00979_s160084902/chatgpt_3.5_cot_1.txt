<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads an input integer `t` using the `FastScanner` class. It then initializes a variable `ans` with the value 1. It subtracts 1 from `t` and assigns the result to `t`. It calculates the number of groups of 3 that can be formed from `t` by dividing `t` by 3 and assigns the result to `three`. It adds the remainder of `t` divided by 3 to `ans`. 

Then, it enters a while loop that continues as long as `three` is greater than or equal to 2. Inside the loop, it adds 2 to `ans`, subtracts 2 from `three`, and adds the remainder of `three` divided by 3 to `ans`. It then divides `three` by 3.

Finally, it adds the value of `three` to `ans` and prints the value of `ans` as the output.
