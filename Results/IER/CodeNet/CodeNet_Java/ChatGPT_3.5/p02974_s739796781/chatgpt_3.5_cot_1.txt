The variable N is initialized with 3 and variable K is initialized with 2 according to the input. The variable M is initialized with 1_000_000_007.
A 3-dimensional array dp is created with dimensions (N+1) x (N+1) x (K+1). All elements of dp are initialized with 0 except for dp[0][0][0] which is initialized with 1.
Then it enters a nested for loop. The outer loop iterates from 1 to N, the middle loop iterates from 0 to i, and the inner loop iterates from 2*j to K.
Inside the innermost loop, it performs several calculations based on the values of i, j, and k.
- If j is greater than 0, it assigns dp[i][j][k] the value of dp[i-1][j-1][k-2*j].
- It adds (2*j + 1) * dp[i-1][j][k-2*j] to dp[i][j][k] and takes the modulo M.
- If dp[i][j][k] is greater than or equal to M, it subtracts M from dp[i][j][k].
- If j is less than N, it adds (j+1) * (j+1) * dp[i-1][j+1][k-2*j] to dp[i][j][k] and takes the modulo M.
- If dp[i][j][k] is greater than or equal to M, it subtracts M from dp[i][j][k].
After the nested for loop finishes, it prints the value of dp[N][0][K] as the output.
