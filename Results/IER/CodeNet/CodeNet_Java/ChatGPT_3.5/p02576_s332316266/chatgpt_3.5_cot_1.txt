<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n, variable x and variable t are initialized with 20, 12 and 6 respectively according to the input. And variable ans is declared but not initialized.
It checks if n is divisible by x using the condition n%x == 0. If it is true, it calculates ans as (n/x) * t.
If the condition is false, it calculates the integer division of n by x and assigns it to variable m. Then it calculates ans as (m+1) * t.
Finally, it prints the value of ans as output.
In this case, n is not divisible by x, so the condition is false. The value of m is 1 and ans is calculated as (1+1) * 6 = 12.
<<<Output>>>
12
