<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input: a, b, and c. It then checks if the sum of a and b is greater than or equal to c. If it is, it assigns the value "Yes" to the variable cnt. Otherwise, it assigns the value "No" to cnt. Finally, it prints the value of cnt as the output.

In this case, the input values are 50, 100, and 120. The sum of 50 and 100 is 150, which is greater than 120. Therefore, the value of cnt will be "Yes".

<<<Output>>>
Yes
