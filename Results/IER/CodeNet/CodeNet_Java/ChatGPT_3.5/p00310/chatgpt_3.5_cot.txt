<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input: p, m, and c. It uses the Scanner class to read the input from the user. The values of p, m, and c are then parsed into integers using the parseInt() method. Finally, the sum of p, m, and c is printed as the output.
In this case, the input is "10 10 20". The first integer is assigned to p, the second integer is assigned to m, and the third integer is assigned to c. The sum of p, m, and c is then calculated as 10 + 10 + 20 = 40.
<<<Output>>>
40
