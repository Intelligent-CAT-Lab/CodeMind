<<<Analysis>>>
The variable x, variable k and variable d are initialized with 6, 2 and 4 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the absolute value of variable x and stores it in variable absX.
Then it checks if absX divided by d is greater than or equal to k. If it is, it subtracts k multiplied by d from absX and stores the result in variable ans.
If absX divided by d is less than k, it calculates the integer division of absX by d and stores it in variable sho, and calculates the remainder of absX divided by d and stores it in variable amari.
Then it checks if (k - sho) modulo 2 is equal to 0. If it is, it assigns the value of amari to ans. Otherwise, it assigns the value of d minus amari to ans.
Finally, it prints the value of ans as output.
