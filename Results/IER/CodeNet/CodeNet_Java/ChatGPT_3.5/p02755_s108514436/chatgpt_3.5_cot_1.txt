<<<Analysis>>>
The variable A is initialized with 2 and variable B is initialized with 2 according to the input. 
Then it calls the solve() method passing A and B as arguments.
Inside the solve() method, it initializes the variables low and high with 1 and Integer.MAX_VALUE respectively. It also initializes the variable ans with -1.
Then it enters a while loop which continues until low is less than or equal to high.
Inside the loop, it calculates the mid value as the average of low and high.
Then it calculates the consumption rate for mid with 8% and 10% by calling the consumptionRate() method.
If the calculated consumption rates are equal to A and B respectively, it updates the ans variable with mid and decreases the high value by 1.
If the calculated consumption rates are less than or equal to A and B respectively, it increases the low value by 1.
Otherwise, it decreases the high value by 1.
After the loop finishes, it returns the value of ans as the output.
In the main method, it prints the output returned by the solve() method.
