<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes two variables A and B with the input values 2 and 5 respectively. Then it checks if either A or B is greater than 9. Since both A and B are less than or equal to 9, the condition is not met and it proceeds to the next line. It then prints the product of A and B, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
