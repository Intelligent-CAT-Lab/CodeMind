<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read input from the console. It then reads two integers A and B from the input using the `nextInt()` method of the Scanner object.
Next, it checks if either A or B is greater than 9. If either of them is greater than 9, it prints -1 and returns from the method.
If both A and B are less than or equal to 9, it calculates the product of A and B and prints it as the output.
In this case, the values of A and B are 2 and 5 respectively, which are both less than or equal to 9. So, the code will calculate the product of 2 and 5, which is 10, and print it as the output.
<<<Output>>>
10
