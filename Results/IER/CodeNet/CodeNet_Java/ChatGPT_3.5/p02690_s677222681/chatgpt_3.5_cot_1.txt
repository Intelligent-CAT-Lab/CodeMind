<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input and assigns it to the variable x. Then it initializes two variables i and j with 0. 
It enters a nested for loop where i ranges from -100 to 999 and j ranges from -100 to 999. 
Inside the loop, it calculates the value of a by raising i to the power of 5 and the value of b by raising j to the power of 5. 
Then it checks if the difference between a and b is equal to x. If it is, it prints the values of i and j and returns from the function.
The loop continues until it finds a pair of values for i and j that satisfy the condition, or until it has checked all possible combinations of i and j.
If no pair of values is found, the code does not print anything.
