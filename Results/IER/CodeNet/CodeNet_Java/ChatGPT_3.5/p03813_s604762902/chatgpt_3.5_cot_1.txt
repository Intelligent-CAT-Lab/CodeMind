<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads an integer input using the Scanner class and stores it in variable a.
Then it checks if the value of a is greater than or equal to 1200. If it is, it prints "ARC". Otherwise, it prints "ABC".
In this case, the value of a is 1000, which is less than 1200. So the code will print "ABC".
<<<Output>>>
ABC
