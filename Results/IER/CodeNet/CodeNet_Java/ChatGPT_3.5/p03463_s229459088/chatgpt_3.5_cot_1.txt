<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three inputs n, a, and b using the Scanner class. It then checks if the difference between b and a is even or odd. If it is even, it prints "Alice", otherwise it prints "Borys".
In this case, the difference between b and a is 2, which is even. Therefore, the code will print "Alice".
<<<Output>>>
Alice
