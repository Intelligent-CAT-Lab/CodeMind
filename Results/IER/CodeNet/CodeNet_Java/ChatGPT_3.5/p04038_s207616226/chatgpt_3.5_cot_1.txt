<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 2 and variable k is initialized with 2 according to the input.
It checks if k is equal to 1. Since k is not equal to 1, it proceeds to the next step.
It initializes an array invs with length k+1 and sets invs[1] to 1.
Then it enters a for loop from i=2 to k and calculates the value of invs[i] using the formula (MODULO - (MODULO / i) * invs[((int) (MODULO % i))] % MODULO) % MODULO.
After that, it initializes a variable invProd to 1 and enters another for loop from i=1 to k-2.
Inside the loop, it calculates the value of invProd by multiplying invProd with invs[i] and taking modulo MODULO.
Then it initializes an array ways with a single element 1 and an array sufProds with length k-1.
It enters a for loop from i=1 to n-1.
Inside the loop, it initializes a new array nways with length ways.length+1 and a variable sum to 0.
Then it enters another for loop from newZ=nways.length to 1.
Inside the loop, it checks if newZ is greater than 1. If it is, it adds ways[newZ-2] to sum and takes modulo MODULO.
Then it calculates the value of need as (i+1)*k-newZ-1.
If upto is less than (need-(k-2)), it updates upto to need and initializes sufProds[0] to 1.
Then it enters another for loop from j=1 to sufProds.length and calculates the value of sufProds[j] using the formula sufProds[j] = sufProds[j-1] * (upto-j+1) % MODULO.
If upto is not less than (need-(k-2)), it multiplies prefProd with need and takes modulo MODULO.
Finally, it calculates the value of nways[newZ-1] using the formula nways[newZ-1] = (nways[newZ-1] + sum * prefProd % MODULO * sufProds[upto - (need - (k - 2))] % MODULO * invProd % MODULO) % MODULO.
After the loop finishes, it updates ways to nways.
Then it initializes a variable res to 0 and enters a for loop to calculate the value of res by adding each element in ways and taking modulo MODULO.
After the loop finishes, it enters another for loop from i=1 to n and calculates the value of res by multiplying res with i and taking modulo MODULO.
Finally, it prints the value of res as output.
