<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes variables X and Y with the input values 1 and 1 respectively. It also initializes the variable ans with 0.
Then it calculates the value of ans by adding the following:
- Math.max(0, 4 - X) * 100000: This calculates the maximum of 0 and (4 - X) and multiplies it by 100000. Since X is 1, the value of (4 - X) is 3. So, the first term becomes 300000.
- Math.max(0, 4 - Y) * 100000: This calculates the maximum of 0 and (4 - Y) and multiplies it by 100000. Since Y is 1, the value of (4 - Y) is 3. So, the second term becomes 300000.
- If X is 1 and Y is 1, it adds 400000 to ans. Since both X and Y are 1, this condition is satisfied and the third term becomes 400000.
Finally, it prints the value of ans, which is 1000000.
<<<Output>>>
1000000
