<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input and converts it into a character array. It then initializes an ArrayDeque and adds each character from the array to the deque. 

The code then initializes a variable 'ans' to 0 and a variable 'anum' to 0. 

The code enters a loop that continues until the deque is empty. Inside the loop, it checks the first character in the deque. If the character is 'A', it increments the 'anum' variable. If the character is 'B', it checks the next character in the deque. If the next character is 'C', it removes it from the deque and adds the value of 'anum' to 'ans'. If the next character is not 'C', it sets 'anum' to 0. If the character is not 'B', it sets 'anum' to 0.

After the loop finishes, it prints the value of 'ans' as the output.

In this case, the input is "ABCABC". The first character is 'A', so 'anum' is incremented to 1. The second character is 'B', so the next character is checked. The next character is 'C', so it is removed from the deque and 'anum' (which is 1) is added to 'ans'. The third character is 'A', so 'anum' is incremented to 1. The fourth character is 'B', so the next character is checked. The next character is 'C', so it is removed from the deque and 'anum' (which is 1) is added to 'ans'. The deque is now empty, so the loop ends. The value of 'ans' is 2, so that is the output.
