The variable n and variable k are initialized with 6 and 3 respectively according to the input. And variable total is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 6 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calls the search function passing num, k-1 and n as arguments.
In the search function, it checks if count is 0. If it is, it returns 1.
Then it checks if the dp HashMap contains the key num. If it does, it checks if the inner HashMap contains the key count. If it does, it returns the value associated with the key count.
If the above conditions are not met, it initializes the variable total with 0.
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from 2 to the maximum value that num * i * Math.pow(2, count - 1) can take without exceeding max.
Inside the for loop, it calls the search function recursively passing num * i, count - 1 and max as arguments and adds the returned value to total.
After the for loop finishes, it checks if the dp HashMap contains the key num. If it does, it adds the key count and value total to the inner HashMap.
If the dp HashMap does not contain the key num, it creates a new inner HashMap, adds the key count and value total to it, and adds the key num and the inner HashMap to the dp HashMap.
Finally, it returns the value of total.
After the loop finishes, it print the final value of variable total as output, which is 6.
