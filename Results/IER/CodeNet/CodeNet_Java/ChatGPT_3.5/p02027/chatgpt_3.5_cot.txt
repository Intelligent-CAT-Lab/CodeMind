The variable n is initialized with 6 and variable k is initialized with 3 according to the input. And variable total is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to n/k. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calls the search function passing num, k-1 and n as arguments.
In the search function, it checks if count is 0. If it is, it returns 1.
Then it checks if the dp HashMap contains the key num. If it does, it checks if the inner HashMap contains the key count. If it does, it returns the value associated with the key count.
If the above conditions are not met, it initializes the variable total with 0.
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from 2 to n/(num * Math.pow(2, count - 1)).
Inside the inner for loop, it calls the search function recursively passing num * i, count - 1 and n as arguments.
After the inner for loop finishes, it checks if the dp HashMap contains the key num. If it does, it puts the value total associated with the key count in the inner HashMap.
If the dp HashMap does not contain the key num, it creates a new inner HashMap, puts the value total associated with the key count in the inner HashMap and puts the inner HashMap in the dp HashMap associated with the key num.
Finally, it returns the value of total.
After the for loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable total as output.
