The variable a is initialized with 4 and variable b is initialized with 10 according to the input. The variable tap is initialized with 1 and variable ans is initialized with 0.
It enters a while loop and the condition is tap < b. Inside the loop, it adds a-1 to tap and increments ans by 1. This process continues until tap becomes greater than or equal to b.
In this case, the loop iterates 3 times and the value of tap becomes 10. So, the loop terminates. Finally, it prints the value of ans as output, which is 3.
