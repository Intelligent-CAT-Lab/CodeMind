<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 12 according to the input.
The code then calls the primeFactorize() method passing the value of n as an argument.
Inside the primeFactorize() method, it creates an instance of the Prime class passing the square root of n + 1 as an argument.
The Prime class has a sieve() method that uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to find all prime numbers up to n.
The sieve() method iterates from 2 to n and checks if the current number is prime. If it is, it adds it to the primes list and marks all its multiples as non-prime.
After the sieve() method finishes, the getPrimes() method returns the list of prime numbers.
Back in the primeFactorize() method, it initializes a TreeMap called ret to store the prime factors of n.
It then iterates through the list of prime numbers and checks if n is divisible by the current prime number.
If it is, it counts the number of times the current prime number divides n and adds it to the ret TreeMap.
Finally, if n is greater than 1, it means that n itself is a prime number and it adds it to the ret TreeMap.
The primeFactorize() method returns the ret TreeMap.
Back in the solve() method, it calls the primeFactorize() method passing the value of n as an argument and assigns the returned TreeMap to the map variable.
It then prints the value of n followed by a colon.
It iterates through the set of keys in the map TreeMap and for each key, it prints the key a number of times equal to its value in the map.
Finally, it prints a new line.
