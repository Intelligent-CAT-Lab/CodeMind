<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input `n` and then iterates from 0 to 2^n - 1. For each iteration, it converts the current number to binary and prints the indices of the set bits in that binary representation. 

For example, if `n` is 4, the code will iterate from 0 to 15 (2^4 - 1). For each iteration, it will convert the current number to binary and print the indices of the set bits.
