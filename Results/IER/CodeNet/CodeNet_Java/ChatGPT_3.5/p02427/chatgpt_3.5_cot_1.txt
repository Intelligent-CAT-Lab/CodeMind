<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 4 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2^n-1 (i.e., 0 to 15 in this case) to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable temp.
Inside the for loop, it prints the value of i followed by a colon.
Then it enters another for loop which iterates until temp becomes 0. In each iteration, it checks if temp is odd (i.e., temp % 2 == 1). If it is, it prints the value of j.
After printing the value of j, it divides temp by 2.
After the inner loop finishes, it prints a new line.
This process is repeated for each value of i in the outer loop.
