The variable n is initialized with 7 according to the input. The variable mod is initialized with 1000000007. The variable dp is an array of long with size n+1 and all elements are initialized with 0. The first element dp[0] is set to 1.
It enters a nested for loop. The outer loop iterates from 3 to n and the inner loop iterates from 3 to i. Inside the inner loop, it calculates the value of dp[i] by adding dp[i-j] to dp[i] and taking the modulo mod. This process is repeated for each value of i and j.
After the loop finishes, it prints the value of dp[n] as output.
