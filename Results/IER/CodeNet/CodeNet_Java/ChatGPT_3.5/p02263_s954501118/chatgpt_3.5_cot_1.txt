<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes input as a string and splits it into an array of strings using the space as a delimiter. In this case, the array will contain three elements: "1", "2", and "+".
Then, it initializes an empty stack and iterates over each element in the array.
For each element, it checks if it is one of the operators: "+", "-", or "*". If it is, it pops the top two elements from the stack, performs the corresponding operation, and pushes the result back onto the stack.
In this case, the element "+" is an operator, so it pops "2" and "1" from the stack, adds them together, and pushes the result "3" back onto the stack.
After iterating over all the elements, it pops the final result from the stack and prints it as the output.
