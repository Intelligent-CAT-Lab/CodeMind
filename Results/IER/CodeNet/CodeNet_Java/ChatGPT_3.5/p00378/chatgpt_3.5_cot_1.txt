<<<Analysis>>>
The variables A, B, and X are initialized with 180, 100, and 2400 respectively according to the input. The variable ans is not used in the code.
It reads the input values of A, B, and X using the Scanner class.
Then it checks if X is not divisible by 500. If it is not, it adds the difference between 500 and the remainder of X divided by 500 to X.
Next, it initializes variables a and b with 0.
Then it checks if A is less than B. If it is, it calculates the value of a by dividing X by 1000 and adding 1 if the remainder of X divided by 1000 is greater than 0.
If A is not less than B, it checks if A is greater than 2 times B. If it is, it calculates the value of b by dividing X by 500.
If neither of the above conditions is true, it calculates the value of a by dividing X by 1000 and updates the value of X by taking the remainder of X divided by 1000. Then it calculates the value of b by dividing X by 500.
Finally, it prints the result of A multiplied by a plus B multiplied by b as the output.
In this case, A is 180, B is 100, X is 2400.
Since X is divisible by 500, it does not add any value to X.
Since A is not less than B and A is not greater than 2 times B, it calculates a by dividing X by 1000, which is 2.
Then it calculates b by dividing X by 500, which is 4.
Finally, it prints the result of A multiplied by a plus B multiplied by b, which is 180 multiplied by 2 plus 100 multiplied by 4, which is 360 + 400, which is 760.
<<<Output>>>
760
