<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers K and X from the input. It then checks if X is less than or equal to 500 times K. If the condition is true, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".
In this case, K is 2 and X is 900. The condition X <= 500*K is true because 900 is less than or equal to 500*2 = 1000. Therefore, the output will be "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
