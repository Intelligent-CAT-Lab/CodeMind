<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, K and X. It then checks if X is less than or equal to 500 times K. If it is, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".
In this case, the input is 2 and 900. Since 900 is less than 500 times 2 (which is 1000), the condition is true and the code will print "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
