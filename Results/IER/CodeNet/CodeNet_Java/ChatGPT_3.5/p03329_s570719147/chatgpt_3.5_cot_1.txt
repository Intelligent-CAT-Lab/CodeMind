<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 127 according to the input.
It creates a TreeSet called set to store the numbers that can be formed using only 6 and 9.
It adds 1 to the set and then it iterates from 6 to n by multiplying tmp by 6 in each iteration and adds tmp to the set.
Then it iterates from 9 to n by multiplying tmp by 9 in each iteration and adds tmp to the set.
After that, it creates an array called dp of size n+1 and initializes all elements with a very large value.
Then it sets dp[0] to 0.
It enters a nested for loop. The outer loop iterates from 0 to n and the inner loop iterates through each element in the set.
Inside the inner loop, it checks if the current element x plus the current index i is less than or equal to n.
If it is, it updates dp[i+x] to the minimum value between dp[i+x] and dp[i]+1.
After the loops finish, it prints the value of dp[n] as output.
