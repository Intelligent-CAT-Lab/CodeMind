The variable L, variable R and variable d are initialized with 5, 10 and 2 respectively according to the input. And variable cnt is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 5 to 10 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current integer i is divisible by 2 using the modulo operator (%). If it is, it increments the value of variable cnt by 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable cnt as output, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
