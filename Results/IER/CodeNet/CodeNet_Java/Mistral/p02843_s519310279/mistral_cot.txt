 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable num is initialized with 615 according to the input.
It calculates the value of stack\_item by dividing num by 100, which gives 6.
Then it calculates the value of diff by subtracting stack\_item \* 100 from num, which gives 15.
It sets the value of pos to false.
Then it checks if diff is less than or equal to stack\_item \* 5. Since 15 is less than 6 \* 5, it sets pos to true.
Since pos is true, it prints "1" as output.
