 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable a and variable b are initialized with 0 and 5 respectively according to the input.
It enters an if-else statement to check the value of variable a.
If variable a is 0, it prints the value of variable b, which is 5.
If variable a is 1, it multiplies variable b with 100 and prints the result, which is 500.
If variable a is anything other than 0 or 1, it multiplies variable b with 10000 and prints the result, which is 50000.
Since variable a is 0, it prints the value of variable b, which is 5.
<<<Output>>>
5
