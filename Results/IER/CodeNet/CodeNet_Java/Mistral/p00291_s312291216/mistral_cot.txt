 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable sum is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 5 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable tmp.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger tmp by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a switch statement and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum falls within the range [1000, INF]. If it does, it print 1, otherwise it print 0.
The condition is met when i is 0, 1, 4 and 5.
