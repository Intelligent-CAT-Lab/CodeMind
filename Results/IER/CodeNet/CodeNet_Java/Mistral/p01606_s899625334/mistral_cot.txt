The variable N and W are initialized with 10 and 2 respectively according to the input. And variable a is initialized with an array of size N \* 2 + 1.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 2 to calculate the value of a[1] and a[2].
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from 3 to 2. It increments a[1] by 1 and then it enters another for loop and it iterates from 3 to N. It increments a[1] by 3 and then it increments a[j] by 1 for j in the range [3, N].
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from 3 to N. It increments a[1] by 3 and then it increments a[j] by 1 for j in the range [3, N].
