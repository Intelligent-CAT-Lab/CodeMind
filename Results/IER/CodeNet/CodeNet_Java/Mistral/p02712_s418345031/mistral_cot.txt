The variable N is initialized with 15 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 15 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable ans.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger i is not divisible by 3 and not divisible by 5. If it is not divisible by 3 and not divisible by 5, it adds the current interger i to variable ans. The condition is met when i is 1,2,4,7,8,10,11,13,14.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 55.
<<<Output>>>
55
