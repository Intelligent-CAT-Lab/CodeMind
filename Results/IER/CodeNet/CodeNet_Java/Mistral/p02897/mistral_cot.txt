 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 4 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 4 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger i is even or odd by using the modulo operator (%). If it is even, it increments the variable notOdd. If it is odd, it increments the variable odd.
After the loop finishes, it calculates the ratio of odd to total number of integers by dividing odd by n.
The condition is met when i is 1, 3 and 4.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable odd / n as output, which is 1.5.
<<<Output>>>
1.5
