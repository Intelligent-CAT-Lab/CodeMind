 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 8 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to the square root of n, which is 2.8284271247461903.
Inside the for loop, it checks if n is divisible by i. If it is, it calculates the value of m by dividing n by i and subtracting 1.
Then it checks if i is less than m. If it is, it adds the value of m to variable ans.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
