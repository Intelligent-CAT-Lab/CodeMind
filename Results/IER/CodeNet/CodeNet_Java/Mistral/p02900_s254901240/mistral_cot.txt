The variable A and variable B are initialized with 12 and 18 respectively according to the input.
The variable g is initialized with the value of gcd(A, B) which is 6.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to 6 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable temp.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger i divides the variable g evenly. If it does, it increments the count variable by 1 and divides the variable g by i.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable count as output, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>
