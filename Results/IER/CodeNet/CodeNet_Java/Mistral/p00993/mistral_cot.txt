 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable fact is initialized with 1 and variable mul is initialized with 1.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 1510 to calculate the value of fact by multiplying variable fact with variable mul.
Then it adds 2 to the value of fact and assigns it to variable fact.
It enters another for loop and it iterates from 2 to 2 + n to print the value of i.
It uses the scanner to read input from the user and it reads an integer n.
It then prints the value of fact and then it enters another for loop and it iterates from 2 to 2 + n to print the value of i.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is not applicable as it is a program that takes input from the user and prints the output based on the input.
It will print the value of fact and then it will enter another for loop and it will print the value of i.
