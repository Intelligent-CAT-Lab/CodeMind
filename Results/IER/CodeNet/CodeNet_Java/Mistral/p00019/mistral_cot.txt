 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a single integer input from the user using the Scanner class. The input is stored in the variable N.
It then enters a for loop that iterates from N to 1. In each iteration, it multiplies the current value of ans by N.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of ans as output.
