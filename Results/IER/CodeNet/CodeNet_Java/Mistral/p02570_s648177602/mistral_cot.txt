 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable d, variable t and variable s are initialized with 1000, 15 and 80 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the value of kakaruhun by dividing d by s and then taking the ceiling of the result using the Math.ceil() method.
Then it checks if the value of kakaruhun is less than or equal to t. If it is, it prints "Yes" otherwise it prints "No".
In this case, the value of kakaruhun is 125.0, which is greater than 15, so the output is "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
