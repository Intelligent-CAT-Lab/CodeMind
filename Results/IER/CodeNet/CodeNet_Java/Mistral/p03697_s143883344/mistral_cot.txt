 <<<Analysis>>>
The program takes two integer inputs A and B from the user using the Scanner class.
It then checks if the sum of A and B is greater than or equal to 10. If it is, it prints "error" to the console. Otherwise, it prints the sum of A and B.
In this case, the sum of 6 and 3 is 9, which is less than 10, so the program will print 9 to the console.
<<<Output>>>
9
