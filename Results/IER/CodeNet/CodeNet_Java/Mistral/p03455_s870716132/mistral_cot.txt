 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the Scanner class from the java.util package. It then creates a new instance of the Scanner class and reads two integers a and b from the user using the nextInt() method.
It then checks if the product of a and b is even by using the modulo operator (%). If the remainder of the product divided by 2 is 0, it means that the product is even and it prints "Even" to the console. Otherwise, it prints "Odd".
<<<Output>>>
Odd
