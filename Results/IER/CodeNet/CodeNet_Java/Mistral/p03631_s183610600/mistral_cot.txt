 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the necessary classes from the java.util and java.lang packages.
It then declares two integer variables i and j and a Scanner object named sc.
The sc object is used to read input from the user.
It then reads the input string from the user and stores it in a char array named n.
It then uses the toCharArray() method to convert the input string to a char array.
It then uses the next() method of the Scanner object to read the next input from the user.
It then uses the equals() method to compare the first and second elements of the char array n.
If the first and second elements of the char array are equal, it prints "Yes" to the console. Otherwise, it prints "No" to the console.
<<<Output>>>
No
