 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string input in the format of `YYYY/MM/DD` and it splits it into three parts using the `split()` method. The first part is the year, the second part is the month and the third part is the day.
It then checks the value of the month and if it is less than or equal to 4, it assigns the string "Heisei" to the variable ans. Otherwise, it assigns the string "TBD" to the variable ans.
Finally, it prints the value of the variable ans.
<<<Output>>>
Heisei
