The variables a, b, c, x, and y are initialized with 1500, 2000, 1600, 3, and 2 respectively according to the input.
It enters a series of if-else statements to check the conditions.
In the first if statement, it checks if the sum of a, b and 1 is greater than c. If it is, it enters the first if-else block.
Inside the first if-else block, it checks if x is greater than y. If it is, it calculates the price as c * y * 2 + c * (x - y) * 2.
If x is less than y, it calculates the price as c * x * 2 + c * (y - x) * 2.
In the second if statement, it checks if the sum of a, b and 1 is less than or equal to c. If it is, it enters the second if-else block.
Inside the second if-else block, it calculates the price as a * x + b * y.
After the if-else statements finish, it prints the final value of variable price as output, which is 10000.
<<<Output>>>
