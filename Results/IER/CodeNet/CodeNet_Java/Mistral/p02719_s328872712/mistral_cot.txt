 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and variable k are initialized with 7 and 4 respectively according to the input.
It enters an if-else statement and checks if n is greater than or equal to k.
Since n is greater than k, it enters the first if statement and checks if n is divisible by k. Since n is not divisible by k, it enters the else block of the first if statement and checks if the absolute value of n modulo k is less than the absolute value of n modulo k minus k. Since the absolute value of n modulo k is 1 and the absolute value of n modulo k minus k is 3, it prints 1 as the output and exits the program.
