The variable a, variable b and variable cc are initialized with 4, 3 and 90 respectively according to the input.
The variable s, variable l and variable h are initialized with 0.0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 90 to check each integer cc in this range.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable s, variable l and variable h using the formulae:
s = a * b * Math.sin(cc) / 2.0
l = a + b + Math.sqrt(a * a + b * b - 2.0 * a * b * Math.cos(cc))
h = b * Math.sin(cc)
Then it print the fianl values of variable s, variable l and variable h as output.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl values of variable s, variable l and variable h as output.
<<<Output>>>
