 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized with the input "125".
It creates an integer array num of length s.length() and initializes it with the values of the digits of the input string s.
It creates a long variable ans and initializes it with 0.
It enters a for loop that iterates from 0 to 2^(s.length()-1)-1.
Inside the for loop, it converts the current integer i to binary string index and pads it with leading zeros if its length is less than s.length()-1.
It initializes two variables count and instance to 0 and num[0] respectively.
It enters another for loop that iterates from 1 to s.length()-1.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current bit of index is 0 or 1.
If it is 0, it multiplies instance by 10 and adds num[j] to it.
If it is 1, it adds count to ans and sets instance to num[j].
After the loop finishes, it adds count and instance to ans and moves to the next iteration of the outer loop.
After the outer loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable ans, which is 115.
<<<Output>>>
115
