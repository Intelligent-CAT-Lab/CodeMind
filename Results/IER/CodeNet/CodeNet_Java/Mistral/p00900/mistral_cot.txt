 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable h and w are initialized with 5 and 6 respectively according to the input. And variable size is calculated as 5.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 4 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable p.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger p by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable next.
Then it checks if the calculated variable next falls within the range [0, 5]. If it does, it adds the current interger i to variable min. The condition is met when i is 0,1,2,3 and 4.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable min as output, which is 1.
