 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and k are initialized with 2 and 3 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable ans.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of ans by multiplying the current value of ans with k and then taking the modulo with 1000000007.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 11.
<<<Output>>>
