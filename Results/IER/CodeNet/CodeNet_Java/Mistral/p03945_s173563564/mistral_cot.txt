The variable count and variable p are initialized with 0.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until the condition e is true.
Inside the while loop, it checks if the first character of the input string s is equal to the variable tmp. If it is, it continues to the next iteration. If it is not, it sets e to false and breaks out of the loop.
Then it enters another while loop and it iterates from p to the end of the input string s. It checks if the current character of the input string s is equal to the variable tmp. If it is, it continues to the next iteration. If it is not, it sets e to false and breaks out of the loop.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable count as output, which is 2.
