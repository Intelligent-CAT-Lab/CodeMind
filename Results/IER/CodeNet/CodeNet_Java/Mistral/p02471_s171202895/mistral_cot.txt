 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first reads the input `4 12` and stores it in two variables `a` and `b`. Then it calls the function `extGCD` with these two variables and the variables `X` and `Y` as arguments. The function `extGCD` calculates the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b` using the extended Euclidean algorithm and returns the result. The function then prints the result `X[0] + Y[0]` which is the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b`.

<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is the greatest common divisor of `4` and `12`, which is `4`.
