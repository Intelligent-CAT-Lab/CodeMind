 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 5 according to the input. And variable S is initialized with "acca".
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 4 to check each character in the string S.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the index of the current character ch in the string S by subtracting 'a' from the ASCII value of the character.
It then checks if the index of the current character ch is already in the array next. If it is not, it sets the start[ch] to the current index i.
It also sets the next[prev[i]] to the current index i.
It also sets the prev[i] to the index of the current character ch.
It also sets the end[ch] to the current index i.
It then enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 25 to check each character in the alphabet.
Inside the inner for loop, it checks if the start[j] is not equal to -1. If it is not, it calculates the count of the characters between start[j] and end[j] by subtracting bit.sum(1, start[j] + 1) from bit.sum(end[j] + 1, N).
It then checks if the count is less than the current minimum count min. If it is, it updates the minimum count min and the index mi.
After the loops finish, it prints the final value of variable ans.
<<<Output>>>
-1
