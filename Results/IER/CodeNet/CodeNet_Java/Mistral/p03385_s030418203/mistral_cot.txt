 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable `string` is initialized with the input `"bac"`.
The `contains()` method is called on the `string` variable to check if it contains the substrings "a", "b" and "c".
The `&&` operator is used to check if all three conditions are true.
The variable `b` is assigned the value of the result of this condition.
Since the `string` variable contains all three substrings, the value of `b` is `true`.
The `System.out.println()` statement is used to print the value of `b` as "Yes" if it is true and "No" otherwise.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
