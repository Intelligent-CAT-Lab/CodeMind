 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable m, variable f and variable b are initialized with 1000, 3000 and 3000 respectively according to the input.
It enters an if-else statement to check the conditions.
The first condition checks if m is greater than or equal to b. Since m is 1000 and b is 3000, this condition is false.
The second condition checks if m plus f is greater than or equal to b. Since m is 1000 and f is 3000, this condition is true.
The third condition is executed since the first two conditions are false. It prints the value of b minus m, which is 2000.
<<<Output>>>
2000
