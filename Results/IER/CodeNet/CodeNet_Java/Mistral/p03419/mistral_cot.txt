 <<<Analysis>>>
The program reads two integers n and m from the standard input using the Scanner class.
It then checks if either n or m is equal to 2. If either of them is equal to 2, it prints 0 and returns from the solve method.
Otherwise, it calculates the maximum possible value of ans by multiplying the maximum possible value of n - 2 with the maximum possible value of m - 2.
The maximum possible value of n - 2 is 1, and the maximum possible value of m - 2 is 1, so ans is calculated as 1 * 1 = 1.
