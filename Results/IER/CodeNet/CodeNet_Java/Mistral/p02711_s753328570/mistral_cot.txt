 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized with the input `117`.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each character of the string s.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character is equal to '7' using the `charAt()` method. If it is, it sets the flag variable to 1 and breaks out of the loop.
After the loop finishes, it checks the value of flag. If it is 1, it prints "Yes" otherwise it prints "No".
Since the input string `117` does not contain the character '7' at any position, the flag variable remains 0 and the output is "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
