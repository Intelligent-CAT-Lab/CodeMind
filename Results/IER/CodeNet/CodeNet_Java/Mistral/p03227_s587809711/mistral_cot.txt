 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized with the input string "abc".
It creates a StringBuffer object sb with the string s.
It checks if the length of the string s is 2. Since it is not, it reverses the string s using the reverse() method of StringBuffer and stores the reversed string in variable dst.
Then it prints the reversed string dst.
<<<Output>>>
