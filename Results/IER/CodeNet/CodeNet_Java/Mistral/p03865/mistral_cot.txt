 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized with the input "aba". The length of the string is calculated and stored in variable a.
It then checks if the first character of the string is equal to the last character of the string. If it is, it checks if the length of the string is odd or even. If it is odd, it sets flag to true, otherwise it sets flag to false.
If the first character is not equal to the last character, it checks if the length of the string is odd or even. If it is odd, it sets flag to true, otherwise it sets flag to false.
Finally, it checks the value of flag and prints "First" or "Second" accordingly.
<<<Output>>>
Second
