 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable a, variable b and variable x are initialized with 2, 2 and 4 respectively according to the input. And variable height is calculated by dividing variable x by the square of variable a.
Then it calculates the value of variable ans using the formula:
```
ans = height <= b / 2d ? a * b * b / (2d * x) : (2d * a * a * b - 2d * x) / (a * a * a)
```
It first checks if the value of height is less than or equal to b divided by 2. If it is, it calculates the value of ans by multiplying a, b and b again and dividing it by 2 times x.
If it is not, it calculates the value of ans by subtracting 2 times x from the product of 2 times a squared, a squared and b.
Then it converts the value of ans from double to degrees using the atan function and prints it.
