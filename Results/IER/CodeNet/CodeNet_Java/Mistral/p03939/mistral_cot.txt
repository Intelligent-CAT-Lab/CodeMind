The variable N, variable d1 and variable x are initialized with 1, 3 and 3 respectively according to the input. And variable ans is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 1.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of ans by adding the value of d1 and (N-0.5)*x.
Then it updates the value of d1 by using the formula ((2*N+2)*d1 + 5*x)/(2*N) and updates the value of x by using the formula ((double)N+2)/N*x.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
