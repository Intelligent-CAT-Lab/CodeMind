 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and variable a are initialized with 8 and 1 respectively according to the input.
The variable c is calculated by raising n to the power of 1/m, where m is a variable that ranges from 2 to 40.
The variable i is then iterated from c-2 to c+2, and for each value of i, the variable res is calculated by multiplying a*(m-1) with j*i + (m-1-j)*(i+1) and then dividing it by the product of i and (i+1) raised to the power of m-1-j.
The variable den is calculated by multiplying i raised to the power of j and i+1 raised to the power of m-1-j.
The variable ans is then updated with the minimum value of ans and res.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
