The variable M is initialized with 1000000007.
It reads the input string s from the user using Scanner class.
It creates a 2D array dp of size [s.length + 1][13] to store the intermediate results.
It creates an array map of size 10 to map the digits 0-9 to their corresponding indexes in the map array.
It initializes the first element of dp array to 1.
It enters a for loop to iterate over each character in the input string s.
For each character, it iterates over each index j in the range [0, 12].
If the current character is '?', it iterates over each index k in the range [0, 9].
For each index k, it calculates the index l = j - k.
If l is less than 0, it adds 13 to l to make it a valid index.
It adds the dp[i - 1][map[l]] to dp[i][j] to get the sum of dp values at the previous index and the corresponding index in the map array.
If dp[i][j] is greater than or equal to M, it subtracts M from dp[i][j] to make it less than or equal to M.
If the current character is not '?', it calculates the index l = j - (ch - '0').
If l is less than 0, it adds 13 to l to make it a valid index.
It assigns the dp[i - 1][map[l]] to dp[i][j] to get the dp value at the previous index and the corresponding index in the map array.
After the for loop finishes, it prints the dp[s.length][5] as output, which is 1.
