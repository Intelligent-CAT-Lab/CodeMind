 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized with the input string "1111". The length of the string is 4 and it is stored in variable N. The first character of the string is '1' and the last character is '1', so the condition c[0]=='0' || c[N-2]=='0' || c[N-1]=='1' is not met.
The variable NN is initialized with N-1, which is 3.
The for loop iterates from 0 to 1, and checks if the current character is equal to the character at the index N-1-i. Since the first character is '1' and the last character is '1', the condition c[i]!=c[NN-1-i] is not met.
The variable parent is initialized with 0.
The for loop iterates from 0 to N-2, and prints the parent index and the current index. Since the first character is '1', the parent index is 1.
The return value of the code is 1 2 3 4, which is the output of the program.
<<<Output>>>
1 2 3 4
