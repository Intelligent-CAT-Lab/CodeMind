 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized with the input string "1234567876".
It creates an integer array arr of length s.length() and assigns the ASCII value of each character in s to the corresponding element of the array.
It then calls the function abc(arr[i], arr[i + 1], arr[i + 2]) for each triplet of adjacent elements in the array.
The function abc(a, b, c) calculates the value of a * 100 + b * 10 + c and subtracts 753 from it. If the result is greater than or equal to 0, it returns the result, otherwise it returns the result multiplied by -1.
It then compares the value returned by the function with the current minimum value min and updates min if the returned value is less than min.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of min as output.
<<<Output>>>
-1
