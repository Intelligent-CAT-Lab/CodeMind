 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the Scanner class from the java.util package to read input from the user.
Then it creates a new Scanner object named scanner and reads two integers A and B from the user using the nextInt() method.
It then compares the sum of A and B with 24. If the sum is greater than 24, it subtracts 24 from the sum. Otherwise, it returns the sum as is.
The final value of ans is 21.
<<<Output>>>
21
