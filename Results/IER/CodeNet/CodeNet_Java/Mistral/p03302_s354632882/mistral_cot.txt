 <<<Analysis>>>
The program reads two integers a and b from the standard input. The program then checks if the sum of a and b is equal to 15, if the product of a and b is equal to 15, or if the two numbers are equal to x.
If the sum of a and b is equal to 15, the program outputs a plus sign.
If the product of a and b is equal to 15, the program outputs an asterisk.
If neither of the above conditions are met, the program outputs an x.
