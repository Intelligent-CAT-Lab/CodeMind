 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and k are initialized with 3 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable seenNum.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable unpairNum and oddness using the formula:
unpairNum = (seenNum + 1) % n
oddness = (seenNum + 1) % 2
Then it calls the function getWayNum with these values and the current value of variable seenNum.
The function getWayNum returns the value of the current cell in the 3D array wayNums.
It returns the value of the cell at position [3][0][2] which is 1.
