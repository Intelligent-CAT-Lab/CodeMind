 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized with the input string "123456789". The variable c is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 9 to check each character of the string s. The value of variable i is also passed to variable charAt.
Inside the for loop, it converts the character of the string s at the current index i to an integer by subtracting 48 from it and then adds it to variable c.
After the loop finishes, it checks if the value of variable c is divisible by 9. If it is, it prints "Yes" otherwise it prints "No".
The condition is met when c is 180.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
