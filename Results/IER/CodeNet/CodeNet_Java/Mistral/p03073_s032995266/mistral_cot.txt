 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable str1 is initialized with null.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the input string str1.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character of the string is 0 or 1. If it is 0, it increments intCnt1, otherwise it increments intCnt2.
It also toggles the value of boolean variable bIsWhite after each iteration.
After the loop finishes, it prints the larger of intCnt1 and intCnt2.
For the input "000", intCnt1 will be 3 and intCnt2 will be 0, so it will print 3.
<<<Output>>>
