 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable x is initialized with 10 according to the input.
It enters an if-else statement. Since x is less than 4, the value of mx is set to 1.
Otherwise, it calculates the square root of x using the floor() method and assigns it to variable sq.
It then enters a for loop that iterates from 2 to sq. For each iteration, it calculates the value of jo using the pow() method and assigns it to variable jo.
It then compares jo with mx and updates the value of mx if jo is greater than mx.
After the loop finishes, it prints the value of mx as output, which is 1.
