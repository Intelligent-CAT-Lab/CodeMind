 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with the input string "123456789". The variable digit is then initialized with the string n converted to a character array.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 9 to extract each digit of the number with a for loop and add it to variable total.
Then it checks if the calculated variable total is divisible by 9. If it is, it prints "Yes" otherwise it prints "No".
The condition is met when the total of the digits is 9.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
