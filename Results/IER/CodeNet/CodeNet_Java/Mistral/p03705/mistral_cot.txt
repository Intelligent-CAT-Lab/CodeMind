 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n, variable a and variable b are initialized with 4, 4 and 6 respectively according to the input.
It enters an if-else statement to check the conditions.
The first condition checks if a is greater than b or if n is equal to 1 and a is not equal to b. If either of these conditions is true, it prints 0 and returns.
The second condition checks if a is equal to b. If it is, it prints 1 and returns.
Since a is not equal to b, it proceeds to the third condition.
It calculates the answer by multiplying (n-2) with (b-a) and adding 1.
The final value of the answer is 10.
<<<Output>>>
