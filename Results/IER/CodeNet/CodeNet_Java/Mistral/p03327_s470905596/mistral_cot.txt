 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the Scanner class from the java.util package. It then creates a new instance of the Scanner class and assigns it to the variable sc.
In the main method, it reads an integer n from the user using the nextInt() method of the Scanner class.
Then it checks if the value of n is greater than 999. If it is, it prints "ABD" to the console. Otherwise, it prints "ABC" to the console.
<<<Output>>>
ABD
