 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and variable m are initialized with 3 and 100 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable temp.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger temp is greater than 2. If it is, it assigns the value of variable m to variable temp.
Then it assigns the value of variable temp to variable ns[i].
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ns[0] and variable ns[1] as output, which are 100 and 100 respectively.
<<<Output>>>
100 100
