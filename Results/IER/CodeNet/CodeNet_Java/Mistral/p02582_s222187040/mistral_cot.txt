The variable s is initialized with the input "RRS". The variable r is initialized with "R". The variable count is initialized with the index of the first occurrence of the variable r in the string s. The variable lastcount is initialized with the index of the last occurrence of the variable r in the string s.
It enters a series of if-else statements to check the conditions.
The first if statement checks if the string s is equal to "RRR". If it is, it prints "3".
The second if statement checks if the string s is equal to "SSR". If it is, it prints "1".
The third if statement checks if the string s is equal to "SRS". If it is, it prints "1".
The fourth if statement checks if the string s is equal to "RSS". If it is, it prints "1".
The fifth if statement checks if the variable count is equal to 0 and the variable lastcount is equal to 1 or if the variable count is equal to 1 and the variable lastcount is equal to 2. If it is, it prints "2".
The sixth if statement checks if the variable count is equal to 0 and the variable lastcount is equal to 2 or if the variable count is equal to 2 and the variable lastcount is equal to -1 or if the variable count is equal to 0 and the variable lastcount is equal to -1 or if the variable count is equal to 1 and the variable lastcount is equal to -1. If it is, it prints "1".
The seventh if statement checks if the string s is equal to "SSS". If it is, it prints "0".
