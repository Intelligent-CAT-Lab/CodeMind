 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N and K are initialized with 2 and 0 respectively according to the input. And variable ans is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger i by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum falls within the range [0, 2]. If it does, it adds the current interger i to variable ans. The condition is met when i is 1 and j is 2.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 1.
