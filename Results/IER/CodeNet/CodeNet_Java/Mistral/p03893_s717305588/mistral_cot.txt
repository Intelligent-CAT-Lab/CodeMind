 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 2 according to the input.
The function f(n) is called with the argument n, which is 2.
Inside the function, it checks if n is equal to 0. If it is, it returns 2. Otherwise, it returns the result of multiplying the result of f(n-1) by 2 plus 2.
The result of f(n-1) is 1, since n is 2. So the function returns (1*2)+2 = 4.
<<<Output>>>
