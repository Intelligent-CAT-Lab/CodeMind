 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 2 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 10 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable N.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of x and y by dividing N by 26 and taking the remainder respectively.
Then it assigns the value of y to the ith index of the out array.
After the loop finishes, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 10 to 0 to print the values of the out array.
Since the value of y is 2, the 10th index of the out array is assigned the value 'z' and the 9th index is assigned the value 'y'.
Then it prints the values of the out array in reverse order, which is 'yz'.
<<<Output>>>
yz
