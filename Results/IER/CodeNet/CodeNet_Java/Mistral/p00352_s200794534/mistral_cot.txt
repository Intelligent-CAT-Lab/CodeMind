 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers a and b from the user using the Scanner class. The variable hannpenn is then calculated by taking the average of a and b by dividing it by 2.
The value of variable hannpenn is then printed to the console using the System.out.println() method.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is the average of the two input numbers, which is 2000.
