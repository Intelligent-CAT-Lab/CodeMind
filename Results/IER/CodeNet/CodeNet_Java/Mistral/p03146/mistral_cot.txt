 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized with 8 according to the input.
It enters a while loop and it iterates indefinitely.
Inside the while loop, it increments the value of variable i by 1.
Then it checks if the current value of s is even or odd. If it is even, it divides s by 2. If it is odd, it multiplies s by 3 and adds 1.
Then it checks if the current value of s is already present in the set using the contains() method. If it is, it prints the value of variable i and returns from the function. If it is not, it adds the current value of s to the set using the add() method.
After the loop finishes, it returns from the function.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is 10.
