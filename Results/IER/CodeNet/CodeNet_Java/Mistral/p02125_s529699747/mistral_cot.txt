The variable num is initialized with 2 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 99 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current integer i is greater than or equal to 2^i-1. If it is, it continues to the next iteration of the loop. If it is not, it breaks out of the loop.
After the loop finishes, it print the value of i-1 as output, which is 98.
<<<Output>>>
