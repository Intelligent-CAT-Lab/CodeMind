The variable ans is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the input string a.
Inside the for loop, it extracts the first i characters of the input string a and the remaining characters from i+1 to the end of the string a.
It then checks if the first i characters of the input string a is empty, if it is "-" or if it is a positive integer.
If the first i characters of the input string a is empty, it assigns 0 to variable h.
If the first i characters of the input string a is "-", it skips the current iteration.
If the first i characters of the input string a is a positive integer, it assigns the integer value of the first i characters of the input string a to variable h.
It then checks if the remaining characters from i+1 to the end of the string a is empty, if it is "0" or if it is a positive integer.
If the remaining characters from i+1 to the end of the string a is empty, it assigns 0 to variable t.
If the remaining characters from i+1 to the end of the string a is "0", it skips the current iteration.
If the remaining characters from i+1 to the end of the string a is a positive integer, it assigns the integer value of the remaining characters from i+1 to the end of the string a to variable t.
It then checks if variable t is less than 0, if it is greater than variable h, if the sum of variable h and variable t is even and if the difference between variable t and variable h is even.
If all the above conditions are met, it increments the value of variable ans by 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 1.
