The variable S is initialized with the input string "BBW". The variable ans is initialized with 0 and count is initialized with 0. The variable b is initialized with false.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the string S. The value of variable i is also passed to variable c.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character c is 'W'. If it is, it checks if variable b is true. If it is, it adds the difference between the current index i and the count variable to the ans variable and increments the count variable. If it is not, it increments the count variable.
Then it checks if the current character c is 'B'. If it is, it sets the value of variable b to true.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 2.
