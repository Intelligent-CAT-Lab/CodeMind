The variable N and M are initialized with 3 and 3 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 5 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable index.
Inside the for loop, it creates a new 2D array dp[i+1]%2] of size [N+2][N+2] and initializes it with 0.
Then it creates a nested for loop and iterates from 0 to N+1 for j and k.
Inside the nested for loop, it calculates dp[(i+1)%2][j][k] by adding dp[i%2][j][k] * (k-j) for j<=k and dp[i%2][j][k] * j for j>k.
Then it calculates dp[(i+1)%2][k][k] by adding dp[i%2][j][k] * j for j<=k and dp[i%2][j][k] * (N-k) for j>k.
Then it calculates dp[(i+1)%2][j][k+1] by adding dp[i%2][j][k] * (N-k) for j<=k and dp[i%2][j][k] * (k-j) for j>k.
After the nested for loop finishes, it calculates dp[M%2][N][N] by adding dp[(M%2)%2][j][k] * (k-j) for j<=k and dp[(M%2)%2][j][k] * j for j>k.
After the for loop finishes, it print the fianl value of dp[M%2][N][N] as output, which is 12.
