 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the java.util package and creates a Scanner object to read input from the user.
It then reads two integers a and b from the user using the nextInt() method of the Scanner object.
It then calculates the average of a and b by dividing the sum of a and b by 2.0 and using the ceil() method of the Math class to round up the result to the nearest integer.
The final result is then printed to the console using the println() method.
