The variable s is initialized with the input string "01B0". The variable t is initialized as an empty string.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 3 to check each character of the input string s.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character is 'B'. If it is, it removes the last character of the string t by using the substring method.
If the current character is not 'B', it adds the current character to the string t.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable t as output, which is "01".
