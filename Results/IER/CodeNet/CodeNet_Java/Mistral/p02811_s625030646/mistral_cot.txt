 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable `coins` is initialized with the value of `500` multiplied by the number of coins entered by the user.
The program then checks if the value of `coins` is greater than or equal to the number of coins entered by the user.
If it is, the program prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
