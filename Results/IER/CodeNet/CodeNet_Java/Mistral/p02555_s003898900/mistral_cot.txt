 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 7 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 3 to 4 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable result.
Inside the for loop, it calls the function culc(n - i) and adds the result to variable result. The result is then calculated by taking the remainder of the result divided by MOD.
The condition is met when i is 3,4.
After the loop finishes, it returns the final value of variable result, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
