 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two BigInteger values a and b from the standard input using the Scanner class. It then subtracts b from a and prints the result using the println() method.
The input is read line by line using the while loop and the nextBigInteger() method of the Scanner class is used to read the next BigInteger value.
The return value of the code is the difference between the two input values.
