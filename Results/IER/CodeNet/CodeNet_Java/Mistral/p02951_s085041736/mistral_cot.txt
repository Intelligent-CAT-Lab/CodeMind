 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integer inputs A, B and C from the user. In this case, A = 6, B = 4 and C = 3.
It calculates the answer by subtracting the difference between A and B from C.
The difference between A and B is 6 - 4 = 2.
So, the answer is C - (A - B) = 3 - 2 = 1.
Then it checks if the answer is greater than 0, if it is, it prints the answer, otherwise it prints 0.
In this case, the answer is 1, which is greater than 0, so it prints 1.
