 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input from the user using the Scanner class and stores it in the variable s.
It then checks if the last character of the string is "s" using the `endsWith()` method.
If it is "s", it prints the string followed by "es". Otherwise, it prints the string followed by "s".
In this case, the input is "apple" and the last character is not "s", so it prints "apples".
<<<Output>>>
apples
