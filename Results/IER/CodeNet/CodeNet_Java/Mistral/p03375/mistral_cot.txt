 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 2 and variable M is initialized with 1000000007.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it calls the function stirling(N) to calculate the stirling number of N.
Then it calls the function complex(N) to calculate the complex number of N.
It then calls the function beki(2,N-i,M) to calculate the value of 2 raised to the power of N-i modulo M.
It then calls the function ways(i) to calculate the number of ways to choose i elements from the set of N elements.
It then calculates the final answer by multiplying the stirling number, the complex number and the number of ways to choose i elements and taking the result modulo M.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 1.
