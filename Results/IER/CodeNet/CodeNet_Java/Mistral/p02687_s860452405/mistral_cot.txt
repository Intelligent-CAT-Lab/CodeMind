 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input from the user using the Scanner class and stores it in the variable s.
Then it checks if the string s is equal to "ABC" using the equals() method.
If it is equal, it prints "ARC" to the console. Otherwise, it prints "ABC" to the console.
<<<Output>>>
ABC
