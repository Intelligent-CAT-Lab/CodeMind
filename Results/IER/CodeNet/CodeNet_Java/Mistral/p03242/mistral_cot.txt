 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input from the user using the Scanner class and stores it in a char array S.
It then iterates through the array S for 3 times and replaces the first occurrence of the character '1' with '9' and the first occurrence of the character '9' with '1' in each iteration.
After the loop finishes, it prints the modified string S.
