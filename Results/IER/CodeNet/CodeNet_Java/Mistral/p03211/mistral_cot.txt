 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable S is initialized with the input string "1234567876". The variable min is initialized with 1000.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 4 to check each substring of length 3 in the input string S. The substring is extracted using the substring() method.
Inside the for loop, it converts the substring to an integer using the parseInt() method and stores it in variable X.
Then it calculates the absolute difference between X and 753 and stores it in variable diff.
It updates the value of variable min with the minimum of min and diff.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable min as output, which is 100.
<<<Output>>>
100
