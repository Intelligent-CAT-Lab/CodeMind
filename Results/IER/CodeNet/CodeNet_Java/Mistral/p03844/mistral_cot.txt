 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three inputs from the user, first integer a, second string s and third integer b. The variable c is initialized with 0.
It uses a Scanner object to read the input from the user.
It reads the first integer a using the nextInt() method of the Scanner object.
It reads the second string s using the next() method of the Scanner object.
It reads the third integer b using the nextInt() method of the Scanner object.
It uses an if-else statement to check the value of the second string s.
If the value of s is "+", it adds the value of a and b and assigns the result to variable c.
If the value of s is "-", it subtracts the value of b from the value of a and assigns the result to variable c.
It prints the value of variable c using the print() method of the System.out object.
