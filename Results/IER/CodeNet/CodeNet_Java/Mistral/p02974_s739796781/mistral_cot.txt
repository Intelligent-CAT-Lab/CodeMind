 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable K and variable M are initialized with 3, 2 and 1000000007 respectively according to the input. And variable dp is a 3D array of size N+1, K+1 and N+1.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to i to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable k.
Inside the second for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 2*j to K to check each integer k in this range.
It calculates the value of dp[i][j][k] by using the formula dp[i][j][k] = dp[i - 1][j - 1][k - 2*j] + (2*j + 1) * dp[i - 1][j][k - 2*j] % M.
It also checks if the calculated value of dp[i][j][k] is greater than or equal to M, if it is, it subtracts M from it.
After the loops finishes, it print the fianl value of dp[N][0][K] as output, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
