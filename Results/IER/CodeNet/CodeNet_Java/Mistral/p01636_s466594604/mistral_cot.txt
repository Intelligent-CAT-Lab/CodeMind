 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized with the input "19".
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 18 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable sub and variable add.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger sub and add by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it calculates the value of variable a and variable b by dividing the sum of digits of sub and add by 2 and subtracting the sum of digits of sub and add by 2 respectively.
It then checks if the calculated variable a and variable b are non-negative and if the sum of a and b is equal to the input "19". If it is, it adds the current interger i to set.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl size of set as output, which is 1.
