 <<<Analysis>>>
The program reads two integers from the standard input, which are 4 and 3.
It then calculates the sum of the digits of the two numbers by repeatedly extracting the digits of the number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum is equal to 4 or 3. If it is, it prints the number to the standard output.
The condition is met when the sum of digits of 4 is 4 and the sum of digits of 3 is 3.
After the loop finishes, it prints the fianl value of variable sum as output, which is 7.
<<<Output>>>
7
