 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable K is initialized with 0 and N is initialized with 50.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 49 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable r by subtracting i from N, adding K / N and adding 1 if K % N is greater than i.
Then it prints the value of variable r.
After the loop finishes, it prints the value of variable N.
<<<Output>>>
0
50
