The variable n is initialized with 12 according to the input. The variable c is also initialized with 12. The variable s is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 10 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable n.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger n by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable s.
Then it checks if the calculated variable s is divisible by c. If it is, it prints "Yes" otherwise it prints "No".
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable s as output, which is 12.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
