 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized with the input string "mmemewwemeww". The variable id is initialized with 0.
The function f() is called recursively until the character 'm' is not found in the string.
Inside the function f(), the character ch is assigned the value of the character at index id of the string s.
Then the function f() is called recursively again until the character 'e' is not found in the string.
Then the character ch is assigned the value of the character at index id of the string s.
Then the function f() is called recursively again until the character 'w' is not found in the string.
Then the character ch is assigned the value of the character at index id of the string s.
After the recursive calls are finished, the function returns.
The main function then checks if the character at index id of the string s is '$'. If it is, it prints "Cat". Otherwise, it prints "Rabbit".
<<<Output>>>
Rabbit
