 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized with the input string "ASSA". It is then converted to a character array using the `toCharArray()` method.
The `Arrays.sort()` method is then called on the character array s to sort it in ascending order.
The first four elements of the sorted array are then checked to see if they are all equal and the second and third elements are not equal.
In this case, the first four elements of the sorted array are 'A', 'A', 'A', 'A' and the second and third elements are not equal.
Therefore, the condition `s[0]==s[1]&&s[2]==s[3]&&s[1]!=s[2]` is true and the program prints "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
