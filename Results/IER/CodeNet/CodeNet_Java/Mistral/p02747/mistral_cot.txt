 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable S is initialized with the input "hihi".
It enters an if statement and checks if the length of the string is odd. Since the length of the string is 4, which is even, the condition is not met and the variable ans is set to "Yes".
Then it enters a for loop that iterates from 0 to the length of the string divided by 2, which is 1. In each iteration, it checks if the substring of the string starting from the current index and ending at the next index is equal to "hi". Since the substring "hi" is not present in the string, the condition is met and the variable ans is set to "No".
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
