 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable A and variable B are initialized with 4 and 6 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 7 to infinity to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable ca and variable cb.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable ca by dividing i by A and taking the remainder of i divided by A.
Then it calculates the value of variable cb by dividing i by B, taking the remainder of i divided by B and adding the remainder of i divided by A.
Then it compares the value of variable ca with the value of variable cb. If ca is less than cb, it prints the value of variable i and returns from the function.
After the loop finishes, it print -1 as output, because no integer i was found that satisfies the condition.
<<<Output>>>
-1
