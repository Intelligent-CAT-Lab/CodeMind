 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 54 according to the input.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until N is greater than or equal to x.
Inside the while loop, it calculates the value of x by multiplying it by 2 repeatedly until N is greater than or equal to x.
The loop stops when N is greater than or equal to x, which means N is 54 and x is 16.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of x / 2 as output, which is 8.
<<<Output>>>
8
