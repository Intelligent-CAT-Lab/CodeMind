 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N and variable M are initialized with 3 and 14 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to the square root of M to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable root.
Inside the for loop, it checks if M is divisible by i. If it is, it adds the current interger i to variable x and also adds the integer M/i to variable x.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable x.
Then it calculates the greatest common divisor of M and N using the ceil() method of TreeSet.
Finally it prints the value of M divided by the greatest common divisor of M and N.
<<<Output>>>
{3, 14}
The return value of the code is 1.
