 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 2 according to the input. And variable str is initialized with an empty string.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable str2.
Inside the for loop, it concatenates the value of variable str2 to variable str using the + operator.
After the loop finishes, it calls the permutation method with variable str and an empty string as arguments.
The permutation method is a recursive method that generates all possible permutations of the given string. It uses a base case and a general case to achieve this.
In the base case, if the length of the string is less than or equal to 1, it prints the string as it is.
In the general case, it iterates over each character in the string and for each character, it generates two permutations: one with the character at the beginning of the string and one without the character at the beginning of the string.
It then calls the permutation method recursively with the remaining characters of the string and the generated permutations as arguments.
After the recursive call finishes, it prints the permutations of the string.
