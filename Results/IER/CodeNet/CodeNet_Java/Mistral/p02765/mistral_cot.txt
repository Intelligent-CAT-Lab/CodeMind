 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and variable r are initialized with 2 and 2919 respectively according to the input.
It enters an if-else statement to check if the value of variable n is less than 10 or not.
Since n is 2, which is less than 10, the if block is executed.
Inside the if block, it calculates the output by adding the value of variable r with (10 - n) * 100.
So the output is 2919 + (10 - 2) * 100 = 2919 + 800 = 3719.
<<<Output>>>
3719
