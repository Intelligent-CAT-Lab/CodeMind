 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and variable m are initialized with 3 and 3 respectively according to the input. And variable dp is initialized with a 2D array of size n+1 x n+1.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable next.
Inside the for loop, it creates a new 2D array next of size n+1 x n+1.
Then it creates a nested for loop and it iterates from 0 to n+1 for variable a and from 0 to n+1 for variable b.
It checks if dp[a][b] is not equal to 0, if it is not, it continues to the next iteration.
Then it calculates the next[a+b][0], next[a][b+1] and next[a][b] by adding dp[a][b] * a, dp[a][b] * (n-a-b) and dp[a][b] * b respectively and taking the modulo with MOD.
Finally, it updates the dp array with the next array.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable dp[n][0], which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
