 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and variable x are initialized with 5 and 2 respectively according to the input.
The variable a and variable b are calculated using the formula a = Math.max(x, n-x) and b = Math.min(x, n-x) respectively.
The variable sum is initialized with 0.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until the variable c is 0.
Inside the while loop, it calls the refrect() method and passes the values of variable a and variable b as arguments.
The refrect() method calculates the remainder of variable a divided by variable b and the quotient of variable a divided by variable b.
It then adds the quotient of variable a divided by variable b multiplied by 2 to the variable sum.
If the remainder of variable a divided by variable b is 0, it subtracts the value of variable b from the variable sum.
The while loop continues until the variable c is 0.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable sum as output, which is 16.
<<<Output>>>
16
