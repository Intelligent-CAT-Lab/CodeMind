 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input from the user using the Scanner class and stores it in the variable A.
Then it checks if the string A contains the substrings "a", "c" and "b" using the contains() method.
Since the input string "bac" contains all three substrings "a", "c" and "b", the condition is met and the program prints "Yes" to the console.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
