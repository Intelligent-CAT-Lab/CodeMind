 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable str is initialized with the input "hihi".
The variable last is initialized with the string obtained by replacing all occurrences of the substring "hi" with an empty string using the `replaceAll()` method.
The length of the string last is checked using the `length()` method.
If the length of the string last is 0, it means that all occurrences of the substring "hi" have been removed from the string str, so the output is "Yes". Otherwise, the output is "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
