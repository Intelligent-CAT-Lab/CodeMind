The variable M and N are initialized with 2 and 3 respectively according to the input. And variable m0 and md are initialized with 1 and 3 respectively.
And variable n0 and nd are initialized with 1 and 3 respectively.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 2 to calculate the value of variable m[i] and n[i].
The value of variable m[i] is calculated by multiplying the value of variable m[i-1] with 58 and adding variable md, then taking the remainder of the result with N+1.
The value of variable n[i] is calculated by multiplying the value of variable n[i-1] with 58 and adding variable nd, then taking the remainder of the result with M+1.
After the loop finishes, it calls the sort method to sort the values of variable m and n in ascending order.
Then it calculates the sum of the values of variable m and n by iterating through the sorted arrays and adding the values of variable m[i] and n[i] to accumM and accumN respectively.
It enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to M to calculate the sum of the values of variable m and n for each value of variable i.
It uses a while loop to find the value of variable i that satisfies the condition that the sum of the values of variable m and n for the current value of variable i is greater than or equal to the sum of the values of variable m and n for the previous value of variable i plus the difference between M and i.
If it finds such a value of variable i, it updates the value of variable sum to be the minimum of the current sum and the sum of the values of variable m and n for the current value of variable i.
After the loop finishes, it prints the value of variable sum as output, which is 10.
