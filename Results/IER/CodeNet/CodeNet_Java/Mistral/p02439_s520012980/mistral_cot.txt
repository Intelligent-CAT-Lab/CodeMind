 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable array is initialized with 3 integers, 4, 5 and 3, according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to assign the values of the input integers to the array.
After the loop finishes, it calls the Arrays.sort() method to sort the array in ascending order.
Finally, it prints the first and last element of the sorted array, which are 3 and 3 respectively.
<<<Output>>>
