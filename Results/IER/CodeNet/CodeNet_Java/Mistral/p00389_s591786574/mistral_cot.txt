 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and k are initialized with 4 and 2 respectively according to the input. The variable res is initialized with 0.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until n is less than row.
Inside the while loop, it checks if row*k is greater than or equal to w. If it is, it increments the variable res and updates the value of w and n.
Then it checks if n is greater than row+1. If it is, it increments the value of row.
If n is not greater than row+1, it breaks out of the loop.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable res as output, which is 2.
