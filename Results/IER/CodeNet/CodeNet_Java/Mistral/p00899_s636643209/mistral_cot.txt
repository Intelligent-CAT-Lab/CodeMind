 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 3 according to the input. And variable bit is initialized with 7.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until sc.hasNext() returns false.
Inside the while loop, it checks if n is 0, if it is, it returns.
It then creates an array s of size n and initializes it with the input.
It then calculates the value of bit by setting it to (1 << n) - 1.
It then creates an array unvalid of size n and initializes it with false.
It then enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to n-1.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current bit is 0, if it is, it continues to the next iteration.
It then enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to n-1.
Inside the inner for loop, it checks if the current bit is 0, if it is, it continues to the next iteration.
It then enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to s[j].length()-1.
Inside the inner for loop, it checks if the current character in s[i] is equal to the current character in s[j], if it is, it sets the current bit to 0 and breaks out of the inner for loop.
It then sets the current bit to 1 and continues to the next iteration.
After the while loop finishes, it creates a memo array of size (1 << n) x n and initializes it with -1.
It then enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to (1 << n) - 1.
Inside the for loop, it creates a memo array of size n and initializes it with -1.
It then enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to n-1.
Inside the inner for loop, it checks if the current bit is 1, if it is, it continues to the next iteration.
It then calls the dp function with the current state, tail, n, unvalid and s as arguments.
The dp function returns the minimum length of the state plus the tail.
It then prints the minimum length of the state plus the tail.
