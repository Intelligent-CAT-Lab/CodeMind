 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable K and variable M are initialized with 2, 2 and 100 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable used.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of dp[newVal][used + use] by using the formula dp[newVal][used + use] = (dp[newVal][used + use] + dp[newVal - 1][used] * transit[used][use]) % M.
It uses the value of dp[newVal][used + use] to update the value of dp[newVal][used + use] in the next iteration.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of dp[K][N], which is 100.
<<<Output>>>
100
