 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable M and variable R are initialized with 2, 0 and 3 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to N-1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable ans.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of ans by multiplying the current value of ans with the value of R + N - 1 - i and then dividing it by the value of i + 1.
Then it checks if the value of ans is less than 0. If it is, it prints 0 and returns from the function.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 1.
