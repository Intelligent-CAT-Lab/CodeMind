 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable a is initialized with 3 integers, 0, 0 and 1 respectively.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer a[i] in this range.
Inside the for loop, it reads the input from the user using Scanner class and stores it in variable a[i].
Then it checks the condition if a[0] is equal to 1 and a[1] is also equal to 1. If it is true, it prints "Open".
It also checks the condition if a[2] is equal to 1. If it is true, it prints "Open".
If none of the above conditions are met, it prints "Close".
In this case, the condition a[0] == 1 and a[1] == 1 is not met, so it prints "Close".
<<<Output>>>
Close
