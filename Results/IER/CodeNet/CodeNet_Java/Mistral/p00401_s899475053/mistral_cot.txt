 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads an integer input from the user using the `Scanner` class and stores it in the variable `n`.
Then it uses the `Integer.highestOneBit()` method to find the highest one-bit set in the integer `n`.
The method returns the highest one-bit set in the integer as a bit mask.
The bit mask is then printed to the console using the `System.out.printf()` method.
