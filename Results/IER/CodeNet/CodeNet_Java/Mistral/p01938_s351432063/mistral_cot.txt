 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable ins is initialized with the input string "AIZU". The length of the string is calculated and stored in variable length.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 3 to check each character in the string. The value of variable i is also passed to variable c.
Inside the for loop, it compares the current character c with the previous character pre\_char. If the current character is greater than the previous character, it adds the difference between the two characters to variable cnt. If the current character is less than the previous character, it adds the difference between the two characters plus 26 to variable cnt.
After the loop finishes, it calculates the average of variable cnt by dividing it by 26 and stores the result in variable cnt\_avg.
Then it print the fianl value of variable cnt\_avg as output, which is 1.
