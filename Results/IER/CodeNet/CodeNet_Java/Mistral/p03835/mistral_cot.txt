 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable k and variable s are initialized with 2 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to k to check each integer x in this range.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to k to check each integer y in this range.
It calculates the value of z by subtracting x and y from s.
Then it checks if the calculated variable z is greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to k. If it is, it increments the count variable.
After the two loops finish, it print the fianl value of variable count as output, which is 1.
