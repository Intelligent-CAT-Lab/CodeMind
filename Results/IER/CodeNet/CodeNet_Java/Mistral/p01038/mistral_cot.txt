The variable N is initialized with 6 according to the input. And variable heights is initialized with an array of 6 integers.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 5 to check each integer in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable heights[i].
It enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 5 to check each integer in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable next\_diff and next\_sign.
It calculates the difference between the current interger heights[i+1] and the previous interger heights[i] and assigns it to variable next\_diff.
Then it calculates the sign of next\_diff and assigns it to variable next\_sign.
It enters another if statement and it checks if the current interger i is 0. If it is, it assigns the value of next\_sign to variable prev and continues to the next iteration.
It enters another if statement and it checks if the current interger i is not 0 and the value of prev is not equal to the value of next\_sign. If it is, it adds the value of prev to the ArrayList signed and assigns the value of next\_sign to variable prev.
It enters another for loop and it iterates from 1 to signed.size() - 2 to check each integer in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable prev\_sign, curr\_sign and next\_sign.
It calculates the difference between the current interger heights[i+1] and the previous interger heights[i] and assigns it to variable next\_diff.
Then it calculates the sign of next\_diff and assigns it to variable next\_sign.
It enters another if statement and it checks if the current interger i is 1. If it is, it assigns the value of next\_sign to variable prev\_sign and continues to the next iteration.
It enters another if statement and it checks if the current interger i is not 1 and the value of prev\_sign is 1 and the value of next\_sign is -1. If it is, it increments the value of counts[0].
It enters another if statement and it checks if the current interger i is not 1 and the value of prev\_sign is -1 and the value of next\_sign is 1. If it is, it increments the value of counts[1].
It enters another if statement and it checks if the current interger i is not 1 and the value of prev\_sign is not equal to the value of next\_sign. If it is, it increments the value of counts[2].
It enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to signed.size() - 2 to check each integer in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable curr\_sign, next\_sign and prev\_sign.
It calculates the difference between the current interger heights[i+1] and the previous interger heights[i] and assigns it to variable next\_diff.
Then it calculates the sign of next\_diff and assigns it to variable next\_sign.
It enters another if statement and it checks if the current interger i is not 0 and the value of curr\_sign is 0. If it is, it checks if the value of prev\_sign is 1 and the value of next\_sign is -1. If it is, it increments the value of counts
