 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable a, variable b, variable c, variable x and variable y are initialized with 1500, 2000, 1600, 3 and 2 respectively according to the input.

It enters a if statement and it checks if the sum of a and b is less than 2 times c. Since 1500 + 2000 = 3500 which is greater than 2 times 1600, it enters the else block.

Inside the else block, it first calculates the minimum of x and y and assigns it to variable min. It also calculates the maximum of x and y and assigns it to variable max.
Then it calculates the res variable by adding 2 times c times min and adding the result of the if-else statement.

If max is equal to x, it adds the minimum of a and 2 times c times (max - min) to res. If max is not equal to x, it adds the minimum of b and 2 times c times (max - min) to res.

After the if-else statement finishes, it print the fianl value of variable res as output, which is 10000.
<<<Output>>>
10000
