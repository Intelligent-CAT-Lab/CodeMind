 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n, variable a and variable b are initialized with 5, 2 and 4 respectively according to the input. And variable ans1 and ans2 are initialized with 0.
It enters a if statement and it checks if a is greater than b. Since a is 5 and b is 4, the condition is not met.
Then it enters another if statement and it checks if (b - a) % 2 == 1. Since (b - a) % 2 == 1, the condition is met.
It calculates the value of ans1 as (a - 1 + (b - a + 1) / 2) = (5 - 1 + (4 - 5 + 1) / 2) = 2.
It calculates the value of ans2 as (a - 1 + (b - a + 1) / 2) = (5 - 1 + (4 - 5 + 1) / 2) = 2.
Since ans1 and ans2 are equal, it prints the value of ans1 as output, which is 2.
