The variable s is initialized with the input string "BBBWW". The variable c is an array of length equal to the length of the string s. It is initialized with the characters of the string s.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to the length of the string s-1. The condition is met when i is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable count as output, which is 4.
