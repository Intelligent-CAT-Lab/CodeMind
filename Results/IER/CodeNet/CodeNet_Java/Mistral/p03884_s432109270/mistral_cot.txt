 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable k is initialized with 7 according to the input.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until k is 0.
Inside the while loop, it first calculates the remainder of k divided by 100, which is 7.
Then it calculates the remainder of k divided by 25, which is 7.
Then it calculates the remainder of k divided by 10, which is 7.
Then it calculates the remainder of k divided by 5, which is 2.
Then it calculates the remainder of k divided by 2, which is 1.
Then it calculates the remainder of k divided by 1, which is 0.
Since k is 0, the while loop terminates.
It then prints the result, which is "L".
<<<Output>>>
