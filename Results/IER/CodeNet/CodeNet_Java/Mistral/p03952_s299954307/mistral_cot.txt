 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first reads the input `4 4` from the standard input stream. It then initializes two variables `n` and `x` with the values `4` and `4` respectively.
It then initializes a variable `left` with the value `1` and a variable `right` with the value `2 * n - 1`, which is `7` in this case.
It then checks if `n` is equal to `2`. If it is, it checks if `x` is equal to `2`. If it is, it prints `Yes` and then enters a loop that iterates from `1` to `3`. Inside the loop, it prints the value of `i` for each iteration.
It then returns from the function.
If `n` is not equal to `2`, it checks if `x + 1` is less than or equal to `right` and if `left` is less than or equal to `x - 2`. If both conditions are true, it prints `Yes` and then enters a loop that iterates from `1` to `2 * n - 1`. Inside the loop, it removes the values of `x`, `x + 1`, and `x - 2` from a `TreeSet` and then prints the values of `x`, `x + 1`, and `x - 2` in a specific order.
It then returns from the function.
If `x + 2` is less than or equal to `right` and if `left` is less than or equal to `x - 1`, it prints `Yes` and then enters a loop that iterates from `1` to `2 * n - 1`. Inside the loop, it removes the values of `x`, `x - 1`, and `x + 1` from a `TreeSet` and then prints the values of `x`, `x - 1`, and `x + 1` in a specific order.
It then returns from the function.
If neither of the above conditions are true, it prints `No`.
