 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the Scanner class from the java.util package. It then creates a new Scanner object named sc and uses it to read two integers a and b from the user.
It then calculates the quotient d by dividing a by b and the remainder r by using the modulo operator % to find the remainder of a divided by b.
It also calculates the fraction f by dividing a by b and converting it to a double data type.
It then prints the value of d, r and f using the System.out.print() and System.out.println() methods.
The output is formatted using the String.format() method to display the value of f with 5 decimal places.
