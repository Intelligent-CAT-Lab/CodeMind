 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a double value from the standard input stream using the `nextDouble()` method of the `InputReader` class. The double value is then printed to the standard output stream using the `print()` method of the `PrintWriter` class.

The `nextDouble()` method reads a sequence of characters from the input stream until it encounters a newline character or the end of the input stream. It then converts the sequence of characters to a double value and returns it.

The `print()` method writes a string to the output stream. In this case, it writes the double value to the output stream.

<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is the double value that was read from the input stream.
