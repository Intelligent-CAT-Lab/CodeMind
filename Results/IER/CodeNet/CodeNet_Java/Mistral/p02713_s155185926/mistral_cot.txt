 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 2 according to the input. And variable sum is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j and k.
Inside the for loop, it calls the function get\_GCD(i,j,k) for each combination of i,j and k. The function get\_GCD takes three integer arguments and returns the greatest common divisor of these three integers.
It calculates the minimum of the three integers a, b and c and then iterates from 1 to this minimum value. For each value of i, it checks if i divides all three integers a, b and c without any remainder. If it does, it sets the value of gcd to i.
After the loop finishes, it adds the value of gcd to variable sum for each combination of i,j and k.
After the outer for loop finishes, it prints the value of variable sum, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
