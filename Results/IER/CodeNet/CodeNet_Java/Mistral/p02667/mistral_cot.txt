 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable T is initialized with the input string "1101". The variable N is initialized with the length of the string.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 3 to check each character in the string.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character is '1'. If it is, it initializes a variable length to 0 and then it enters another for loop to iterate from the current index i to the end of the string.
Inside the inner for loop, it checks if the current character is '1'. If it is, it increments the variable length. If it is not, it breaks out of the inner for loop.
After the inner for loop finishes, it checks if the length is odd. If it is, it adds the current index i to the ArrayList indexes.
After the outer for loop finishes, it calculates the number of zeroes in the string by subtracting the number of ones from the length of the string.
It then calculates the answer by multiplying the number of zeroes by the number of ones minus the size of the indexes divided by 2.
It then iterates over the indexes and adds the number of zeroes plus one minus the index plus one to the answer.
Finally, it iterates over the numbers from one to the number of ones minus one and adds half of each number to the answer.
The final value of the answer is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
