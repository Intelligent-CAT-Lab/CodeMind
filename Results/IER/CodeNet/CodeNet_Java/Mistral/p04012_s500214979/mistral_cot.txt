 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable w is initialized with the input string "abaccaba".
It creates a character array c of length w.length() and assigns each character of the string w to the corresponding index of the array c.
It creates an integer array a of length 1000 and initializes all elements of the array to 0.
It then iterates through each character in the string w and increments the corresponding element in the array a by 1.
It then iterates through the array a and checks if any element is odd. If it finds an odd element, it sets flag to false and breaks out of the loop.
If flag is still true after the loop, it prints "Yes" to the console.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
