The variable numN is initialized with 7 according to the input. And variable ope is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 11 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable opeNum.
It calculates the value of opeNum by multiplying numN with 2 and adding the remainder of numN divided by 11.
It also checks if the remainder of numN divided by 11 is 0, 1 or 2 and assigns the corresponding value to opeHasu.
It then adds opeNum and opeHasu to ope.
It enters another for loop and it iterates from 1 to 11 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable opeNum.
It calculates the value of opeNum by multiplying numN with 2 and adding the remainder of numN divided by 11.
It then adds opeNum to ope.
