 <<<Analysis>>>
The program takes two integer inputs a and b from the user. In this case, a = 2 and b = 16.
The program then checks if the difference between a and b is even or odd. In this case, (a-b) = 14 which is an even number.
Since the difference is even, the program divides the sum of a and b by 2 and prints the result. In this case, (a+b)/2 = (2+16)/2 = 9.
<<<Output>>>
9
