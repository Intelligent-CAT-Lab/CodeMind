 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable a, variable b, variable c and variable d are initialized with 1, 1, 3 and 4 respectively according to the input.
The method solve() is called which first calls the method ni() to read the first integer from the input. It then calls the method gcd() to find the greatest common divisor of the absolute difference between a and c and the absolute difference between b and d.
It then calls the method out.println() to print the result of the calculation which is the absolute difference between a and c plus the absolute difference between b and d minus the greatest common divisor.
