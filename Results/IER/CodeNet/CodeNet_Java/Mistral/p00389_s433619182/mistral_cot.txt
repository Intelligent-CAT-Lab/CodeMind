 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable count, variable strength and variable total are initialized with 4, 2 and 1 respectively according to the input.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until count becomes 0.
Inside the while loop, it calculates the value of x by dividing the sum of total, strength and 1 by the strength.
Then it checks if the value of count is greater than or equal to x. If it is, it increments the value of size and adds x to the value of total. Then it decrements the value of count by x.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable size as output, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>
3
