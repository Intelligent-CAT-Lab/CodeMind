 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first creates an instance of the class Main. Then it calls the input() method to read the input values of a, b and c from the user. The input values are 1, 3 and 8 respectively.
Then it calls the output() method to check if the input values satisfy the condition that a < b < c.
The condition is met because 1 < 3 < 8.
Therefore, the output of the program is "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
