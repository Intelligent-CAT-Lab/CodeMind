 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable x is initialized with 90 according to the input.
It calls the method `gcd` to find the greatest common divisor of 360 and x. The method returns 0 as the remainder of 360 divided by 90 is 0.
Then it calls the method `lcm` to find the least common multiple of 360 and x. The method returns 360 as the product of 360 and 90 divided by 0 is undefined.
Finally, it divides the result of `lcm` by x and prints the result.
<<<Output>>>
0.0
