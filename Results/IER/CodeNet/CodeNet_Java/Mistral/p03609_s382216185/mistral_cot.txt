 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable x and variable t are initialized with 100 and 17 respectively according to the input.
It enters a FastScanner class which reads the input and returns the value of variable x - variable t.
The FastScanner class reads the input in the format of two integers separated by a space. It uses a while loop to read the input until it reaches the end of the line.
It checks if the current byte is a space and if it is, it skips it.
It checks if the current byte is a minus sign and if it is, it sets the minus flag to true.
It checks if the current byte is a digit and if it is, it adds it to the current integer n.
It checks if the current byte is the end of the input and if it is, it returns the value of variable n with the minus flag if it is set.
After the loop finishes, it returns the value of variable n with the minus flag if it is set.
<<<Output>>>
