 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable t1, variable t2, variable r1 and variable r2 are initialized with 9, 8, 1000 and 999 respectively according to the input.
It enters a if-else-if statement to check the value of r1 and r2.
If r1 is -1 or r2 is -1, it assigns the value of -t1 to r1 and -t2 to r2.
Then it checks if r1 is equal to r2. If it is, it prints "Draw".
If r1 is less than r2, it prints "Bob".
If r1 is greater than or equal to r2, it prints "Alice".
In this case, r1 is 9 and r2 is 999, so r1 is less than r2, so it prints "Bob".
<<<Output>>>
Bob
