The variable list is initialized with the input string "AIZU". The variable a is initialized with the first character of the string, which is 'A'. The variable sum is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 3 to check each character in the string. The value of variable i is also passed to variable list[i].
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character is less than or equal to the current value of variable a. If it is, it increments the variable sum. The condition is met when i is 0, 1 and 2.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable sum as output, which is 3.
