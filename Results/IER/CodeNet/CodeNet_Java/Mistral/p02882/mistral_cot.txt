 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable A, variable B and variable X are initialized with 2, 2 and 4 respectively according to the input.
It enters an if-else statement to check if X * 2 >= A * A * B.
If the condition is true, it calculates the value of z as (A * A * B - X) / A / A * 2.
Then it calculates the value of d as Math.atan(z / A) * 180 / Math.PI.
If the condition is false, it calculates the value of z as (X) / A / B * 2.
Then it calculates the value of d as Math.atan(B / z) * 180 / Math.PI.
After the calculation, it prints the value of d as output.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is 180.0.
