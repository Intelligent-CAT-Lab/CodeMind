 <<<Analysis>>>
The code prompts the user to enter two strings, `tString` and `string`, using the `Scanner` class. The first string `tString` is stored in the variable `tString` and the second string `string` is stored in the variable `string`.
Then it concatenates the two strings using the `+` operator and stores the result in the variable `tString + string`.
Finally, it prints the concatenated string using the `System.out.println()` method.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is the concatenated string `tString + string`.
If the user enters `oder` as the first string and `atc` as the second string, the return value of the code would be `oder atc`.
