 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable x and y are initialized with 4 and 4 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to x to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable p.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the x and y values of variable p by multiplying i with 2 and subtracting y from it respectively.
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to y to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable p.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the x and y values of variable p by multiplying i with 2 and subtracting y from it respectively.
Then it calculates the slope of the line by dividing y by 2*x.
It then enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to y to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable p.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the x and y values of variable p by multiplying i with 2 and subtracting y from it respectively.
Then it checks if the calculated variable p.x and p.y are equal to any of the points in the list cx. If it is, it sets the variable same to true and breaks out of the loop.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl size of the list cx, which is 2.
