 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable x is initialized with 33 according to the input.
It enters a nested for loop and it iterates from -100 to 100 for variable i and from -100 to 100 for variable j.
Inside the nested for loop, it calculates the 5th power of variable i and variable j using the pow() method of BigInteger class and stores it in variable a and b respectively.
Then it subtracts variable b from variable a and checks if the result is equal to variable x using the equals() method of BigInteger class.
If it is equal, it prints the values of variable i and j and returns from the function.
After the nested for loop finishes, it returns from the function without finding any match.
<<<Output>>>
No output is returned as the input value 33 does not have any match in the nested for loop.
