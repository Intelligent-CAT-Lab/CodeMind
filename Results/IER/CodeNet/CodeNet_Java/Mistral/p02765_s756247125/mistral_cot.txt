 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and variable r are initialized with 2 and 2919 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 9 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable na by multiplying the value of variable r with 100 if n is less than 10, otherwise it adds 100*(10-n) to the value of variable r.
Then it prints the value of variable na as output.
After the loop finishes, it prints the fianl value of variable na as output, which is 2919.
<<<Output>>>
2919
