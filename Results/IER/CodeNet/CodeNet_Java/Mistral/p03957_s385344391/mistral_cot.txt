 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable arr is initialized with the input string "CODEFESTIVAL" using the `Scanner` class.
It enters a for loop and it iterates through each character in the string.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character is 'C' and if it is, it sets the boolean variable `beforeC` to false.
If `beforeC` is true, it checks if the current character is 'F'. If it is, it prints "Yes" and returns immediately.
If `beforeC` is false, it continues to the next iteration.
After the loop finishes, it prints "No" because it did not find the character 'F' in the string.
<<<Output>>>
No
