 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the Scanner class from the java.util package. It then creates a new Scanner object named sc and uses it to read two integers a and b from the user.
It then calculates the answer ans by dividing b by a, and subtracting 1 from the result.
It then checks if the remainder of the division is 0. If it is, it prints the value of ans. Otherwise, it prints the value of ans+1.
<<<Output>>>
