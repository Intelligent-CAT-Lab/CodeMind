 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable c[] is initialized with the input string "eggchickenegg".
It enters a while loop and it iterates until it has read all the characters from the input string.
Inside the while loop, it converts the current character to a char array and stores it in variable c.
It then creates an ArrayList<String>AL and initializes it with the first character "e".
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the char array c.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character is "e". If it is, it adds "e" to the ArrayList<String>AL and moves to the next character by adding 3 to the index i.
If the current character is not "e", it checks if it is "c". If it is, it adds "c" to the ArrayList<String>AL and moves to the next character by adding 7 to the index i.
After the for loop finishes, it initializes variables a and b to 0 and variable cnt to 1.
It enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to the size of the ArrayList<String>AL.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character is "e". If it is, it increments variable cnt and sets variable a to 1.
If the current character is not "e", it checks if it is "c". If it is, it increments variable cnt and sets variable b to 1.
It then checks if variable cnt is greater than the current maximum value of max. If it is, it sets the value of ans to "eggchickenegg" and sets the value of max to cnt.
If variable cnt is not greater than the current maximum value of max, it continues to the next iteration.
After the for loop finishes, it prints the value of variable ans, which is "eggchickenegg".
<<<Output>>>
eggchickenegg
