 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable a and variable b are initialized with 2 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the minimum and maximum price of an item after applying 8% tax by dividing the variable a by 0.08 and adding 1 to it respectively.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from tax8pricemin to tax8pricemax to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable tax8 and variable tax10.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the tax amount for 8% and 10% respectively by multiplying the current interger i with 0.08 and 0.1 respectively.
Then it checks if the calculated tax amount for 8% is equal to variable a and the calculated tax amount for 10% is equal to variable b. If it is, it prints the current interger i and exits the program.
After the loop finishes, it print -1 as output, because no such integer i was found that satisfies the condition.
<<<Output>>>
-1
