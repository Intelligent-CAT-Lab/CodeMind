 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input from the user using the Scanner class and stores it in a char array c.
It then checks if the first character of the string is 'x' and the last character of the string is 'x' using the logical operator &&.
If both conditions are true, it prints "x" otherwise it prints "o".
<<<Output>>>
x
