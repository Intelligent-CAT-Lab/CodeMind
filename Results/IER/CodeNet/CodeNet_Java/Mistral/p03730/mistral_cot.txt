 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized with 7, 5 and 1 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 5000 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the remainder of the multiplication of variable a and i divided by variable b. If the remainder is equal to variable c, it prints "YES" and returns immediately.
After the loop finishes, it prints "NO" because no such integer i was found that satisfies the condition.
<<<Output>>>
NO
