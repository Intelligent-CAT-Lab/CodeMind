 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized with the input "SAT" by calling the function nstr().
Then it uses the indexOf() method of the list to find the index of the string s in the list.
Since the string "SAT" is not present in the list, the indexOf() method returns -1.
Therefore, the expression 7 - list.indexOf(s) evaluates to 7 - (-1) = 8.
<<<Output>>>
8
