 <<<Analysis>>>
The program takes two integer inputs a and b from the user using the Scanner class. It then checks if the sum of a and b is equal to 15. If it is, it assigns the value "+ " to the variable ans. If the product of a and b is equal to 15, it assigns the value "* " to the variable ans. If neither of these conditions are met, it assigns the value "x" to the variable ans.
<<<Output>>>
