 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable input is initialized with the string "1118".
It enters a if-else statement and it checks if the second element of the valueset array is equal to the third element of the valueset array.
It also checks if the first element of the valueset array is equal to the second element of the valueset array or if the second element of the valueset array is equal to the third element of the valueset array.
Since the second element of the valueset array is equal to the third element of the valueset array, the condition is met and the program prints "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
