 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input from the standard input stream and stores it in variable s. It then iterates through each character in the string s. If the character is either 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T', it increments a counter variable cnt. Otherwise, it adds the current value of cnt to a priority queue pq. After the loop finishes, it adds the final value of cnt to the priority queue pq. Finally, it prints the top element of the priority queue pq, which is the answer.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is the top element of the priority queue pq, which is the answer.
