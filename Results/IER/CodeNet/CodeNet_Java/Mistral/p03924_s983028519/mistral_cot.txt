 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and m are initialized with 3 and 3 respectively according to the input. And variable dp is a 3D array of size 2x(n+1)x(n+1) initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable fr.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger fr by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum falls within the range [0, 2]. If it does, it adds the current interger i to variable answer. The condition is met when i is 0, 1 and 2.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable answer as output, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>
3
