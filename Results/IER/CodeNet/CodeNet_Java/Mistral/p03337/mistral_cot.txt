 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable a and variable b are initialized with 3 and 1 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger num by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum is equal to 3. If it is, it prints the current integer i as output.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable answer as output, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>
3
