 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable c is initialized with 67 according to the input.
It enters an if-else statement to check the value of variable c.
The condition c>=65 && c<=90 is met, so the code block under if is executed.
Inside the if block, variable code is assigned the value 1.
After the if block, the code block under else is executed, but the condition c>=97 && c<=122 is not met, so no value is assigned to variable code.
Therefore, the final value of variable code is 1.
