 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable k, variable A and variable B are initialized with 4, 2 and 6 respectively according to the input.
It enters an if-else statement.
Inside the if statement, it checks if the difference between variable B and variable A is less than or equal to 2. Since B-A=6-2=4, it is not less than or equal to 2, so the if statement is not met.
Inside the else statement, it calculates the value of variable kk by subtracting the difference between variable A and 1 from variable k.
Then it calculates the value of variable ans by multiplying the value of variable kk by half of the difference between variable B and variable A, adding variable A and then adding 1 if the remainder of kk divided by 2 is not 0.
Since kk=4-3=1, ans=1*2*4+2+1=13.
After the calculation, it prints the value of variable ans as output, which is 13.
<<<Output>>>
13
