 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 1_000_000_007L.
It enters a Scanner class to read input from the user.
It reads the input string str from the user.
It creates a 2D array d of size [str.length() + 1][4] and initializes the first row with 1.
It enters a for loop to iterate over each character in the input string str.
For each character, it checks if it is '?' and assigns n = 3, otherwise it assigns n = 1.
It also assigns a, b and c based on the character.
It calculates the values of d[i][0], d[i][1], d[i][2] and d[i][3] using the values of d[i-1][0], d[i-1][1], d[i-1][2] and d[i-1][3] and the values of n, a, b and c.
It then calculates the remainder of d[i][j] % N for j = 0, 1, 2 and 3.
After the loop finishes, it prints the value of d[str.length()][3] as output.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code for the input `A??C` would be 1.
