 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable K, variable A and variable B are initialized with 4, 2 and 6 respectively according to the input.
It enters a if-else statement and it checks if A is less than B. If it is, it enters the if block.
Inside the if block, it initializes variable sum1 with 1. Then it checks if A is greater than sum1. If it is, it subtracts the difference between A and sum1 from K and updates the value of sum1 to A.
Then it calculates the value of sum1 by adding (B-A)*(K/2) and adding 1 if K is odd.
Finally, it compares the value of sum with sum1 and assigns the maximum value to sum.
After the if-else statement finishes, it print the fianl value of variable sum as output, which is 11.
<<<Output>>>
11
