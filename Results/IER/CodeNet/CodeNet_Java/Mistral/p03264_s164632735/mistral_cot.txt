 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 3 according to the input. And variable a and variable b are initialized with 0.
It enters a if statement and it checks if n is even. Since n is 3, the condition is not met.
Then it enters the else block and it assigns the value of n/2 + 1 to variable a and the value of n/2 to variable b.
After the if-else block finishes, it prints the value of variable a * variable b, which is 3 * 0 = 0.
<<<Output>>>
