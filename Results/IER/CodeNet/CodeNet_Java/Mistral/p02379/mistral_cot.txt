 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 4 according to the input. And variable list is initialized with a double array of size 4.
It enters a while loop and it iterates from 0 to 3 to extract the values of the input array and store it in the list array.
Then it calculates the square root of the sum of the squares of the differences between the corresponding elements of the two arrays using the formula:
sqrt((list[0]-list[2])*(list[0]-list[2])+(list[1]-list[3])*(list[1]-list[3]))
The condition is met when n is 0, which means that the loop has finished iterating and the final value of the square root is printed.
<<<Output>>>
0.0
