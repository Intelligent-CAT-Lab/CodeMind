 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 111 according to the input. The variable THRESHOLD is initialized with 111.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 8 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current integer N is greater than the threshold value THRESHOLD * i and less than or equal to the threshold value THRESHOLD * (i + 1).
If it is true, it prints the value of THRESHOLD * (i + 1) which is 111.
After the loop finishes, it returns 111.
<<<Output>>>
111
