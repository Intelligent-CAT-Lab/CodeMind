The variable a, variable b and variable op are initialized with 5, 4 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable op.
Inside the for loop, it performs the following operations:
- If i is even, it adds the value of b to a and divides a by 2.
- If i is odd, it adds the value of a to b and divides b by 2.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl values of variable a and variable b as output.
