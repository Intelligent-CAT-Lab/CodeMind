The input is a string "3-2*3" which is parsed into a list of Elm objects. The list contains three elements: a Num object with value 3, a Subtract object and a Num object with value 2. The Subtract object has a left operand of the Num object with value 3 and a right operand of the Num object with value 2.
The list is then passed to the postfix function which applies the operator precedence rules to convert the infix expression to a postfix expression. The postfix function first checks the precedence of the operators and applies the operators accordingly. In this case, the Subtract operator has a higher precedence than the Num object with value 2, so the Num object with value 2 is pushed onto the stack first. Then the Subtract operator is applied to the top two elements on the stack, which are the Num object with value 3 and the Num object with value 2. The result of this operation is a Num object with value 1, which is pushed onto the stack. Finally, the Num object with value 1 is popped from the stack and returned as the result of the postfix expression.
