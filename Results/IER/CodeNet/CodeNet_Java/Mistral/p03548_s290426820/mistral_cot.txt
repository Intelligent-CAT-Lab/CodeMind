 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable x, variable y and variable z are initialized with 13, 3 and 1 respectively according to the input.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until the condition x-(y+z)>=0 is not met.
Inside the while loop, it subtracts the sum of y and z from x and assigns the result to variable x. It also increments the variable cnt.
Then it checks if x-(y+z)>=0 is not met. If it is not met, it checks if x-y>=0. If it is met, it increments the variable cnt and breaks out of the loop.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable cnt as output, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>
3
