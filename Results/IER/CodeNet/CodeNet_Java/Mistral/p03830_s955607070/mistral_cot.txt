The variable n is initialized with 3 according to the input. And variable sum is initialized with 1.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable t.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the number of occurrences of each divisor of t by repeatedlly extracting the divisors of number with a nested for loop and incrementing the count of each divisor in array x.
Then it calculates the product of all the occurrences of each divisor by multiplying the count of each divisor with (x[i]+1) and adding it to variable sum.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable sum as output, which is 1.
<<<Output>>>
