 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and variable m are initialized with 2 and 2 respectively according to the input. And variable ans is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of ans using the getAns function. The function getAns takes three arguments: num, sum and upperbound.
It first checks if the sum of num and upperbound is 0, in which case it returns 1.
It then calculates the value of ans using the formula:
ans = (1L*fact[sum+num-1]*inv(fact[num-1+(sum-upperbound-1)]) % mod) + mod;
It then returns the value of ans.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 1.
