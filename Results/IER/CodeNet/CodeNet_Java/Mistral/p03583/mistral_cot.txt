 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 2 according to the input.
It enters two nested for loops. The outer loop iterates from 1 to 3510 and the inner loop iterates from 1 to 3510.
Inside the for loops, it calculates the value of variable si and variable bo.
Then it checks if variable bo is less than or equal to 0. If it is, it skips the current iteration of the inner loop using the continue statement.
If variable bo is not less than or equal to 0, it checks if variable si is divisible by variable bo using the modulo operator (%). If it is, it prints the values of i, j and (si / bo) and returns from the function.
After the loops finish, it returns from the function because no values of i and j were found that satisfy the condition.
<<<Output>>>
No output is returned because no values of i and j were found that satisfy the condition.
