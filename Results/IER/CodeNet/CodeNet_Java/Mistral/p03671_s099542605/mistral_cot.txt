 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable num and param are initialized as ArrayLists. The variable system is initialized with 0.
It enters a while loop and it reads the input line by line. If the input is an integer, it is added to the ArrayList num. If the input is a string, it is added to the ArrayList param.
The while loop continues until there is no more input.
After the while loop finishes, it calls the Method function with the ArrayList num and param as arguments.
Inside the Method function, it sorts the ArrayList num in ascending order.
Then it prints the sum of the first two elements of the sorted ArrayList num.
