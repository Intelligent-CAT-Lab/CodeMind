The variable n and k are initialized with 2 and 2 respectively according to the input. The variable t is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable x.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable t by calling function f(n,k) which returns the sum of the digits of n raised to the power of k.
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from 1 to 2 to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable m.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable t by adding the value of dp[i-1][u+(u+j)/i] and (u+j)%i*m%MOD.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable t as output, which is 1.
