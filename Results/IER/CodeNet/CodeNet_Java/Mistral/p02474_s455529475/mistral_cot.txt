 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two input numbers from the user using the Scanner class. The first number is read using the `nextBigInteger()` method and stored in the variable `num1`. The second number is read using the `nextBigInteger()` method and stored in the variable `num2`.
Then it multiplies the two numbers using the `multiply()` method of the BigInteger class and stores the result in the variable `result`.
Finally, it prints the value of the `result` variable using the `println()` method of the System.out class.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code would be 40.
