 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 3 according to the input. And variable pow is initialized with 1.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 3 to calculate the value of variable pow.
Inside the for loop, it multiplies the current value of variable pow with the current integer i and then takes the remainder of the result divided by 1000000007.
Then it prints the final value of variable pow as output.
