 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable r, variable g and variable b are initialized with 4, 3 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It creates a string s by concatenating the values of variable g and variable b using the String.valueOf() method.
Then it converts the string s to an integer k using the Integer.parseInt() method.
It checks if k is divisible by 4 using the modulo operator (%).
Since k is 11, which is not divisible by 4, the program prints "NO" as output.
<<<Output>>>
NO
