 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integer inputs a and b from the user. The function calcu is called with the values of a and b as arguments.
Inside the function, it uses a while loop to repeatedly subtract the value of b from a until b becomes 0. The remainder of the division of a by b is stored in variable ans.
Then the value of a is updated with the value of b and the value of b is updated with the value of ans.
After the while loop finishes, the value of variable a is printed as output.
<<<Output>>>
20
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
The return value of the code is 20.
