The variable n is initialized with 10 according to the input. And variable count is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 10 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the square of current interger i is less than or equal to n. If it is, it increments the variable count. The condition is met when i is 1, 4 and 9.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable count as output, which is 3.
