 <<<Analysis>>>
The program takes three integers as input from the user using the Scanner class. The first integer is a, the second integer is b and the third integer is c.
It then checks if the value of a is less than or equal to c and if c is less than or equal to b. If both conditions are true, it prints "Yes" otherwise it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
