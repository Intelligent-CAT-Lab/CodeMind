 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized with 2, 3 and 9 respectively according to the input.
It enters a method named sqrt which takes two parameters a and scale.
Inside the method, it first calculates the square root of the number a using the Math.sqrt() method and then it converts it to a BigDecimal object.
Then it checks if the scale is less than 17, if it is, it sets the scale of the result to the given scale using the setScale() method.
Then it enters a for loop which iterates from 16 to the given scale (excluding the given scale) and in each iteration it calculates the new value of x by subtracting the square of x from a divided by x multiplied by 2.
After the loop finishes, it returns the final value of x.
After the method finishes, it checks if the sum of the square root of a, b and c is less than 17, if it is, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
