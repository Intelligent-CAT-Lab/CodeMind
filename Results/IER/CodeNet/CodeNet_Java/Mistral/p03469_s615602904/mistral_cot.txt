 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first creates a FastScanner object to read input from the console. It then reads the input line using the `nextLine()` method and stores it in a variable `s`.
It then iterates through the characters of the input string `s` and replaces the character at index 3 with '8'.
It then prints the modified string using the `println()` method.
<<<Output>>>
8
