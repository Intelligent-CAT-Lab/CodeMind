 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 3 according to the input. And variable ans is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 5 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j, k and l.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of dp[n][i][j][k] by adding the value of dp[n-1][j][k][l] and dp[n-1][j][k][l] using modulo operation.
Then it calculates the value of ans by adding the value of dp[n][i][j][k] for all i, j, k and l.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 1.
