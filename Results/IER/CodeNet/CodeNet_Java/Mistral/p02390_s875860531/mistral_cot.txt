The variable S is initialized with 46979 according to the input.
It enters a Scanner class to read the input from the console.
It uses the nextInt() method to read the integer value of S.
Then it calculates the hour, minute and second of the input time by dividing S by 3600 and taking the remainder.
It uses the modulo operator to get the remainder of S divided by 60 to get the minute.
It uses the modulo operator again to get the remainder of S divided by 60 to get the second.
Finally, it uses the String.format() method to print the hour, minute and second in the format of "hh:mm:ss".
