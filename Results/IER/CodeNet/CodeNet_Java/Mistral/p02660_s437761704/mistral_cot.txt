 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 24 according to the input. The variable ans is initialized with 0.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until N is equal to 1.
Inside the while loop, it calculates the value of div by raising q to the power of e.
Then it checks if N is divisible by div. If it is, it divides N by div and increments ans and e.
If N is not divisible by q, it divides N by q and increments e.
Then it checks if q is equal to 2. If it is, it increments q. Otherwise, it increments q by 2.
If q * q is greater than N, it breaks out of the loop.
After the loop finishes, it checks if N is equal to 1. If it is not, it increments ans.
Finally, it prints the value of ans as output, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>
