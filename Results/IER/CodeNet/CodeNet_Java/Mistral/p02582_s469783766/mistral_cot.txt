The variable s is initialized with the input string "RRS". The variable max is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the string s. The value of variable i is also passed to variable c.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character c is 'R'. If it is, it updates the value of variable max by taking the maximum of the current value of max and the index i - left + 1. This is because the current character 'R' is the rightmost character in the current substring, and the length of the current substring is i - left + 1.
If the current character c is not 'R', it updates the value of variable left to i + 1. This is because the current character 'R' is the rightmost character in the current substring, and the length of the current substring is i + 1 - left.
After the loop finishes, it returns the value of variable max, which is 3.
