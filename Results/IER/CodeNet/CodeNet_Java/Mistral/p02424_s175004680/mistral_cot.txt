 <<<Analysis>>>
The program takes two long inputs, num1 and num2, which are 8 and 10 respectively.
It then uses three bitwise operators, &, |, and ^, to perform bitwise operations on num1 and num2.
The first operation, num1 & num2, performs a bitwise AND operation between num1 and num2. This operation returns a number where each bit is 1 if and only if both corresponding bits in num1 and num2 are 1. The result of this operation is 0.
The second operation, num1 | num2, performs a bitwise OR operation between num1 and num2. This operation returns a number where each bit is 1 if and only if at least one corresponding bit in num1 or num2 is 1. The result of this operation is 15.
The third operation, num1 ^ num2, performs a bitwise XOR operation between num1 and num2. This operation returns a number where each bit is 1 if and only if exactly one corresponding bit in num1 or num2 is 1. The result of this operation is 11.
Then it uses the `zeroLine` method to add leading zeros to the binary representation of the result of each operation so that they are all 32 bits long.
Finally, it uses the `printStr` method to print the binary representation of the result of each operation.
