 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable m, variable rd, variable rr, variable cd, and variable cr are initialized with the input values.
It calculates the value of variable d by dividing the value of variable cd by variable rd and multiplying the result by 100.
It then uses a while loop to check if the value of variable d multiplied by variable rd divided by 100 is equal to variable cd. If it is not, it increments the value of variable d by 1.
It calculates the value of variable r by dividing the value of variable cr by variable rr and multiplying the result by 100.
It then uses another while loop to check if the value of variable r multiplied by variable rr divided by 100 is equal to variable cr. If it is not, it increments the value of variable r by 1.
It then subtracts the values of variable d and variable r from variable m and prints the result.
<<<Output>>>
-1
