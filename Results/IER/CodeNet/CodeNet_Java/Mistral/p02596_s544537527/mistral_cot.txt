 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable k is initialized with 101.
It enters a if-else statement and checks if k is divisible by 2 or 5. Since k is not divisible by 2 or 5, it enters the else block.
Inside the else block, it initializes a variable count to 1 and a variable cur to 7 modulo k.
It then enters a while loop that continues until cur is 0. Inside the while loop, it increments count and multiplies cur by 10 and adds 7. It then takes the modulo of cur with k.
The while loop continues until cur is 0, which means that count is incremented until cur is equal to 0 modulo k.
After the while loop finishes, it prints the value of count, which is 1.
