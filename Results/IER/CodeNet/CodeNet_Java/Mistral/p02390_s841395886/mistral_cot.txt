The variable S is initialized with 46979 according to the input.
It enters a try-catch block and it reads the input from the console using BufferedReader.
Then it calculates the value of h, m and s by dividing the input S by 3600, (S - h * 3600) / 60 and S - (h * 3600 + m * 60) respectively.
It then prints the value of h, m and s in the format of h:m:s.
