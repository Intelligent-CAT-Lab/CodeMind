 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable input is initialized with the given string "?D-C'KOPUA".
It enters a while loop and it iterates through each character in the input string.
For each character, it checks if it is a letter or not. If it is a letter, it converts the letter to its corresponding binary number using the map2 HashMap and appends it to the StringBuilder ss.
If it is not a letter, it converts the character to its corresponding binary number using the map and appends it to the StringBuilder ss.
After the loop finishes, it enters another while loop and it iterates through each substring in the ss string.
For each substring, it checks if it exists in the map2 HashMap. If it does, it appends the corresponding character to the StringBuilder sss.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of the sss StringBuilder as output.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code based on the given input is "?D-C'KOPUA".
