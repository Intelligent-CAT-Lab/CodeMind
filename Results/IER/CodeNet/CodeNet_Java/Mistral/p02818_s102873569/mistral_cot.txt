The variable a, variable b and variable k are initialized with 2, 3 and 3 respectively according to the input.
It enters an if-else statement to check if both a and k are positive. If they are, it checks if k is greater than or equal to a. If it is, it subtracts k from a and sets k to 0. If it is not, it subtracts a from k and sets a to 0.
It then enters another if-else statement to check if both b and k are positive. If they are, it checks if k is greater than or equal to b. If it is, it subtracts k from b and sets k to 0. If it is not, it subtracts b from k and sets b to 0.
After the if-else statements finish, it prints the final values of a and b as output, which are 0 0.
