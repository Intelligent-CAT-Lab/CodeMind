 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the necessary classes from the java.util and java.math packages.
It then creates a new Scanner object to read input from the user.
It reads the first input string from the user using the next() method of the Scanner class and stores it in the variable str.
It then creates a new BigInteger object from the input string str using the constructor of the BigInteger class.
It reads the second input string from the user using the next() method of the Scanner class and stores it in the variable str.
It creates another new BigInteger object from the second input string str using the constructor of the BigInteger class.
It then calls the multiply() method of the BigInteger class on the two BigInteger objects A and B to get the product of the two numbers.
Finally, it prints the product using the println() method of the System.out class.
