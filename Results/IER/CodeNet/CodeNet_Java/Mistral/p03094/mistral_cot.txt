 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 2 according to the input. And variable dp is initialized with {1, 0, 0}.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 2 to check each integer k in this range. The value of variable k is also passed to variable coef.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the next value of dp by adding the value of dp[j1] to dp[j2] for j1 != j2.
Then it calculates the value of coef by multiplying the value of coef with (n - k + 1) and inv[k].
It then calculates the value of ways by multiplying the value of dp[1] with coef.
It then calculates the value of delta by multiplying the value of inv[3] with inv[n] with inv[k] and ways.
Finally it adds the value of delta to the variable ret.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ret as output, which is 0.
<<<Output>>>
