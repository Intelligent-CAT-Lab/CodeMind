 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integer inputs from the user, dress and days. It then calculates the return value by dividing the sum of days and dress by dress.
The formula used is (days + dress - 1) / dress.
The return value is then printed to the console.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code for the input `3 5` would be 2.0.
