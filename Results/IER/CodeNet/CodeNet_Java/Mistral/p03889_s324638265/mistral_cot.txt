 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized with the input "pdbq". The length of the string is calculated and stored in variable l.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to l/2-1. The value of variable i is also passed to variable c.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character c is 'b', 'd' or 'p'. If it is 'b', it replaces it with 'd'. If it is 'd', it replaces it with 'b'. If it is 'p', it replaces it with 'q'.
Then it checks if the current character c is not equal to the last character of the string s. If it is not, it prints "No" and closes the output stream.
After the loop finishes, it prints "Yes" and closes the output stream.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
