 <<<Analysis>>>
The program takes two integer inputs a and b from the user. The program then checks if a is greater than or equal to b. If it is, it enters a for loop that iterates from 0 to a and prints the value of b in each iteration. If it is not, it enters another for loop that iterates from 0 to b and prints the value of a in each iteration.
