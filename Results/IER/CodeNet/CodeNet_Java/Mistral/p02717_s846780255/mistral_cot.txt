 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads three integers from the standard input stream using the `nextInt()` method of the `ContestReader` class. These integers are stored in the variables `x`, `y`, and `z`.
Then it prints these three integers in the order `z`, `x`, and `y` using the `printListOneLine()` method of the `ContestWriter` class.
