 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first creates a Scanner object to read input from the user. It then prompts the user to enter a number between 0 and 6, which represents the day of the week.
The user enters 1, which is a valid input.
The code then uses the modulo operator to calculate the remainder of 1 divided by 7, which is 1.
The remainder is used as an index to access the corresponding element in the array "thu:fri:sat:sun:mon:tue:wed".
The array is split by the colon character, which results in an array of strings "thu", "fri", "sat", "sun", "mon", "tue", "wed".
The code then prints the element at index 1, which is "fri".
<<<Output>>>
fri
