 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable S is initialized with the input "erasedream".
It enters a series of replaceAll() method calls to replace the substrings "eraser", "erase", "dreamer" and "dream" with "-".
After the replaceAll() method calls, it calls the replaceAll() method again to replace all occurrences of "-" with an empty string.
Then it checks if the length of the resulting string is 0. Since the resulting string is "erasedream" which has 9 characters, the condition is not met and it prints "NO".
<<<Output>>>
NO
