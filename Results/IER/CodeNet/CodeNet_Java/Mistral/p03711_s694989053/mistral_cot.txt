 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable x and y are initialized with 1 and 3 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 6 to check each integer A[i] in this range.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current integer x is equal to A[i]. If it is, it assigns "A" to variable Xans.
It also enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 5 to check each integer B[i] in this range.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current integer y is equal to B[i]. If it is, it assigns "B" to variable Yans.
After the loops finishes, it check if x is equal to 2 and y is also equal to 2. If it is, it assigns "C" to variable Xans.
Then it check if variable Xans is equal to variable Yans. If it is, it prints "Yes" otherwise it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
