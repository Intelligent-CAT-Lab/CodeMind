 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 10 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 10 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable sunukeNum.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger sunukeNum by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable gradesum.
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of sunukeString + 1. The value of variable j is also passed to variable nine.
Inside the second for loop, it calculates the candidate number by concatenating the substring of sunukeString from 0 to sunukeString.length() - j with the string nine.
Then it calculates the candidate number by multiplying the candidate number with the result of the calc() function.
It then compares the candidate number with the minimum value and updates the minimum value and sunukecand if the candidate number is smaller than the minimum value.
After the second for loop finishes, it prints the value of sunukecand.
It then increments the value of sunukeNum by 1.
After the loop finishes, it prints the value of sunukecand which is 1.0.
<<<Output>>>
1.0
