 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the java.util package and creates a static Scanner object named s.
In the main method, it uses the nextInt() method of the Scanner object to read an integer input from the user.
Then it checks if the input is less than 1200. If it is, it prints "ABC" otherwise it prints "ARC".
<<<Output>>>
ABC
