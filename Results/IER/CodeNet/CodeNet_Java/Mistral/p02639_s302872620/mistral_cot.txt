 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a line of input from the standard input stream, which is a string of integers separated by spaces. It then uses the `Arrays.stream()` method to convert the string of integers into an array of integers. The `mapToInt()` method is used to convert the array of integers into an array of integers of type `int`. The `toArray()` method is used to convert the array of integers into a fixed-size array of integers.
It then enters a for loop and it iterates through each element of the array. If the current element is 0, it prints the index of the current element plus 1.
In this case, the input is `0 2 3 4 5`, so the output will be:
```
1
2
3
4
5
```
<<<Output>>>
