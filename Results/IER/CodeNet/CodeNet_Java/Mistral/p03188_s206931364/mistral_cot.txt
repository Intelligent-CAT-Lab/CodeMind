The variable k is initialized with 2 according to the input. And variable n is initialized with 2.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable temp.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of temp[i][0] and temp[i][1] as k.
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 1 to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable temp.
Inside the second for loop, it calculates the value of temp[i][j] as k.
After the loop finishes, it print the value of temp[0][0] and temp[0][1] as output, which are 2 and 2 respectively.
<<<Output>>>
2 2
