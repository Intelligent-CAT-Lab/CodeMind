 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized with the input string "QWERTYASDFZXCV".
It then converts the string to a character array using the toCharArray() method.
It initializes two variables min and max to 0.
It enters two for loops, one iterates from the end of the string to the beginning and the other iterates from the beginning of the string to the end.
Inside the first loop, it checks if the current character is 'A' and if it is, it sets the value of min to the current index.
Inside the second loop, it checks if the current character is 'Z' and if it is, it sets the value of max to the current index.
After the loops finish, it calculates the difference between max and min and adds 1 to it.
Finally, it prints the result which is 6.
<<<Output>>>
6
