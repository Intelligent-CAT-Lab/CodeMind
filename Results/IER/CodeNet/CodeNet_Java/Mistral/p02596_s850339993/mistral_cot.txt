 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable K is initialized with 101 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 100000000.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current integer cur is divisible by K. If it is, it prints the current value of variable cnt and returns from the function.
If it is not divisible by K, it calculates the next value of variable cur by multiplying the current value of variable cur by 10 and adding 7, then taking the modulo with K. It also increments the value of variable cnt.
After the loop finishes, it prints -1 as output, because the loop did not find a value of cur that is divisible by K.
<<<Output>>>
-1
