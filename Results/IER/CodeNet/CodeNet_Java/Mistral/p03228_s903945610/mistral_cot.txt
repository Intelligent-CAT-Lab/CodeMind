 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable A, variable B and variable K are initialized with 5, 4 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 2 (since K is 2).
Inside the for loop, it divides the value of variable A by 2 and assigns the result to variable A. Then it calculates the new value of variable B by adding the current value of variable A and variable B and dividing the result by 2. Finally, it adds the new value of variable B to variable A.
After the loop finishes, it checks if K is odd. Since K is 2, it is even, so it doesn't execute the if statement.
It then prints the final values of variable A and variable B, which are 2 and 3 respectively.
<<<Output>>>
