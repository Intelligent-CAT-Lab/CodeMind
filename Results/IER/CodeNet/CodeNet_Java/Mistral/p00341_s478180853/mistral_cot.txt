 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable e[] is initialized with the input values [1, 1, 3, 4, 8, 9, 7, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5].
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 11 to check each integer e[i] in this range.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 11 - i to check each integer e[j] in this range.
It checks if e[j] is less than e[j + 1]. If it is, it swaps the values of e[j] and e[j + 1].
After the inner loop finishes, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer u in this range.
Inside the outer loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 3 to check each integer k in this range.
It calculates the index i = u * 4 and checks if e[i] is equal to e[i + 1], e[i + 2] and e[i + 3].
It also checks if e[i] is equal to e[i + 2], e[i + 1] and e[i + 3].
It also checks if e[i] is equal to e[i + 3], e[i + 1] and e[i + 2].
If all these conditions are met, it increments the variable p by 1.
After the outer loop finishes, it checks if the value of p is equal to 12. If it is, it prints "yes", otherwise it prints "no".
<<<Output>>>
no
