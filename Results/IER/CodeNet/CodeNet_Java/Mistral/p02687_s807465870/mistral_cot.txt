 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a line of input from the user using the `Scanner` class and stores it in the variable `pre`.
Then it uses the `equals()` method to compare the value of `pre` with the string "ABC".
If the value of `pre` is equal to "ABC", it prints "ARC" otherwise it prints "ABC".
<<<Output>>>
ABC
