 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integer inputs N and K from the user. N is the number of elements in the array and K is the number of elements to be removed.
It then prints the number of elements left in the array after removing K elements.
It uses the scanner class to read the input from the user.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code for the input `4 2` would be 2.
