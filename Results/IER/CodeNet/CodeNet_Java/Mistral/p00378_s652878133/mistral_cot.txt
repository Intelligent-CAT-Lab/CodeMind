The variable A, variable B and variable X are initialized with 180, 100 and 2400 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2400 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable dp.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the minimum value of dp[i+1000] and dp[i+500] and assigns it to dp[i+1000] and dp[i+500] respectively.
Then it assigns the minimum value of dp[i+1000] and dp[i+500] to dp[i] respectively.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable dp[0] as output, which is 100.
<<<Output>>>
100
