 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads the input string from the user using the Scanner class. It then iterates through each character in the string using a for loop.
For each character, it checks if it is a lowercase letter, uppercase letter or a space using the Character.isLowerCase(), Character.isUpperCase() and Character.isSpace() methods respectively.
If the character is a lowercase letter, it converts it to uppercase using the Character.toUpperCase() method and prints it.
If the character is an uppercase letter, it converts it to lowercase using the Character.toLowerCase() method and prints it.
If the character is a space, it prints a space.
If the character is neither a lowercase letter, uppercase letter or a space, it prints the character as is.
After the loop finishes, it prints a newline character to move to the next line.
<<<Output>>>
F A I R, L A T E R, O C C A S I O N A L L Y C L O U D Y.
