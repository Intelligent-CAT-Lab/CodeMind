 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N and M are initialized with 1 and 6 respectively according to the input. And variable sum is initialized with 0.
It enters an if-else statement to check the relationship between N and M.
If N*2>M, it means that N is greater than M/2, so it assigns M/2 to variable sum.
If M>N*2, it means that M is greater than N*2, so it assigns N to variable sum and then adds (M-N*2)/4 to variable sum.
After the if-else statement finishes, it print the fianl value of variable sum as output, which is 4.
<<<Output>>>
4
