 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integer inputs n and k from the user. The variable ans is initialized with 0.
It checks the value of k using an if-else statement. If k is equal to 1, it assigns 0 to variable ans. Otherwise, it assigns the value of n minus k to variable ans.
After that it prints the value of variable ans as output.
<<<Output>>>
0
