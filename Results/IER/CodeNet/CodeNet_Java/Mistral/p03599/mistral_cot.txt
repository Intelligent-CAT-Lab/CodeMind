The variable A, variable B, variable C, variable D, variable E and variable F are initialized with 1, 2, 10, 20, 15 and 200 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 200/1000000000 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable ans1.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 200/1000000000 to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable ans2.
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 200/1000000000 to check each integer k in this range. The value of variable k is also passed to variable ans2.
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 200/1000000000 to check each integer l in this range. The value of variable l is also passed to variable ans2.
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 200/1000000000 to check each integer m in this range. The value of variable m is also passed to variable ans2.
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 200/1000000000 to check each integer n in this range. The value of variable n is also passed to variable ans2.
Then it checks if the calculated variable ans1 and ans2 fall within the given conditions. If it does, it updates the value of ans1 and ans2.
After the loops finish, it print the fianl value of variable ans1 and ans2 as output, which are 1000000000 and 200 respectively.
<<<Output>>>
1000000000 200
