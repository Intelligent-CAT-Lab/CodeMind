 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable num is initialized with 3 integers, 3, 8 and 1.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num[i].
Inside the for loop, it compares the current integer num[i] with variable max. If num[i] is greater than max, it updates the value of max and ind.
After the loop finishes, it checks if ind is not equal to 2. If it is not, it swaps the values of num[2] and num[ind].
Then it checks if num[0] is greater than num[1]. If it is, it swaps the values of num[0] and num[1].
Finally, it prints the sorted array num[0], num[1] and num[2].
