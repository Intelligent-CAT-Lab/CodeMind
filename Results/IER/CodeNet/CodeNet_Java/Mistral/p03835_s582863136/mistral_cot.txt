The variable k and variable s are initialized with 2 and 2 respectively according to the input. And variable count is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to k to check each integer x in this range.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to k to check each integer y in this range.
It checks if the sum of x and y is less than or equal to s and if it is also less than or equal to k. If it is, it increments the count variable.
The condition is met when x is 0 and y is 2.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable count as output, which is 1.
