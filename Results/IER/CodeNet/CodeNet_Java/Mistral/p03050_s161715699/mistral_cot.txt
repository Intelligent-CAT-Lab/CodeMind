 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 8 according to the input.
It calls the function divisors(8) which returns a list of divisors of 8. The list is [1, 2, 4].
It then iterates through the list and checks if the current divisor is greater than 1000000. If it is, it continues to the next divisor.
It then checks if the current divisor multiplied by itself plus the current divisor is less than or equal to n. If it is, it calculates the difference between n and the current divisor and adds it to the answer variable ans.
Since 1*1+1=2 and 2*2+2=8, it adds 4 to the ans variable.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 4.
<<<Output>>>
4
