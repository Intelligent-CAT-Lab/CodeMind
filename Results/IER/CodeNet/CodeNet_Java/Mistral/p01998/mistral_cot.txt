The variable n is initialized with 3 according to the input. And variable count is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable arr[i].
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current integer i is not already marked as true in the boolean array arr[i]. If it is not, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 2 to i to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable arr[i*j].
It sets the value of arr[i*j] to true.
Then it checks if the current integer i is not already marked as true in the boolean array arr[i] and arr[i-2]. If it is not, it increments the count variable.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable count as output, which is 1.
