 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized with 6, 4 and 3 respectively according to the input.
It enters an if-else statement and it checks if the sum of variable b and variable c is less than variable a.
Since the sum of variable b and variable c is 10 which is greater than variable a, the else block is executed.
It subtracts the value of variable a from the sum of variable b and variable c and assigns the result to variable answer.
The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the if-else statement finishes, it print the fianl value of variable answer as output, which is 7.
<<<Output>>>
7
