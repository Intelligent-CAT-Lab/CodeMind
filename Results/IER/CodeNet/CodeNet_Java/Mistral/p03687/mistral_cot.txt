 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized with the input "serval".
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 25 to check each character target in the range of 'a' to 'z'.
Inside the for loop, it initializes two variables max and cur to 0.
It enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the string s.
Inside the inner loop, it checks if the current character of the string s is equal to the target character. If it is, it resets the variable cur to 0. Otherwise, it increments the variable cur and updates the variable max with the maximum value between max and cur.
After the inner loop finishes, it updates the variable ans with the minimum value between ans and max.
After the outer loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable ans as output, which is 5.
<<<Output>>>
5
