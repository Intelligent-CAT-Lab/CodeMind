 <<<Analysis>>>
The program takes three long inputs from the user, a, b and n.
It first checks if n is greater than or equal to b. If it is, it calculates the return value as (a*(b-1)/b). If it is not, it calculates the return value as (a*n/b).
In this case, n is 4, which is less than b which is 7. So the program calculates the return value as (5*4/7) which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
