 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers A and B from the standard input. It then calculates the sum of the digits of A and B and stores it in the variable sum. It then checks if the sum is less than or equal to 5. If it is, it prints the string "=". If it is greater than 5, it prints the string "<". If it is less than 5, it prints the string ">".
The code uses a while loop to extract the digits of A and B one by one and add them to the variable sum.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is the string "=".
