 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n, variable h and variable d are initialized with 2, 2 and 1 respectively according to the input. And variable mod is initialized with 1000000007.
The long array dp is initialized with 1 at index 0 and 0 at all other indexes.
The variable fs is initialized with 1 and f is initialized with 2.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of f by multiplying the current interger i with the previous value of f and taking the modulo with mod.
Then it calculates the value of fs by adding the current value of f to the previous value of fs and taking the modulo with mod.
It enters another for loop and it iterates from 1 to h to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable sum.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of sum by adding the value of dp[i-1] to the current value of sum and taking the modulo with mod.
Then it updates the value of dp[i] by adding the value of sum and taking the modulo with mod.
Then it checks if the current value of i is greater than or equal to d. If it is, it updates the value of sum by subtracting the value of dp[i-d] and taking the modulo with mod.
Then it updates the value of dp[i] by multiplying the value of fs with the current value of sum and taking the modulo with mod.
It enters another for loop and it iterates from 1 to d to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable ret.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of ret by adding the value of dp[h-i] and taking the modulo with mod.
Finally it prints the value of ret.
