 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n, variable a and variable b are initialized with 5, 2 and 4 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the difference between variable b and variable a and assigns it to variable k.
It checks if the remainder of variable k divided by 2 is equal to 1. If it is, it prints "Borys" otherwise it prints "Alice".
Since k is 2, the remainder of k divided by 2 is 0, so it prints "Alice".
<<<Output>>>
Alice
