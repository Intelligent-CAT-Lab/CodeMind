 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable k is initialized with 2 according to the input.
It enters an if statement and checks if k is equal to 1. Since it is not, it proceeds to the next block of code.
It calculates the value of variable n as 2 \* ((k+3)/4) = 2 \* ((2+3)/4) = 2 \* (5/4) = 5.
It calculates the value of variable curt as n*2 - k = 5*2 - 2 = 9.
It creates a 2D array mat of size n x n and initializes it with 0.
It enters a for loop and iterates through each row of the mat. For each row, it enters another for loop and iterates through each column of the row.
For each cell in the mat, it checks if the row index is odd and if the sum of the row index and column index is less than n - curt. If both conditions are met, it sets the value of the cell to n + (row index + column index)%n and increments it by 1. Otherwise, it sets the value of the cell to (row index + column index)%n and increments it by 1.
It prints the value of n and then prints each row of the mat.
