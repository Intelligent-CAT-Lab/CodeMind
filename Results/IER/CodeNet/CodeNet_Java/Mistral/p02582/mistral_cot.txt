 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized with the input "RRS".
It enters a series of if-else statements to check the first three characters of the input string.
If the first three characters are "RRR", the variable res is set to 3.
If the first two characters are "RR" and the third character is "S", the variable res is set to 2.
If the first two characters are "SS" and the third character is "R", the variable res is set to 2.
If the first three characters are "SSS", the variable res is set to 0.
Since none of the conditions match the input "RRS", the variable res is set to 1.
