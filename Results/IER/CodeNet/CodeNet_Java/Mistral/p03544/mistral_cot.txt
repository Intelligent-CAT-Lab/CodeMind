The variable n is initialized with 5 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 99 to calculate the value of each element of the array num.
Inside the for loop, it checks the current index i and assigns the value accordingly.
For i=0, it assigns the value 2 to num[i].
For i=1, it assigns the value 1 to num[i].
For i>1, it assigns the value of num[i-1]+num[i-2] to num[i].
After the loop finishes, it print the value of num[5] as output, which is 14.
<<<Output>>>
