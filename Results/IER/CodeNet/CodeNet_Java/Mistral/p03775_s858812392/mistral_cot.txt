 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 10000 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to the square root of N to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable rootN.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the number of digits of the current interger i and variable N divided by i using a while loop and adding it to variable count.
Then it checks if the calculated variable count is less than the current minimum value min. If it is, it updates the value of min.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable min as output, which is 4.
<<<Output>>>
4
