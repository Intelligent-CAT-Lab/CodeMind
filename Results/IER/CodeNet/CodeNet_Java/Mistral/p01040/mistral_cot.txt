 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable y1, variable m1, variable d1, variable y2, variable m2 and variable d2 are initialized with 2015, 3, 13, 2015, 3, 13 respectively according to the input.
The variable a is initialized with 5.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until y1 is greater than y2 or y1 is equal to y2 and m1 is greater than m2 or y1 is equal to y2 and m1 is equal to m2 and d1 is greater than d2.
Inside the while loop, it checks if d1 is equal to 13 and a is equal to 5. If it is, it increments the variable count.
Then it increments the variable d1 and checks if d1 is greater than days[m1] + (m1 == 2 && isUruu(y1) ? 1 : 0). If it is, it sets d1 to 1 and increments m1. If m1 is greater than 12, it sets m1 to 1 and increments y1.
It also increments the variable a by 1 and takes the remainder of a divided by 7.
After the loop finishes, it returns the final value of variable count, which is 1.
