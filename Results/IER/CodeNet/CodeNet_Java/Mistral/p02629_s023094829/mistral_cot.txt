 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 2 according to the input.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until n is less than 0.
Inside the while loop, it calculates the remainder of n divided by 26 and assigns it to variable d.
Then it adds the ASCII value of the character 'a' (97) to the remainder d and adds it to variable name.
Then it divides n by 26 and subtracts 1 from it.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable name as output, which is "ab".
<<<Output>>>
ab
