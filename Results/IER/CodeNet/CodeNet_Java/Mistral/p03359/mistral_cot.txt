 <<<Analysis>>>
The program takes two integer inputs a and b from the user using the Scanner class.
It then checks if the value of b is greater than or equal to the value of a. If it is, it prints the value of a. Otherwise, it prints the value of a minus 1.
In this case, the value of a is 5 and the value of b is 5, so the condition is not met and the program prints the value of a minus 1, which is 4.
<<<Output>>>
4
