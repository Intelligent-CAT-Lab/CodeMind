 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 25 according to the input.
It creates a 2D array numArray of size 10x10 and initializes all its elements with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 25 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable topNum and bottomNum.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the top and bottom numbers of the current interger i by extracting the first digit and the last digit of number with a substring method and converting them to integers.
Then it increments the element of numArray[bottomNum][topNum] by 1.
After the loop finishes, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 1 to 25 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable topNum and bottomNum.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the top and bottom numbers of the current interger i by extracting the first digit and the last digit of number with a substring method and converting them to integers.
Then it adds the element of numArray[bottomNum][topNum] to variable res.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable res as output, which is 105.
<<<Output>>>
105
