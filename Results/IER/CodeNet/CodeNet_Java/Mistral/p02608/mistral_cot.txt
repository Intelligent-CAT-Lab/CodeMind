 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 20 according to the input.
It creates an array eratosu of size 100000.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 100 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 1 to 100 to check each integer j in this range.
Inside the second for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 1 to 100 to check each integer k in this range.
It calculates the sum of the squares of i, j and k and the sum of the products of i, j and k.
It stores the result in an array eratosu.
After the loop finishes, it creates a string s with the value of eratosu[1] and it converts it to a StringBuilder.
It enters another for loop and it iterates from 2 to n to append the value of eratosu[i] to the StringBuilder.
After the loop finishes, it prints the StringBuilder.
