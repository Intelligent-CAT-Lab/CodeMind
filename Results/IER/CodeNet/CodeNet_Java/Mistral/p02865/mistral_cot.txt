 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 4 according to the input.
It enters a try-catch block and it calls the method `i()` of the `Reader` class to read the input.
The method `i()` reads the input as a string and then converts it to an integer using the `Integer.parseInt()` method.
It then returns the integer value of N, which is 4.
<<<Output>>>
4
