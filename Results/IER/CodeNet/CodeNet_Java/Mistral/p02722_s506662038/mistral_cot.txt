 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable j is initialized with 6 according to the input. The variable k is initialized with j - 1 = 5.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to the square root of j (rounded up) to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable k.
Inside the for loop, it checks if j is divisible by i by using the modulo operator (%). If it is, it calls the function f(i, j, l) and passes the variable i, j and l as arguments.
The function f(i, j, l) takes three arguments: i, j and l. It uses a while loop to repeatedly divide j by i until j is no longer divisible by i. If the remainder of j divided by i is 1, it adds i to the HashSet l.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable l.size() + 2.
