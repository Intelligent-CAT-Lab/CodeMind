 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 1118 according to the input.
It calculates the value of n1, n10, n100 and n1000 by repeatedly extracting the digits of number with modulo operation.
n1 is 1, n10 is 1, n100 is 1 and n1000 is 1.
It then checks if n1 is equal to n10 and n10 is equal to n100 or n10 is equal to n100 and n100 is equal to n1000.
Since n1 is not equal to n10 and n10 is not equal to n100, it prints "No" as output.
<<<Output>>>
No
