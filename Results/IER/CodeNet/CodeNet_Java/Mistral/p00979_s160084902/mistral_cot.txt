 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable t is initialized with 19 according to the input. And variable ans is initialized with 1.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until t is 0.
Inside the while loop, it calculates the remainder of t divided by 3 and assigns it to variable three.
Then it adds t to variable ans and subtracts t % 3 from variable ans.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
