 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable str is initialized with the input string "$OJJOOIIOJOI".
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to the length of the string - 1 to check each character in the string.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character is 'O' and if the previous character is not 'O'. If it is, it stores the index of the current character in variable s.
Then it checks if the current character is 'O' and if the next character is not 'O'. If it is, it calculates the length of the current substring by subtracting the index of the previous 'O' from the index of the current 'O' plus 1.
It then checks if the length of the current substring is greater than or equal to the length of the previous substring and if the length of the current substring plus 1 is greater than or equal to the length of the string minus the index of the current 'O' minus 1.
If both conditions are met, it checks if the current substring contains the substring "JI" by iterating over the substring and checking if each character is 'J' or 'I'. If it does, it stores the length of the current substring in variable ans.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 4.
