 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized with the input "redcoder". The length of the string is calculated and stored in variable len.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to len/2-1 to check each character in the string. The current character is compared with the character at the end of the string (len-1-i). If they are not equal, the variable res is incremented.
After the loop finishes, it returns the value of variable res, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
