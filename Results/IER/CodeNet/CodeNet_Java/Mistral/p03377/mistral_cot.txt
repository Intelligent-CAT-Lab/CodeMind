 <<<Analysis>>>
The program takes three integer inputs from the user using the Scanner class. The first input is assigned to variable a, the second input is assigned to variable b and the third input is assigned to variable x.
It then checks if the sum of variables a and b is greater than or equal to x and if a is less than or equal to x. If both conditions are met, it prints "YES" otherwise it prints "NO".
<<<Output>>>
NO
