 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable d, variable t and variable s are initialized with 1000, 15 and 80 respectively according to the input.
It enters a conditional statement and checks if the product of variable s and variable t is less than variable d.
Since (80 * 15) < 1000, the conditional statement evaluates to true and the program prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
