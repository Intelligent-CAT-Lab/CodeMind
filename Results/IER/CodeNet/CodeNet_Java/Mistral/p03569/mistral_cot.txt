 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized with the input string "xabxa". The length of the string is calculated and stored in variable length.
It enters a while loop and it iterates from the leftmost index of the string to the rightmost index of the string.
Inside the while loop, it extracts the characters at the leftmost and rightmost index of the string and stores them in variable cl and cr respectively.
Then it checks if the characters are equal. If they are, it increments the variable l and decrements the variable r.
If the characters are not equal, it checks if the character at the leftmost index is 'x'. If it is, it increments the variable cnt and increments the variable l.
If the character at the rightmost index is 'x', it increments the variable cnt and decrements the variable r.
If the characters are not equal, it sets the variable cnt to -1 and breaks out of the loop.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable cnt as output, which is 3.
