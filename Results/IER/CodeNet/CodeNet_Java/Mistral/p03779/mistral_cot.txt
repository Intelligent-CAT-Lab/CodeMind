 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable x is initialized with 6 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 100000 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of x <= i \* (i + 1) / 2.
If the condition is met, it assigns the value of i to variable ans and breaks out of the loop.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
