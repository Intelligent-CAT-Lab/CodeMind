 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with the input "hihi". The variable hi is initialized with true.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 3 to check each character of the string N.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character is 'h' or 'i' and if it is not, it sets the variable hi to false.
The condition is met when i is 0, 1 and 3.
After the loop finishes, it checks if the variable hi is true and the length of the string N is even. If both conditions are true, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".
In this case, the variable hi is false and the length of the string N is odd, so it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
