 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable string is initialized with the input "atcoderregularcontest".
It creates an array count of size 26 to store the count of each character in the string.
It converts the string to a character array and iterates through each character in the array.
For each character, it subtracts 97 from its ASCII value to get its index in the alphabet array. Then it increments the count of that index in the count array.
It then iterates through the count array and checks if any element is 0. If it is, it sets the variable isNOTfound to true and breaks out of the loop.
Since none of the elements in the count array are 0, the variable isNOTfound is not set to true.
Therefore, the output of the code is "None".
<<<Output>>>
None
