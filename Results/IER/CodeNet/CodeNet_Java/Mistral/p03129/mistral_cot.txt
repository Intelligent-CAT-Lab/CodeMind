 <<<Analysis>>>
The program takes two integers as input from the user using the Scanner class. The first integer is 3 and the second integer is 2.
It then performs the following calculation:
(3 + 1) / 2 = 2
Since 2 is not greater than or equal to 2, the program prints "NO" to the console.
<<<Output>>>
NO
