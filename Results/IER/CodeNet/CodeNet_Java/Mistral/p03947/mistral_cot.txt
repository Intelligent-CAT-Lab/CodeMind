 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable input is initialized with the input string "BBBWW".
It converts the input string to a character array using the `toCharArray()` method.
It initializes the current\_char variable with the first character of the input\_char array.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to the length of the input\_char array.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character is different from the previous character. If it is, it increments the count variable and updates the current\_char variable with the current character.
After the loop finishes, it prints the value of the count variable, which is 4.
<<<Output>>>
4
