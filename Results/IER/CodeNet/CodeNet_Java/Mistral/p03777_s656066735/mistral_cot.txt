 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable atCoDeerSpeak and topCoDeerSpeak are initialized with the first two elements of the input array "H H".
It enters an if-else statement to check if the value of atCoDeerSpeak is equal to topCoDeerSpeak. Since the value of atCoDeerSpeak and topCoDeerSpeak are both "H", the if condition is met and the program prints "H".
<<<Output>>>
H
