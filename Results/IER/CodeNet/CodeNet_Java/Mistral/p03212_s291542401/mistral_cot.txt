 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 575 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 575 to 0 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable digit.
Inside the for loop, it calls the method sevenfivethree(digit) and it returns a list of integers that satisfy the condition.
It then iterates through the list of integers returned by sevenfivethree(digit) and it checks if the current integer i is less than or equal to the current integer in the list. If it is, it increments the variable ans.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 1.
