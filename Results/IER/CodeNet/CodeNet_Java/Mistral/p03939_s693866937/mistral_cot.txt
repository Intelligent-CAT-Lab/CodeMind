 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n, variable d and variable x are initialized with 1, 3 and 3 respectively according to the input. And variable F and variable G are initialized with -1.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to 200000 to calculate the values of F and G.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of F[i] and G[i] using the formula provided in the code.
After the loop finishes, it calculates the final value by multiplying F[n] with x and adding d with G[n].
The final value is 1.00.
<<<Output>>>
