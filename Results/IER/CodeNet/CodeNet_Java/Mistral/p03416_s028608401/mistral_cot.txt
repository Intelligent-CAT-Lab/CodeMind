 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable x and y are initialized with 11009 and 11332 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 11009 to 11332 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable k.
Inside the for loop, it creates a char array arr from the integer i by converting it to a string and then converting it to a char array.
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the array divided by 2.
Inside the second for loop, it checks if the current character in the array is equal to the character at the end of the array. If it is, it increments the count variable.
After the second for loop finishes, it checks if the count variable is equal to the length of the array divided by 2. If it is, it increments the count2 variable.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable count2 as output, which is 11.
<<<Output>>>
11
