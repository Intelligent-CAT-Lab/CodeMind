 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable w is initialized with the input string "abaccaba".
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the string w.
Inside the for loop, it converts the current character of the string w to its ASCII value and subtracts 97 from it to get its index in the list.
Then it increments the value of the list at that index.
After the loop finishes, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 25.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the value of the list at that index is odd. If it is, it prints "No" and exits the program.
Since the list is [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] which is not odd at any index, it prints "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
