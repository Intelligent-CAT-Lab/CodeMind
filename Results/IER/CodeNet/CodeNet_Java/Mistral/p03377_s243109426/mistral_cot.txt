 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads the input from the standard input stream and stores it in a variable `A`. It then reads the input from the standard input stream and stores it in a variable `B`. It reads the input from the standard input stream and stores it in a variable `X`.
It then checks if `X` is less than `A` or greater than `A+B`. If it is, it prints "NO" to the standard output stream. Otherwise, it prints "YES" to the standard output stream.
<<<Output>>>
YES
