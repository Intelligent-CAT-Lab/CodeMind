 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with -9.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until N is 0.
Inside the while loop, it checks if N is greater than or equal to 0. If it is, it prints the value of N.
It also checks if N is less than 0. If it is, it prints the value of N.
After the while loop finishes, it prints the value of N.
<<<Output>>>
-9
