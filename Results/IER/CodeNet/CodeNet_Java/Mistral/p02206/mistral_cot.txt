 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and variable k are initialized with 1 and 1 respectively according to the input. And variable left is initialized with 1 and variable right is initialized with 2.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until the difference between left and right is greater than 1.
Inside the while loop, it calculates the middle value of left and right by dividing the sum of left and right by 2 and storing it in variable m.
Then it initializes variable x with the value of m and variable total with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates until n is reached, x is greater than 0 and total is less than or equal to k.
Inside the for loop, it adds the value of x to variable total and divides x by 2.
After the for loop finishes, it checks if the value of total is less than or equal to k. If it is, it updates the value of left to be equal to m. Otherwise, it updates the value of right to be equal to m.
After the while loop finishes, it prints the value of left, which is 1.
