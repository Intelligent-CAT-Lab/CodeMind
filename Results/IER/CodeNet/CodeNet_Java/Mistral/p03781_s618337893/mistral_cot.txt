 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable X is initialized with 6 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 5 to check each integer time in this range.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable pow by adding the current interger time to it.
Then it checks if the calculated variable pow is greater than or equal to 6. If it is, it prints the current value of variable time and exits the loop.
After the loop finishes, it doesn't print anything because none of the value of pow is greater than or equal to 6.
