 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integer inputs a and b from the user using the Scanner class. It then calculates the remainder of a and b when divided by 3 using the modulo operator (%). The remainder of a divided by 3 is stored in variable c, the remainder of b divided by 3 is stored in variable d, and the sum of a and b divided by 3 is stored in variable e.
It then checks if any of the variables c, d or e is equal to 0. If any of them are equal to 0, it prints "Possible". Otherwise, it prints "Impossible".
<<<Output>>>
Impossible
