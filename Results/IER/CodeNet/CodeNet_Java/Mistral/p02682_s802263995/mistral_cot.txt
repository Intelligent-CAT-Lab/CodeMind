 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable a, variable b, variable c and variable k are initialized with 2, 1, 1 and 3 respectively according to the input.
It enters an if-else statement to check if the value of variable a is greater than or equal to variable k.
If it is, it assigns the value of variable k to variable answer.
If it is not, it assigns the value of variable a to variable answer, then it subtracts the value of variable a from variable k and assigns the result to variable k.
Then it subtracts the value of variable k from variable answer.
After the if-else statement finishes, it print the fianl value of variable answer as output, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>
3
