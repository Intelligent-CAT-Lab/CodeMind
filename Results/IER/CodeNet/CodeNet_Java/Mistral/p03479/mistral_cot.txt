The variable ans is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from x to y to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of num by multiplying x with 2 and then adding y.
Then it prints the value of num.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 21.
