 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized with the input "akasaka". The length of the string is calculated and stored in variable n.
The string is then split into two halves, left and right, using the formula (n + 1) / 2 - 1. The left half is "akas" and the right half is "aka".
The function function(s) is called with the input "akasaka". The function first checks if the length of the string is even or odd. In this case, it is even.
The function then extracts the left and right halves of the string and reverses the right half using the reverse function. The reverse function takes a string as input and returns the reversed string.
The function then compares the left and right halves of the string using the equals method. Since the left and right halves are "akas" and "aka" respectively, the function returns true.
The function function(left) is also called with the input "akas". The function follows the same process as before and returns true.
The function function(right) is also called with the input "aka". The function follows the same process as before and returns true.
Since all three functions return true, the if statement is satisfied and the output is "Yes".
