 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable x and variable y are initialized with 1 and 3 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates through the three arrays grp1, grp2 and grp3 to check if the current integer in the array is equal to x or y.
It uses two boolean variables bx and by to keep track of whether the current integer is equal to x or y respectively.
After the loop finishes, it checks if both bx and by are true. If they are, it returns true, otherwise it returns false.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
