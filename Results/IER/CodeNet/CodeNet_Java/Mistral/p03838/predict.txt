The variable x and y are initialized with 10 and 20 respectively according to the input.
It enters a if-else statement and it checks if x is greater than or equal to 0.
If it is, it enters another if-else statement and it checks if y is also greater than or equal to 0.
If both conditions are true, it checks if x is greater than y. If it is, it prints the value of x minus y plus 1. If y is 0, it prints the value of x minus y plus 2.
If both conditions are false, it enters another if-else statement and it checks if y is equal to 0. If it is, it prints the absolute value of the absolute value of y minus x plus 1.
If both conditions are false, it enters another if-else statement and it checks if x is greater than y. If it is, it prints the value of x minus y plus 2. If y is greater than x, it prints the value of y minus x.
If both conditions are false, it enters another if-else statement and it checks if y is greater than or equal to 0.
If it is, it enters another if-else statement and it checks if x is greater than y. If it is, it prints the value of x minus y plus 2. If y is greater than x, it prints the value of y minus x.
