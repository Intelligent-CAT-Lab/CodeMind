 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable a and variable b are initialized with 4 and 12 respectively according to the input.
It enters a ternary operator which checks if the remainder of b divided by a is 0. If it is, it returns the sum of a and b. Otherwise, it returns the difference between b and a.
Since the remainder of 12 divided by 4 is 0, it returns the sum of 4 and 12, which is 16.
<<<Output>>>
16
