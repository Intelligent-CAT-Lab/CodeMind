 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable S is initialized with the input "010".
It enters the main method and calls the solve() method.
The solve() method first checks if the length of the string is 1, in which case it returns 1.
It then iterates through the string and finds the first pair of characters that are not the same. The mid variable is initialized to -1.
It then calls the moreMid() method to find the index of the mid variable.
The moreMid() method returns the index of the mid variable if it is not -1, otherwise it returns the mid() method.
The mid() method returns the length of the string divided by 2.
If the mid variable is not -1, it returns the length of the string minus the mid variable.
The solve() method returns the length of the string minus the mid variable.
