 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable c is initialized with the input string "BACD". The variable flg is initialized with false.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to c.length-1 to check each character in the string.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character c[i] is 'A' and c[i+1] is 'C'. If it is, it sets the variable flg to true and breaks out of the loop.
After the loop finishes, it print the value of variable flg as output, which is true.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
