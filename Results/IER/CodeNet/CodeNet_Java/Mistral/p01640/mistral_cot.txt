The variable w, variable h, and variable gx are initialized with 2, 2, and 0 respectively according to the input. And variable gy is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 3 to check each integer d in this range.
Inside the for loop, it calls the solve1() method and passes the current integer d as an argument.
It also calls the ok() method and passes the current integer d as an argument.
The ok() method checks if the current integer d is 0, 1, 2, or 3. If it is, it checks if the current integer d is equal to the current integer x and y. If it is, it returns true. Otherwise, it updates the current integer x and y and checks if the current integer d is equal to 0, 1, 2, or 3. If it is, it updates the current integer d.
It also calls the solve1() method and passes the current integer d as an argument.
It also calls the ok() method and passes the current integer d as an argument.
The ok() method checks if the current integer d is 0, 1, 2, or 3. If it is, it checks if the current integer d is equal to the current integer x and y. If it is, it returns true. Otherwise, it updates the current integer x and y and checks if the current integer d is equal to 0, 1, 2, or 3. If it is, it updates the current integer d.
