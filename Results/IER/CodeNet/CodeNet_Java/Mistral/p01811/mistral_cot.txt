 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input from the standard input stream and checks if it contains the substring "ABC". If it does, it replaces the substring with "X" and continues to process the string. If it doesn't, it prints "No" and exits.
The code then checks if the string contains any character that is not a letter between 'A' and 'Z'. If it does, it prints "No" and exits.
If the string contains only letters between 'A' and 'Z', it checks if it contains exactly two occurrences of each letter. If it does, it prints "Yes". If it doesn't, it prints "No".
If the string contains only one occurrence of each letter, it replaces each occurrence of "X" with the corresponding letter and prints the resulting string.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
