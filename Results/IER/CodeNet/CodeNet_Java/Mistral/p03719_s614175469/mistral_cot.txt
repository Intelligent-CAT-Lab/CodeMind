 <<<Analysis>>>
The program takes three integers as input from the user using the Scanner class. The first integer is assigned to variable a, the second integer is assigned to variable b and the third integer is assigned to variable c.
It then checks if the value of variable c is greater than or equal to the value of variable a and less than or equal to the value of variable b. If the condition is true, it prints "Yes" otherwise it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
