 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads an integer input from the user using the `Scanner` class and stores it in the variable `a`.
Then it calculates the value of the expression `a + a * a + a * a * a` and prints it to the console.
The expression is equivalent to `a^5` and the result is 32768.
<<<Output>>>
32768
