The variable r1 and r2 are initialized with 2 and 3 respectively.
It enters a method solve(1, in, out) which is called by the main method.
Inside the method solve, it calls the ans(1 / (1 / r1 + 1 / r2), 10).ln() method.
The ans(1 / (1 / r1 + 1 / r2), 10).ln() method calculates the equivalent resistance of the two resistors r1 and r2 in ohms.
It calculates the equivalent resistance by using the formula 1 / (1 / r1 + 1 / r2).
It then prints the result of the calculation in scientific notation with 10 decimal places.
The result of the calculation is 0.0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
