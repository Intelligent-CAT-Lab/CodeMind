 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N and X are initialized with 2 and 3 respectively according to the input. And variable dp is a 3D array of size 2 x 512 x (X+1) initialized with 1.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 2 to check each integer t in this range.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 512 to check each integer j in this range.
It enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to X to check each integer k in this range.
It calculates the sum of dp[1-t][j][k] and dp[1-t][j ^ k][k] and assigns it to variable sum.
Then it assigns the value of sum to dp[t][j ^ k][k].
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans by summing up dp[1-t][X][i] for i = 0 to X.
