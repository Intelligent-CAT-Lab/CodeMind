 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized with the input "atcoder". The variable sSplit is initialized with an empty array.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the input string s.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current index i is even. If it is, it adds the current character of the input string s at index i to the array sSplit.
After the loop finishes, it prints the array sSplit.
<<<Output>>>
