 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string input from the user and stores it in a char array s. The length of the string is stored in variable n.
It then checks if the first character of the string is equal to the last character of the string and also equal to the character 'x'. If it is, it prints 'x', otherwise it prints 'o'.
<<<Output>>>
x
