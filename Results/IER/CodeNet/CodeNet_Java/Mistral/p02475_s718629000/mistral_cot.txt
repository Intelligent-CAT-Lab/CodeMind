 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers A and B from the standard input using the Scanner class. The first integer is read using the `next()` method of the Scanner class and stored in the variable A. The second integer is read using the `next()` method of the Scanner class and stored in the variable B.
Then it uses the `divide()` method of the BigInteger class to divide A by B and returns the result.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code would be 0.625.
