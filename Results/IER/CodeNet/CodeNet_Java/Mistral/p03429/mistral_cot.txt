The variable N, variable M, variable A and variable B are initialized with 3, 4, 4 and 2 respectively according to the input. And variable ans is initialized with a 2D array of size N x M filled with '.'.
The program enters a series of if-else statements to check the parity of N and M.
If N and M are both even, it calls the method evenSolver(N, M, A, B, 0, 0) to solve the problem.
If N is even and M is odd, it calls the method evenSolver(N, M-1, A, B, 0, 1) to solve the problem.
If N is odd and M is even, it calls the method evenSolver(N-1, M, A, B, 1, 0) to solve the problem.
If N and M are both odd, it first checks if A and B are both 1. If they are, it calls the method evenSolver(N-1,M-1,A,B,0,0) to solve the problem. If not, it calls the method evenSolver(N-1,M-1,A,B,0,0) to solve the problem.
If N is odd and M is odd, it first checks if A and B are both 1. If they are, it calls the method evenSolver(N-1,M-1,A,B,0,0) to solve the problem. If not, it calls the method evenSolver(N-1,M-1,A,B,0,0) to solve the problem.
After the method call, it calls the method printSolve(t) to print the solution.
