The variable n, variable a and variable b are initialized with 63, 2 and 5 respectively according to the input. And variable sum is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 63 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger num by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum falls within the range [2, 5]. If it does, it adds the current interger i to variable answer. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14,21,22,23,24,25,31,32,33,34,35,36,41,42,43,44,45,51,52,53,54,55,61,62,63.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable answer as output, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
