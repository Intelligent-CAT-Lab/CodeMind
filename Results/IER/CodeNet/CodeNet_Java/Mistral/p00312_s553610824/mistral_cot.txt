 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable D and variable L are initialized with 10 and 5 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the value of variable jump\_time\_L by dividing variable D by variable L.
It then calculates the value of variable jump\_time by adding variable jump\_time\_L to variable D and subtracting variable L \* variable jump\_time\_L from variable D.
It prints the value of variable jump\_time as output.
