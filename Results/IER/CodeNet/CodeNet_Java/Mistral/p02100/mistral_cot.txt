 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable num is initialized with 0 and plus is initialized with true.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 2.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger i is equal to 1 or 2. If it is, it sets the value of variable num to i and sets the value of variable plus to true.
It then enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 5.
Inside the second for loop, it checks if the current interger j is equal to 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5. If it is, it calculates the value of variable result by multiplying the value of variable i with the power of j and the value of keis[j].
It then checks if the value of variable result is equal to 0. If it is, it sets the value of variable ji to j and sets the value of variable ans[ji] to -i.
It then calculates the value of variable result again by multiplying the value of variable i with the power of -j and the value of keis[j].
It then checks if the value of variable result is equal to 0. If it is, it sets the value of variable ji to j and sets the value of variable ans[ji] to i.
After the second for loop finishes, it sorts the values of ans in ascending order.
It then creates a StringBuilder object and it iterates through the values of ans. For each value, it appends the character "(x" and if the value is positive, it appends the character "+". It then appends the value and the character ")" to the StringBuilder object.
Finally, it prints the StringBuilder object as output.
<<<Output>>>
(x+2)(x+1)
