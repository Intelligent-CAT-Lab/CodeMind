The variable s is initialized with the input "AtCoder".
It converts the input string s to a character array using the toCharArray() method.
It initializes two variables countC and judge to 0 and true respectively.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the array - 1.
Inside the for loop, it checks the current index i.
If i is 0, it checks if the first character is 'A'. If it is, it sets judge to true.
If 2 <= i && i <= array.length - 2, it checks if the current character is 'C'. If it is, it increments countC. Otherwise, it checks if the current character is lowercase using Character.isLowerCase().
If i is outside the range [2, array.length - 2], it checks if the current character is lowercase using Character.isLowerCase().
After the loop finishes, it checks if judge is true and countC is equal to 1. If both conditions are met, it sets the result variable to "AC". Otherwise, it sets the result variable to "WA".
Finally, it prints the value of the result variable.

WA
