 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and variable b are initialized with 11 and 2 respectively.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to n to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the logarithm of n with base b and rounds it up to the nearest integer using the Math.ceil() method.
Then it prints the value of variable ans as output.
