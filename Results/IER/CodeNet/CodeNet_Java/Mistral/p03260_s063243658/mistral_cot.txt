 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, A and B. It checks if either of the two integers is even by using the modulo operator (%). If either of the two integers is even, it prints "No". Otherwise, it prints "Yes".
In this case, A is 3 and B is 1, so neither of them is even. Therefore, the code will print "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
