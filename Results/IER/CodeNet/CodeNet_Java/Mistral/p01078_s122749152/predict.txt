The variable N and K are initialized with 5 and 2 respectively according to the input. And variable radDiff is calculated as PI * 2 / N = 0.06283185307179586.
It creates two points p1f and p1t, where p1f is (1, 0) and p1t is (0.7071067811865475, 0.7071067811865475).
It also creates two points p2f and p2t, where p2f is (0.7071067811865475, 0.7071067811865475) and p2t is (0.7071067811865475, -0.7071067811865475).
It calls the getIntersectPoint method to find the intersection point of the two lines. The method returns null because the two lines do not intersect.
It calculates the area of the triangle formed by the intersection point, p1f, p1t and p2f as (0.0, 0.0) and the area of the triangle formed by the intersection point, p1f, p1t and p2t as (0.0, 0.0).
It calculates the area of the triangle formed by the intersection point, p1f, p2f and p2t as (0.0, 0.0) and the area of the triangle formed by the intersection point, p1t, p2f and p2t as (0.0, 0.0).
It calculates the area of the triangle formed by the intersection point, p1f, p1t and p2t as (0.0, 0.0) and the area of the triangle formed by the intersection point, p1f, p2f and p2t as (0.0, 0.0).
