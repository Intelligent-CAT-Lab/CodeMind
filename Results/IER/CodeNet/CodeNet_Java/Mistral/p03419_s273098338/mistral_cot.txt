 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the Scanner class from the java.util package.
It then creates a new Scanner object named stdIn and uses it to read input from the user.
It reads two integers n and m from the user and stores them in the variables n and m respectively.
It then uses a series of if-else statements to check the values of n and m.
If n is equal to 1 and m is also equal to 1, it prints 1.
If n is equal to 1 and m is not equal to 1, it prints m-2.
If m is equal to 1 and n is not equal to 1, it prints n-2.
If neither of the above conditions are met, it calculates the product of (m-2) and (n-2) and prints it.
