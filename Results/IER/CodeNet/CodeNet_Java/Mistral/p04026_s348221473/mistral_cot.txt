 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized with the input string.
It first checks if the length of the string is 1, in which case it prints -1 -1 and returns.
If the length of the string is 2, it checks if the first two characters are equal. If they are, it prints 1 2 and returns. If they are not, it prints -1 -1 and returns.
If the length of the string is greater than 2, it enters a for loop that iterates from 1 to the second last index of the string.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character is equal to the previous character, the next character or the character next to the previous character. If it is, it prints the current index and the next index and returns.
If none of the conditions are met, it prints -1 -1 and returns.
<<<Output>>>
-1 -1
