 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first reads two integers a and b from the user using the Scanner class.
Then it checks the first condition if a is equal to 1 and b is not equal to 1, it prints "Alice".
Then it checks the second condition if b is equal to 1 and a is not equal to 1, it prints "Bob".
Then it checks the third condition if a is greater than b and both a and b are not equal to 1, it prints "Alice".
Then it checks the fourth condition if a is less than b and both a and b are not equal to 1, it prints "Bob".
Then it checks the fifth condition if a is equal to b, it prints "Draw".

For the given input `8 6`, the first condition is not met, the second condition is not met, the third condition is not met, the fourth condition is not met, the fifth condition is met, so the output will be "Draw".
