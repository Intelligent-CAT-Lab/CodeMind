The variable i, j, k, l,m are initialized with 0 according to the code.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the input string.
Inside the for loop, it initializes an array cnt with 0.
It enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the input string.
Inside the inner for loop, it checks if the current character of the input string is equal to the current character of the input string. If it is, it increments the corresponding element of the cnt array.
After the inner for loop finishes, it finds the maximum value in the cnt array and the corresponding character. It assigns it to variable max and variable str1.
It enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the input string.
Inside the inner for loop, it checks if the current character of the input string is longer than the current longest character. If it is, it assigns it to variable longest and variable str2.
After the inner for loop finishes, it prints the value of variable str1 and variable str2.
