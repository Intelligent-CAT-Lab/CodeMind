 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable A, variable B, variable H and variable M are initialized with 3, 4, 9 and 0 respectively according to the input.
It enters a StringTokenizer class to split the input string into tokens.
It then uses the nextToken() method to extract the values of A, B, H and M from the tokens.
It calculates the value of variable mins by multiplying H and M and then multiplying it by 60.
It calculates the value of variable M\_angle by multiplying M with 6.
It calculates the value of variable H\_angle by multiplying mins with 0.5.
It calculates the values of x1 and y1 by multiplying A with cos(H\_angle) and sin(H\_angle) respectively.
It calculates the values of x2 and y2 by multiplying B with cos(M\_angle) and sin(M\_angle) respectively.
It calculates the distance between the two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) using the distance formula.
It prints the value of the distance.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is 10.0.
