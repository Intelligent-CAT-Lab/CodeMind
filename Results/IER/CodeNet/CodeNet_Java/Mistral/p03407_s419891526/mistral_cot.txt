 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integer inputs a, b and c from the user. In this case, the values of a, b and c are 50, 100 and 120 respectively.
It then checks if the sum of a and b is greater than or equal to c. In this case, 50 + 100 = 150, which is greater than 120.
Therefore, the variable cnt is assigned the value "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
