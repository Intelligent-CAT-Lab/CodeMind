 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable l and k are initialized with 5 and 3 respectively according to the input.
It creates a 2x(l+1) matrix dp and initializes the first row with 1.
It then enters a for loop and iterates from 1 to l+1 to calculate the values of dp[0][i] and dp[1][i].
It calculates the value of dp[0][i] by adding the value of dp[1][i-1] to it.
It calculates the value of dp[1][i] by adding the value of dp[0][i-1] to it.
If i is greater than or equal to k, it adds the value of dp[0][i-k] to it.
After the loop finishes, it calculates the sum of all values in dp[1] and stores it in variable ans.
Finally, it prints the value of variable ans as output.
