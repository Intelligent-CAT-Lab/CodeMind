 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable rawInputs is initialized with the input "1 2 +".
It enters a for loop and it iterates through the rawInputs array.
Inside the for loop, it uses a switch statement to check the current input.
When the input is "+", it pops the top two elements from the stack, which are 2 and 1 respectively. It then adds them together and pushes the result (3) onto the stack.
When the input is "-", it pops the top two elements from the stack, which are 2 and 1 respectively. It then subtracts them and pushes the result (1) onto the stack.
When the input is "*", it pops the top two elements from the stack, which are 2 and 1 respectively. It then multiplies them and pushes the result (2) onto the stack.
When the input is not one of the three operators "+", "-", "*", it simply pushes the input onto the stack.
After the loop finishes, it pops the top element from the stack, which is 3, and prints it as the output.
