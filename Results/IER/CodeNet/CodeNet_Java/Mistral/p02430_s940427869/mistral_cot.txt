 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and variable k are initialized with 5 and 3 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 31 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable temp.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the binary representation of the current interger temp by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable count.
Then it checks if the calculated variable count falls within the range [3, 3]. If it does, it prints the current integer i and the index of the 1's in the binary representation of i.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable count as output, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>
3
