 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 1 according to the input. And variable res is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable now.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger now by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum is equal to 1. If it is, it adds the current interger i to variable res.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable res as output, which is 1.
<<<Output>>>
1
