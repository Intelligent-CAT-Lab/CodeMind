The variable a and variable b are initialized with 11009 and 11332 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 11009 to 11332 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it converts the current integer i to a string and stores it in variable _i.
Then it checks if the first character of the string is equal to the fifth character of the string and the second character of the string is equal to the third character of the string.
If it is true, it increments the count variable.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable count as output, which is 1.
