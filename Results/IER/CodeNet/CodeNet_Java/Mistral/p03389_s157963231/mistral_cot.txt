 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first reads the input from the user using the `FastScanner` class. It then calls the `solve()` method of the `Main` class, passing the input as an array of integers.
The `solve()` method first initializes an array `a` with the three integers from the input. It then sorts the array in ascending order.
The method then checks if the three integers are all equal. If they are, it returns 0. Otherwise, it increments a variable `r` and checks if any of the integers are equal. If they are, it increments the corresponding integer in the array and checks again. If none of the integers are equal, it increments the first integer in the array and checks again.
The method then sorts the array again and returns the value of `r` plus half of the sum of the squares of the three integers.
