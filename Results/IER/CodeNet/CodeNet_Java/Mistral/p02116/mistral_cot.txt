The variable res, variable han, variable ni_beki and variable ruijyo are initialized with 0, 0, 1 and 0 respectively.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable han.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the remainder of the division of the current interger res by the current interger han. If the remainder is 0, it means that the current interger han is a power of 2 and it updates the value of variable res by adding 1 to the current value of variable res and sets the value of variable i to 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable res as output, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
