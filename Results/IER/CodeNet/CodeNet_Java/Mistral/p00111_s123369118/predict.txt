The return value of the code for the input `?D-C'KOPUA` would be:
```
?
D
-
C
'
K
O
P
U
A
```
This is because the input string contains the characters `?`, `D`, `-`, `C`, `'`, `K`, `O`, `P`, `U`, and `A`, and the corresponding ASCII values for these characters are found in dec2. The output string is then printed to the console.
