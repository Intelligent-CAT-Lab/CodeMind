 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first creates two maps, dec1 and dec2, which contain the decimal values of the digits in the alphabet and the corresponding ASCII values of the digits.
It then reads a line of input from the user and iterates through each character in the line. For each character, it checks if it exists in dec1 and if it does, it adds the corresponding value from dec2 to the output string.
It continues this process until it reaches the end of the line, at which point it prints the output string.

<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code for the input `?D-C'KOPUA` would be:
```
?
D
-
C
'
K
O
P
U
A
```
This is because the input string contains the characters `?`, `D`, `-`, `C`, `'`, `K`, `O`, `P`, `U`, and `A`, and the corresponding ASCII values for these characters are found in dec2. The output string is then printed to the console.
