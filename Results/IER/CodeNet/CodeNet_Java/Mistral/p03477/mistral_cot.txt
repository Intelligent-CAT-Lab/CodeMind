 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four integer inputs from the user, which are stored in the variables left, right, first and second.
It then compares the value of left and right, if left is greater than right it prints "Left", if left is equal to right it prints "Balanced" and if left is less than right it prints "Right".
<<<Output>>>
Balanced
