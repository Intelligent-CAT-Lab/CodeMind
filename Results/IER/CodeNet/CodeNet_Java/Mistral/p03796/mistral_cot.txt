 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable cnt is initialized with 3 according to the input. And variable power is initialized with 1.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 3 to calculate the value of power.
Inside the for loop, it multiplies the current value of power by i and then calculates the remainder of the result divided by 10^9 + 7.
Then it prints the final value of variable power as output.
<<<Output>>>
