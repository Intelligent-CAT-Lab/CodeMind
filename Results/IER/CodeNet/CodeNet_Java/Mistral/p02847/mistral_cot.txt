 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable days[] is initialized with the days of the week.
The variable in is initialized with the input "SAT".
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 6 to check each day of the week.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current day of the week is equal to the input "SAT". If it is, it assigns 6 to the variable idx and breaks out of the loop.
After the loop finishes, it calculates the answer by taking the remainder of ((6-idx+7)%7) and assigns it to the variable ans.
Since ans is 6, it prints 7 as output.
<<<Output>>>
7
