 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 2 according to the input.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until the value of variable cn is equal to 2*n.
Inside the while loop, it checks if the current integer x is a small prime number using the isSNT() method. If it is, it adds it to the array snt[] and increments the value of cn.
The condition is met when x is 2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31,37,41,43,47,53,59,61,67,71,73,79,83,89,97.
After the loop finishes, it creates a 2D array a[][] of size n x n and initializes it with the values of snt[] using nested loops.
Then it creates two arrays dx[] and dy[] of size n x 4 and initializes them with the values -1, 0, 1, 0 and 0, 1, 0, -1 respectively.
It enters another while loop and it iterates from 0 to n-1. Inside this loop, it iterates from 1 to n-1.
For each pair of (i, j), it calculates the value of a[i][j] by multiplying the values of snt[(i+j)/2] and snt[(j-i+n-1)/2+n] and adding 1.
After the loop finishes, it prints the values of the 2D array a[][] using nested loops.

[[1, 1], [1, 1]]
