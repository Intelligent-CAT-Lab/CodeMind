The variable a, variable b and variable x are initialized with 4, 8 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It enters a variable count and initializes it with 0.
It calculates the value of count by subtracting the value of b divided by x from the value of a divided by x.
Then it checks if the remainder of a divided by x is 0. If it is, it increments the value of count by 1.
After the calculation, it prints the value of count as output.
