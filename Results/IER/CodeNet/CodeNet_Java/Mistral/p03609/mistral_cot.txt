 <<<Analysis>>>
The program takes two integer inputs, x and t, from the user using the Scanner class.
It then checks if x is greater than t. If it is, it subtracts t from x and prints the result. If x is not greater than t, it prints 0.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code based on the input `100 17` would be 83.
