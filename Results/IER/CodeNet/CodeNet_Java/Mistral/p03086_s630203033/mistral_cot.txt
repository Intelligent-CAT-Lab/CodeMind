 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable S is initialized with "ATCODER" according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 6 to check each character of the string S.
Inside the for loop, it uses a switch statement to check the current character of the string S.
If the current character is 'A', 'T', 'C' or 'G', it adds the character to the list.
If the current character is not one of the above characters, it checks if the list is empty. If it is not empty, it adds the size of the list to the result list.
After the loop finishes, it checks if the result list is empty. If it is empty, it prints 0. Otherwise, it prints the maximum element of the result list.
