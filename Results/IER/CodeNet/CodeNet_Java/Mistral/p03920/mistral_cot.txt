 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 4 according to the input.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until N becomes 0.
Inside the while loop, it initializes variable sum with 0 and it enters a for loop.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger i by repeatedlylly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum is greater than or equal to N. If it is, it prints the current value of i and subtracts i from N. The loop continues until N becomes 0.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable N as output, which is 0.
<<<Output>>>
0
