 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable a and variable b are initialized with 2 and 16 respectively according to the input. And variable k is initialized with the sum of a and b.
It checks if k is even by using the modulo operator (%). If k is even, it divides k by 2 and prints the result. If k is odd, it prints "IMPOSSIBLE".
In this case, k is 18 which is even, so it divides 18 by 2 and prints the result which is 9.
<<<Output>>>
9
