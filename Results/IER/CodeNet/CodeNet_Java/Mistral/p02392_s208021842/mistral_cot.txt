 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable abc is initialized with 1, 3 and 8 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer abc[i] in this range.
Then it checks if the current integer abc[i] is less than the next integer abc[i+1] and the next integer abc[i+1] is less than the next integer abc[i+2].
If all three conditions are met, it prints "Yes" otherwise it prints "No".
In this case, the first condition is met, the second condition is met and the third condition is not met. So it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
