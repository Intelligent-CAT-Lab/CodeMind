 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable m, variable f and variable b are initialized with 1000, 3000 and 3000 respectively according to the input.
It enters an if-else-if statement to check the value of variable b.
If b is greater than m + f, it prints "NA".
If b is greater than m, it subtracts m from b and prints the result.
If b is less than or equal to m, it prints 0.
Since b is 3000 which is greater than m + f (1000 + 3000 = 4000) and also greater than m (1000), it prints 3000 - 1000 = 2000.
<<<Output>>>
2000
