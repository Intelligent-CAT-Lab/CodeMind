 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized with 3, 5 and 7 respectively according to the input. And variable amount is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to 10 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable time.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the amount by adding the value of variable b to the current value of variable amount.
Then it calculates the time by multiplying the value of variable a with the current value of variable i.
The condition is met when i is 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable amount as output, which is 45.
<<<Output>>>
45
