The variable S is initialized with the input string "redcoder". The length of the string is calculated and stored in variable length. The variable c and variable d are initialized with space character.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to length/2-1 to check each pair of characters in the string. The current character c is assigned with the character at index i and the current character d is assigned with the character at index length-i-1.
Then it checks if the current character c is not equal to the current character d. If it is not, it increments the variable cnt.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable cnt as output, which is 2.
