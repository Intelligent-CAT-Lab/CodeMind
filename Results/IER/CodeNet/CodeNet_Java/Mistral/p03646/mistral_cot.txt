The variable K is initialized with 0 according to the input. And variable N is initialized with 50.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 49 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable num by dividing K by N and adding i.
Then it prints the value of variable num.
After the loop finishes, it prints the value of variable num.
