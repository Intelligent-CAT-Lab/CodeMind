 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the java.util.Scanner class to read input from the user.
Then it creates a new Scanner object named sc and reads two integers a and b from the user using the nextInt() method.
It then checks if the value of a and b are both less than or equal to 8 using the if statement.
If the condition is true, it prints "Yay!" to the console.
Otherwise, it prints ":(" to the console.
<<<Output>>>
Yay!
