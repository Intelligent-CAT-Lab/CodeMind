The variable h, variable w, variable a and variable b are initialized with 2, 3, 1 and 1 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to h-a.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of c(b-1+i,i) and c(w-b-1+h-i-1,w-b-1) using the binomial calculator class and adds it to the answer variable.
Then it checks if the calculated value of answer is greater than or equal to a and less than or equal to b. If it is, it adds the current interger i to variable answer. The condition is met when i is 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable answer as output, which is 1.
