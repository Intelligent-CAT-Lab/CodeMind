 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers A and B from the user using the Scanner class. The first integer A is read using the `nextInt()` method of the Scanner class. The second integer B is also read using the `nextInt()` method of the Scanner class.
Then it multiplies the two integers A and B and stores the result in the variable `A*B`.
Finally, it prints the value of the variable `A*B` using the `println()` method of the System.out class.
