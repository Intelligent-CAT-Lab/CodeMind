 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable str is initialized with the input "575".
It uses the Scanner class to read the input from the console.
It then uses the nextLine() method to read the input as a string.
It uses the parseInt() method to convert the string to an integer and store it in variable num1.
It uses the charAt() method to extract the characters from the string and convert them to integers. It stores the first character in variable a, the second character in variable b and the third character in variable c.
It then calculates the value of variable num2 by multiplying variable c by 100, variable b by 10 and adding variable a.
It then compares the value of variable num1 with variable num2.
Since num1 is equal to num2, the program prints "Yes" to the console.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
