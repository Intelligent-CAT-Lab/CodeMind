 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable H, variable W, variable h and variable w are initialized with 3, 3, 2 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable h.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable w.
It initializes the 2D array a with 1_000_000_000 - 1 for all elements.
Then it checks if the current element of array a is within the range [0, 1]. If it is, it sets the value of the current element of array a to -1_000_000_000.
After the loops finishes, it print the 2D array a.
<<<Output>>>
[[-1, -1, -1, -1], [-1, -1, -1, -1], [-1, -1, -1, -1]]
