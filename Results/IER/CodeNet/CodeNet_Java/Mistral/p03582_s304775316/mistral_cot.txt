The variable x, variable y and variable z are initialized with 2, 2 and 0 respectively according to the input. And variable n is calculated as x + y + z = 6.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 6 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the number of occurrences of each character in the string ans by repeatedlylly extracting the characters of number with a while loop and adding it to variable count.
Then it checks if the calculated variable count falls within the range [2, 2]. If it does, it adds the current interger i to variable answer. The condition is met when i is 1, 2 and 6.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable answer as output, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>
