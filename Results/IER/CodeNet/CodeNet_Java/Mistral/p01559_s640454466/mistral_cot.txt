The code first reads the input from the standard input stream using the `Scanner` class. It then reads two integers `N` and `M` from the input.
Then it reads `M` integers `x` and `y` from the input.
It then iterates through all pairs of `x` and `y` and checks if `x` is greater than or equal to `y`. If it is, it swaps the values of `x` and `y`.
It then calls the `solve` method with the input values of `N`, `M`, `x`, and `y`.
The `solve` method first creates a `HashSet` of obstacles. It then iterates through all pairs of `x` and `y` and checks if `x` is greater than or equal to `y`. If it is, it swaps the values of `x` and `y`.
It then calls the `solve` method with the input values of `N`, `M`, `x`, and `y`.
