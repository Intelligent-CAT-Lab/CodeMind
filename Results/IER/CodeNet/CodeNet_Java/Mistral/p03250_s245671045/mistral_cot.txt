 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable a is initialized with 3 integers, 1, 5 and 2 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to assign the values of the input integers to the corresponding index of the array a.
After the loop finishes, it calls the Arrays.sort() method to sort the array in ascending order.
Then it calculates the final value by multiplying the last element of the array (a[2]) by 10, adding the second element (a[1]) and the first element (a[0]) and prints it as output.
