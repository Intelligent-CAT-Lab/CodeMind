The variable yoko, variable tate and variable moji are initialized with 3, 3 and B respectively according to the input. And variable hata is initialized with an array of size 3.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable yoko.
Inside the for loop, it checks if i is 0 or yoko-1. If it is, it adds "+" to the first and last element of the array hata. If it is not, it adds "-" to the first and last element of the array hata.
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from 1 to tate-1 to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable tate.
Inside the second for loop, it checks if j is not equal to (tate-1)/2. If it is not, it adds "." to the jth element of the array hata. If it is, it checks if i is (yoko-1)/2. If it is, it adds the value of variable moji to the jth element of the array hata. If it is not, it adds "." to the jth element of the array hata.
Then it prints the jth element of the array hata.
After the loops finish, it prints the following output:
```
B

```
