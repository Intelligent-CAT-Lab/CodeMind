 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable x is initialized with 6 according to the input.
It enters a while loop and it iterates indefinitely.
Inside the while loop, it calculates the value of variable d by multiplying count by (count + 1) and dividing it by 2.
Then it checks if the calculated variable d is greater than or equal to x. If it is, it prints the value of variable count and returns from the function.
After the loop finishes, it increments the value of variable count and continues the loop.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is not defined because the loop will run indefinitely and the function will not return.
