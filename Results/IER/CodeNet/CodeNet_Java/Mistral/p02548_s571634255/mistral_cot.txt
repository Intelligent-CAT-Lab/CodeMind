 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 3 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 3 to check each integer A in this range.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the count of integers between 1 and N-1 divided by A. The count is incremented by the value of (N-1)/A for each iteration of the loop.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable count as output, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
