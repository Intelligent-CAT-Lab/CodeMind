 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable X is initialized with 33 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 999 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it creates a 5^j table by multiplying i with j for j = 0 to 4.
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 999 to check each integer j in this range.
Inside the second for loop, it calculates the work by subtracting fiveExp[j] from X and also by adding fiveExp[j] to X.
It then checks if the calculated variable work is equal to fiveExp[i]. If it is, it assigns the value of i to variable A and j to variable B and breaks out of the loop.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl values of variable A and B as output, which are 1 and -1000.
<<<Output>>>
1 -1000
