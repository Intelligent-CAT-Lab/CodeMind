 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer array `a` as input and an integer `k` as input. It then uses the `Scanner` class to read the value of `k` from the user.
It then uses the `k-1` index to access the element at that index in the array `a` and prints it to the console.
So, when `k` is equal to `6`, the element at index `k-1` in the array `a` is `15`, which is printed to the console.
<<<Output>>>
15
