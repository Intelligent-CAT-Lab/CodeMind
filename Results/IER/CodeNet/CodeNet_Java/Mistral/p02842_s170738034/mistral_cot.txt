The variable n is initialized with 432.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to n to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger num by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum is greater than or equal to 100. If it is, it adds the current interger i to variable answer. The condition is met when i is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable answer as output, which is 32.
<<<Output>>>
32
