 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable S is initialized with 1905 according to the input.
It first calculates the value of variable yy by dividing S by 100, which gives 19.
Then it calculates the value of variable mm by taking the remainder of S divided by 100, which gives 5.

It then checks the value of variable yy and variable mm using if-else statements.
Since 19 is between 1 and 12, it checks the value of variable mm. Since mm is also between 1 and 12, it prints "MMYY" as the output.

<<<Output>>>
MMYY
