The variable P, variable Q and variable R are initialized with 1, 3 and 4 respectively according to the input.
It enters a series of if-else statements to check the maximum value of the three variables.
The first if statement checks if P is greater than or equal to Q. If it is, it checks if P is also greater than or equal to R. If it is, it assigns the value of Q + R to variable max. If it is not, it assigns the value of P + Q to variable max.
The second if statement checks if Q is greater than or equal to R. If it is, it checks if Q is also greater than or equal to P. If it is, it assigns the value of P + R to variable max. If it is not, it assigns the value of Q + R to variable max.
The third if statement checks if R is greater than or equal to P. If it is, it checks if R is also greater than or equal to Q. If it is, it assigns the value of P + Q to variable max. If it is not, it assigns the value of P + R to variable max.
After the if-else statements finish, it print the fianl value of variable max as output, which is 10.
