 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three input strings A, B and C from the user. It checks if the last character of string A is equal to the first character of string B and if the last character of string B is equal to the first character of string C. If both conditions are true, it prints "YES" otherwise it prints "NO".
<<<Output>>>
NO
