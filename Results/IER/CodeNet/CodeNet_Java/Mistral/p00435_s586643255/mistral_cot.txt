 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable alpha is initialized with the alphabet characters in order.
It reads the input string "MRL" and converts it to a character array using the `toCharArray()` method.
It then enters a nested for loop to iterate through each character in the input string and compare it with each character in the alphabet array.
If the input character matches the alphabet character, it replaces the input character with the corresponding alphabet character using the formula `alpha[j<3?(26-(3-j)):(j-3)%26]`.
The formula is used to map the alphabet characters to their corresponding positions in the alphabet array.
For example, if the input character is 'M', it will be mapped to the position 13 in the alphabet array, and the formula will return the character 'N'.
After the nested for loop finishes, it converts the modified character array back to a string using the `toString()` method and stores it in the variable ans.
Finally, it prints the value of variable ans, which is "NRL".
<<<Output>>>
