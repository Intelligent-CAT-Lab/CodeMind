The variable nums is a 4x3 matrix that stores the numbers to be arranged. The variable used is a boolean array of size 10 that keeps track of the used numbers. The variable pos is a 2D array that contains the positions of the numbers to be arranged.
The code reads the input from the user and stores it in the variables nums and used. It then calls the solve method with the starting index 0.
The solve method takes an index as input and recursively tries to arrange the numbers at that index and its adjacent indices. It first checks if the current index is the last index in the pos array. If it is, it checks if the arrangement is valid by calling the check method. If it is, it returns 1. Otherwise, it returns 0.
If the current index is not the last index, it tries all possible numbers from 1 to 9 that are not already used. For each number, it sets the current index to that number and calls the solve method recursively with the next index. After trying all possible numbers, it sets the current index back to -1 and the used number back to false and continues with the next index.
The check method takes an array of 4 integers as input and returns true if the sum of the integers is equal to the product of the integers.
For the given input `7 6 -1 1 -1 9 2 3 4`, the variable nums will be filled with the following values:
```
nums[0][0] = 7
nums[0][1] = 6
nums[0][2] = -1
nums[1][0] = 1
nums[1][1] = -1
