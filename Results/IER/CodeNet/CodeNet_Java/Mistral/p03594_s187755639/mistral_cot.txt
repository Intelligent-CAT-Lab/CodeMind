 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n, variable m and variable d are initialized with 2, 2 and 1 respectively according to the input.
The variable colors is initialized with "RYGB".
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 1 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 1 to check each integer j in this range.
It calculates the value of k and l using the formula (i + j) % (2 \* d) and (i - j) % (2 \* d) respectively.
Then it calculates the value of col using the formula (k / d) \* 2 + (l / d).
It uses the value of col to get the corresponding color from the string "RYGB" and print it.
After the loop finishes, it print a newline character.
After the inner loop finishes, it print another newline character.
After the outer loop finishes, it print another newline character.
