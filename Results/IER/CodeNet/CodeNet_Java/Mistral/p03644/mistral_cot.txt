The variable pnum is initialized with 7 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the power of 2 less than or equal to pnum. The value of variable i is also passed to variable result.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of 2 raised to the power of i and assigns it to variable result.
Then it returns the value of variable result.
After the loop finishes, it returns the value of variable result, which is 16.
