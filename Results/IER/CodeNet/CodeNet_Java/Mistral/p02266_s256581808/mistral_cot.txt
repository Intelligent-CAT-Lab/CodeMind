 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input from the user. It then initializes two stacks, stack1 and stack2.
It iterates through the characters in the string and performs the following actions:
- If the character is '\\', it pushes the index of the character to stack1.
- If the character is '/' and stack1 is not empty, it pops the index of the last '\\' from stack1 and calculates the area between the two characters. It adds this area to the sum and pushes the index of the last '\\' and the area to stack2.

After the loop finishes, it pops all elements from stack2 and adds them to a list ans in the order they were pushed.
Finally, it prints the sum and the size of the list ans.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code based on the input `\\//` would be:
- The sum would be 0, since there is no area between the two characters.
- The size of the list ans would be 0, since there are no elements to pop from stack2.
Therefore, the return value of the code based on the input `\\//` would be:
```
0
0
```
