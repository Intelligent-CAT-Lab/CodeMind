 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integer inputs from the user using the Scanner class. The first input is stored in variable x, the second input is stored in variable a and the third input is stored in variable b.
It then uses the Math.abs() method to calculate the absolute value of the difference between x and a, and the absolute value of the difference between x and b.
It then compares the two absolute values using the ternary operator. If the absolute value of the difference between x and a is greater than the absolute value of the difference between x and b, it prints 'B', otherwise it prints 'A'.
In this case, the absolute value of the difference between x and a is 5, and the absolute value of the difference between x and b is 5. Since they are equal, the ternary operator returns 'A'.
<<<Output>>>
A
