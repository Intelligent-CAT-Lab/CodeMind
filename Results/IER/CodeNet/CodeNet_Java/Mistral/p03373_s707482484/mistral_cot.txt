 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable a, variable b, variable c, variable x and variable y are initialized with 1500, 2000, 1600, 3 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 100000 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable tmpPrice.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of tmpPrice by multiplying variable c with 2, adding variable a multiplied by the maximum of 0 and x-i, and adding variable b multiplied by the maximum of 0 and y-i.
Then it compares the value of tmpPrice with the current value of price. If tmpPrice is less than price, it updates the value of price with tmpPrice.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable price as output, which is 100000.
<<<Output>>>
100000
