 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable e[] is initialized with 5 integers. The for loop iterates from 1 to 4 and reads each integer from the user using the Scanner class.
It then checks if all the integers are equal to each other. If they are, it prints "yes" otherwise it prints "no".
The condition is met when all the integers are equal to each other, which is not the case for the input `1 1 3 4`.
<<<Output>>>
no
