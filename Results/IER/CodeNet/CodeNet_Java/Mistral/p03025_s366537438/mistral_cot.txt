The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized with 1, 25 and 25 respectively according to the input. And variable C is initialized with 50.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to N to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable ret by adding the value of variable ret with the result of the following expression:
(A + B + C) * modpow(A + B, MOD - 2) % MOD * modpow(Awin, N) % MOD * modpow(Bwin, i) % MOD * (N + i) % MOD
It then prints the value of variable ret as output.
