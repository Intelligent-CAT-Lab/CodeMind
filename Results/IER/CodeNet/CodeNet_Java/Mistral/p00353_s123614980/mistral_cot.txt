 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable k1 is initialized with 3 integers, 1000, 3000 and 3000.
It enters a while loop and it reads the input line by line.
Inside the while loop, it tokenizes the input string using StringTokenizer and stores the integers in the k1 array.
Then it calculates the difference between the second and first element of the array k1, which is 2000.
It checks if the second element of the array k1 is greater than or equal to the calculated difference.
Since 3000 is greater than 2000, it prints the value of the difference, which is 2000.
<<<Output>>>
2000
