 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized with the input string "abaababaab".
It enters a for loop and it iterates from the last character of the string to the second character of the string.
Inside the for loop, it extracts the substring of the string from the first character to the current index i.
Then it extracts the substring of the string from the index i/2 to the last character of the string.
It then checks if the two substrings are equal and the length of the first substring is not equal to the length of the string.
If it finds a match, it assigns the current string to variable answer and breaks out of the loop.
After the loop finishes, it prints the length of the final string stored in variable answer.
