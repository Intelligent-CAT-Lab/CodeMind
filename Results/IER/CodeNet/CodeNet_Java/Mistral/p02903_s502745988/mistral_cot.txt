 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable h, variable w, variable a and variable b are initialized with 3, 3, 1 and 1 respectively according to the input.
It enters two for loops. The first for loop iterates from 0 to 1 and the second for loop iterates from 0 to 1.
Inside the first for loop, it creates a StringBuilder object and it appends 0 for a number of times equal to the value of variable b.
Inside the second for loop, it creates a StringBuilder object and it appends 1 for a number of times equal to the value of variable (w-a).
Then it appends a newline character to the StringBuilder object.
After the first for loop finishes, it enters the second for loop and it repeats the same process.
After both for loops finish, it prints the StringBuilder object as output.
