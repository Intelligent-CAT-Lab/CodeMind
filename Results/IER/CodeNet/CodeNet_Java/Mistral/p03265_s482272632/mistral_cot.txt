 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four integer inputs from the user, x1, y1, x2 and y2. It then calculates the difference between x2 and x1, and y2 and y1, and assigns the values to variables diffX and diffY respectively.
It then calculates the values of x3, y3, x4 and y4 using the formulas x3 = x2 - diffY, y3 = y2 + diffX, x4 = x3 - diffX and y4 = y3 - diffY.
Finally, it prints the values of x3, y3, x4 and y4.
