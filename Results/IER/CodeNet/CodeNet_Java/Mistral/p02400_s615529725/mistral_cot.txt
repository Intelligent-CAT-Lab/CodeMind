 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the java.util.Scanner class to read input from the user.
Then it creates a new Scanner object named sc and reads a double value from the user using the nextDouble() method.
It then calculates the value of r by multiplying the input value by itself.
It then calculates the value of the expression r*r*Math.PI and stores it in the variable result1.
It calculates the value of the expression 2*r*Math.PI and stores it in the variable result2.
It then prints the result of the expression result1+result2 using the String.format() method with a precision of 6 decimal places.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is the output of the program, which is the sum of the two expressions calculated in the code.
The output of the program is:
```
10.000000
```
Therefore, the return value of the code is 10.000000.
