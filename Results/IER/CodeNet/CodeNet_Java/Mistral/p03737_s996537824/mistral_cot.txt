 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three input strings `s1`, `s2` and `s3` from the user using `Scanner` class.
It then uses the `substring()` method to extract the first character of each string and stores it in variables `s1.substring(0,1)`, `s2.substring(0,1)` and `s3.substring(0,1)`.
It then concatenates the three characters using the `+` operator and converts them to uppercase using the `toUpperCase()` method.
Finally, it prints the concatenated string as output.
