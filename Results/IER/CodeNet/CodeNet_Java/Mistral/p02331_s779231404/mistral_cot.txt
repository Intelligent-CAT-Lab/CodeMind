 <<<Analysis>>>
The program first reads the input `2 3` using the `FastScanner` class.
Then it calls the `iterationPowMod` method of the `Main` class with the input values `k` and `n`.
The `iterationPowMod` method uses a while loop to calculate the sum of the powers of `x` raised to the powers of 2 raised to the powers of `k` and `n`.
The sum is calculated modulo 1000000007.
The method returns the sum as an integer.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the program is 10.
