 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integer inputs n and k from the user.
It uses the `Scanner` class to read the input from the user.
It then uses the `nextInt()` method to read the integer values of n and k.
It then uses the `Integer.toString(n, k)` method to convert the integer value of n to a string representation in base k.
It uses the `length()` method to get the length of the string representation of n in base k.
Finally, it prints the length of the string representation of n in base k.
