 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input from the user using the Scanner class. It then uses the replace() method to replace the occurrences of the string "apple" with "temp", "peach" with "apple" and "temp" with "peach" in the string.
It then prints the modified string using the println() method.
The input string is "the cost of one peach is higher than that of one apple."
After applying the replacements, the modified string becomes "the cost of one temp is higher than that of one apple."
<<<Output>>>
the cost of one temp is higher than that of one apple.
