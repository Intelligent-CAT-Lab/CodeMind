 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first creates a Scanner object to read input from the user. It then creates an integer array of size 5, nums.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 4 to read the 5 integers from the user and store them in the array nums.
After that, it sorts the array nums in ascending order using the Arrays.sort() method.
It enters another for loop and it iterates from nums.length-1 to 0 in reverse order.
Inside the loop, it checks if the current index i is equal to 0. If it is, it prints the current element of the array nums[i] as output.
If it is not, it prints the current element of the array nums[i] followed by a space.
After the loop finishes, it prints the sorted array nums as output.
