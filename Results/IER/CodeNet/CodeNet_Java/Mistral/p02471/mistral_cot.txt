 <<<Analysis>>>
The program first reads two integers a and b from the user using the Scanner class. Then it enters a while loop that continues until the value of variable r2 becomes 0.
Inside the loop, it calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a and b using the gcd() function. The GCD is calculated by repeatedly dividing the larger number by the smaller number until the remainder is 0.
Then it calculates the values of x3 and y3 by subtracting the quotient of a and b from x1 and y1 respectively.
After that, it updates the values of r1, r2, x1, and y1 using the values of r3, x3, and y3.
Finally, it prints the values of x1 and y1 as output.
<<<Output>>>
