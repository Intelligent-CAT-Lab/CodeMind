 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 15 according to the input. The variable ans is initialized with n.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to 7 to check each integer a in this range. The value of variable a is also passed to variable b.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger a and b by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum is less than or equal to the current value of ans. If it is, it updates the value of ans with the current sum.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 15.
<<<Output>>>
15
