 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 3 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 3 to N to check each integer p in this range.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current integer p is prime by checking if its value is true in the boolean array isPrime.
Then it checks if the integer p + 2 is also prime by checking if its value is true in the boolean array isPrime.
If both p and p + 2 are prime, it adds 2 to variable ans.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
