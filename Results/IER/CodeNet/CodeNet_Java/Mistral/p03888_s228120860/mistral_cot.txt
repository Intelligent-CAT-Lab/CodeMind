 <<<Analysis>>>
The program starts by importing the java.util.Scanner class.
It creates a new Scanner object named d and uses it to read two integers a and b from the user.
It then calculates the value of c by multiplying a and b and dividing it by the sum of a and b.
It uses the println() method to print the value of c.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is the value of c, which is 1.5.
