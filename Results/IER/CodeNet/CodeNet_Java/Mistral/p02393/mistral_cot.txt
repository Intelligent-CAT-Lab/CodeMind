 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable strNum is initialized with the input "3 8 1" according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable index.
Inside the for loop, it splits the input string strNum into an array of strings strNumList using the split() method.
Then it sorts the array of strings strNumList using the Arrays.sort() method.
After the loop finishes, it extracts the first, second and third elements of the sorted array strNumList and assigns them to the variables intNumSmall, intNumMiddle and intNumLarge respectively.
Finally, it prints the values of the three variables intNumSmall, intNumMiddle and intNumLarge as output.
<<<Output>>>
3 8 1
