 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable a and variable b are initialized with 3 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It creates a Scanner object to read input from the user.
It reads the first integer a using the nextInt() method of the Scanner object.
It reads the second integer b using the nextInt() method of the Scanner object.
It closes the Scanner object using the close() method.
It calculates the quotient d by dividing a by b using the division operator /.
It calculates the remainder r by using the modulo operator % on the same division.
It calculates the floating point value f by dividing a by b and converting it to a string using the String.format() method.
It uses the System.out.printf() method to print the values of d, r and f.
