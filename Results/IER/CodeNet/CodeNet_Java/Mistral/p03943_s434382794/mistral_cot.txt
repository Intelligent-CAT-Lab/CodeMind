 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized with 10, 30 and 20 respectively according to the input. And variable sum is initialized with the sum of these three variables.
It calculates the discriminant of the equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0 by multiplying the differences of the squares of the variables a, b and c with the sum of these variables.
Then it checks if the discriminant is equal to 0. If it is, it prints "Yes" otherwise it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
