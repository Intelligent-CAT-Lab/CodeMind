 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 12 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 11 to check each digit of the current interger n.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger n by extracting the digits of number with a substring method and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum is divisible by n. If it is, it assigns "Yes" to variable ans, otherwise it assigns "No".
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output.
<<<Output>>>
No
