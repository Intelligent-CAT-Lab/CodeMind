 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable sc is initialized with a Scanner object that reads input from the console.
The run() method is called which contains a for loop that iterates through each line of input.
Each line of input is stored in the variable buffer and the dec variable is initialized as an empty string.
The for loop iterates through each character in the buffer and uses the HashMap hash to convert each character to its corresponding binary string.
The dec variable is then concatenated with the binary string of each character.
The for loop then iterates through each 5-bit string in the dec variable and uses the HashMap hash2 to convert each 5-bit string to its corresponding ASCII character.
The ret variable is then concatenated with the ASCII character of each 5-bit string.
Finally, the ret variable is printed to the console.
