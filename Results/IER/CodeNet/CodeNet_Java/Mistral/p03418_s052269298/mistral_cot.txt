 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and variable k are initialized with 5 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from k+1 to n to check each integer b in this range.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the answer by adding the product of n and n/b and subtracting k and b-k respectively.
Then it adds the maximum of n%b-k+1 and 0 to the answer.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable answer as output, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
