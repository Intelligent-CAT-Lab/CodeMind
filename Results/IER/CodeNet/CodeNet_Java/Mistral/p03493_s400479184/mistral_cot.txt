 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized with the input "101".
It then uses the `split()` method to split the string into an array of strings, where each string is a digit in the input.
The array of strings is stored in variable sArray.
It then uses an if-else statement to check if each element of the array is equal to "1". If it is, it increments the count variable by 1.
The count variable is then printed as output.
