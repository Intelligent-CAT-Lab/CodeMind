 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first reads the input line using the `Scanner` class and stores it in the `s` array. It then initializes two `HashMap`s, `count` and `length`, to store the count of each word and the length of each word respectively.
It then iterates through the `s` array and for each word, it checks if the word already exists in the `count` and `length` hashmaps. If it does, it increments the count of the word in the `count` hashmap and updates the length of the word in the `length` hashmap. If it doesn't, it adds the word to both hashmaps with a count of 1 and a length equal to the length of the word.
It then finds the word with the maximum count and the word with the maximum length by iterating through the `count` and `length` hashmaps respectively.
Finally, it prints the word with the maximum count and the word with the maximum length.
