 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable H, variable W and variable K are initialized with 1, 3 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 1 to check each integer h in this range.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of dp[h+1][w] for each integer w in the range [0, 3].
It calculates the value of dp[h+1][w] by adding the value of dp[h][w]*memo[w]%mod*memo[(W-1)-(w+1)]%mod and dp[h][w]*memo[w]%mod*memo[(W-1)-w]%mod.
It then calculates the value of dp[h+1][w]%mod.
It then calculates the value of ans by taking dp[H][K-1].
<<<Output>>>
ans = 1
