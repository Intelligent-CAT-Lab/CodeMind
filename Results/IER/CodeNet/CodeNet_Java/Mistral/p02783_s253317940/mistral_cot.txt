 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable H and variable A are initialized with 10 and 4 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the value of variable a by dividing variable H by variable A.
It calculates the value of variable b by adding 1 to the value of variable a.
It checks if the remainder of variable H divided by variable A is 0. If it is, it prints the value of variable a. If it is not, it prints the value of variable b.
Since the remainder of 10 divided by 4 is 0, it prints the value of variable a, which is 2.5.
<<<Output>>>
2.5
