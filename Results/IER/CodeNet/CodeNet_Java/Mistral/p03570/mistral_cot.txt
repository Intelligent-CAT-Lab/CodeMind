 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized with the input string "aabxyyzz".
It creates an array d of size 1 << 26 (1,128,192) and fills it with the length of the string s.
It also creates a variable mask which is initialized to 0.
It then iterates through each character in the string s.
For each character, it calculates the mask by XORing the current character with the mask.
It then iterates through all possible values of j from -1 to 25.
For each value of j, it calculates the current value of d[mask] by XORing the current value of d[j] with the mask.
It then updates the value of d[mask] to the minimum of the current value and 1 + d[j].
After the loop finishes, it prints the minimum value of d[mask] which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
