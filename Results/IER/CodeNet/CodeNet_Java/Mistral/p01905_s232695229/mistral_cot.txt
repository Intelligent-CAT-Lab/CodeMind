The variable n and variable m are initialized with 2 and 0 respectively according to the input. And variable a is not used in this code.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable a.
Inside the for loop, it creates a new array b of size n and initializes all its elements with -1.
Then it calls the function rec(b, 0, n) with the array b, the left index 0 and the right index n.
The function rec(b, 0, n) is a recursive function that takes three arguments: an array b, a left index and a right index. It first checks if the right index is 2 positions to the left of the left index. If it is, it returns -1. If it is not, it calculates the mid index by dividing the left index and the right index by 2 and taking the integer part.
Then it calls the function rec(b, left, mid) with the array b, the left index and the mid index. It also calls the function rec(b, mid, right) with the array b, the mid index and the right index.
If both of these function calls return -1, it returns -1. If either of these function calls returns 0, it returns the sum of the two function calls plus 1. Otherwise, it returns the sum of the two function calls plus 1.
After the function rec(b, 0, n) returns, it prints the return value as output, which is 0.
