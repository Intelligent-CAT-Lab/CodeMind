 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and variable x are initialized with 5 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It enters a function f(a, b) which takes two long arguments a and b.
Inside the function, it checks if b is divisible by a. If it is, it returns 2*(b/a)*a - a. If it is not, it returns 2*(b/a)*a + f(a, b % a).
Since b is not divisible by a, it returns 2*(b/a)*a + f(a, b % a).
It calls the function f(a, b % a) recursively with a and b % a as arguments.
Since b % a is 1, it returns 2*(1/5)*5 + f(5, 1 % 5) = 2*1 + f(5, 0) = 2 + f(5, 0) = 2 + 5 = 7.
So the return value of the function f(a, b) is 7.
<<<Output>>>
7
