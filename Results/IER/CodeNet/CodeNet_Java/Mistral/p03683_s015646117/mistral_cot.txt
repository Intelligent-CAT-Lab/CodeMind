 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and variable m are initialized with 2 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 100000 to calculate the value of x[i] by multiplying the previous value of x[i-1] with i and taking the remainder of the result with a modulo operation of 1000000007.
Then it calculates the value of ans by multiplying x[n] and x[m] and taking the remainder of the result with a modulo operation of 1000000007.
Since n and m are equal, it multiplies ans by 2 and takes the remainder of the result with a modulo operation of 1000000007.
Finally, it prints the value of ans as output, which is 1.
