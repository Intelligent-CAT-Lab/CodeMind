 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 4 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2^4-1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable temp.
Inside the for loop, it prints the current integer i followed by a colon.
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to temp divided by 2. The value of variable j is also passed to variable temp.
Inside the second for loop, it checks if the current integer temp is odd by checking if temp % 2 == 1. If it is, it prints the current integer j.
After the second for loop finishes, it prints a newline character.
