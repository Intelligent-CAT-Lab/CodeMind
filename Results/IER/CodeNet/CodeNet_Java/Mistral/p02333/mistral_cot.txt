 <<<Analysis>>>
The program first reads the input `4 3` from the standard input stream. It then creates a new `Combinatrics` object with `k = 3`. The `Combinatrics` class has a method `surjection` that takes two integer arguments `n` and `k`, and returns the number of surjections of `n` elements taken `k` at a time.

The `surjection` method first initializes a variable `ans` to 0, and a variable `sign` to 1. It then loops through all possible values of `i` from 1 to `k`. For each value of `i`, it checks whether `sign` is 1 or -1. If `sign` is 1, it adds the product of the combination of `k` elements taken `i` at a time, and the `i`th power of `n`, to `ans`. If `sign` is -1, it subtracts the product of the combination of `k` elements taken `i` at a time, and the `i`th power of `n`, from `ans`. After the loop finishes, it returns the value of `ans` modulo 1000000007.

The `iterationPow` method takes two integer arguments `x` and `n`, and returns the value of `x` raised to the power of `n` modulo 1000000007. It does this by repeatedly squaring `x` and taking the modulo 1000000007 until `n` becomes 0.

The `mod` method takes an integer argument `a`, and returns the value of `a` modulo 1000000007.

The `FastScanner` class is used to read input from the standard input stream. It has a method `nextInt` that reads an integer from the input stream and returns it.

<<<Output>>>
The return value of the program is 12.
