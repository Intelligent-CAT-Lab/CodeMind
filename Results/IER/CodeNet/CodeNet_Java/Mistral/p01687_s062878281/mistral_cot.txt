 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable str is initialized with the input "AIDUNYAN".
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 7 to check each character in the input string.
Inside the for loop, it initializes 8 variables A, I, D, U, N, Y and Z with 0.
It then checks if the current character in the input string matches with any of the 8 characters. If it does, it increments the corresponding variable.
After the loop finishes, it checks if all the variables A, I, D, U, N, Y and Z are equal to 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1 and 1 respectively. If they are, it replaces the current character in the input string with 'A', 'I', 'Z', 'U', 'N', 'Y' and 'A' respectively and increments the index i by 7.
It then prints the modified input string.
<<<Output>>>
