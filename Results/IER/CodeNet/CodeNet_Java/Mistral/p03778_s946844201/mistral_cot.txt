 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable W, variable a and variable b are initialized with 3, 2 and 6 respectively according to the input.
It enters an if-else statement to check the condition.
If the sum of variable a and variable W is less than variable b, it prints the value of variable b minus variable a minus variable W.
If the sum of variable b and variable W is less than variable a, it prints the value of variable a minus variable b minus variable W.
If the sum of variable a and variable W is equal to variable b, it prints 0.
In this case, the sum of variable a and variable W is 5, which is greater than variable b, so it prints 0.
<<<Output>>>
0
