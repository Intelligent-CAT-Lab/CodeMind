The variable n is initialized with 2 according to the input. And variable invs is initialized with 1.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable invs.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of invs[i] using the formula invs[i] = (MODULO - invs[((int) (MODULO % i))] * (MODULO / i) % MODULO) % MODULO.
It also checks if invs[i] * i % MODULO != 1. If it does, it throws a RuntimeException.
After the loop finishes, it calculates the value of e[k] using the formula e[k] = (s + invs[n] * invs[k]) % MODULO.
It also calculates the value of res using the formula res = (res + g * pw) % MODULO.
After all the calculations, it prints the value of res as output, which is 0.
