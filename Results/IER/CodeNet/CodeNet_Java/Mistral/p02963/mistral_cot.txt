 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized with 3 according to the input.
It then initializes the variable a with 1000000000.
It uses the modulo operator to find the remainder of s divided by a.
It then subtracts the remainder from a and takes the modulo again to get the remainder of the new value divided by a.
Finally, it calculates the quotient of s divided by a and adds 1 to it.
It then prints the values of s, a, the remainder of s divided by a, the remainder of (s-1) divided by a and (s-1)/a+1.
<<<Output>>>
