 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable str is initialized with the input "KIHBR". The variable pattern is initialized with the regular expression "A?KIHA?BA?RA?".
The program uses the Pattern.matches() method to check if the input string str matches the regular expression pattern.
The regular expression pattern is a sequence of characters that are used to match a specific pattern in a string. In this case, the pattern is looking for the presence of the letters A, K, I, H, B, R, and A, in any order, and the end of the string.
The method returns true if the string matches the pattern and false otherwise.
<<<Output>>>
NO
