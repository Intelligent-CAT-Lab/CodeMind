 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers a and b from the user using the Scanner class.
It then checks if the sum of a and b is greater than 0, less than 0 or equal to 0.
If the sum is greater than 0, it prints 1. If the sum is less than 0, it prints -1. If the sum is equal to 0, it prints 0.
<<<Output>>>
-1
