 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads an integer `N` from standard input and then reads `N` integers from standard input. It then calculates the sum of the squares of all the integers read from standard input.
The code uses a `for` loop to iterate over the integers read from standard input and calculates the square of each integer using the `Math.pow()` method. It then adds the square of each integer to a running total using the `+=` operator.
Finally, the code prints the total sum of the squares of all the integers read from standard input.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is the sum of the squares of all the integers read from standard input.
