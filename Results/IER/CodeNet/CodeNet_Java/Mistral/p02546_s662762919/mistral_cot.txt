 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input from the user using the Scanner class. The input is stored in the variable t.
It then checks if the last character of the string is "s". If it is, it concatenates the string "es" to the end of the string using the concat() method. If it is not, it concatenates the string "s" to the end of the string.
The final output is then printed to the console.
