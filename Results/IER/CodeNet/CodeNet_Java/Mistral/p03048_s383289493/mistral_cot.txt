The variable R, variable G, variable B and variable N are initialized with 1, 2, 3 and 4 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 4 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable r.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the number of integers j that can be subtracted from r to get a multiple of G. It does this by dividing r by G and checking if the remainder is 0. If it is, it increments the count variable.
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to the remainder of r divided by G. The value of variable j is also passed to variable j.
Inside the second for loop, it calculates the number of integers k that can be subtracted from r - G \* j to get a multiple of B. It does this by dividing r - G \* j by B and checking if the remainder is 0. If it is, it increments the count variable.
After the second for loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable count as output, which is 1.
