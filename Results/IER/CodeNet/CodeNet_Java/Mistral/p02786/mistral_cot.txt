 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable h is initialized with 2 according to the input.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until h is equal to 1.
Inside the while loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger h by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum is equal to 1. If it is, it prints 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable sum as output, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>
3
