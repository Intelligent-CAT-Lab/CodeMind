 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable K is initialized with 10 according to the input. And variable num is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 9 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable d.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger num by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it calls the calc() method with num + 2 \* d and num + d as arguments. The calc() method returns the ratio of the number of digits of the number to the sum of its digits.
It compares the returned value of calc() method with num + 2 \* d and num + d. If the returned value of calc() method is less than num + 2 \* d, it means that the number of digits of num + 2 \* d is less than the number of digits of num + d, so it updates the value of d by multiplying it by 10.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable num as output, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
