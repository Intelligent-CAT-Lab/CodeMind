 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and k are initialized with 5 and 3 respectively.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 31 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the number of bits set to 1 in the binary representation of the current interger num by repeatedlly extracting the bits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable count.
Then it checks if the calculated variable count equals k. If it does, it prints the binary representation of the current interger i and the number of bits set to 1 in it.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable count as output, which is 11.
<<<Output>>>
11
