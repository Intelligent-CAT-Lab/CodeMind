 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized with the input "125". The variable ans is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the string s. The value of variable dx is also passed to variable cur.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the string s minus dx. The value of variable start is also passed to variable cur.
It calculates the current integer cur by extracting the substring of the string s from start to start+dx+1.
Then it calls the helper function with the current integer cur and the current value of start and s.length()-1-dx-start.
It multiplies the current integer cur with the result of helper function and adds it to variable ans.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 1152.
<<<Output>>>
1152
