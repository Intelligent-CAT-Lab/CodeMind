 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable X is initialized with 1024 according to the input.
It calculates the value of gohyaku by dividing X by 500 and storing the result in variable gohyaku.
Then it calculates the value of goen by dividing X by 5 and storing the result in variable goen.
It then prints the value of 1000*gohyaku+5*goen, which is 1000*1+5*0.5, which is 1000.5.
<<<Output>>>
1000.5
