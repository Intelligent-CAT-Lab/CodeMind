 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads three integers a, b and c from the user using the Scanner class.
It then checks if a is equal to b using the first if statement. Since a is 5 and b is 7, the condition is not met and the code moves to the next if statement.
It then checks if b is equal to c using the second if statement. Since b is 7 and c is 5, the condition is not met and the code moves to the next if statement.
It then checks if c is equal to a using the third if statement. Since c is 5 and a is 5, the condition is met and the code prints the value of b, which is 7.
<<<Output>>>
7
