 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized with the input "?&?|?&?|?&?".
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 6 to check each character in this range. The value of variable c is also passed to variable text.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character c is '?'. If it is, it increments the cur and returns a new VarNode.
If the current character c is '(', it increments the cur and calls getOrExpr() method to get the next node.
If the current character c is ')', it increments the cur and returns the current node.
After the loop finishes, it returns the final node which is a AndNode with 2 VarNode children.
<<<Output>>>
AndNode{VarNode{0}, AndNode{VarNode{0}, VarNode{0}}}}
