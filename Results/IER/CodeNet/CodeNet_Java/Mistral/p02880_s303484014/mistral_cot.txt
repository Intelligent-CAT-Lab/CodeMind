 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 10 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 9 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it iterates from 1 to 9 again to check each integer j in this range.
It then checks if the product of i and j is equal to N. If it is, it prints "Yes" and returns immediately.
Since the product of 1 and 10 is 10, which is equal to N, it prints "Yes" and returns immediately.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
