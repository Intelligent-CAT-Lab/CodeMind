 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable max is initialized with 0 and variable idx is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer x in this range.
Inside the for loop, it reads the input from the user using the Scanner class and stores it in variable x.
Then it compares the current value of variable x with the current value of variable max. If the current value of variable x is greater than the current value of variable max, it updates the value of variable max and variable idx.
After the loop finishes, it prints the value of variable idx as output, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
