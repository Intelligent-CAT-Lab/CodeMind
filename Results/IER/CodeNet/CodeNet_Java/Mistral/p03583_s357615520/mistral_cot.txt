 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 2 according to the input.
It enters a nested for loop and it iterates from 1 to 3500 for variable h and from 1 to 3500 for variable w.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the numerator Num by multiplying N with h and w.
Then it calculates the denominator Den by multiplying 4 with h and w, subtracting N with w and N with h.
It checks if the denominator is greater than 0 and if the numerator is divisible by the denominator. If both conditions are met, it calculates the quotient ans by dividing the numerator by the denominator and prints the values of h, ans and w.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable found as output, which is false.
<<<Output>>>
false
