The variable A, variable B, variable X and variable ans are initialized with 180, 100, 2400 and 0 respectively according to the input.
It enters a if-else-if statement to check the value of variable A.
If A is less than B, it assigns the value of X divided by 1000 to variable a and the remainder of X divided by 1000 to variable X.
If A is greater than 2*B, it assigns the value of X divided by 500 to variable b.
If A is between 2*B and B, it assigns the value of X divided by 1000 to variable a and the remainder of X divided by 1000 to variable X, and then assigns the value of X divided by 500 to variable b.
After the if-else-if statement finishes, it calculates the product of variable A and variable a and the product of variable B and variable b and assigns it to variable ans.
Finally, it prints the value of variable ans as output, which is 18000.
<<<Output>>>
18000
