 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable k is initialized with 10 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 9 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable i by multiplying i with 10 and adding 9.
Then it prints the value of variable i.

After the loop finishes, it prints the value of variable k, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
