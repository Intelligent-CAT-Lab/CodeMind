 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and k are initialized with 1 and 1 respectively according to the input. And variable ret is initialized with a 2D array of size n x 3.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to n-1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable ptr.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of ret[i][1] as k + n + i and ret[i][2] as k + 2 * n + i.
Then it adds ret[i][1] and ret[i][2] to a TreeSet set.
After the loop finishes, it iterates through the TreeSet set and for each element it calculates the difference between ret[i][2] and ret[i][1]. It then adds the value of this difference to ret[i][0].
Finally, it prints the values of ret[i][0], ret[i][1] and ret[i][2] for each i in the range 0 to n-1.
