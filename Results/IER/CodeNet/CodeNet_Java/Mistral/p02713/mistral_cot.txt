The variable N is initialized with 2 according to the input. And variable result is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable a.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 1 to 2 to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable a.
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from 1 to 2 to check each integer k in this range. The value of variable k is also passed to variable a.
It calls the gcd function with the values of a and k as arguments and adds the result to variable result.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable result as output, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
