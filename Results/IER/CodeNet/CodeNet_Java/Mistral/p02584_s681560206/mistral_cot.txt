 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable X, variable K and variable D are initialized with 6, 2 and 4 respectively according to the input.
It enters an if-else statement to check the value of variable K with respect to variable X divided by variable D.
If K is less than or equal to X divided by D, it means that K is less than or equal to 2, so it assigns the value of X to variable ans.
If K is greater than X divided by D, it means that K is greater than 2, so it assigns the value of X to variable ans.
Then it enters another if-else statement to check the value of variable X modulo variable D with respect to variable D.
If X modulo D is less than or equal to D, it means that X modulo D is 0, so it assigns the value of X modulo D to variable ans.
If X modulo D is greater than D, it means that X modulo D is 4, so it assigns the value of 4 to variable ans.
If X modulo D is equal to D, it means that X modulo D is 4, so it assigns the value of 4 to variable ans.
After the if-else statement, it prints the final value of variable ans as output, which is 4.
<<<Output>>>
