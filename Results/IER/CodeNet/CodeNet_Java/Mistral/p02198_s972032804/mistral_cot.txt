 <<<Analysis>>>
The code prompts the user to enter two integers using the `Scanner` class. The first integer is read using the `nextInt()` method and stored in the variable `a` and the second integer is read using the `nextInt()` method and stored in the variable `b`.
Then it multiplies the two variables `a` and `b` and stores the result in the variable `result`.
Finally, it prints the value of the `result` variable using the `System.out.println()` method.
