 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers `n` and `a` from the input. It then reads an array of `n` integers `x` from the input.
It then iterates over the array `x` and for each element `x[i]`, it calculates the sum of the digits of `x[i]` by repeatedly extracting the digits of `x[i]` with a while loop and adding it to variable `sum`.
Then it checks if the calculated variable `sum` falls within the range [2, 5]. If it does, it adds the current interger `i` to variable `answer`.
The condition is met when `i` is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable `answer` as output, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
