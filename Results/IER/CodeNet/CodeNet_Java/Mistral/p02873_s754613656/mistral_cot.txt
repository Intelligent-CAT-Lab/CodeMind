 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input from the standard input stream and then iterates through each character in the string. If the current character is a digit, it is added to a variable `num`. If the current character is a `<`, it is added to the variable `num` with the maximum value of `num` and `a[i+1]`. If the current character is a `>`, it is added to the variable `num` with the maximum value of `num` and `a[n-i]`. Finally, the sum of all the digits in the variable `num` is printed to the standard output stream.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is the sum of all the digits in the input string.
