 <<<Analysis>>>
The code prompts the user to enter three integers a, b and c using the Scanner class. The values of a, b and c are then stored in the variables a, b and c respectively.
It then checks if the values of a, b and c are equal to each other using the if statement. If all three values are equal, it prints "Yes" otherwise it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
