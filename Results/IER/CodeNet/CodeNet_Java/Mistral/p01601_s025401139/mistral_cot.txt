 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 13 according to the input.
It enters a while loop that runs until the input is exhausted.
Inside the loop, it first converts the integer n to a string and stores it in variable str.
Then it creates a StringBuffer object sb from the string str and reverses it by calling the reverse() method.
It then converts the reversed StringBuffer object sb back to a string and stores it in variable rev.
It then initializes two variables a and b with values n-1 and n+1 respectively.
It enters a for loop that runs until the string str is equal to its reverse.
Inside the for loop, it first converts the integer a to a string and stores it in variable str.
Then it creates a StringBuffer object sb from the string str and reverses it by calling the reverse() method.
It then converts the reversed StringBuffer object sb back to a string and stores it in variable rev.
It then checks if the string str is equal to its reverse. If it is, it prints the value of variable str and breaks out of the loop.
If it is not, it increments variable a and decrements variable b and continues the loop.
After the loop finishes, it prints the value of variable str, which is 13.
<<<Output>>>
13
