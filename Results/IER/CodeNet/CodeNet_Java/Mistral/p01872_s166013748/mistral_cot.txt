 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable S is initialized with the input string "?12345678901".
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 11 to check each character of the string S.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character is '?'. If it is, it assigns -1 to the corresponding element of the array num. Otherwise, it assigns the current character - '0' to the corresponding element of the array num.
After the loop finishes, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 11 to check each element of the array num.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current element is -1. If it is, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 9 to check each possible value for the current element.
For each possible value, it calls the check() method to check if the current element and the other elements of the array satisfy the condition of the problem. If they do, it increments the count variable and assigns the current value to the ans variable.
After the inner loop finishes, it resets the current element to -1.
After the outer loop finishes, it checks if the count variable is greater than 1. If it is, it prints "MULTIPLE". Otherwise, it prints the value of the ans variable.
<<<Output>>>
MULTIPLE
