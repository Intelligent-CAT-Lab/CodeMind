 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized with the input string "ABCABC".
It creates an ArrayDeque<Character> q and adds all the characters of the string s to it.
It initializes a variable ans to 0 and a variable anum to 0.
It enters a while loop that continues until the size of the queue q is 0.
Inside the loop, it initializes a variable now to 'A'.
It enters another while loop that continues until now is not equal to 'A'.
Inside this loop, it checks if the size of the queue q is 0. If it is, it breaks out of the loop.
Otherwise, it removes the first character from the queue q and assigns it to now. If now is 'A', it increments anum.
It then checks if now is 'B'. If it is, it removes the first character from the queue q and assigns it to now. If now is 'C', it adds anum to ans and breaks out of the loop. Otherwise, it sets anum to 0 and continues the loop.
If now is not 'A', it sets anum to 0 and continues the loop.
After the while loop finishes, it prints the value of ans, which is 3.
