 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string input from the user using the Scanner class. It then calculates the length of the string using the length() method and stores it in the variable n.
It then extracts the first and last character of the string using the charAt() method and stores it in the variables h and t respectively.
Finally, it prints the concatenation of the first character, the length of the string minus 2, and the last character using the println() method.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is the concatenation of the first character, the length of the string minus 2, and the last character of the input string.
For example, if the input string is "hello", the output will be "h2e".
