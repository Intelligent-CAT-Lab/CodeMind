 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable h is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger num is equal to 'g' or 'p'. If it is, it increments or decrements the value of variable h by 1.
The condition is met when num is equal to 'g' and 'p' and the value of variable h is 0.
It then prints the value of variable h divided by 2.
<<<Output>>>
0
