 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 24 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates until N is equal to 1.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of div by raising q to the power of e.
Then it checks if N is divisible by div. If it is, it divides N by div and increments ans.
If N is not divisible by div, it checks if N is divisible by q. If it is, it divides N by q and increments ans.
If N is not divisible by q, it increments q and checks if q * q is greater than N. If it is, it breaks out of the loop.
After the loop finishes, it checks if N is equal to 1. If it is not, it increments ans.
Finally, it prints the value of ans as output, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>
3
