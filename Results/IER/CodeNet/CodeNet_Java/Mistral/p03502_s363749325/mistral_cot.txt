 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 12 according to the input. And variable sum is initialized with 0.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until n is not equal to 0.
Inside the while loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger n by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum is equal to 2. If it is, it print "Yes" otherwise it print "No".
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable answer as output, which is "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
