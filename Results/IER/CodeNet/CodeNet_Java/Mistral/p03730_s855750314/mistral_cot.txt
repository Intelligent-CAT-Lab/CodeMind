The variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized with 7, 5 and 1 respectively according to the input.
The function gcd(b, a % b) is called to find the greatest common divisor of b and a % b.
The function gcd(y, x % y) is a recursive function that returns the greatest common divisor of two integers x and y. It returns x if y is 0, otherwise it returns the greatest common divisor of y and x % y.
The condition c % gcd(b, a % b) == 0 is checked to see if c is divisible by the greatest common divisor of b and a % b.
Since c is 1, it is not divisible by any number, so the condition is false.
Therefore, the return value of the code is "NO".
<<<Output>>>
NO
