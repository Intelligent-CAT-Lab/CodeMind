 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n, variable y and variable need are initialized with 9, 45000 and 0 respectively according to the input.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until it has no more input.
Inside the while loop, it reads the next integer n from the input.
It then calculates the value of y by dividing n by 100000.
It initializes flag variable to false.
It enters two nested for loops. The outer loop iterates from 0 to y/price[0] and the inner loop iterates from 0 to (y-price[0]*i)/price[1].
Inside the for loops, it calculates the value of need by subtracting the price of the items purchased from the total amount of money.
It then checks if the sum of the items purchased is equal to n. If it is, it sets flag variable to true and prints the values of i, j and need.
After the loops finishes, it checks if flag variable is still false. If it is, it prints -1 -1 -1.
After the while loop finishes, it flushes the output stream and closes the input and output streams.
<<<Output>>>
-1 -1 -1
