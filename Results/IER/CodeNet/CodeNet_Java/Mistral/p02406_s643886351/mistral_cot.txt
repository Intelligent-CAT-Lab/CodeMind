 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 30 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 30 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable x.
Inside the for loop, it checks if x is divisible by 3 using the modulo operator (%). If it is, it appends the current integer i to the StringBuilder count and continues to the next iteration of the loop.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable count as output, which is "15 24 30".
<<<Output>>>
15 24 30
