 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized with the input "0011".
It calculates the length of the string s using the variable len.
Then it calculates the number of occurrences of the character "0" in the string s using the variable countRed. It does this by subtracting the length of the string s after removing all occurrences of the character "0" using the replace() method from the original string s.
Then it calculates the number of occurrences of the character "1" in the string s using the variable countBlue. It does this by subtracting the length of the string s after removing all occurrences of the character "1" using the replace() method from the original string s.
Then it calculates the minimum of countRed and countBlue.
Finally, it multiplies the minimum of countRed and countBlue by 2 and assigns the result to the variable result.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is 10.
