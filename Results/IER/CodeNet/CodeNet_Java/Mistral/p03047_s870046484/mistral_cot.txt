 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the java.util.Scanner class to read input from the user.
Then it creates a Scanner object named sc and reads two integers a and b from the user using the nextInt() method.
It then calculates the answer by subtracting b from a and adding 1 to the result.
Finally, it prints the calculated answer using the println() method.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code would be 4.
