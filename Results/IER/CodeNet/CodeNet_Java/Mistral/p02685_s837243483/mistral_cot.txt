The variable n, variable m and variable k are initialized with 3, 2 and 1 respectively according to the input. And variable limit is initialized with 998244353.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable nextPattern.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the next pattern of the current interger i by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable nextPattern.
Then it calculates the color pattern of the current interger i by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable colorPattern.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable countPattern as output, which is 1.
