 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 2 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 1.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable pos[0] as 0 and pos[1] as 1.
It then adds pos[0] and pos[1] to the set used and checks if the set contains any duplicates.
Since the set used does not contain any duplicates, it prints the value of pos[0] and pos[1] as output.
<<<Output>>>
0 1
