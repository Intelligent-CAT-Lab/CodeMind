 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable a, variable b and variable k are initialized with 99, 98 and 1 respectively according to the input. And variable max is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 1023 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable borrow.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable c by subtracting the value of variable borrow from the value of variable a and b.
Then it calculates the value of variable ans by multiplying the value of variable c with 10 and adding it to the value of variable ans.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable max as output, which is 10000000000000000000.
<<<Output>>>
10000000000000000000
