 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized with the input string "0011". The variable numZeros is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates through each character in the string s. If the character is '0', it increments the variable numZeros.
After the loop finishes, it calculates the minimum of numZeros and the length of the string s minus numZeros. It then multiplies this value by 2 and prints it as output.
In this case, numZeros is 2 and s.length - numZeros is 3. So the minimum value is 2 and multiplying it by 2 gives 4.
<<<Output>>>
4
