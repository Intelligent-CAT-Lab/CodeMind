 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable M, variable rd, variable rr, variable cd, and variable cr are initialized with the input values.
It enters a for loop and it iterates 1000 times.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the mid value of the current range by dividing the sum of r and l by 2.
Then it checks if the calculated value of cd is less than or equal to rd \* mid / 100. If it is, it updates the value of l to mid. Otherwise, it updates the value of r to mid.
After the loop finishes, it calculates the value of x and y by finding the mid value of the current range and updating the value of r and l accordingly.
Then it checks if the sum of x and y is greater than M. If it is, it prints -1. Otherwise, it calculates the value of D and R by dividing the product of rd and x or rr and y by 100.
Then it calculates the value of ans by subtracting x and y from M and adding the value of D and R multiplied by 100.
Finally, it checks if the value of D is less than cd or the value of R is less than cr. If either of these conditions is true, it prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the value of ans.
<<<Output>>>
-1
