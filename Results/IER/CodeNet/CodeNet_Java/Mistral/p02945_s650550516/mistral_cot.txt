 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the java.util package and creates a Scanner object to read input from the user.
It then reads two integers a and b from the user using the nextInt() method of the Scanner object.
It then uses the Math.max() method to find the maximum of the three possible values:
- a+b
- a-b
- a*b
It returns the maximum value.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code for the input `-13 3` would be 13.
