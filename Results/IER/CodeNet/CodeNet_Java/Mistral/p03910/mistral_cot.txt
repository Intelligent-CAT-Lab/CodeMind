 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 4 according to the input. And variable table is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 4 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of table[i] by adding i to table[i-1].
Then it checks if table[i] is greater than or equal to N. If it is, it assigns the value of i to variable M and breaks out of the loop.
After the loop finishes, it creates a HashSet s and adds all integers from 1 to M to it.
Then it removes the integer table[M] - N from the HashSet s.
Finally, it prints all the integers in the HashSet s.
Since table[M] - N is 1, the HashSet s contains only 1.
