 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four integer inputs from the user using the Scanner class. The variables a, b, c and d are initialized with the values 3, 8, 7 and 1 respectively.
It then uses an if-else statement to compare the sum of variables a and b with the sum of variables c and d.
If the sum of a and b is greater than the sum of c and d, it prints "Left".
If the sum of a and b is equal to the sum of c and d, it prints "Balanced".
If the sum of a and b is less than the sum of c and d, it prints "Right".
In this case, the sum of a and b is 18, which is greater than the sum of c and d, which is 16. Therefore, it prints "Left".
<<<Output>>>
Left
