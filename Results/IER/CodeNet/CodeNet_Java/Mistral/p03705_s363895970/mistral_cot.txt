The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized with 4, 4 and 6 respectively according to the input.
It enters a series of if-else statements to check the value of N, A and B.
The first if statement checks if A is greater than B, if it is true it prints 0 and returns.
The second if statement checks if A is equal to B, if it is true it prints 1 and returns.
The third if statement checks if N is equal to 1, if it is true it prints 0 and returns.
The fourth if statement checks if N is equal to 2, if it is true it prints 1 and returns.
The fifth if statement checks if N is less than the difference between B and A plus 1, if it is true it prints 0 and returns.
The sixth statement prints the result of the calculation (B-A)*(N-2)+1.
The calculation is 12*2+1 = 25.
