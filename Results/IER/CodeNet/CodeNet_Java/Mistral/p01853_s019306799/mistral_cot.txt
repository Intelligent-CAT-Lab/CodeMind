The variable n and variable m are initialized with 3 and 100 respectively.
It enters a if-else statement to check if n is odd or even.
If n is odd, it calculates the first and second half of n and prints the first half followed by a space and the second half.
If n is even, it calculates the first half of n and prints the first half followed by a space and the second half minus 1.
After the if-else statement finishes, it prints a newline character.
<<<Output>>>
