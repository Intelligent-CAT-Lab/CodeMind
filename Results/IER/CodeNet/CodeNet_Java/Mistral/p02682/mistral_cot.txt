 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four integer inputs a, b, c and d from the user. It initializes a variable sum to 0.
It checks if d is less than or equal to a. If it is, it prints the value of d and returns from the function.
If it is not, it assigns the value of a to variable sum and subtracts d from a.
It then checks if d is less than or equal to b. If it is, it prints the value of sum and returns from the function.
If it is not, it subtracts b from d and assigns the result to variable d.
It then subtracts d from sum and prints the final value of sum.
In this case, the input values are 2, 1, 1, and 3.
The first if condition is not met, so it moves to the next if condition.
The second if condition is also not met, so it moves to the next if condition.
The third if condition is also not met, so it moves to the next if condition.
The final value of sum is 0, which is printed as output.
