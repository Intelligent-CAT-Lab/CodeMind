 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 8 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to the square root of N to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable n.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the integer n is a factor of N by checking if N-i is divisible by i and if N-i is greater than i. If it is, it adds the integer n to the ArrayList num.
After the loop finishes, it calculates the sum of all the integers in the ArrayList num and stores it in variable ans.
The sum of the integers in the ArrayList num is 2+4=6.
<<<Output>>>
6
