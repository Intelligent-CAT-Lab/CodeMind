 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the java.util.Scanner class to read input from the user.
Then it creates a new Scanner object named sc and reads two integers a and b from the user using the nextInt() method.
It then uses the Math.max() method to find the maximum of the three possible values:
- The sum of a and b
- The difference between a and b
- The product of a and b
The return value of the code is the maximum of these three values.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is 11, which is the maximum of the three possible values: 3+1=4, 3-1=2, 3*1=3.
