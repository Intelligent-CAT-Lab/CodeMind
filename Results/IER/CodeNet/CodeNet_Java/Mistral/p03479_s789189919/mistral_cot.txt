 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable X and variable Y are initialized with 3 and 20 respectively according to the input. And variable A is initialized with X.
It enters an infinite while loop and it repeatedly multiplies variable A by 2 until it becomes less than or equal to Y.
Inside the loop, it checks if A is less than 0, if it is, it multiplies A by -2, otherwise it multiplies A by 2.
Then it checks if A is less than or equal to Y, if it is, it increments the value of variable ans.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 1.
