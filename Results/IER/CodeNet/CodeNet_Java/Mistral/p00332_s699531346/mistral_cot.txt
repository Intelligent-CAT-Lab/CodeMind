 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable E and variable Y are initialized with 0 and 2015 respectively according to the input.
It enters a series of if-else statements to check the value of variable E.
If E is 0, it checks the value of variable Y and prints the corresponding output based on the range of Y.
If E is 1, it adds 1867 to the value of Y and prints the output.
If E is 2, it adds 1911 to the value of Y and prints the output.
If E is 3, it adds 1925 to the value of Y and prints the output.
If E is greater than 3, it adds 1988 to the value of Y and prints the output.
Since E is 0, it checks the value of Y and finds that it falls within the range [1867, 1911]. Therefore, it prints "M" followed by the difference between Y and 1867, which is 148.
<<<Output>>>
M 148
