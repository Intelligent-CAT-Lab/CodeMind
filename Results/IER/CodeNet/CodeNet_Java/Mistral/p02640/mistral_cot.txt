 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs, x and y, which are the number of heads and the number of tails respectively. It calculates the number of cranes and turtles using the formula `crane = -(y/2) + 2*x` and `turtle = x - crane`.
It then checks if the number of turtles and cranes are non-negative and have no decimal places. If the conditions are met, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
