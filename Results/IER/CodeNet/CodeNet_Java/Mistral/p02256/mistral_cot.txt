The variable a and variable b are initialized with 54 and 20 respectively according to the input.
It calls the function GCD(a, b) to find the greatest common divisor of a and b.
The function GCD takes two integer arguments a and b. It first checks if a is less than b, if so it swaps the values of a and b. Then it checks if a is divisible by b. If it is, it returns b as the GCD. If not, it calls the function GCD recursively with b and the remainder of a divided by b as arguments.
The function GCD continues to call itself recursively until the remainder is 0. At this point, the function returns the last value of b, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
