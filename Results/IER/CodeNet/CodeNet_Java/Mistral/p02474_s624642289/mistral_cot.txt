The variable s is initialized with the input "5 8" using the Scanner class.
It then splits the input string s into an array of strings using the split() method.
The first two elements of the array are assigned to the variables a and b respectively.
The variables a and b are then multiplied using the multiply() method of the BigInteger class and the result is assigned to the variable c.
Finally, the value of variable c is printed to the console using the println() method.
