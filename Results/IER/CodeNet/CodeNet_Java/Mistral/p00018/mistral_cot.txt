 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable ans is an array of 5 integers, which is initialized with the values [1,1,1,1,1]. The variable count is initialized with 0.
It enters a while loop and it reads the input from the user using Scanner class. It reads the first integer and stores it in variable num. It then adds num to the ans array at the index count and increments count.
It checks if count is equal to 5, if it is, it calls the strkn() method and passes the ans array as an argument.
The strkn() method takes an array of integers as an argument and sorts it in descending order using the Arrays.sort() method and Comparator.reverseOrder() method.
It then concatenates the sorted array elements into a string and returns the result.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code based on the input `3 6 9 7 5` would be `96375`.
