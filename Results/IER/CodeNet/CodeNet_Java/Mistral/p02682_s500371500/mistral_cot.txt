 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized with 2, 1 and 1 respectively according to the input. And variable k is initialized with 3.
It enters a if statement and it checks if k is greater than 0. Since k is greater than 0, it enters the if block.
Inside the if block, it calculates the minimum of k, a and b. The minimum of k, a and b is 1.
Then it calculates the minimum of the remaining value of k, b and c. The minimum of the remaining value of k, b and c is 0.
Since k is greater than 0, it subtracts the minimum of the remaining value of k, b and c from ans.
After the if block finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 1.
