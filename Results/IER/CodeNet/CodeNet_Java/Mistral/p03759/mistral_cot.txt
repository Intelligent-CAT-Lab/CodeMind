 <<<Analysis>>>
The program takes three integers a, b and c as input from the user. In this case, the values of a, b and c are 2, 4 and 6 respectively.
It then checks if the difference between a and b is equal to the difference between b and c.
Since 2-4 = 4-6, the condition is met and the program prints "YES" as output.
<<<Output>>>
YES
