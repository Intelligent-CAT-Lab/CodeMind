 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers H and R from the user using Scanner class.
It checks if H is less than 0 and if the absolute value of H is equal to R. If both conditions are true, it prints 0.
If H and R are positive and their sum is greater than 0, it prints 1.
If none of the above conditions are met, it prints -1.
<<<Output>>>
-1
