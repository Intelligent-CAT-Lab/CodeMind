 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable x, variable a and variable b are initialized with 5, 2 and 7 respectively according to the input.
It enters an if-else statement and it checks if the absolute value of x-a is less than the absolute value of x-b.
The condition is met when x-a is -3 and x-b is -5.
Since -3 is less than -5, the program prints "A" as output.
<<<Output>>>
