 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with the input value 432.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 432 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of i multiplied by 1.08 and checks if it is equal to N. If it is, it prints the value of i and returns from the function.
After the loop finishes, it prints ":"(without quotes) as output, because no integer i in the range [0, 432] satisfies the condition.
<<<Output>>>
