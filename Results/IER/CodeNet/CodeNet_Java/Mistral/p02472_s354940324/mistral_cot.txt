 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers A and B from the user using the Scanner class. The first integer is read using the `next()` method of the Scanner class and stored in the variable A using the `BigInteger` class. The second integer is read using the `next()` method of the Scanner class and stored in the variable B using the `BigInteger` class.
Then it prints the sum of A and B using the `add()` method of the `BigInteger` class.
