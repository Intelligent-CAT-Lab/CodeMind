 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N and K are initialized with 1 and 1 respectively according to the input. And variable ans is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 1 to check each integer 1 in this range. The value of variable 1 is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger num by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum falls within the range [1, 1]. If it does, it adds the current interger 1 to variable ans.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 1.
<<<Output>>>
1
