 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable A, variable B and variable C are initialized with 7, 5 and 1 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 5 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the remainder of the division of A and i by B using the modulo operator (%). If the remainder is equal to C, it prints "YES" and returns immediately.
After the loop finishes, it prints "NO" because none of the values of i satisfy the condition.
<<<Output>>>
NO
