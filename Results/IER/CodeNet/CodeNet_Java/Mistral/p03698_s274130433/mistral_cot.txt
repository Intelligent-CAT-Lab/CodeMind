 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable c is initialized with the input string "uncopyrightable" using the `Scanner` class.
It then converts the input string to a character array using the `toCharArray()` method.
It sorts the character array using the `Arrays.sort()` method.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to the length of the character array - 1.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character is equal to the previous character. If it is, it sets the boolean variable bl to false and breaks out of the loop.
After the loop finishes, it checks the value of variable bl. If it is true, it prints "yes" otherwise it prints "no".
<<<Output>>>
no
