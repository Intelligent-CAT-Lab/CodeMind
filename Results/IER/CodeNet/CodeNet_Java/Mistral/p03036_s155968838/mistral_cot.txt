 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable r and d are initialized with 10 and 2 respectively according to the input. And variable ary is initialized with an array of size 11.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 9 to calculate the value of each element in the array ary.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of each element in the array ary by multiplying the previous element in the array with variable r and subtracting variable d.
Then it prints the value of each element in the array ary.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of the array ary as output, which is [2, 22, 44, 66, 88, 110, 132, 154, 176, 198, 220].
<<<Output>>>
[2, 22, 44, 66, 88, 110, 132, 154, 176, 198, 220]
