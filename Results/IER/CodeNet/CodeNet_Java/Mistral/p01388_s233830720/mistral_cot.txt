 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable k, variable u, variable p, and variable c are initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the input string s.
Inside the for loop, it checks the current character of the input string s. If the character is 'K', it increments the value of variable k. If the character is 'U', it increments the value of variable u. If the character is 'P', it increments the value of variable p. If the character is 'C', it increments the value of variable c.
After the loop finishes, it uses the Math.min() method to find the minimum value among k, u, p, and c.
The condition is met when k is 1, u is 1, p is 1, and c is 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable k, which is 1.
