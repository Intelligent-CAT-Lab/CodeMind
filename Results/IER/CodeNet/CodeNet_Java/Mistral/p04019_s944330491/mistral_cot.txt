 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable dir is a boolean array of size 4, which is used to store the direction of movement. The variable line is a string that contains the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the string line. The current character of the string line is stored in variable now.
If the current character is 'N', it sets the value of dir[0] to true. If the current character is 'S', it sets the value of dir[1] to true. If the current character is 'E', it sets the value of dir[2] to true. If the current character is 'W', it sets the value of dir[3] to true.
After the loop finishes, it checks if all the elements of dir array are true. If they are, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
