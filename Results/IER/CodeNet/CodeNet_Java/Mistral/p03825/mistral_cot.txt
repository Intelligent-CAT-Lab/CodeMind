The variable zeroes, variable ones and variable k are initialized with 2, 2 and 2 respectively according to the input. And variable depth is calculated as (zeroes + ones - 1) / (k - 1) = 2.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable cur.
Inside the for loop, it creates a boolean array nice and fills it with false. Then it creates a for loop to iterate from 0 to depth.
Inside the inner loop, it calculates the number of ones that can be obtained by adding k-1 zeros to the current number of ones. If the number of ones is greater than or equal to 0, it sets the corresponding element of nice array to true.
Then it creates another for loop to iterate from ones to 0.
Inside the inner loop, it checks if the current number of ways is not 0. If it is not, it creates another for loop to iterate from 1 to k-1.
Inside the inner loop, it checks if the current number of ways is not 0 and the current number of ones plus the current value of cur is not greater than or equal to 0. If both conditions are met, it adds the current number of ways to the result variable res.
Then it updates the current number of ways by adding the current number of ways to the number of ways of the current number of ones plus the current value of cur.
After the loops finish, it print the fianl value of variable res as output, which is 2.
