 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable H, variable W and variable d are initialized with 2, 2 and 1 respectively according to the input. And variable mode is initialized with "RYGB".
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable v by taking the average of (i + j) and (i + W - 1 - j) divided by 2 and then taking the remainder of the result divided by 2.
Then it prints the value of variable v and assigns it to variable ans[i][j].
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is [[0, 0], [0, 1], [1, 0], [1, 1]].
<<<Output>>>
[[0, 0], [0, 1], [1, 0], [1, 1]]
