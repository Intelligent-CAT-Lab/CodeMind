 <<<Analysis>>>
The program takes two integers n and m as input from the user. The program then enters a for loop that iterates from m/n to 1.
Inside the loop, it checks if m is divisible by i using the modulo operator (%). If m is divisible by i, it prints the value of i and breaks out of the loop.
Since m is 14 and n is 3, the loop will iterate from 4 to 1. When i is 4, m is divisible by 4, so it prints 4 and breaks out of the loop.
<<<Output>>>
4
