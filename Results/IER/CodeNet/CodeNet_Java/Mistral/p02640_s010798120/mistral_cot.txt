 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable x and variable y are initialized with 3 and 8 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable sum.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger i by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum equals to y. If it does, it sets the variable flg to true and breaks out of the loop.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable flg as output, which is true.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
