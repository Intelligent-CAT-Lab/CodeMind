 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads the input from the standard input stream using BufferedReader. It then tokenizes the input string using StringTokenizer and extracts the three tokens: i, ch, and j.
The variable i is assigned the value of the first token, which is 1. The variable ch is assigned the value of the second token, which is '+'. The variable j is assigned the value of the third token, which is 2.
The code then checks the value of variable ch. If it is '+', it adds the values of variable i and variable j and prints the result. If it is '-', it subtracts the value of variable j from the value of variable i and prints the result.
In this case, the value of variable ch is '+', so it adds the values of variable i and variable j and prints the result, which is 3.
