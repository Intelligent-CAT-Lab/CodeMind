 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable S is initialized with the input string "ASSA".
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 3 to check each character c in this range.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character c is already present in the map m. If it is not present, it adds the character c to the map m with a value of 1. If it is present, it increments the value of the current character c in the map m.
After the loop finishes, it checks the size of the map m. If the size of the map is 2, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
In this case, the size of the map is 2, because the characters 'A' and 'S' are present in the map with a value of 1.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
