 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input from the user using the Scanner class. It then iterates through each character in the string using a for loop. For each character, it checks if it is an uppercase letter using the Character.isUpperCase() method. If it is, it converts it to lowercase using the Character.toLowerCase() method and prints it. If it is not an uppercase letter, it converts it to uppercase using the Character.toUpperCase() method and prints it.

After the loop finishes, it prints an empty line to separate the input from the output.

<<<Output>>>
fAIR, LATER, OCCASIONALLY CLOUDY.
