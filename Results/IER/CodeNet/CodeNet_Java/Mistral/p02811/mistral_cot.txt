 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable K and variable X are initialized with 2 and 900 respectively according to the input.
It enters an if statement and it checks if the value of variable X is less than or equal to 500 times the value of variable K.
Since 900 is greater than 500 times 2, the condition is not met and the program prints "No" as output.
<<<Output>>>
No
