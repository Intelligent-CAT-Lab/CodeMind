 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads three input values `a`, `t` and `r` from the user using the `Scanner` class. The `a` is read as 180, `t` is read as 120 and `r` is read as 90.
It then calculates the result by multiplying `r` and `t` and dividing it by `a`. The result is calculated as `(90 * 120) / 180 = 30`.
The result is then printed to the console using the `System.out.println()` method.
<<<Output>>>
30
