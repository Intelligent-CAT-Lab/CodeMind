 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable cIndex is set to the index of the first character 'C' in the input string "CODEFESTIVAL".
The variable fIndex is set to the index of the last character 'F' in the input string "CODEFESTIVAL".
Since 'C' is the first character in the input string, cIndex is set to 0.
Since 'F' is the last character in the input string, fIndex is set to 11.
Since fIndex is greater than cIndex, the condition in the if statement is met and the output is "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
