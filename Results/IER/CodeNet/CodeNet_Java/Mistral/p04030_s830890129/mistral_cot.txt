The variable s is initialized with the input string "01B0".
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 3 to check each character c in this range.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character c is 'B'. If it is, it deletes the last character from the StringBuilder sb. Otherwise, it appends the current character c to the StringBuilder sb.
After the loop finishes, it print the final value of the StringBuilder sb as output, which is "01".
