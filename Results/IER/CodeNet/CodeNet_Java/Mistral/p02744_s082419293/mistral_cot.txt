 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 1 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 10 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger i is not present in the string s by repeatedlylly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and checking if it is present in the string s.
If it is not present, it adds the current interger i to variable last and breaks out of the while loop.
Then it checks if the current string s contains the last digit i. If it does, it adds the current string s to the list.
After the loop finishes, it returns the list.
<<<Output>>>
["a"]
