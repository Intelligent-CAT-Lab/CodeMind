The variable n and w are initialized with 10 and 2 respectively according to the input. And variable count is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the count of the digits of the current interger num by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable count.
Then it checks if the count of digits of num is 1 or 2. If it is, it adds 1 to variable nowcount.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable nowcount as output, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
