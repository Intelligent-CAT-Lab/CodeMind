 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 6 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to the square root of n to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it checks if n is divisible by i. If it is, it adds the current interger i to variable list and repeatedly divides n by i until n is no longer divisible by i.
After the loop finishes, it calculates the product of all the integers in the list by multiplying each element of the list with the previous element and storing the result in variable k.
Then it calculates the quotient of n by dividing it by the product of all the integers in the list.
Finally, it prints the product of k and t.
