 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a line of input from the user using BufferedReader and stores it in a String variable `line`.
It then creates a new StringBuffer object and appends the `line` to it using the `append()` method.
It then reverses the contents of the StringBuffer using the `reverse()` method.
Finally, it prints the reversed contents of the StringBuffer using the `print()` method.
