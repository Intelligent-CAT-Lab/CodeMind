 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable r1 and r2 are initialized with 2 and 3 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the equivalent resistance of the circuit by repeatedlylly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it prints the equivalent resistance of the circuit as output, which is 0.5.
<<<Output>>>
0.5
