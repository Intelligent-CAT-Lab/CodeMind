 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N and M are initialized with 3 and 9 respectively according to the input.
It enters an if-else statement to check if N is equal to 1. If it is, it prints the value of M+1 modulo 1000000007.
If N is not equal to 1, it calculates the value of first\_limit by checking if M+1 is divisible by N-1. If it is, it calculates first\_limit as (M+1)/(N-1)-1. If it is not, it calculates first\_limit as (M+1)/(N-1).
If first\_limit is less than or equal to 0, it prints the value of M+1 modulo 1000000007.
If first\_limit is greater than 0, it initializes bigMOD, limit, A, B and C variables as BigInteger objects.
It then calculates A as the value of M+1, B as 2*(M+1)*limit and C as (N-1)*limit*(first\_limit+1).
Finally, it prints the value of (A.add(B).subtract(C)).remainder(bigMOD) modulo 1000000007.
