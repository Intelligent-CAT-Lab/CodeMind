 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized with the input "YAKINIKU".
It checks if the length of the string s is less than 4. Since it is 6, it proceeds to the next step.
It extracts the first 4 characters of the string s using the substring() method and stores it in variable s2.
It then checks if the value of s2 is equal to "YAKI". Since it is not, it prints "No" as output.
<<<Output>>>
No
