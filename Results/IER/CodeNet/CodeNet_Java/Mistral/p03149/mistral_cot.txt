 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N[] is initialized with 4 integers, which are read from the user using Scanner class. The integers are stored in the array N[] in the order of 1, 7, 9, 4.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 3 to check each integer in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable N[i].
After the loop finishes, it sorts the array N[] in ascending order using Arrays.sort(N) method.
Then it checks if the first element of the sorted array N[] is equal to 1, second element is equal to 4, third element is equal to 7 and fourth element is equal to 9. If all these conditions are met, it sets the variable ans to true.
After that it checks the value of variable ans. If it is true, it prints "YES" otherwise it prints "NO".
<<<Output>>>
NO
