 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable base and K are initialized with 4 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until the value of base is less than 1.
Inside the while loop, it initializes two variables low and high with 0 and base respectively.
Then it enters another while loop and it iterates until the difference between high and low is greater than 1.
Inside this loop, it calculates the value of willNext by taking the average of low and high.
Then it checks if the value of willNext is less than or equal to K*(base - willNext). If it is, it updates the value of low to willNext. Otherwise, it updates the value of high to willNext.
After the inner loop finishes, it updates the value of next with the value of low.
If the value of next is greater than 0, it updates the value of base with next and increments the value of ans. Otherwise, it breaks out of the while loop.
After the while loop finishes, it prints the value of ans as output, which is 2.
