 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 1 according to the input. And variable ind is initialized with 1.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until sc.hasNext() returns false.
Inside the while loop, it calculates the value of variable res using the calc() method.
The calc() method calculates the value of res by subtracting the value of variable a from the value of variable b and adding the value of variable digit.
It then checks if the value of res is equal to the value of variable n. If it is, it breaks out of the while loop.
If the value of res is not equal to the value of variable n, it continues to iterate until it finds the value of res that is equal to the value of variable n.
After the while loop finishes, it prints the value of variable res.
