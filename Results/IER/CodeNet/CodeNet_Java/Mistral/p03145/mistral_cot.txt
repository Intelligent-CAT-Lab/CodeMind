 <<<Analysis>>>
The code prompts the user to enter three integers x, y and z using the Scanner class. The values of x, y and z are then stored in the variables x, y and z respectively.
It then calculates the product of x and y and divides it by 2 and stores the result in the variable (x*y)/2.
It then prints the value of the variable (x*y)/2 using the System.out.println() method.
