 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable S is initialized with the input string "RUDLUDR". The variable li[] is initialized with the string S.split("").
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to li.length-1 to check each element of the array li.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current element of the array li is even or odd. If it is even, it checks if the element is equal to "R", "U" or "D". If it is not, it increments the count variable and breaks out of the loop. If it is odd, it checks if the element is equal to "L", "U" or "D". If it is not, it increments the count variable and breaks out of the loop.
After the loop finishes, it checks if the count variable is equal to 0. If it is, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
