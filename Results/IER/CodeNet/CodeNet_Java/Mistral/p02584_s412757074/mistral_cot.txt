 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable x, variable k and variable d are initialized with 6, 2 and 4 respectively according to the input. And variable rem is initialized with 0.
It enters a if-else block.
Inside the if block, it calculates the value of variable quo by dividing variable x by variable d.
Then it checks if the value of variable k is less than variable quo. If it is, it calculates the value of variable rem by taking the modulo of variable x by variable d.
Then it prints the absolute value of variable x minus k multiplied by d.
Inside the else block, it calculates the value of variable v1 by subtracting variable d from variable rem.
Then it calculates the value of variable rem1 by subtracting variable quo from variable k.
If variable rem1 is even, it prints the absolute value of variable rem.
If variable rem1 is odd, it prints the absolute value of variable v1.
After the if-else block finishes, it prints the value of variable rem.
