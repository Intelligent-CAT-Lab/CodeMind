 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n, variable a and variable b are initialized with 4, 2 and 9 respectively according to the input.
The function solve() takes two parameters, InputStream is and PrintStream os. It creates a Scanner object sc from the InputStream is and uses it to read the input.
It reads the three integers n, a and b from the input and stores them in the respective variables.
Then it calculates the minimum of a * n and b using the Math.min() method and stores the result in a variable.
Finally, it prints the result using the PrintStream os.
