 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable nNum is initialized with -1.
It enters a try-catch block and it reads the input line from the BufferedReader.
It checks if the input line is not null and not empty. If it is not, it tries to parse the input line as an integer and assigns it to variable nNum.
It returns the value of variable nNum, which is 5.
<<<Output>>>
5
