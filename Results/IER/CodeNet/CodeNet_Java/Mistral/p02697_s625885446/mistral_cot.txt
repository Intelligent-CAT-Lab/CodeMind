 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and m are initialized with 4 and 1 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 4 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the value of i and j satisfy the condition (j - i) < n / 2 and m > 0. If it does, it prints the value of i and j separated by a space.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable j as output, which is 5.
<<<Output>>>
5
