 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable input is initialized with the input values `3 8 2` by splitting the input string with space and converting each element to an integer using the `mapToInt` method.
It enters an `IntStream` range closed loop that iterates from the first element of the input array to the second element of the input array.
Inside the loop, it calculates the order of the current integer by subtracting the first element of the input array from it.
Then it checks if the order is less than the third element of the input array or if the difference between the second element and the first element of the input array is less than the order. If either of these conditions is true, it prints the current integer.
After the loop finishes, it prints the output as `3 8 2`.
