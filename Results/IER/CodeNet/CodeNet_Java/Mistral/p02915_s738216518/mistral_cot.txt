 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 2 according to the input.
It enters an if statement and checks if 1<=n && n<=9. Since 2 is less than 9 and greater than 1, the condition is met.
It then calculates the cube of n by multiplying n with itself three times and assigns the result to variable i.
i = 2*2*2 = 8
It then prints the value of variable i, which is 8.
<<<Output>>>
8
