 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the java.util package and creates a Scanner object to read input from the user.
It then reads three integers a, b and c from the user using the nextInt() method of the Scanner object.
It calculates the minimum and maximum values of a and b using the Math.min() and Math.max() methods respectively.
It then calculates the minimum of the minimum value and c and the maximum of the maximum value and c using the Math.min() and Math.max() methods respectively.
Finally, it prints the calculated values using the println() method.
