 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input from the standard input stream and prints the first 8 characters of the string.
It uses a `InputReader` class to read the input and a `OutputStreamWriter` class to write the output.
The `AXXFESTIVAL` class contains a `solve` method that takes three arguments: the test number, the input stream and the output stream.
The `solve` method reads the input string using the `InputReader` class and prints the first 8 characters of the string using the `OutputStreamWriter` class.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is the first 8 characters of the input string.
