The variable a and variable b are initialized with 1 and 21 respectively according to the input. And variable aa and variable bb are calculated by taking the length of the string representation of variable a and variable b respectively.
It enters a series of if-else statements to check the values of aa and bb.
If aa is 1 and bb is 1, it calculates the value of c as 10*a+b which is 10*1+21 which is 21. It then enters a for loop that iterates from 0 to 20 and checks if the square of the current integer is equal to c. Since the square of 0 is 0 and the square of 1 is 1, it prints "Yes" and breaks out of the loop.
The return value of this code block is "Yes".
If aa is 1 and bb is 2, it calculates the value of c as 100*a+b which is 100*1+21 which is 2100. It then enters a for loop that iterates from 0 to 2099 and checks if the square of the current integer is equal to c. Since the square of 0 is 0 and the square of 1 is 1, it prints "Yes" and breaks out of the loop.
The return value of this code block is "Yes".
If aa is 1 and bb is 3, it calculates the value of c as 1000*a+b which is 1000*1+21 which is 21000. It then enters a for loop that iterates from 0 to 20999 and checks if the square of the current integer is equal to c. Since the square of 0 is 0 and the square of 1 is 1, it prints "Yes" and breaks out of the loop.
The return value of this code block is "Yes".
If aa is 2 and bb is 1, it calculates the value of c as 10*a+b which is 10*2+1 which is 21. It then enters a for loop that iterates from 0 to 20 and checks if the square of the current integer is equal to c. Since the square of 0 is 0 and the square of 1 is 1, it prints "Yes" and breaks out of the loop.
The return value of this code block is "Yes".
If aa is 2 and bb is 2, it calculates the value of c as 100*a+b which is 100*2+1 which is 201. It then enters a for loop that iterates from 0 to 199 and checks if the square of the current integer is equal to c. Since the square of 0 is 0 and the square of 1 is 1, it prints "Yes" and breaks out of the loop.
The return value of this code block is "Yes".
If aa is 2 and bb is 3, it calculates the value of c as 1000*a+b which is 1000*2+1 which is 2001. It then enters a for loop that iterates from 0 to 1999 and checks if the square of the current integer is equal to c. Since the square of
