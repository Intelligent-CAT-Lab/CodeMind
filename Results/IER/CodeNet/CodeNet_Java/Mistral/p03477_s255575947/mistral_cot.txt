 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the java.util.Scanner class to read input from the user.
It then creates a Scanner object named sc and reads two integers a and b from the user using the nextInt() method.
It then adds the two integers read from the user and stores the result in variable a.
It then reads two more integers c and d from the user and adds them to store the result in variable b.
It then compares the value of variable a with variable b using the greater than operator (>).
If variable a is greater than variable b, it prints "Left".
If variable a is equal to variable b, it prints "Balanced".
If variable a is less than variable b, it prints "Right".
In this case, variable a is 11 and variable b is 10, so the output will be "Left".
<<<Output>>>
Left
