 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable total is initialized with 100000 and variable weeks is initialized with 5.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 4 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable yield.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the yield by multiplying the current total with 5% and then it checks if the yield is divisible by 1000. If it is, it adds the yield to the total sum. If it is not, it adds the yield to the total sum after rounding it to the nearest 1000 and adding 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable sum as output, which is 100000.
<<<Output>>>
100000
