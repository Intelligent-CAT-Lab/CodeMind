 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads an integer N from the standard input using the Scanner class.
It then prints the value of N minus the remainder of N divided by 500.
The remainder of N divided by 500 is calculated by using the modulo operator (%).
The remainder is 0 because 5700 is divisible by 500.
Therefore, the output of the code will be 5700 - 0 = 5700.
<<<Output>>>
5700
