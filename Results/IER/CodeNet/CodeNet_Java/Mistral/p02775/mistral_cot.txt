 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 36 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 35 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of dp[i][0], dp[i][1] and dp[i][2] using the following formula:
dp[i][0] = Math.min(dp[i - 1][0], dp[i - 1][2]) + 9 - c;
dp[i][1] = Math.min(dp[i - 1][0] + 1, dp[i - 1][1]) + c;
dp[i][2] = Math.min(dp[i - 1][0] + 1, dp[i - 1][1]) + c + 1;
where c is the digit of the current integer i.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable dp[35][0], dp[35][1] and dp[35][2] as output, which are 1, 1 and 1 respectively.
