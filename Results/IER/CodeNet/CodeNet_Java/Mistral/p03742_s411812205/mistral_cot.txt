 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable x and variable y are initialized with 2 and 1 respectively according to the input.
It enters an if-else-if statement to check the value of variable y.
If y is between 0 and x-2, it assigns 1 to variable ans.
If y is between x-1 and x+1, it assigns 0 to variable ans.
If y is greater than x+2, it assigns 1 to variable ans.
After the if-else-if statement, it prints the value of variable ans using PrintWriter.
Since y is less than x-2, it assigns 0 to variable ans and prints "Brown" as output.
<<<Output>>>
Brown
