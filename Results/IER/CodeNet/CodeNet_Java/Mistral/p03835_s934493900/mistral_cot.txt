 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable k and variable s are initialized with 2 and 2 respectively according to the input. And variable count is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer x in this range.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer y in this range.
It calculates the value of variable z by subtracting the current values of x and y from variable s.
Then it checks if the calculated variable z is greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 2. If it is, it increments the value of variable count.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable count as output, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>
3
