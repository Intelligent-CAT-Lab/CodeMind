 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 4 and variable x is initialized with 4.
It enters a if-else statement and it checks if x is equal to 1 or 2\*N-1. If it is, it prints "No" and returns.
Otherwise, it calls the solve method with N and x as arguments.
The solve method returns an array of integers.
It first checks if N is equal to 2. If it is, it initializes the array ans with the values [1,2,3].
If N is not equal to 2, it initializes the array ans with the values [1,x,2\*N-1,2].
Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2\*N-2.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current element of the array ans is equal to x. If it is, it increments the value of elm by 1.
If the current element of the array ans is equal to 0, it sets the current element of the array ans to the value of elm.
After the loop finishes, it returns the array ans.
<<<Output>>>
[1, 4, 7, 2]
