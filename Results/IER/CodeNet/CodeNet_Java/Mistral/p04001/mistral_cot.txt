 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable S is initialized with the input "125".
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable N.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger N[i] by extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum is equal to 1. If it is, it prints the value of variable i as output, which is 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable sum as output, which is 1.
