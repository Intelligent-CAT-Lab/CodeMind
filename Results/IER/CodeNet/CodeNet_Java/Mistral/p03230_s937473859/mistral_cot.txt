 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 3 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 3 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of i * (i + 1) / 2 and checks if it is equal to 3.
Since i * (i + 1) / 2 = 3 * 4 / 2 = 6, the condition is met when i is 3.
It then creates a 2D array of size 4x3 and initializes it with the values 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20.
It then prints the value of i + 1, which is 4.
It then prints the 2D array in the format of rows.
It returns from the function.
