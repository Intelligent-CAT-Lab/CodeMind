 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N and P are initialized with 3 and 24 respectively.
The function solve() is called which first calls the function getPrimeFactorization(P) to get the prime factorization of P.
The prime factorization of P is {2, 2, 3, 3}.
The function solve() then calculates the output by multiplying the prime factorization of P with the number N.
The output is calculated as follows:
output = 2^2 * 2^2 * 3^2 * 3^1 = 144
<<<Output>>>
144
