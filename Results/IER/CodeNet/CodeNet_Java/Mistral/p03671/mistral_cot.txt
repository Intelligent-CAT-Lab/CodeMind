 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the java.util package and creates a Scanner object to read input from the user.
It then reads three integers a, b and c from the user using the nextInt() method of the Scanner object.
It creates an integer array sum and initializes it with the values of a, b and c.
It then uses the Arrays.sort() method to sort the sum array in ascending order.
Finally, it prints the sum of the first two elements of the sorted array using the + operator.
