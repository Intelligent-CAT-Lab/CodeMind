 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and variable k are initialized with 7 and 4 respectively according to the input. And variable ans is initialized with n.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until num is less than 0.
Inside the while loop, it calculates the absolute value of num and assigns it to variable num2. Then it assigns the minimum value between ans and num2 to ans.
Then it subtracts k from num and assigns the result to num.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 1.
