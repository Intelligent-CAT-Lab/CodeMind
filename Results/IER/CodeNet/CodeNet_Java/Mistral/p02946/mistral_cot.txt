 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable K and variable X are initialized with 3 and 7 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from X - K + 1 to X + K - 1 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current integer i is not equal to X + K - 1. If it is not, it prints the integer i with a space. If it is equal to X + K - 1, it prints the integer i without a space.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl output, which is 3 7 10 13 16 19 22 25 28 31 34 37.
<<<Output>>>
