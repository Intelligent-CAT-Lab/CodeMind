The variable n, variable A and variable B are initialized with 4, 1 and 2 respectively according to the input. And variable K is initialized with 5.
The variable comb is an array of size n+1 and it is initialized with 1 at index 0. It then enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to n+1 to calculate the value of comb[i] using the formula comb[i] = comb[i-1] * (n - i + 1) % MOD * pow(i, MOD - 2) % MOD.
Then it calculates the value of q = K + A.
It enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to n. It subtracts A from q in each iteration and checks if q is divisible by B. If it is, it calculates the value of y = q / B and checks if y is within the range [0, n]. If it is, it calculates the value of ans = (ans + comb[x] * comb[(int)y] % MOD) % MOD.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable ans as output, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
