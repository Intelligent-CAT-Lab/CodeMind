 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and variable k are initialized with 3 and 10 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable x.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable m by multiplying 2 with itself k times.
Then it calculates the winRatio by adding the value of 1 divided by n divided by m to the winRatio variable.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable winRatio as output, which is 0.01.
<<<Output>>>
0.01
