 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four integer inputs from the user using the Scanner class. The inputs are stored in variables a, b, c and d.
It then checks if the absolute difference between any two of the variables is less than or equal to the third variable.
It does this by checking if the absolute difference between a and c is less than or equal to d, or if the absolute difference between a and b is less than or equal to d and the absolute difference between b and c is less than or equal to d.
If either of these conditions is true, it prints "Yes" to the console. Otherwise, it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
