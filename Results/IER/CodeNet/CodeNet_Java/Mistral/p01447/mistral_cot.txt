 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 8 according to the input.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until n is greater than 1.
Inside the while loop, it calculates the new value of n by adding 0 if n is divisible by 3, otherwise it adds 3 - n % 3.
Then it divides n by 3 and decrements the count variable.
The loop continues until n is 1, at which point the count variable is printed as output.
<<<Output>>>
