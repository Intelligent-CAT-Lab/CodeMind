The variable N is initialized with 6 according to the input. And variable 高原, variable 盆地, variable 山腹, variable 峰, variable 窪地 are initialized with 0.
And variable a is initialized with an array of size 6.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 5 to check each integer a[i] in this range.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current integer a[i] is equal to the previous integer a[i-1]. If it is, it skips the current iteration and moves to the next one.
Otherwise, it enters another for loop and it iterates from i+1 to N-1 to check each integer a[k] in this range.
Inside the inner for loop, it checks if the current integer a[k] is equal to the next integer a[k+1]. If it is, it breaks out of the inner for loop.
Then it checks the conditions to increment the variables 高原, 盆地, 山腹, 峰, 窪地.
After the inner for loop finishes, it prints the final values of the variables 高原, 盆地, 山腹, 峰, 窪地 as output, which are 1 1 1 1 1.
<<<Output>>>
1 1 1 1 1
