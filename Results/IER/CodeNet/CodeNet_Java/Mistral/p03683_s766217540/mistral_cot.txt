 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and variable m are initialized with 2 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable d.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of ans by multiplying all the integers from 1 to i and then multiplying it again by i.
Then it checks if the value of ans is greater than or equal to 1000000007. If it is, it takes the modulo of ans with 1000000007.
It then checks if n is equal to m. If it is, it multiplies ans by 2. Otherwise, it multiplies ans by the maximum of n and m.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 4.
<<<Output>>>
4
