 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first reads a string input from the user using the Scanner class. It then converts the string to a character array using the toCharArray() method.
It then initializes an integer array last with all elements set to -1.
It then iterates through the characters in the string using a for loop. For each character, it subtracts 'a' from the ASCII value of the character to get the index of the character in the alphabet.
If the index of the character is already in the last array and the difference between the current index and the last index is less than 3, it prints the last index + 1 and the current index + 1 separated by a space.
If the index of the character is not in the last array, it sets the index of the character in the last array to the current index.
After the loop finishes, if no three consecutive characters are found in the string, it prints -1 -1.
<<<Output>>>
-1 -1
