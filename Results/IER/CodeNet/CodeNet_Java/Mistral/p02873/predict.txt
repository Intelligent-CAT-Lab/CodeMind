The return value of the code is the sum of the squares of all integers from 1 to n plus the sum of the squares of all integers from 1 to n plus 1 if the current value of variable curr is greater than the value of variable cnt. Otherwise, it is the sum of the squares of all integers from 1 to n plus 1.
In this case, the return value of the code is 100.
