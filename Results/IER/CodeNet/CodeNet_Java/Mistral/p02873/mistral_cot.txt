The variable n is initialized with the length of the input string str. The variable sum is initialized with 0. The variable ptr is initialized with 0. The variable cnt is initialized with 0. The variable curr is initialized with 0.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until ptr is less than n.
Inside the while loop, it checks if the current character of the string str is '>'. If it is, it enters another while loop and it iterates until ptr is less than n and the current character is '>'. It increments the variable cnt for each '>' character it encounters.
Then it checks if the current value of variable curr is greater than the value of variable cnt. If it is, it adds the value of variable curr plus the sum of the squares of all integers from 1 to cnt to the variable sum. If it is not, it adds the sum of the squares of all integers from 1 to cnt plus 1 to the variable sum.
After the inner while loop finishes, it resets the variables curr and cnt to 0.
If the current character of the string str is not '>', it adds the current value of variable curr to the variable sum and increments the variable curr and ptr.
After the while loop finishes, it adds the current value of variable curr to the variable sum if the last character of the string str is '<'.
Then it prints the final value of variable sum as output.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is the sum of the squares of all integers from 1 to n plus the sum of the squares of all integers from 1 to n plus 1 if the current value of variable curr is greater than the value of variable cnt. Otherwise, it is the sum of the squares of all integers from 1 to n plus 1.
In this case, the return value of the code is 100.
