 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable K is initialized with 15 according to the input.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until the size of the priority queue is equal to K.
Inside the while loop, it creates a new set of unique numbers by iterating over the set of numbers and applying a transformation to each number.
The transformation is done by converting the number to a string, extracting the last digit of the string, and then adding the digit to the string to form a new number.
Then it checks if the new number is already in the set or not. If it is not, it adds it to the set and the priority queue.
After the loop finishes, it removes the first K-1 elements from the priority queue and prints the last element of the priority queue, which is 15.
<<<Output>>>
15
