 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized with 5, 14 and 80 respectively according to the input. And variable sum is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from a to b to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable c.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger c is divisible by i by using the modulo operator (%). If it is divisible, it increments the variable sum.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable sum as output, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
