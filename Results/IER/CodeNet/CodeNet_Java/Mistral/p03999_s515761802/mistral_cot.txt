 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized with "125" according to the input.
It enters a dfs function and it iterates from 0 to 4 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable depth.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable nowCharNum by extracting the current digit of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum is equal to 125. If it is, it returns the current value of variable sum.
After the loop finishes, it returns 0 as there is no path that leads to the sum 125.
<<<Output>>>
0
