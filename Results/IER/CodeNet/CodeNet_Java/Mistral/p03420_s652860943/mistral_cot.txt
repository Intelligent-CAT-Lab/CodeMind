 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N and variable K are initialized with 5 and 2 respectively according to the input. And variable ans is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 5 to check each integer alpha in this range. The value of variable alpha is also passed to variable b.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable n by dividing the difference between N and K by b.
Then it calculates the value of ans by multiplying n and alpha and adding it to the previous value of ans.
After the loop finishes, it checks if the value of K+n*b+alpha-1 is less than or equal to N. If it is, it calculates the difference between K+n*b+alpha-1 and K+n*b and adds it to the value of ans.
After the loop finishes, it checks if the value of K is 0. If it is, it subtracts N from the value of ans.
Finally, it prints the value of ans as output, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
