The variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized with 2, 0 and 3 respectively according to the input.
It enters an if statement and it checks if a*b is greater than c. If it is, it prints 0 and exits the program.
Since a*b is 0, the condition is not met and the program continues to the next step.
It subtracts a*b from c to get the value of c-a*b, which is 3.
It calculates the value of d by adding a and subtracting 1, which is 2.
It creates a BigInteger object bi and initializes it with the value 1.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2.
Inside the for loop, it multiplies bi with the value of (d-i) and then divides it by the value of (i+1) for each iteration.
After the loop finishes, it prints the value of bi.toString() as output, which is 1.
