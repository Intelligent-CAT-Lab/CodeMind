 <<<Analysis>>>
The program takes two integer inputs x and y from the user. The program then creates an instance of the Main class and calls its gcd method with the values of x and y as arguments.
The gcd method takes two integer arguments x and y and recursively calls itself with the value of y and the remainder of x divided by y as arguments until y becomes 0. At that point, the method returns the value of x.
The program then prints the return value of the gcd method, which is 6.
<<<Output>>>
6
