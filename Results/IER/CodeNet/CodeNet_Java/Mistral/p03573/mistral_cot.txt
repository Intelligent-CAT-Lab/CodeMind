 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integer inputs A, B and C from the user using the Scanner class.
It then checks if A is equal to B using an if-else statement. If A is equal to B, it prints the value of C.
If A is not equal to B, it checks if B is equal to C using another if-else statement. If B is equal to C, it prints the value of A.
If neither of the above conditions are met, it prints the value of B.
In this case, the input values are 5, 7 and 5. Since 5 is not equal to 7, it checks if 7 is equal to 5. Since 7 is not equal to 5, it checks if 5 is equal to 7. Since 5 is not equal to 7, it prints the value of B, which is 5.
<<<Output>>>
5
