The variable n is initialized with 5 according to the input. And variable money is initialized with 100000.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 5 to 0 to check each integer n in this range. The value of variable n is also passed to variable money.
Inside the for loop, it multiplies the current value of money by 1.05 to increase it by 5% and then checks if the last digit of money is greater than 0. If it is, it divides the current value of money by 1000, adds 1 to the quotient and then multiplies the result by 1000 to get the same value with the last digit removed.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable money as output, which is 105000.
<<<Output>>>
105000
