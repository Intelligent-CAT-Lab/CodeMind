 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable word is initialized with the input "3776".
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 3775 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger i is equal to the next interger i+1. If it is, it sets flag to true and breaks out of the loop.
After the loop finishes, it checks the value of flag. Since flag is not set to true, it prints "Good" as output.
<<<Output>>>
Good
