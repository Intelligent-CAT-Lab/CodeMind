 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n, variable a and variable b are initialized with 8, 3 and 4 respectively according to the input.
It enters a main method and it creates an object of FastScanner class.
It calls the nextLong() method of FastScanner class to read the input.
It calculates the value of ans by dividing n by the sum of a and b, then multiplying the result by a and adding the minimum of a and n%(a+b).
The condition is met when n is 8, a is 3 and b is 4.
After the calculation, it prints the value of ans as output, which is 14.
<<<Output>>>
14
