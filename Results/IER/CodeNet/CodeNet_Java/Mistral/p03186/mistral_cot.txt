 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable A, variable B and variable C are initialized with 3, 1 and 4 respectively according to the input.
The variable max is initialized with the sum of variable B and variable C.
It enters an if-else statement to check if variable C is greater than or equal to variable B. If it is, it subtracts variable B from variable C and assigns the result to variable C. If it is not, it subtracts variable C from variable B and assigns the result to variable C.
It enters another if-else statement to check if variable C is greater than or equal to variable A. If it is, it subtracts variable A from variable C and assigns the result to variable C. If it is not, it assigns 0 to variable C.
Finally, it prints the value of variable C if it is greater than 0, otherwise it prints the value of variable max.
The condition is met when variable C is 4, variable B is 1 and variable A is 3.
After the condition is met, it prints 4.

4
