 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized with the input "SAT". The variable a is initialized with 1.
It enters an if-else statement to check the value of variable s.
Since s is not equal to "SUN", "MON", "TUE", "WED", "THU" or "FRI", the else block is executed.
The return value of the code is 1, as the variable a is not updated in the else block.
<<<Output>>>
