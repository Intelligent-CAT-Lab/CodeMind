The variable num is an array of integers that are passed as input. The array contains the following elements: 1, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 9, 27, 81, 243, 729, 16, 64, 256, 1024, 25, 125, 625, 36, 216, 49, 343, 64, 512, 81, 729, 100, 1000, 121, 144, 169, 196, 225, 256, 289, 324, 361, 400, 441, 484, 529, 576, 625, 676, 729, 784, 841, 900, 961.
The variable X is an integer that is passed as input and is read from the user.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from the last element of the array to the first element of the array.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the maximum value of the array by comparing the current element with variable X. If the current element is less than or equal to variable X, it updates the maximum value of the array.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable max as output, which is 10.
