 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads an integer input from the user using the Scanner class and stores it in the variable i.
It then uses the variable i to access the element of the array ans at index i.
Since the input is 1, the element at index 1 of the array ans is accessed and printed as output.
<<<Output>>>
