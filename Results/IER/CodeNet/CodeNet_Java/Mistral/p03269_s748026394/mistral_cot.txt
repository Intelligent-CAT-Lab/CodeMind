The variable l is initialized with 4 according to the input.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until l is 0.
Inside the while loop, it calculates the value of cval by repeatedly subtracting cval from l and checking if the result is less than or equal to 0. If it is, it breaks out of the loop.
It then adds the value of cval to the variable nn and increments cval by 2.
It then adds the value of cval to the variable nn and increments cval by 2.
