 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable K, variable A and variable B are initialized with 4000, 2000 and 500 respectively according to the input.
The function `help` takes three parameters K, A and B and returns an integer value.
It first checks if A is less than or equal to B. If it is, it returns 1 if A is greater than or equal to K, otherwise it returns -1.
If A is greater than K, it calculates the difference between A and B and stores it in variable dif.
Then it calculates the value of t by dividing the difference between K and A by dif and adding 1 if the remainder is 0.
Finally, it returns 2*t+1.
<<<Output>>>
-1
