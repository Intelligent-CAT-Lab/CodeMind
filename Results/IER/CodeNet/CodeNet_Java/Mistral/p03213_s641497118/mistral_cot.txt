 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 9 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to 9 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable c.
Inside the for loop, it calls the factor method and passes variable c and array a as arguments.
The factor method uses a while loop to find the greatest common divisor of variable c and each integer i from 2 to 100. It increments the value of array a[i] by 1 for each iteration of the while loop.
It returns the value of variable c after the while loop finishes.
After the for loop finishes, it prints the value of variable c as output, which is 9.
<<<Output>>>
9
