 <<<Analysis>>>
The program prompts the user to enter two integers a and b using the Scanner class. The program then compares the two integers using if-else statements.
If a is greater than b, it prints "a > b".
If a is less than b, it prints "a < b".
If a is equal to b, it prints "a == b".
The program then closes the scanner.
<<<Output>>>
a > b
