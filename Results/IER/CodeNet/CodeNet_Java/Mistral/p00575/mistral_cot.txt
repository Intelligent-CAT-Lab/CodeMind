 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized with 3, 0 and 10 respectively according to the input.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until the value of variable cnt is less than 10.
Inside the while loop, it increments the value of variable i by 1 and adds the value of variable a to variable cnt.
Then it checks if the value of variable i is divisible by 7. If it is, it adds the value of variable b to variable cnt.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable i as output, which is 14.
<<<Output>>>
14
