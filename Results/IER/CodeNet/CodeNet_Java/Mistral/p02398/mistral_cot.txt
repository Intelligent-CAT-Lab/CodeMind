 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable x, variable y and variable z are initialized with 5, 14 and 80 respectively according to the input. And variable t is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from x to y to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable z.
Inside the for loop, it checks if z is divisible by i by using the modulo operator (%). If it is divisible, it increments the value of variable t.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable t as output, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>
3
