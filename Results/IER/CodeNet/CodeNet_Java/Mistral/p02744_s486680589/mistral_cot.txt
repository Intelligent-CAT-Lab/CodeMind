The variable N is initialized with 1 according to the input. And variable s is initialized with "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz".
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 25 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable tmp.
Inside the for loop, it creates a new ArrayList<String> tmp by adding the current interger i to the ArrayList<String> list.
Then it calls the dfs method with the new ArrayList<String> tmp and 0 as the maximum value.
The dfs method is a recursive method that performs a depth-first search on the given graph. It takes two arguments: a list of nodes and a maximum depth.
The method first checks if the list size is equal to N. If it is, it adds the current list to the output list.
Then it iterates from 0 to the maximum depth and for each value of i, it creates a new ArrayList<String> tmp by adding the current interger i to the ArrayList<String> list.
It then calls the dfs method with the new ArrayList<String> tmp and i + 1 as the maximum value.
The dfs method continues to call itself recursively until it reaches the maximum depth.
After the for loop finishes, it prints the output list.
