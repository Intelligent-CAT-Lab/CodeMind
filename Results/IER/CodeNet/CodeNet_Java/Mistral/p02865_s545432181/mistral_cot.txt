 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable a is initialized with 4 according to the input.
It enters an if-else statement to check if the value of variable a is even or odd.
Since the value of variable a is 4, which is an even number, the if block is executed.
Inside the if block, it calculates the value of variable ans by dividing the value of variable a by 2 and then subtracting 1 from it.
The value of variable ans is 1.
Then it prints the value of variable ans as output, which is 1.
<<<Output>>>
1
