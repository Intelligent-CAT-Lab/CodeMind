 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 3 according to the input.
The function fib() is called with the value of n as argument.
Inside the function, it first checks if the value of n is already stored in memo array. If it is, it returns the value stored in memo array.
If n is 0 or 1, it returns 1.
If n is not 0 or 1, it recursively calls the function fib() with n-1 and n-2 as arguments and adds the returned values to memo array.
It returns the value stored in memo array.
