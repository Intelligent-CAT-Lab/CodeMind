 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable H and variable W are initialized with 4 and 5 respectively according to the input.
It enters a conditional statement to check if H is greater than W. Since H is 4 and W is 5, the condition is not met.
It then enters another conditional statement to check if H is not equal to 1. Since H is 4, the condition is met.
It calculates the output by multiplying the sum of (W+1)/2 and (H+1)/2 and adding the product of W/2 and H/2.
The output is calculated as (5+1)/2*4 + (5/2)*4 = 16.
<<<Output>>>
