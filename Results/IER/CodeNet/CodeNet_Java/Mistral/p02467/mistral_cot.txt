 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 12 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to the square root of n to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it checks if n is divisible by i by using the modulo operator (%). If it is, it divides n by i and prints the value of i.
After the loop finishes, it prints the value of n.
The output of the code will be 12 6 3 2 1.
<<<Output>>>
12 6 3 2 1
