 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integer inputs from the user using the Scanner class. The first input is stored in variable str1 and the second input is stored in variable str2.
Then it calculates the sum of the two inputs and stores it in variable kei.
It then checks if the value of kei is less than 24. If it is, it prints the value of kei. If it is not, it subtracts 24 from kei and prints the result.
In this case, the value of str1 is 9 and the value of str2 is 12. So the value of kei is 9 + 12 = 21.
Since 21 is less than 24, it prints the value of kei, which is 21.
<<<Output>>>
21
