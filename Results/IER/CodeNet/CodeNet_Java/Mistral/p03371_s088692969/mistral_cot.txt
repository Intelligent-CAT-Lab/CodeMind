 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable A, variable B and variable C are initialized with 1500, 2000 and 1600 respectively according to the input. And variable X and variable Y are initialized with 3 and 2 respectively.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 3 to check each integer X in this range. The value of variable X is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the result of each method by passing the values of A, B, C, X and Y to the methods.
The method resultA calculates the result of multiplying X and Y with A and B respectively.
The method resultB calculates the result of buying A and B with C and X respectively.
The method resultC calculates the result of buying A and B with C and X respectively.
Then it prints the fianl value of the method that returns the smallest result among the three methods.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of the method that returns the smallest result among the three methods, which is 1000.
<<<Output>>>
1000
