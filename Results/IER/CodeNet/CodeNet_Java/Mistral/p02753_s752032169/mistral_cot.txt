 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first creates a Scanner object to read input from the user. It then reads the input string S from the user and splits it into an array of strings called word[] using the split() method.
It then initializes an empty string called result.
It then checks if the first three elements of the array are all equal to "A". If they are, it sets the result to "No". If not, it sets the result to "Yes".
Finally, it prints the value of the result variable.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
