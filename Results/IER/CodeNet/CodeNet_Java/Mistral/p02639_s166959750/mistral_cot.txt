 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable a[] is initialized with the input values [0, 2, 3, 4, 5] using the FastScanner class.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 4 to check each integer a[i] in this range.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current integer a[i] is equal to 0. If it is, it assigns the value of i+1 to variable x and breaks out of the loop.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable x as output, which is 1.
