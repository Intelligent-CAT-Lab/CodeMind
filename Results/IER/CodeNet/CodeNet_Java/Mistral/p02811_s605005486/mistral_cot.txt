 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 2 and variable m is initialized with 900.
The program then enters a for loop that iterates from 1 to n.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable sum by adding the digits of the current integer i.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum is equal to m. If it is, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable answer as output, which is "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
