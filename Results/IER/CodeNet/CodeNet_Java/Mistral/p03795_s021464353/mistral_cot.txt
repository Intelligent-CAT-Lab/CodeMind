The variable N is initialized with 20 according to the input.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until the value of variable N is 0.
Inside the while loop, it calculates the value of variable x by multiplying N with 800.
Then it calculates the value of variable y by dividing N with 15 and multiplying the result with 200.
It prints the value of variable x - y as output.
The condition is met when N is 0.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable x - y as output, which is 0.
<<<Output>>>
