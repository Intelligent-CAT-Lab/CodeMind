 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and variable m are initialized with 2 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It enters an if-else statement to check the difference between n and m.
If the difference is greater than 1, it assigns 0 to variable result.
If the difference is equal to 1, it calls the function factorialsModBillion(n, m) and assigns the returned value to variable result.
If the difference is 0, it calls the function factorialsModBillion(n, m) and assigns the returned value to variable result. Then it multiplies the result by 2 and takes the modulo with 1000000007L.
After the if-else statement finishes, it print the fianl value of variable result as output.
<<<Output>>>
0
