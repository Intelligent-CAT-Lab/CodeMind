 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n, variable a and variable b are initialized with 8, 3 and 4 respectively according to the input. And variable sum is initialized with a + b = 11.
It calculates the remainder of n divided by sum using the modulo operator % and stores it in variable mod. It calculates the quotient of n divided by sum using the division operator / and stores it in variable div.
Then it prints the value of div * a + Math.min(mod, a) as output.
The value of div * a is 24 and the value of Math.min(mod, a) is 4.
So the final output is 24 + 4 = 28.
<<<Output>>>
28
