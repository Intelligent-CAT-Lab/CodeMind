 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and k are initialized with 6 and 3 respectively according to the input.
The variable total is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 2^3-1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calls the function search(num, count, max) with num, count and max as arguments.
The function search(num, count, max) first checks if count is 0, if it is, it returns 1.
Then it checks if dp contains key num and key count. If it does, it returns the value associated with that key.
If dp does not contain key num and key count, it initializes a variable total to 0.
Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to num * 2^count-1. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calls the function search(num \* i, count-1, max) with num \* i, count-1 and max as arguments.
It continues this process until it reaches the end of the for loop.
After the for loop finishes, it returns the value of variable total.
