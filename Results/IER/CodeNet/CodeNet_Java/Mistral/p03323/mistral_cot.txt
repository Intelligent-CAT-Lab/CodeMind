 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers a and b from the user using the Scanner class. The first integer a is read using the `nextInt()` method of the Scanner class and stored in the variable a. The second integer b is also read using the `nextInt()` method of the Scanner class and stored in the variable b.
Then it checks if both a and b are less than or equal to 8 using the `<=` operator. If both conditions are true, it prints "Yay!" to the console. Otherwise, it prints ":(" to the console.
<<<Output>>>
Yay!
