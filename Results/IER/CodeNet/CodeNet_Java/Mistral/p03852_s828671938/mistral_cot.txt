 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input from the user using the `Scanner` class and stores it in the variable `c`.
Then it uses the `matches()` method to check if the string `c` contains any vowels. The regular expression `[aiueo]` is used to match any of the vowels.
If the string `c` contains any vowels, it prints "vowel" to the console. Otherwise, it prints "consonant" to the console.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is "vowel" because the input string "a" contains the vowel "a".
