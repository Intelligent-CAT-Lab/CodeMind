 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized with 1.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until upper - lower > 1.
Inside the while loop, it calculates the value of upper and lower by dividing s by 10 and 10000000000000000000 respectively.
It enters another while loop and it iterates until upper - lower > 1.
Inside the inner while loop, it calculates the value of med by taking the average of upper and lower.
It calls the count function with med as an argument and it stores the returned value in variable dist.
It checks if dist is greater than s, if it is, it updates the value of upper to med.
It checks if dist is less than s, if it is, it updates the value of lower to med.
It checks if dist is equal to s, it updates the value of upper to med-1 and lower to med-1.
After the while loop finishes, it enters another while loop and it iterates until cur < s.
Inside the while loop, it checks if cur is greater than or equal to (s + 20), if it is, it prints a new line and exits the loop.
If cur is less than s, it continues to the next iteration.
If cur is greater than or equal to (s + 20), it prints a new line and exits the loop.
It returns null.
