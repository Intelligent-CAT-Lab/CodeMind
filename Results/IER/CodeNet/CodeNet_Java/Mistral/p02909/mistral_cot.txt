 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input from the user using the Scanner class. The variable str is assigned the value of the input string.
It then checks if the value of str is equal to "Sunny" using the first if statement. Since the value of str is not equal to "Sunny", the first if statement is skipped and the program moves to the next if statement.
The second if statement checks if the value of str is equal to "Cloudy". Since the value of str is not equal to "Cloudy", the second if statement is skipped and the program moves to the next if statement.
The third if statement checks if the value of str is equal to "Rainy". Since the value of str is not equal to "Rainy", the third if statement is skipped and the program exits.
<<<Output>>>
Cloudy
