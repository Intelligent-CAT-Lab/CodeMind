 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 0 and variable ans is initialized with 0.
It enters a dfs function which takes a string parameter val.
Inside the dfs function, it checks if the value of the string is greater than n. If it is, it returns.
Then it checks if the string contains the characters "3", "5" and "7". If it does, it increments the value of variable ans.
Then it calls the dfs function recursively with three different string parameters, val + "3", val + "5" and val + "7".
After the recursive calls finish, it returns to the main function and prints the value of variable ans.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is 1.
