The variable n, variable a, variable b, variable c and variable d are initialized with 5, 1, 5, 2 and 4 respectively according to the input. And variable centerCD is calculated as (c + d) / 2 = (5 + 4) / 2 = 3.5.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to n-1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger num by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if a + d1 - d2 <= b && b <= a + d1 + d2 where d1 = centerCD * i - centerCD * (n - 1 - i) and d2 = rCD * (n - 1).
If the condition is met, it adds the current interger i to variable answer. The condition is met when i is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable answer as output, which is 16.
<<<Output>>>
16
