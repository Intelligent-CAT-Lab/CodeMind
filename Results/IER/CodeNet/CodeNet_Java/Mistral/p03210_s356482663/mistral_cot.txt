 <<<Analysis>>>
The code prompts the user to enter an integer value using the Scanner class. The entered value is stored in the variable age.
Then it checks if the value of age is equal to 3, 5 or 7 using an if-else statement. If the condition is true, it prints "YES" otherwise it prints "NO".
<<<Output>>>
NO
