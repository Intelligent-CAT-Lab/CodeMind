 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and variable k are initialized with 3 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It enters an if-else statement to check if k is even or odd.
If k is even, it calculates the cube of n by multiplying n by itself three times and stores it in variable ans. Then it calculates the cube of n again by multiplying n by itself three times and adds it to variable ans. Finally, it adds the cube of n plus the cube of n divided by k to variable ans.
If k is odd, it calculates the cube of n by multiplying n by itself three times and stores it in variable ans.
After the if-else statement finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 12.
<<<Output>>>
12
