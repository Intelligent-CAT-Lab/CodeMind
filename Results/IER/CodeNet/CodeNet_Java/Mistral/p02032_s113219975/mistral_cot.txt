 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 18 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to the square root of n to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it checks if n is divisible by i. If it is, it adds the value of i and the value of n divided by i to the set nums.
After the loop finishes, it initializes two variables max and min to 0 and 1 respectively.
It enters another for loop and it iterates over the set nums. For each element x in the set, it checks if the value of x is already in the set used. If it is, it continues to the next iteration. Otherwise, it increments the variable min and enters another for loop to check each integer i from 2 to the square root of -x. If -x is divisible by i, it adds the value of i and the value of -x divided by i to the set used.
After the second for loop finishes, it checks if the variable min is equal to 0. If it is, it increments it to 1.
Finally, it prints the value of min and max.
