 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N and variable K are initialized with 5 and 2 respectively according to the input. And variable a and variable b are initialized with 1.0 and 0.0 respectively.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 4 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable pa.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the point pa by multiplying variable K with the cosine of 2π/N and the sine of 2π/N.
Then it calculates the point pb by multiplying variable (1 - K) with the cosine of 2π/N and the sine of 2π/N.
It enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 4 to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable a.
It enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 4 to check each integer k in this range. The value of variable k is also passed to variable b.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the point intersection of line a-b and pa-pb by calling the function lineIntersection.
Then it calculates the point ai and bi by subtracting the intersection point from point a and point b respectively.
Then it calculates the area of the triangle formed by point a, point b and intersection point by multiplying the determinant of ai and bi.
After the for loops finishes, it print the fianl value of variable area as output, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
