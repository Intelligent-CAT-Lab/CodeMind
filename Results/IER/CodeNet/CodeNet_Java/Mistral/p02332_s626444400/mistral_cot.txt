 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N and K are initialized with 2 and 3 respectively according to the input. And variable ans is initialized with 1.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable kosu.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of ans by multiplying the current interger i with kosu and then taking the modulo with 1000000007.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 1.
