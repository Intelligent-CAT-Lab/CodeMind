 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable S is initialized with the input "akasaka". The function check(S) is called three times with three different substrings of the input string S.
The first substring is the entire string S, the second substring is the first half of the string S and the third substring is the last half of the string S.
The function check(S) checks if the first and last characters of the substring are the same. If they are not, it returns false and the variable key is set to false.
The variable anskey is set to true if all three substrings pass the check(S) function.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
