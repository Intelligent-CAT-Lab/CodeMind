 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four input values, x1, y1, x2 and y2, which are all doubles. It uses the `Scanner` class to read these values from the standard input stream.
It then calculates the distance between the two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) using the distance formula `sqrt((x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2)`.
The result is printed to the console using the `System.out.printf()` method with a precision of 8 decimal places.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is 2.00000000.
