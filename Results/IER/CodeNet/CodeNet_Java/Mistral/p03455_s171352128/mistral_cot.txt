 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable testNumber is initialized with 3 according to the input.
It enters a class ABC086AProduct and its solve method is called.
Inside the solve method, it reads the first two integers from the input using the Scanner class and stores them in variable a and variable b respectively.
Then it calculates the product of a and b and stores it in variable product.
Then it checks if the product is even or odd by checking if the product is divisible by 2.
If the product is even, it prints "Even" to the output. Otherwise, it prints "Odd" to the output.
In this case, the product of 3 and 4 is 12 which is even, so it prints "Even" to the output.
<<<Output>>>
