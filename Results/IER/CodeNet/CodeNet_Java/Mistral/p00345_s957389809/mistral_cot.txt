 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable o, p, l and d are initialized with -1, -1, -1 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the input string in -1 steps.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character is a dot (.) and if it is, it assigns the index of the dot to variable o.
It also checks if the current character is an opening parenthesis (() and if it is, it assigns the index of the opening parenthesis to variable p.
It also checks if the current character is a closing parenthesis ()) and if it is, it assigns the index of the closing parenthesis to variable sub.
It also checks if the current character is not a dot, opening or closing parenthesis, and if it is, it adds the current character to variable all.
After the loop finishes, it assigns the length of the input string minus the index of the dot minus 1 to variable d and the length of the input string minus the index of the opening parenthesis minus 1 to variable l.
It then checks if the opening parenthesis is not found, in which case it prints the value of variable all divided by 10 raised to the power of variable d.
Otherwise, it subtracts 2 from variable d (for the parenthesis) and prints the value of variable all minus the value of variable sub divided by 10 raised to the power of variable d minus 10 raised to the power of variable l.
