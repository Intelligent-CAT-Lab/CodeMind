 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable S is initialized with the input string "RRLRL".
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 4 to check each character in this range.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character is 'R' and the next character is 'L'. If it is, it enters another for loop and it iterates from the next character to the end of the string.
Inside the inner for loop, it checks if the current character is 'R'. If it is, it extracts the substring between the previous character and the current character and adds it to the ArrayList Sa. It also updates the variable prev to the current character index and breaks out of the inner for loop.
After the inner for loop finishes, it checks if the current character is the last character in the string. If it is, it extracts the substring between the previous character and the current character and adds it to the ArrayList Sa. It also updates the variable prev to the index of the last character in the string and breaks out of the outer for loop.
If the current character is not the last character in the string, it extracts the substring between the previous character and the current character and adds it to the ArrayList Sa. It also updates the variable prev to the index of the current character and breaks out of the outer for loop.
After the outer for loop finishes, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to the size of the ArrayList Sa.
Inside the for loop, it extracts the current substring from the ArrayList Sa and checks if it contains the substring "RL". If it does, it checks if the length of the substring is even or odd. If it is even, it prints the length of the substring divided by 2 followed by a space. If it is odd, it prints the length of the substring divided by 2 plus 1 followed by a space.
If the length of the substring is not even or odd, it prints 0 followed by a space.
