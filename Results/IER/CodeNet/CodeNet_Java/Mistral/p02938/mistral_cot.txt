 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable l and variable r are initialized with 2 and 3 respectively according to the input. And variable n is calculated as the number of digits of variable r, which is 2.
It enters a 4D array dp with dimensions [n+1][2][2][2] and initializes all elements of dp to 1.
It then enters a for loop that iterates from 1 to n.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop that iterates from 0 to 2.
Inside the second for loop, it enters another for loop that iterates from 0 to 2.
Inside the third for loop, it enters another for loop that iterates from 0 to 2.
It then checks the value of x, y and msb and updates the corresponding elements of dp accordingly.
It also calls the print function to print the current state of dp.
After the for loop finishes, it prints the value of dp[n][0][0][0], which is 3.
<<<Output>>>
3
