 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n, variable x and variable y are initialized with 5, 2 and 4 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 4 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it creates a new array dist of size n and fills it with -1.
Then it creates a new queue and adds the current interger i to it.
It enters a while loop and it checks if the queue is empty. If it is not, it polls the first element from the queue and checks the four possible directions from the current element i.
If the current element i is equal to x, it adds y to the queue and updates the dist array with the distance from i to y.
If the current element i is equal to y, it adds x to the queue and updates the dist array with the distance from i to x.
It continues this process until the queue is empty.
After the loop finishes, it iterates from i to n and updates the ans array with the count of elements in the dist array.
Finally, it prints the ans array.
<<<Output>>>
[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
