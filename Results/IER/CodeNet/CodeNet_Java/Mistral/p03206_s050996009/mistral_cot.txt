 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input from the user using the Scanner class and stores it in the variable day.
Then it uses a switch statement to check the value of the variable day.
If the value of day is 25, it prints "Christmas" as output.
If the value of day is 24, it prints "Christmas Eve" as output.
If the value of day is 23, it prints "Christmas Eve Eve" as output.
If the value of day is 22, it prints "Christmas Eve Eve Eve" as output.
<<<Output>>>
