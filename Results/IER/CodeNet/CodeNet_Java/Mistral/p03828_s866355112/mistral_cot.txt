 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 3 according to the input. And variable dp is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calls the method primeFactorize(num) for each integer i.
The method primeFactorize(num) uses a for loop to iterate from 2 to num and check if num is divisible by i. If it is, it increments the dp[i] variable and calls the method primeFactorize(num/i) recursively.
After the for loop finishes, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. If dp[i] is not 0, it calculates the count variable by multiplying dp[i] with 1 and then multiplying it with 2 modulo 1000000007.
After the for loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable count as output, which is 1.
