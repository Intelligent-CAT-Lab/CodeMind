 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 12 according to the input. And variable a is calculated by calling the function `sumDigits(n)` which returns the sum of the digits of the number n.
The function `sumDigits(n)` uses a while loop to extract the digits of the number n one by one and adds them to variable sum.
After the function returns the value of variable sum, which is 3, the program checks if n is divisible by a using the modulo operator (%). Since 12 is not divisible by 3, the program prints "No" as output.
<<<Output>>>
No
