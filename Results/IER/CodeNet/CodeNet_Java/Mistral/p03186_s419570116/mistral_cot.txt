 <<<Analysis>>>
The program takes three integers a, b and c as input from the user. The first integer a is 3, the second integer b is 1 and the third integer c is 4.
It then checks if the value of c is less than or equal to the sum of a and b. Since c is 4 and a+b is 3+1=4, the condition is not met.
So the program proceeds to the else block and it prints the value of 2*b+a+1, which is 2*1+3+1=7.
<<<Output>>>
7
