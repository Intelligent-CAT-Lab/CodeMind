 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with the input "119".
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each character of the string N.
Inside the for loop, it checks the current character of N using if-else statement.
If the current character is '1', it prints 9.
If the current character is '9', it prints 1.
If the current character is anything else, it prints the current character.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final string "119".
<<<Output>>>
119
