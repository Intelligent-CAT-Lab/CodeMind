 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized with the input string "RUDLUDR".
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 6 to check each character in the string.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character is either "R", "U", "D" or "L" and if it is an even index or an odd index.
If the current character is "R", "U" or "D" and it is an even index, it sets the value of ans to "No".
If the current character is "L" and it is an odd index, it sets the value of ans to "No".
If none of the above conditions are met, it sets the value of ans to "Yes".
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
