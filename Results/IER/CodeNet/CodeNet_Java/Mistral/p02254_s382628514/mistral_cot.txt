The variable alphabets[] is initialized with 0 for all elements.
It enters a for loop and it iterates through each character in the input string "abca".
For each character, it increments the corresponding element in the alphabets[] array.
After the loop finishes, it creates a priority queue and adds a node for each character in the input string.
The priority queue is sorted in descending order of frequency.
It then removes the two nodes with the highest frequency from the priority queue and creates a new node with the sum of their frequencies.
It adds the new node to the priority queue.
It then removes the node with the highest frequency from the priority queue and creates a new node with the sum of its frequency and the frequency of the node it removed.
It adds the new node to the priority queue.
It then removes the node with the highest frequency from the priority queue and creates a new node with the sum of its frequency and the frequency of the node it removed.
