 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with the input value "1 21" by concatenating the two input values using the `next()` method of the `Scanner` class.
Then it calculates the square root of the integer value of n using the `Math.sqrt()` method and stores it in the variable sqr.
It then checks if the square root of the integer value of n is an integer by comparing it with its floor value using the `Math.floor()` method.
Since the square root of 21 is not an integer, the condition `Math.floor(sqr) == sqr` is false and the program prints "No" as output.
<<<Output>>>
No
