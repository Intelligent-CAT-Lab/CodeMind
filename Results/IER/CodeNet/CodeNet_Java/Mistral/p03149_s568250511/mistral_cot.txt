 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads the input line by line, and for each line, it first checks if the line contains a valid integer `n`. If it does, it initializes an array `ok` of size `114514` with all elements set to `false`. Then it sets the elements at index `nei()`, `nei()`, and `nei()` to `true`. Finally, it prints `out(ok[1] && ok[9] && ok[7] && ok[4] ? "YES" : "NO")`.

<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is `YES`.
