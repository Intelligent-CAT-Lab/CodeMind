The variable n is initialized with 3 according to the input. And variable s is also initialized with 3.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger s[j] contains the current interger s[i] using regular expression.
If it does, it adds the current interger i to variable flg.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable flg as output, which is 2.
