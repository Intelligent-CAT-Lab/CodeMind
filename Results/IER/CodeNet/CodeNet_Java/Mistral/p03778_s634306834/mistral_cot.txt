 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable W, variable a and variable b are initialized with 3, 2 and 6 respectively according to the input.
It enters a solve method and it calls the FastScanner class to read the input.
It then calls the printWriter class to print the output.
The solve method first calculates the maximum value between a and b and subtracts the minimum value between a and b and the value of W. If the result is less than 0, it prints 0. Otherwise, it prints the result.
The condition is met when a is 2, b is 6 and W is 3.
After the solve method finishes, it print the fianl value of variable answer as output, which is 11.
<<<Output>>>
11
