The variable t is initialized with 725 according to the input.
It enters a series of if-else statements to check the value of variable t and print the corresponding output.
The first if statement checks if t is greater than or equal to 1800. Since t is 725, this condition is not met.
The second if statement checks if t is greater than or equal to 1600. Since t is 725, this condition is not met.
The third if statement checks if t is greater than or equal to 1400. Since t is 725, this condition is not met.
The fourth if statement checks if t is greater than or equal to 1200. Since t is 725, this condition is not met.
The fifth if statement checks if t is greater than or equal to 1000. Since t is 725, this condition is not met.
The sixth if statement checks if t is greater than or equal to 800. Since t is 725, this condition is not met.
The seventh if statement checks if t is greater than or equal to 600. Since t is 725, this condition is not met.
Since none of the above conditions are met, the last if statement is executed and it prints the output 8.
