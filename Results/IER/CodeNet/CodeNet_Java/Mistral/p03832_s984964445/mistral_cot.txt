The variable n, variable A and variable B are initialized with 3, 1 and 3 respectively according to the input. And variable C and variable D are initialized with 1 and 2 respectively.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger j by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum falls within the range [1, 2]. If it does, it adds the current interger j to variable answer. The condition is met when j is 1 and 2.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable answer as output, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>
3
