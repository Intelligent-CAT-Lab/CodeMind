The variable s is initialized with 7 according to the input. And variable dp is initialized with a length of s+1.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to s.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 3 to s.
It checks if the sum of current index i and j is less than or equal to s. If it is, it adds the value of dp[i+j] to dp[i+j] by adding dp[i] to it and then taking the modulo of the result with mod.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable dp[s] as output, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
