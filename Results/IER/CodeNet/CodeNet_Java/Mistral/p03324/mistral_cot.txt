The variable D is initialized with 5 according to the input.
The variable A is initialized with 10000L if D is 2, 100L if D is 1 and 1L if D is not 2 or 1.
The variable N is initialized with 0 according to the input.
The variable ser is initialized with 0L and count is initialized with 0L.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until ser is equal to N.
Inside the while loop, it increments count by 1L and calls the search function with the current value of count*A and D.
The search function takes two arguments, a and b, and it returns true if the remainder of a divided by 1000000 is equal to 3, the remainder of a divided by 10000 is equal to 2, the remainder of a divided by 100 is equal to 1, otherwise it returns false.
If the search function returns true, it increments ser by 1L.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable count*A as output, which is 500000.
<<<Output>>>
500000
