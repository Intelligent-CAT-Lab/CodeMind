The variable N is initialized with 432 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to N to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of wk by multiplying i with 1.08.
Then it checks if the value of wk is equal to N. If it is, it prints the value of i and returns from the function.
After the loop finishes, it prints ":" and returns from the function.
