 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and variable k are initialized with 3 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It creates two arrays min and max of size n+1.
It initializes the first element of min array with 1 and the first element of max array with n.
Then it iterates from 1 to n and updates the min and max array accordingly.
It updates the min array by adding the current index i to the previous value of min array.
It updates the max array by adding n-i to the previous value of max array.
It initializes variable ans to 0.
It iterates from k-1 to n and updates the ans variable by adding the difference between max and min array at each index i.
Finally, it prints the value of ans modulo 1000000007.
