 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable odd is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates 3 times. In each iteration, it reads an integer from the user using the Scanner class and adds the remainder of the integer divided by 2 to variable odd.
So, in the first iteration, it reads 1 and adds 1 to variable odd.
In the second iteration, it reads 1 and adds 1 to variable odd.
In the third iteration, it reads 10 and adds 0 to variable odd.
After the loop finishes, it checks if the value of variable odd is greater than or equal to 2. Since it is 3, it prints "Hom".
<<<Output>>>
Hom
