 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable a and variable b are initialized with 5 and 5 respectively according to the input.
The variable ans is initialized with a - 1, which is 4.
Then it checks if a is less than or equal to b. Since a is equal to b, the condition is true and it adds 1 to variable ans.
After that, it prints the value of variable ans, which is 5.
<<<Output>>>
