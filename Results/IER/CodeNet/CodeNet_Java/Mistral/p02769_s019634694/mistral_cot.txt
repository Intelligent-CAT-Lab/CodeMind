The variable n and k are initialized with 3 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the factorial of current interger num by multiplying all the integers from 1 to num and storing it in variable factorial.
Then it calculates the inverse of factorial of current interger num by calculating the reciprocal of factorial of current interger num modulo 1000000007 and storing it in variable inverse.
Then it calculates the factorial of inverse of current interger num by multiplying all the integers from 1 to inverse of current interger num and storing it in variable factorial\_inverse.
Then it calculates the combination of n and i by multiplying the factorial of n with the product of factorial\_inverse of i and factorial\_inverse of n-i modulo 1000000007 and storing it in variable combination.
Then it calculates the combination of n-1 and i-1 by multiplying the factorial of n-1 with the product of factorial\_inverse of n-i-1 and factorial\_inverse of i modulo 1000000007 and storing it in variable combination2.
Then it adds the product of combination and combination2 modulo 1000000007 to variable answer.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable answer as output, which is 1.
