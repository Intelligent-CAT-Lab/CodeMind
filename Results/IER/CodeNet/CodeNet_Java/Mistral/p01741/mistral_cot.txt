The variable d is initialized with 1.000 according to the input.
It enters a series of if-else statements to check the value of variable d.
The first if statement checks if d is less than 1, if it is true it prints d * Math.sqrt(2) which is 1.732.
The second if statement checks if d is less than Math.sqrt(2), if it is true it prints 2.
The third if statement checks if d is less than 2, if it is true it prints d * Math.sqrt(2) which is 1.732.
The fourth if statement checks if d is less than Math.sqrt(2) * 1.5, if it is true it prints 3.
The fifth if statement checks if d is less than Math.sqrt(2) * 1.5, if it is true it prints 3.
The sixth if statement checks if d is less than Math.sqrt(2) * 1.5, if it is true it prints 3.
The seventh if statement checks if d is less than Math.sqrt(2) * 1.5, if it is true it prints 3.
The eighth if statement checks if d is less than Math.sqrt(2) * 1.5, if it is true it prints 3.
The ninth if statement checks if d is less than Math.sqrt(2) * 1.5, if it is true it prints 3.
The tenth if statement checks if d is less than Math.sqrt(2) * 1.5, if it is true it prints 3.
The eleventh if statement checks if d is less than Math.sqrt(2) * 1.5, if it is true it prints 3.
The twelfth if statement checks if d is less than Math.sqrt(2) * 1.5, if it is true it prints 3.
The thirteenth if statement checks if d is less than Math.sqrt(2) * 1.5, if it is true it prints 3.
The fourteenth if statement checks if d is less than Math.sqrt(2) * 1.5, if it is true it prints 3.
The fifteenth if statement checks if d is less than Math.sqrt(2) * 1.5, if it is true it prints 3.
