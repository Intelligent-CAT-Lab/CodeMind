 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n, variable d1 and variable d2 are initialized with 2, 1 and 2 respectively according to the input. And variable d1s and d2s are initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger num by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum falls within the range [1, 2]. If it does, it checks if the current interger i is 1 or 2 and if it is, it checks if the current interger j is 1 or 2 and if it is, it checks if the current interger i and j have the same parity. If it does, it prints the current interger i and j and decrements the variable need.
If the variable need is 0, it returns from the function.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable need as output, which is 0.
<<<Output>>>
0
