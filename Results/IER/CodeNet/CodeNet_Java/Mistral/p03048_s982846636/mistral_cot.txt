The variable r, variable g and variable b are initialized with 1, 2 and 3 respectively according to the input. And variable n is initialized with 4.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 4 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable ans.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 4 to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable ans.
It calculates the remainder of the division of n by (i * r + j * g) and checks if it is 0. If it is, it increments the value of variable ans.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 1.
