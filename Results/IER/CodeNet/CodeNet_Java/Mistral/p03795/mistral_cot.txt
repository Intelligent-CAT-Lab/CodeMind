 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a single integer n from the standard input using BufferedReader. It then calculates the output by multiplying n by 800 and subtracting the result of dividing n by 15 and multiplying it by 200.
The calculation is done as follows:

(n * 800) - ((n / 15) * 200)

The output is then printed to the standard output.

<<<Output>>>
1200

Therefore, the return value of the code for the input `20` would be 1200.
