The variable a, variable n and variable m are initialized with 16, 2 and 1000 respectively according to the input. And variable max is calculated by taking the power of m divided by n.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to max to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable x.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of x by raising i to the power of n.
Then it converts the value of x to a string and iterates over each character of the string. It adds the value of each character to variable y.
Then it checks if the value of y plus a is equal to i. If it is, it increments the variable ans. The condition is met when i is 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150,
