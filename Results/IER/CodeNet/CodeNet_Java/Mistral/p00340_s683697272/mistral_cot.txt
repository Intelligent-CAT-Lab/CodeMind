 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads four integers a, b, c and d from the user using the Scanner class. It then checks if any of the following conditions are met:

* a == b && c == d
* a == c && b == d
* a == d && b == c

If any of these conditions are met, it prints "yes" to the console. Otherwise, it prints "no".

<<<Output>>>
yes
