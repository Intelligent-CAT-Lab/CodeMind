 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable k is initialized with 6 according to the input.
It creates an array of size k and initializes each element of the array with a Vertex object.
It then iterates through the array and sets the edge of each vertex with the next vertex in the array and the cost of 1.
It then calls the dijkstra method of the Search class with the first vertex and the last vertex as arguments.
The dijkstra method initializes a map called minCost with the first vertex as the key and 1 as the value.
It then adds the first vertex to a queue called q and sets the cost of the first vertex to 1.
It then enters a while loop that continues until the queue is empty.
Inside the while loop, it dequeues the next vertex from the queue and checks if the cost of the next vertex is less than the cost of the current vertex in the map.
If it is, it updates the cost of the current vertex in the map and adds the next vertex to the queue.
It then continues to the next iteration of the while loop.
After the while loop finishes, it returns the value of the map with the last vertex as the key.
