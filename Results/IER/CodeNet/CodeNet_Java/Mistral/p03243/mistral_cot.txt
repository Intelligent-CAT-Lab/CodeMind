 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 0 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 999 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current integer i is divisible by 111 using the modulo operator (%). If it is, it prints the value of i and returns immediately using the return statement.
Since 111 is not divisible by 111, the loop continues until it reaches 999.
<<<Output>>>
No output is returned since the loop does not find any integer i that is divisible by 111.
