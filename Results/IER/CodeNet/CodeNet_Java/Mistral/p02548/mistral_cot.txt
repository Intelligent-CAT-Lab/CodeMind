 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 3 according to the input. And variable cnt is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the product of i and j is less than 3. If it is, it increments the value of variable cnt by 1. The condition is met when i is 1 and j is 1, i is 1 and j is 2, i is 2 and j is 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable cnt as output, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>
3
