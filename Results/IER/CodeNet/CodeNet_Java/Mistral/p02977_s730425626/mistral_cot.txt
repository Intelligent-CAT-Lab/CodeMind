 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 3 according to the input. And variable prev is calculated as (n + 1) / 4 * 4 - 1 = 0.
It enters a if statement and it checks if prev is greater than 0 and if (n & (n - 1)) != 0.
Since prev is 0 and (n & (n - 1)) != 0, it goes to the else block and it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
