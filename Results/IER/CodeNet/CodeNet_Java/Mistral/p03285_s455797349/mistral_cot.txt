 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 11 according to the input.
It enters two nested for loops. The outer loop iterates from 0 to 15 (15 is 100/7) and the inner loop iterates from 0 to 25 (25 is 100/4).
Inside the for loops, it checks if the current combination of i and j multiplied by 7 and 4 respectively, equals to the variable N. If it does, it prints "Yes" and returns immediately.
After the loops finishes, it prints "No" because no combination of i and j multiplied by 7 and 4 respectively, equals to 11.
<<<Output>>>
No
