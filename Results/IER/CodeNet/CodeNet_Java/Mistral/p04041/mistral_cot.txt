The variable n, variable x and variable y are initialized with 3, 5 and 7 respectively according to the input. And variable z is not given in the input.
The variable sum is calculated as x+y+z+1 = 16.
The variable mask is calculated as 1<<sum = 1<<16 = 65536.
The variable ng is calculated as 1<<z = 1<<7 = 128 and 1<<(y+z) = 1<<(5+7) = 1<<12 = 4096 and 1<<(x+y+z) = 1<<(5+7+1) = 1<<13 = 8192.
The variable dp is a 2D array of size n+1 and mask+1. It is initialized with 1 at position (0,1) and 0 at all other positions.
The variable ans is initialized with 1.
The solve() method is called which performs the following steps:
1. It initializes the variables n, x, y and z with the values passed as input.
2. It calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger sum = x+y+z+1 = 16.
3. It calculates the variable mask as 1<<sum = 1<<16 = 65536.
4. It initializes the variable ng with the values 1<<z, 1<<(y+z) and 1<<(x+y+z)
5. It initializes the variable dp with 1 at position (0,1) and 0 at all other positions.
6. It iterates through all the values of i from 0 to n-1.
7. For each value of i, it iterates through all the values of state from 0 to mask.
8. For each value of state, it iterates through all the values of j from 1 to 10.
9. It calculates the value of res as ((state<<j)&mask) + 1.
10. If ((res&ng)==ng) continue;
11. It adds the value of dp[i][state] to dp[i+1][res].
12. It calculates the value of ans as 10^n.
13. It iterates through all the values of i from 0 to mask.
14. For each value of i, it subtracts the value of dp[n][i] from ans.
15. It calculates the final value of ans as (ans+MOD)%MOD.
The run() method is called which performs the following steps:
1. It reads the input from the standard input stream.
2. It calls the solve() method.
3. It prints the output to the standard output stream.
The main() method is called which calls the run() method.
The return value of the code is the value of ans which is 10^n = 10^3 = 1000.
