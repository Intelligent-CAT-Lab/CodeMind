 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable r, variable c, variable a1, variable a2, variable b1 and variable b2 are initialized with 4, 4, 0, 0, 3 and 3 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the absolute difference between a1 and b1, and a2 and b2, and assigns them to variable x and y respectively.
Then it calculates the minimum of x and y and assigns it to variable C.
It initializes variable z to 1 and multiplies it by 2 if x is equal to r-x or y is equal to c-y.
It initializes variable b to 1 and multiplies it by the product of x+y-i for i in the range [0, C-1].
Finally, it multiplies variable b by variable z and takes the modulo with 100000007.
