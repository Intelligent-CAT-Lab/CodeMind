 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with the input "1222".
It extracts the digits of the number n and assigns them to variables a, b, c and d.
It then checks if the sum of the digits of n is equal to 7.
It checks the first condition a+b+c+d==7, which is true.
It then prints the output "1+2+2+2=7" and returns from the function.
<<<Output>>>
1+2+2+2=7
