 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable an, ad, bn, bd are initialized with 0, 1, 0, 1 respectively according to the input. And variable n, d, g are initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 10 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable n.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the greatest common divisor of variable n and variable i using the gcd function.
Then it calculates the least common multiple of variable ad and variable bd using the lcm function.
It calculates the new value of variable n by multiplying variable an with the quotient of variable d divided by variable ad and variable bn with variable d divided by variable bd.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable n as output, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>
3
