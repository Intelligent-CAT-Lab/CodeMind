 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable X and variable Y are initialized with 9 and 45000 respectively according to the input. And variable sum is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 9 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger num by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a for loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum equals to Y. If it does, it sets the variable judge to true and also sets the variable a, b and c with the current values of i, k and X-i-k respectively.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl values of variable a, b and c as output, which are 0 4 5.
<<<Output>>>
0 4 5
