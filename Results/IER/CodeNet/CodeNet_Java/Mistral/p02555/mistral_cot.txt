 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 7 according to the input. And variable mod is initialized with 1000000007.
It creates an array dp of size n+1 and initializes the first element dp[0] with 1.
It enters a for loop that iterates from 3 to n. For each iteration, it enters another for loop that iterates from 3 to the current iteration i.
Inside the inner loop, it calculates the value of dp[i] by adding the value of dp[i - j] and dp[i] and taking the modulo with mod.
The condition is met when i is 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 10.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable dp[n], which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
