 <<<Analysis>>>
The variables a, b and c are initialized with 1, 5 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It enters a series of if-else statements to check the order of the variables.
It first checks if a is greater than or equal to b and c. If it is, it then checks if b is greater than or equal to c. If it is, it adds the value of b to the sum of a and c and prints the result. If it is not, it adds the value of c to the sum of a and b and prints the result.
It then checks if b is greater than or equal to a and c. If it is, it then checks if a is greater than or equal to c. If it is, it adds the value of b to the sum of a and c and prints the result. If it is not, it adds the value of c to the sum of b and a and prints the result.
Finally, it checks if a is greater than or equal to b and c. If it is, it then checks if b is greater than or equal to c. If it is, it adds the value of c to the sum of a and b and prints the result. If it is not, it adds the value of b to the sum of c and a and prints the result.
After all the conditions are checked, it prints the final result which is 13.
<<<Output>>>
