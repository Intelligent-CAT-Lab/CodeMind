 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable X is initialized with 20 according to the input.
It creates an empty list dp.
It adds 2 to the list dp.
It enters a do-while loop and it iterates until i is less than X.
Inside the loop, it initializes a boolean variable f to true.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to dp.size()-1.
Inside the for loop, it checks if i is divisible by dp.get(j) using the modulo operator. If it is, it sets f to false and breaks out of the for loop.
If f is still true after the for loop, it adds i to the list dp.
After the loop finishes, it enters another for loop and it iterates from X to 2*X-1.
Inside the for loop, it initializes a boolean variable f to true.
It enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to dp.size()-1.
Inside the for loop, it checks if i is divisible by dp.get(j) using the modulo operator. If it is, it sets f to false and breaks out of the for loop.
If f is still true after the for loop, it sets ans to i and breaks out of the for loop.
After the loop finishes, it prints the value of ans.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is 100.
