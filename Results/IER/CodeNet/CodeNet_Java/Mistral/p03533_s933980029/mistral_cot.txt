 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable S is initialized with the input "KIHBR".
It creates a StringBuilder object sb with the value of S.
It converts the string S to a char array ch.
It checks if the length of ch is greater than 9. If it is, it prints "NO" and returns.
It creates a new string akb with the value "AKIHABARA".
It enters a for loop that iterates 9 times.
Inside the loop, it checks if the length of sb is greater than the current iteration i.
If it is, it checks if the character at index i of sb is equal to the character at index i of akb. If it is, it continues to the next iteration.
If it is not, it inserts the character "A" at index i of sb.
After the loop finishes, it checks if the character at index i of sb is equal to the character at index i of akb. If it is, it continues to the next iteration.
If it is not, it prints "NO" and exits the program.
After the loop finishes, it prints "YES".
