 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable spl is initialized with the input "10 30 20" by splitting it with the delimiter " ". The resulting array is stored in variable spl.
It then creates an integer array num of length equal to the length of the spl array. It iterates through the spl array and assigns each element to the corresponding index in the num array.
It then sorts the num array in ascending order using the Arrays.sort() method.
It then checks if the sum of the first two elements of the num array is equal to the third element of the num array. In this case, it is 10 + 30 = 40, which is not equal to 20.
Therefore, it prints "No" as output.
<<<Output>>>
No
