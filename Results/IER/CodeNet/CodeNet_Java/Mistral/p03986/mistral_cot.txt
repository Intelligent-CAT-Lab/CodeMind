The variable x is initialized with the input string "TSTTSS". The variable c is initialized with 0 and len is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 6 to check each character of the string x.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character is 'T'. If it is, it decrements the value of variable c. Otherwise, it checks if the value of variable c is less than 0. If it is, it subtracts the value of variable c from variable len and sets the value of variable c to 1. Otherwise, it increments the value of variable c.
After the loop finishes, it adds the absolute value of variable c to variable len.
Finally, it prints the value of variable len as output, which is 6.
<<<Output>>>
6
