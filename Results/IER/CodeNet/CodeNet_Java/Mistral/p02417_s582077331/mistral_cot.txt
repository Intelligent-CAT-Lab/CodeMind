 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable low_az and up_az are initialized with "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz" and "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ" respectively.
The variable str is initialized with an empty string.
The variable cnt is an integer array of length 26, initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 25 to initialize the variable cnt with 0.
It enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the input string str.
Inside the second for loop, it iterates from 0 to 25 to check each character in the input string str.
For each character in the input string str, it checks if the character is present in either low_az or up_az. If it is, it increments the corresponding element in the cnt array.
After the second for loop finishes, it prints the count of each character in the input string str.
<<<Output>>>
a : 1
e : 1
i : 1
n : 1
o : 1
p : 1
t : 1
. : 1
