It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to X.length()-1 to check each character of the string X.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current index i is equal to 4. If it is, it appends a space and the current character of X to the StringBuilder sb. Otherwise, it just appends the current character of X to the StringBuilder sb.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable sb as output, which is "CODEFES".
