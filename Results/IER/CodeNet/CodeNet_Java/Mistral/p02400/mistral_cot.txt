 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a double value from the user using BufferedReader and stores it in variable r. Then it calculates the value of x and y using the formula x = r^2 * pi and y = 2 * r * pi.
It uses the System.out.printf() method to print the values of x and y with 6 decimal places.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is not applicable as it is a program that reads input from the user and calculates and prints the values of x and y based on that input. The output of the program will be different for different inputs.
In this case, if the input is 2, the output will be:
```
0.000000 4.000000
```
