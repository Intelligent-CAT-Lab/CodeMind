 <<<Analysis>>>
The program takes two integer inputs n and m from the user.
It calculates the value of the expression `(1900 * m + 100 * (n - m)) * (1<<m)` and prints it as output.
The expression is calculated as follows:
- `1900 * m` multiplies 1900 by m.
- `100 * (n - m)` multiplies 100 by (n - m).
- `(1900 * m + 100 * (n - m))` adds the two results above.
- `(1<<m)` raises 2 to the power of m.
- `(1900 * m + 100 * (n - m)) * (1<<m)` multiplies the result above by 2 raised to the power of m.

<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code based on the input `1 1` is 100.
