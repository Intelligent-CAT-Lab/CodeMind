 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 1817181712114 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to n to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable cur.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of d[i] by multiplying the current integer cur with the digit of the current integer i and adding the value of d[i+1].
Then it calculates the remainder of d[i] by dividing it by 2019.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 1817181712114.
<<<Output>>>
1817181712114
