 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 3 according to the input.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until there is no more input.
Inside the while loop, it calls the solve() method.
The solve() method first calls the ni() method to get the value of N.
Then it prints the value of (N - 2) * 180, which is 180.
<<<Output>>>
180
