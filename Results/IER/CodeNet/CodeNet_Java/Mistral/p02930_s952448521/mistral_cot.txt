The variable n is initialized with 3 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from i+1 to n+1 to check each integer j in this range.
Inside the second for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 9 to check each integer k in this range.
Inside the third for loop, it checks if the bit at position k of integer i is different from the bit at position k of integer j. If it is, it prints the value of k+1 and breaks out of the loop.
The condition is met when i is 1, j is 2 and k is 0.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable k+1 as output, which is 1.
