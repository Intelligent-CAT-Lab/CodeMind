 <<<Analysis>>>
The program reads two characters A and B from the standard input. It then compares A and B and prints "<", ">" or "=" depending on whether A is less than, greater than or equal to B respectively.

The program uses a static class IO which extends PrintWriter and provides additional functionality for reading input from the standard input. The class has several methods for reading input, such as hasNextByte(), readByte(), isPrintableChar(), isNewLine(), skipUnprintable(), skipNewLine(), hasNext(), hasNextLine(), next(), nextCharArray(), nextLine(), nextLong(), nextInt(), nextChar(), nextDouble(), arrayInt(), matrixInt(), charMap() and close().

The program first creates an instance of the IO class and then reads two characters A and B from the standard input using the nextCharArray() method. It then compares A and B using an if-else statement and prints the appropriate character "<", ">" or "=" depending on the comparison result.
