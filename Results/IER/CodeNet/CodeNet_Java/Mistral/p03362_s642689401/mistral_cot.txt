 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 5 according to the input.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until the count of prime numbers is equal to n.
Inside the while loop, it calls the method nextPrime() of the Prime class to get the next prime number.
It checks if the current prime number is divisible by 5. If it is, it increments the count and prints the prime number.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable count, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
