 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable l is initialized with 4 according to the input.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until l is greater than or equal to 2^n. The value of variable n is incremented in each iteration of the loop.
After the loop finishes, it creates a StringBuilder object and initializes variable sum with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to n-1. In each iteration, it appends the values of (bit+1), (bit+2) and 0 to the StringBuilder object. It also increments variable m.
Then it appends the values of (bit+1), (bit+2) and (1<<bit) to the StringBuilder object. It also increments variable m.
Then it checks if the current bit is set in the value of l by using the bitwise AND operator. If it is set, it appends the value of (bit+1), n and (l-sum-(1<<bit)) to the StringBuilder object. It also increments variable sum and variable m.
After the loop finishes, it prints the value of n and m.
It also prints the StringBuilder object.
The StringBuilder object contains the following values:
