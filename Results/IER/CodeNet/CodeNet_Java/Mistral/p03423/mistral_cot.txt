 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable l is initialized with the input "8".
It creates a StringTokenizer object with the input string "8" and tokenizes it into an array of strings.
It then uses the nextToken() method of the StringTokenizer object to extract the first token from the array of strings, which is "8".
It then divides the integer value of "8" by 3 and uses the Math.floor() method to round down the result to the nearest integer.
The final value of the variable answer is 2.
<<<Output>>>
