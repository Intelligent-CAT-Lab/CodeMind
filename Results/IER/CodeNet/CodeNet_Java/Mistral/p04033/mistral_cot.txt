 <<<Analysis>>>
The program takes two integer inputs a and b from the user using the Scanner class.
It checks if both a and b are zero, if yes it prints "Zero" otherwise it calculates the difference between Math.min(0,b) and Math.min(-1,a) and checks if the result is odd or even by using the modulo operator (%).
If the result is odd, it prints "Positive" otherwise it prints "Negative".
<<<Output>>>
Positive
