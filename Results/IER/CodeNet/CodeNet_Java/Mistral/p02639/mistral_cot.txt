 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable x is an array of size 5 and it is initialized with 5 integers. The variable sum is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 4 to extract each integer from the array x and add it to variable sum.
After the loop finishes, it calculates the difference between 15 and the sum of the integers in the array x.
The condition is met when i is 0,1,2,3,4.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable sum as output, which is 15.
<<<Output>>>
15
