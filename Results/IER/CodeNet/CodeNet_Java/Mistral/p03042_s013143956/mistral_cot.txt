 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable m and y are initialized with 19 and 5 respectively according to the input.
It enters a if-else-if-else statement to check the value of y and m.
If y is less than or equal to 12 and m is less than or equal to 12, it prints "AMBIGUOUS" and returns.
If m is greater than 0 and m is less than or equal to 12, it prints "YYMM" and returns.
If y is greater than 0 and y is less than or equal to 12, it prints "MMYY" and returns.
It doesn't meet any of the conditions, so it prints "NA" and returns.
