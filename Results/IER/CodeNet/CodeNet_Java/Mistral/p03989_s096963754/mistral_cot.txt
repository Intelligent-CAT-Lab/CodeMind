The variable n, variable K, and variable m are initialized with 3, 1, and 0 respectively according to the input. And variable vis, canPair, and A are initialized with false, false, and an empty array respectively.
The program enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to n to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable v.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the value of variable v is less than or equal to n. If it is, it checks if the value of variable vis[v] is true. If it is, it continues to the next iteration of the loop. If it is not, it sets vis[v] to true and adds v to the array A. It also calculates the value of variable v by adding K to v and then adding n to the result. If v is greater than n, it sets v to v - n. If v is less than or equal to n, it sets v to v + n. It then sets canPair[m-1] to true.
The program then calls the function dfs(v) to perform a depth first search on the graph. The function dfs(v) starts by setting vis[v] to true. It then adds v to the array A and calculates the value of variable v by adding K to v and then adding n to the result. If v is greater than n, it sets v to v - n. If v is less than or equal to n, it sets v to v + n. It then calls the function dfs(v) recursively on the value of variable v.
The program then calculates the value of variable res by adding the result of solve(0,r) multiplied by the factorial of n-r to the result of solve(1,r). The function solve(u,r) is a recursive function that calculates the number of pairs of integers that can be formed from the array A such that the sum of the two integers is less than or equal to r. The function first checks if r is equal to 0. If it is, it returns 1. It then checks if u is equal to the length of the array A. If it is, it returns 0. It then checks if canPair[u] is true. If it is, it returns the result of solve(u+2,r-1). It then calls the function solve(u+1,r) and adds the result to the result of solve(u+2,r-1).
The program then prints the value of variable res.
