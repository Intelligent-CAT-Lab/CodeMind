 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable H and variable W are initialized with 3 and 5 respectively according to the input.
It enters a if statement and it checks if either H or W is divisible by 3. If it is, it prints 0 and returns immediately.
It then calculates the values of h1, h2, w1 and w2 by dividing H and W by 2 and checking if they are even or odd.
It calculates the values of a1, a2 and a3 by dividing W by 3 and subtracting the remainder, and then multiplying the result by h1, h2 and w1 respectively.
It calculates the value of cur by taking the maximum of a1, a2 and a3 and subtracting the minimum of a1, a2 and a3.
It then increments the value of a1 and checks if it is less than W. If it is, it recalculates the values of a2 and a3 and updates the value of cur.
It then calculates the value of a1, a2 and a3 again by dividing H by 3 and subtracting the remainder, and then multiplying the result by w1, w2 and H respectively.
It calculates the value of cur again by taking the maximum of a1, a2 and a3 and subtracting the minimum of a1, a2 and a3.
It then increments the value of a1 and checks if it is less than H. If it is, it recalculates the values of a2 and a3 and updates the value of cur.
It then calculates the minimum of cur, H and W and prints it as output.
