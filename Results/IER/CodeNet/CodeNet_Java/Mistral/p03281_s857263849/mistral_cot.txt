The variable N is initialized with 105 according to the input. The variable cnt is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 105 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable temp.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the number of factors of the current interger i by repeatedlly extracting the factors of number with a nested for loop and adding it to variable temp.
Then it checks if the calculated variable temp equals 8. If it does, it increments the variable cnt.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable cnt as output, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
