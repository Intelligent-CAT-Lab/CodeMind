The variable n is initialized with 8 according to the input.
The function loop(n) is called with n as an argument.
The function checks if n is greater than 0 and less than 4. If it is, it returns 1.
If n is not greater than 0 and less than 4, it checks if n is divisible by 3. If it is, it returns the result of calling the function loop(n / 3) + 1.
If n is not divisible by 3, it returns the maximum of the result of calling the function loop(n / 3 + 1) + 1 and the result of calling the function loop(n / 3) + 1.
The function is called recursively until the base case is reached.
The base case is when n is 1, 2 or 3, in which case the function returns 1.
The function is called with n = 1, 2 and 3, and it returns 1, 1 and 1 respectively.
The function is called with n = 4, and it returns 1.
The function is called with n = 3, 2 and 1, and it returns 2, 2 and 1 respectively.
The function is called with n = 2, and it returns 2.
The function is called with n = 1, and it returns 1.
The function returns 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 6.
