 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the java.util package and creates a Scanner object to read input from the user.
It then reads two integers a and b from the user using the next() method of the Scanner object.
It then calculates the expression `a*b - b - a + 1` and stores the result in a variable.
Finally, it prints the value of the variable using the println() method.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code would be 5.
