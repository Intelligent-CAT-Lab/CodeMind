 <<<Analysis>>>
The program takes four integer inputs from the user, which are sx, sy, tx, and ty. These inputs represent the coordinates of a rectangle. The program then uses a series of for loops to print out the shape of the rectangle.

The first two for loops print out the top and bottom of the rectangle, respectively. The third and fourth for loops print out the left and right sides of the rectangle, respectively.

The last two for loops print out the diagonal lines that connect the top-left and bottom-right corners of the rectangle.

The program uses the `System.out.print()` method to print out each character of the rectangle.

<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is the shape of the rectangle printed to the console. The shape of the rectangle is:
```
RU
LR
UR
DL
```
Therefore, the return value of the code is the shape of the rectangle printed to the console.
