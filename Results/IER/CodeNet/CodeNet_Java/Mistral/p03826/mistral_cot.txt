 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the Scanner class from the java.util package.
It then creates a new Scanner object named sc and uses it to read input from the user.
The first two integers are read using the nextInt() method of the Scanner class and stored in the variables a and b.
The next two integers are also read using the nextInt() method and stored in the variables c and d.
The code then calculates the product of a and b and stores it in the variable product.
It also calculates the product of c and d and stores it in the variable product2.
Then it compares the two products and prints the larger of the two products.
In this case, the larger product is 140, which is the product of 5 and 28.
<<<Output>>>
140
