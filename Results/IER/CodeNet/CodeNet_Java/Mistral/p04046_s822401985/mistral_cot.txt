 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable H, variable W, variable A and variable B are initialized with 2, 3, 1 and 1 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable comb1.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of comb1 using the formula comb(H-A-1+B-1, B-1) and then it calculates the value of comb2 using the formula comb(A-1+W-B, W-B).
Then it calculates the value of ans using the formula (ans + comb1 * comb2 % MOD) % MOD.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 1.
