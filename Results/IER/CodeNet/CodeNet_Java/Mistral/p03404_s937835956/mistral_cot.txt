 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable A and B are initialized with 2 and 3 respectively.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 1.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable ans[i][j] by checking if the current interger i is less than or equal to 1. If it is, it sets the value of ans[i][j] to true, otherwise it sets it to false.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is a 2x2 matrix with the values [true, false] and [false, true].
<<<Output>>>
[[true, false], [false, true]]
