 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with the length of the input string.
It creates a TreeMap with key as double and value as integer.
It iterates through each character in the input string and calculates the sum of the characters that are equal to the current character.
It uses the lowerEntry method to find the entry with the smallest key in the map.
If the value of the entry is equal to i-1, it means that the current character is the second occurrence of the previous character, so it prints the value of the entry plus 2 and the index of the current character plus 1.
If the value of the entry is not equal to i-1, it means that the current character is the first occurrence of the previous character, so it prints the value of the entry plus 2 and the index of the current character plus 1.
If no entry is found with the current sum, it adds the current sum and index to the map.
If the loop finishes without finding any matching entry, it prints -1 -1.
<<<Output>>>
-1 -1
