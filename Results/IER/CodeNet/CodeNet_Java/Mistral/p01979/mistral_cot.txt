The variable numArr is initialized with the input "5124". The length of the array is calculated and stored in variable length.
An array arr is created with the same length as numArr and each element of arr is initialized by subtracting '0' from the corresponding element of numArr.
A 3D array dp is created with dimensions [length+1][10][10][10][10][2]. The first element of the first dimension is initialized with 1.
A 2D array counts is created with dimensions [length+1][2]. The first element of the first dimension is initialized with 0 and the second element of the first dimension is initialized with 1.
A for loop iterates from 1 to length and for each iteration, it iterates through each digit of numArr and updates the dp array accordingly.
The first nested for loop iterates through each digit of numArr and updates the dp array with the sum of the dp array of the previous iteration.
The second nested for loop iterates through each digit of numArr and updates the dp array with the sum of the dp array of the previous iteration.
The third nested for loop iterates through each digit of numArr and updates the dp array with the sum of the dp array of the previous iteration.
The fourth nested for loop iterates through each digit of numArr and updates the dp array with the sum of the dp array of the previous iteration.
The fifth nested for loop iterates through each digit of numArr and updates the dp array with the sum of the dp array of the previous iteration.
The sixth nested for loop iterates through each digit of numArr and updates the dp array with the sum of the dp array of the previous iteration.
The seventh nested for loop iterates through each digit of numArr and updates the dp array with the sum of the dp array of the previous iteration.
The eighth nested for loop iterates through each digit of numArr and updates the dp array with the sum of the dp array of the previous iteration.
The ninth nested for loop iterates through each digit of numArr and updates the dp array with the sum of the dp array of the previous iteration.
The tenth nested for loop iterates through each digit of numArr and updates the dp array with the sum of the dp array of the previous iteration.
The eleventh nested for loop iterates through each digit of numArr and updates the dp array with the sum of the dp array of the previous iteration.
The twelfth nested for loop iterates through each digit of numArr and updates the dp array with the sum of the dp array of the previous iteration.

The fourteenth nested for loop iterates through each digit of numArr and updates the dp array with the sum of the dp array of the previous iteration.
The fifteenth nested for loop iterates through each digit of numArr and updates the dp array with the sum of the dp array of the previous iteration.
The sixteenth nested for loop iterates through each digit of numArr and updates the dp array with the sum of the dp array of the previous iteration.
The seventeenth nested for loop iterates through each digit of numArr and updates the dp array with the sum of the dp array of the previous iteration.
The eighteenth nested for loop iterates through each digit of numArr and updates the dp array with the sum of the dp array of the previous iteration.
The nineteenth nested for loop iterates through
