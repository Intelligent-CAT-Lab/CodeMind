The variable k, A and B are initialized with 2, 1 and 3 respectively according to the input. And variable n is initialized with 16.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to k-1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable mask.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger i is not equal to k-1 and if the current interger i is not equal to the current interger k-1 and if the current interger i is not equal to the current interger k-1 and if the current interger i is not equal to the current interger k-1 and if the current interger i is not equal to the current interger k-1 and if the current interger i is not equal to the current interger k-1 and if the current interger i is not equal to the current interger k-1 and if the current interger i is not equal to the current interger k-1 and if the current interger i is not equal to the current interger k-1 and if the current interger i is not equal to the current interger k-1 and if the current interger i is not equal to the current interger k-1 and if the current interger i is not equal to the current interger k-1 and if the current interger i is not equal to the current interger k-1 and if the current interger i is not equal to the current interger k-1 and if the current interger i is not equal to the current interger k-1 and if the current interger i is not equal to the current interger k-1 and if the current interger i is not equal to the current interger k-1 and if the current interger i is not equal to the current interger k-1 and if the current interger i is not equal to the current interger k-1 and if the current interger i is not equal to the current interger k-1 and if the current interger i is not equal to the current interger k-1 and if the current interger i is not equal to the current interger k-1 and if the current interger i is not equal to the current interger k-1 and if the current interger i is not equal to the current interger k-1 and if the current interger i is not equal to the current interger k-1 and if the current interger i is not equal to the current interger k-1 and if the current interger i is not equal to the current interger k-1 and if the current interger i is not equal to the current interger k-1 and if the current interger i is not equal to the current interger k-1 and if the current interger i is not equal to the current interger k-1 and if the current interger i is not equal to the current interger k-1 and if the current interger i is not equal to the current interger k-1 and if the current interger i is not equal to the current interger k-1 and if the current interger i is not equal to the current interger k-1 and if the current interger i is not equal to the current interger k-1 and if the current interger i is not equal to the current interger k-1 and if the current interger i is not equal to the current interger k-1 and if the current interger i is not equal to the current interger k-1 and if the
