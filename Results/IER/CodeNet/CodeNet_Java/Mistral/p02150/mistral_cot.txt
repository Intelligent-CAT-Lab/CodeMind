 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable a, variable b and variable x are initialized with 3, 1 and 5 respectively according to the input. And variable s is calculated as a - b = -2.
It calculates the maximum value between x - a and 0, which is 0.
Then it calculates the total value of (count % MOD) * (a % MOD) % MOD, which is 0.
It then calculates the value of x - count * s, which is 5.
It then adds 5 to the total value, which is 5.
Finally, it calculates the remainder of 5 divided by 1000000007, which is 5.
<<<Output>>>
5
