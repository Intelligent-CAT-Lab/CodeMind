The variable N, variable K and variable X0 are initialized with 10, 3 and 1 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 10 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable x.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable x by performing a series of bitwise operations.
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from 1 to 10 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable x.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable x by performing a series of bitwise operations.
After the second for loop finishes, it enters a while loop and it iterates until the value of variable K becomes less than or equal to 0.
Inside the while loop, it decrements the value of variable K by the value of variable c[pos].
It also enters another for loop and it iterates from 1 to the value of variable c[pos] to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable x.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable x by performing a series of bitwise operations.
After the while loop finishes, it creates an array of length c[pos] and it stores the values of variable x in this array.
It then sorts the array in ascending order.
Finally, it prints the value of variable x at the index K - 1 in the sorted array.
