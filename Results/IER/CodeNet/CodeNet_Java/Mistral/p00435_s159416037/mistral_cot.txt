 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string input from the user and converts each character in the string to its corresponding ASCII value. Then it subtracts 3 from the ASCII value of each character, and adds 26 to the result. The result is then taken modulo 26, and the resulting value is added to the ASCII value of the letter 'A' to get the final ASCII value of the character.

The resulting ASCII values are then stored in a char array.

The input for the code is `MRL`.

The first character 'M' has an ASCII value of 77. Subtracting 3 from it gives 74. Adding 26 to it gives 100. Taking the result modulo 26 gives 14. Adding 65 to it gives the final ASCII value of the character 'M', which is 79.

The second character 'R' has an ASCII value of 82. Subtracting 3 from it gives 79. Adding 26 to it gives 105. Taking the result modulo 26 gives 13. Adding 65 to it gives the final ASCII value of the character 'R', which is 78.

The third character 'L' has an ASCII value of 108. Subtracting 3 from it gives 105. Adding 26 to it gives 131. Taking the result modulo 26 gives 1. Adding 65 to it gives the final ASCII value of the character 'L', which is 106.

The resulting char array is `['M', 'R', 'L']`.

<<<Output>>>
['M', 'R', 'L']
