 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n, variable m and variable r are initialized with 2, 0 and 3 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to n-1 to calculate the value of ans.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of ans by multiplying the current value of ans with the value of r + n - 1 - i and then dividing it by the value of i + 1.
The condition is met when i is 0,1,2.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 1.
