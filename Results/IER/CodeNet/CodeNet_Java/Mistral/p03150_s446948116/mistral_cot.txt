 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable a is initialized with "keyofscience" according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the string a.
Inside the for loop, it creates two substrings str1 and str2 by extracting the substring from index i to j and k to l respectively.
Then it concatenates str1 and str2 to create a new string str.
It checks if the concatenated string str equals "keyence". If it does, it sets the boolean variable bool to true.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable bool as output, which is true.
<<<Output>>>
true
