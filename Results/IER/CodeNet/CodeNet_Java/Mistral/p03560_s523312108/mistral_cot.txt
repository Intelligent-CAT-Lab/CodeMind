 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 6 according to the input. And variable best is initialized with 100.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 1000000 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable d.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable td by multiplying variable d with variable j and taking the remainder of the result divided by n.
Then it updates the value of variable best[td] with the minimum of the current value of best[td] and j.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable best[0] as output, which is 1.
