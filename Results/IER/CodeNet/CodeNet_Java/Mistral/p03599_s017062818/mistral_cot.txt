 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable A, variable B, variable C, variable D, variable E and variable F are initialized with 1, 2, 10, 20, 15 and 200 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 200/100*100/(100*200) to check each integer a in this range.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger a by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to (200-100*a)/100*100 to check each integer b in this range.
Inside the second for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger b by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to (200-100*a-100*b)/100 to check each integer c in this range.
Inside the third for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger c by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to (200-100*a-100*b-100*c)/100 to check each integer d in this range.
Inside the fourth for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger d by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum falls within the range [15, 20]. If it does, it adds the current interger a, b, c and d to variable water and sugar.
After the loops finishes, it print the fianl value of variable water and sugar as output, which is 150.
<<<Output>>>
150
