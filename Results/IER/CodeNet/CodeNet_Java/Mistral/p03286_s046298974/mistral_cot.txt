 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with -9.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until N is 0.
Inside the while loop, it calculates the remainder of N divided by base using the modulo operator (%). It then inserts the absolute value of the remainder at the beginning of the StringBuilder sb.
Then it updates the value of N by subtracting the remainder from N and dividing N by -base.
After the loop finishes, it checks if the length of the StringBuilder sb is 0. If it is, it appends "0" to the StringBuilder.
Finally, it prints the value of the StringBuilder sb.
<<<Output>>>
-9
