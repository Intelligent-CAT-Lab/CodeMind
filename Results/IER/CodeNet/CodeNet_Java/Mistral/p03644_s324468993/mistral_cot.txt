 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 7 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 7 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable i by multiplying it by 2 in each iteration.
After the loop finishes, it assigns the value of variable i to variable i, which is 3.
Then it prints the value of variable i as output, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>
3
