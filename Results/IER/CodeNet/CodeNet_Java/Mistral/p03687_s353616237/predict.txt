The variable strz is initialized with the input "serval".
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 25 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable key.
Inside the for loop, it creates a new char array str of length strz.length and assigns each element of strz to it.
Then it enters a while loop that runs until it finds a character in str that is not equal to key.
Inside the while loop, it checks if all characters in str are equal to key. If they are, it breaks out of the loop.
If they are not, it creates a new char array next of length str.length - 1 and assigns each element of str to it.
It then checks if the length of next is 1. If it is, it breaks out of the loop.
If it is not, it checks if the first character of next is equal to key. If it is, it breaks out of the loop.
If it is not, it checks if the second character of next is equal to key. If it is, it breaks out of the loop.
If it is not, it checks if the third character of next is equal to key. If it is, it breaks out of the loop.
If it is not, it checks if the fourth character of next is equal to key. If it is, it breaks out of the loop.
If it is not, it checks if the fifth character of next is equal to key. If it is, it breaks out of the loop.
If it is not, it checks if the sixth character of next is equal to key. If it is, it breaks out of the loop.
If it is not, it checks if the seventh character of next is equal to key. If it is, it breaks out of the loop.
If it is not, it checks if the eighth character of next is equal to key. If it is, it breaks out of the loop.
If it is not, it checks if the ninth character of next is equal to key. If it is, it breaks out of the loop.
If it is not, it checks if the tenth character of next is equal to key. If it is, it breaks out of the loop.
If it is not, it checks if the eleventh character of next is equal to key. If it is, it breaks out of the loop.
If it is not, it checks if the twelfth character of next is equal to key. If it is, it breaks out of the loop.
If it is not, it checks if the thirteenth character of next is equal to key. If it is, it breaks out of the loop.
If it is not, it checks if the fourteenth character of next is equal to key. If it is, it breaks out of the loop.
If it is not, it checks if the fifteenth character of next is equal to key. If it is, it breaks out of the loop.
If it is not, it checks if the sixteenth character of next is equal to key. If it is, it breaks out of the loop.
If it is not, it checks if the seventeenth character of next is equal to key. If it is, it breaks out of the loop.
If it is not, it checks if the eighteenth character of next is equal to key. If it is, it breaks out of the loop.
If it is not, it checks if the nineteenth character of next is equal to key.
