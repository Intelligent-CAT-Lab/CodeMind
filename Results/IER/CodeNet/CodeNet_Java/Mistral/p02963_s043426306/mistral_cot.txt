 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized with 3 according to the input.
It enters a if-else statement and checks if s is equal to 1e18. Since s is not equal to 1e18, it proceeds to the else block.
In the else block, it calculates the value of x and y as follows:
x = 1000000000 - s % 1000000000 = 1000000000 - 3 % 1000000000 = 1000000000 - 0 = 1000000000
y = s / 1000000000 + 1 = 3 / 1000000000 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1
Therefore, the value of x is 1000000000 and the value of y is 1.
It then prints the value of x, y, 1000000000 and 1 to the output.
<<<Output>>>
0 0 1000000000 1
