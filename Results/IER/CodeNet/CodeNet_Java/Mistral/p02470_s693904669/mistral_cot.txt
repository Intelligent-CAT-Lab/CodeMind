 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 6 according to the input. The variable ans is initialized with 1.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to 6 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the count of the number of times num is divisible by i using a while loop. If num is divisible by i, it increments the count variable cnt and divides num by i.
Then it multiplies the variable ans by the factorial of i raised to the power of count minus 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 15.
<<<Output>>>
15
