 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three input values n, m and d. In this case, n is 2, m is 3 and d is 1.
The variable s is calculated as follows:
s = d == 0 ? n : ((n - d) * 2);
s = 1 == 0 ? 2 : ((2 - 1) * 2);
s = 2
The variable s is then used to calculate the output value as follows:
so.println((double) s/n/n*(m-1));
so.println((double) 2/2/2*(3-1));
so.println(2.5)
<<<Output>>>
2.5
