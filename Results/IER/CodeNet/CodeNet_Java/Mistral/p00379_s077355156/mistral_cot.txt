 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable a, variable n and variable m are initialized with 16, 2 and 1000 respectively according to the input. And variable ans is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 1000 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num2.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable num2 by raising the current interger i to the power of variable n using Math.pow() method.
Then it calls the Dudeney() method to calculate the sum of the digits of the current interger num2.
Then it calculates the value of variable x by raising the sum of the digits of num2 plus the value of variable a to the power of variable n using Math.pow() method.
Then it checks if the value of variable num2 is equal to the value of variable x. If it is, it increments the value of variable ans.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 1.
