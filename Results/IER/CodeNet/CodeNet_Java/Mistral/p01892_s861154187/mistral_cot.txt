 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable a, variable b and variable n are initialized with 19, 30 and 3 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable x.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable y by dividing variable a by variable x.
Then it checks if the value of variable y is greater than n or equal to 0. If it is, it calculates the difference between n and a by multiplying n with x and subtracting a. If it is not, it calculates the difference between y and a by multiplying y with x and subtracting a.
Then it checks if the value of y is greater than n or equal to 0. If it is, it calculates the difference between n and a by multiplying n with x and subtracting a. If it is not, it calculates the difference between (y + 1) and a by multiplying (y + 1) with x and subtracting a.
Then it checks if the value of y is less than 0 or greater than n. If it is, it calculates the difference between n and a by multiplying n with x and subtracting a. If it is not, it calculates the difference between (y - 1) and a by multiplying (y - 1) with x and subtracting a.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable min as output, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
