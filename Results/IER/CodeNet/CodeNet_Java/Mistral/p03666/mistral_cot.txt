 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A, variable B, variable C and variable D are initialized with 5, 1, 5, 2 and 4 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 4 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable max and variable min.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the maximum and minimum value of variable B-A based on the current interger i.
Then it checks if the calculated variable B-A falls within the range [min, max]. If it does, it prints "YES" and returns from the function.
After the loop finishes, it prints "NO" as the condition is not met for any value of i.
<<<Output>>>
NO
