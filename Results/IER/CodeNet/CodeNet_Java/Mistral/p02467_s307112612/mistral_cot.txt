 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 12 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to 12 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the prime factorization of the current interger num by calling the method primeFactorize(n).
It then prints the prime factorization of the current interger num.
The prime factorization of 12 is 2 x 2 x 3.
<<<Output>>>
12: 2 2 3
