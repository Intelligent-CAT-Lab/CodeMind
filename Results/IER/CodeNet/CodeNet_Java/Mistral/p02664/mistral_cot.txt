 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable c is initialized with the input string "PD?D??P".
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the string c.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character c[i] is either 'D' or '?'. If it is, it increments the count variable and replaces the character c[i] with 'D'.
After the loop finishes, it prints the modified string c with all the '?' replaced with 'D' and the final character 'P' removed.
The output of the code will be "PD?D?D?P".
<<<Output>>>
PD?D?D?P
