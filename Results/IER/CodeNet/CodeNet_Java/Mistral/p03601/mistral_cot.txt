 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable a, variable b, variable c, variable d, variable e and variable f are initialized with 1, 2, 10, 20, 15 and 200 respectively according to the input.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until 100 * a * waterX <= f.
Inside the while loop, it enters another while loop and it iterates until 100 * a * waterX + 100 * b * waterY <= f.
Inside the second while loop, it calculates the value of water by adding 100 * a * waterX + 100 * b * waterY.
Then it enters another while loop and it iterates until water + c * sugarX <= f.
Inside the third while loop, it calculates the value of sugar by adding c * sugarX + d * sugarY.
Then it checks if sugar * (100 + e) <= e * (water + sugar). If it does, it checks if sugar * (ansWater + ansSugar) >= ansSugar * (water + sugar). If it does, it updates the value of ansWater and ansSugar.
After the third while loop finishes, it increments waterY and sugarX.
After the second while loop finishes, it increments waterX.
After the first while loop finishes, it prints the final value of ansWater and ansSugar.
