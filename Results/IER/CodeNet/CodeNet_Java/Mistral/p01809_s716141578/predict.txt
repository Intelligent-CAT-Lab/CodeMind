The variable p is initialized with 1 and variable q is initialized with 2.
The variable a is calculated by dividing variable q by variable p using the modulo operator (%). The remainder of the division is 0, so variable a is 0.
The variable ret is initialized with 1.
The for loop iterates from 2 to the square root of variable a.
The variable i is initialized with 2 and it is checked if it is a factor of variable a. Since 2 is not a factor of 0, the loop continues to the next iteration.
The variable i is initialized with 3 and it is checked if it is a factor of variable a. Since 3 is not a factor of 0, the loop continues to the next iteration.
The variable i is initialized with 4 and it is checked if it is a factor of variable a. Since 4 is not a factor of 0, the loop continues to the next iteration.
The variable i is initialized with 5 and it is checked if it is a factor of variable a. Since 5 is not a factor of 0, the loop continues to the next iteration.
The variable i is initialized with 6 and it is checked if it is a factor of variable a. Since 6 is not a factor of 0, the loop continues to the next iteration.
The variable i is initialized with 7 and it is checked if it is a factor of variable a. Since 7 is not a factor of 0, the loop continues to the next iteration.
The variable i is initialized with 8 and it is checked if it is a factor of variable a. Since 8 is not a factor of 0, the loop continues to the next iteration.
The variable i is initialized with 9 and it is checked if it is a factor of variable a. Since 9 is not a factor of 0, the loop continues to the next iteration.
The variable i is initialized with 10 and it is checked if it is a factor of variable a. Since 10 is not a factor of 0, the loop continues to the next iteration.
The variable i is initialized with 11 and it is checked if it is a factor of variable a. Since 11 is not a factor of 0, the loop continues to the next iteration.
The variable i is initialized with 12 and it is checked if it is a factor of variable a. Since 12 is not a factor of 0, the loop continues to the next iteration.
The variable i is initialized with 13 and it is checked if it is a factor of variable a. Since 13 is not a factor of 0, the loop continues to the next iteration.
The variable i is initialized with 14 and it is checked if it is a factor of variable a. Since 14 is not a factor of 0, the loop continues to the next iteration.
The variable i is initialized with 15 and it is checked if it is a factor of variable a. Since 15 is not a factor of 0, the loop continues to the next iteration.
The variable i is initialized with 16 and it is checked if it is a factor of variable a. Since 16 is not a factor of 0, the loop continues to the next iteration.
The variable i is initialized with 17 and it is checked if it is a factor of variable a. Since 17 is not a factor of 0, the loop continues to the next iteration.
The variable i is initialized with 18
