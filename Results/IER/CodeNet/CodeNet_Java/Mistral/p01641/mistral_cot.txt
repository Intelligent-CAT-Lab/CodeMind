 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first initializes an array mem of size 10 and a variable pos to 0. It also creates a StringBuilder object sb.
It then reads the input string from the user using the Scanner class and iterates over each character in the string.
For each character, it calculates the index idx by dividing the ASCII value of the character by 10 and taking the integer part.
It then checks the difference between the current position pos and the calculated index idx. If the difference is positive, it appends '<' to the StringBuilder object sb. If the difference is negative, it appends '>' to the StringBuilder object sb.
It then updates the value of pos to the calculated index idx.
It then calculates the difference between the current value of mem[pos] and the current character c. If the difference is positive, it appends '-' to the StringBuilder object sb. If the difference is negative, it appends '+' to the StringBuilder object sb.
It then updates the value of mem[pos] to the current character c.
It then appends '.' to the StringBuilder object sb.
Finally, it prints the value of the StringBuilder object sb.
