The variable n is initialized with 3 according to the input. And variable ret is a 2D integer array of size n x n.
It enters a dfs function and it starts from the leftmost element of the array. It iterates through the array and fills the elements with the current level of the dfs.
The dfs function is called recursively until the leftmost element is reached.
