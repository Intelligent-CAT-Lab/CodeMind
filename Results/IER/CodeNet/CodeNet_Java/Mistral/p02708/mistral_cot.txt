 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and variable k are initialized with 3 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable f.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable f by multiplying i with (i-1)/2.
Then it calculates the value of variable l by multiplying (n*2-i+1) with i/2.
Then it calculates the value of variable add by subtracting f from l and adding 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable add as output, which is 1.
