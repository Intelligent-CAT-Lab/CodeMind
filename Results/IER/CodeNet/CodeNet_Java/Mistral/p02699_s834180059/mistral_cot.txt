 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers from the user using the Scanner class. The first integer is read using the `nextInt()` method and stored in the variable `a`. The second integer is read using the `nextInt()` method and stored in the variable `b`.
Then it uses the `<=` operator to compare the value of `a` with the value of `b`. If `a` is less than or equal to `b`, it prints "unsafe" otherwise it prints "safe".
<<<Output>>>
safe
