 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n, variable a and variable b are initialized with 2, 5 and 4 respectively according to the input. And variable step is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable cur.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the step required to reach the target sum by repeatedly checking the conditions.
If the sum of the first two elements is equal to the third element, it means that the target sum can be reached by adding 2 to the first two elements. So it sets the step to 2 and breaks out of the loop.
If the sum of the first two elements is not equal to the third element, it means that the target sum can be reached by adding 2 to the first element and 1 to the second element. So it sets the step to 1 and breaks out of the loop.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable step as output, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
