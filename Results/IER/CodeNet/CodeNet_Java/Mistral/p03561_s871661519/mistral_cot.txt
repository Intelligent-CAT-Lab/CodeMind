 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable k and n are initialized with 3 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It enters a if-else statement.
If k is even, it prints k/2 and then it prints n-1 times k.
If k is odd, it creates an ArrayList res and initializes it with (k+1)/2.
Then it enters a for loop and it iterates n/2 times.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the last element of res is greater than 1. If it is, it subtracts 1 from the last element of res and then it adds k to the end of res.
If the last element of res is not greater than 1, it removes the last element of res.
After the for loop finishes, it prints the elements of res.
<<<Output>>>
