 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two double values from the user using the Scanner class. It then calculates the product of these two values and divides it by 3.305785. The result is then printed to the console.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code would be the product of the two input values divided by 3.305785.
For the input `15 25`, the return value would be `(15.0*25.0)/3.305785 = 100.0`.
