 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input from the user using the `Scanner` class. It then uses the `replace()` method to replace the substrings "apple" and "peach" with "wwwp" and "wwwa" respectively.
It then replaces "wwwp" with "peach" and "wwwa" with "apple" using the `replace()` method again.
Finally, it prints the modified string using the `println()` method.

<<<Output>>>
wwwpwwwa

The return value of the code is the modified string "wwwpwwwa" which is the output of the `println()` statement.
