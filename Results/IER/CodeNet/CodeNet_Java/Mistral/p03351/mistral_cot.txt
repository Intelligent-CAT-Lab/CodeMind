 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the Scanner class from the java.util package to read input from the user.
It then creates a new Scanner object named sc and reads four integers a, b, c and d from the user using the nextInt() method.
It calculates the absolute difference between a and b, a and c, and b and c using the Math.abs() method and assigns the values to variables ab, ac and bc respectively.
It then checks if the absolute difference between a and c is less than or equal to d, or if the absolute difference between a and b is less than or equal to d and the absolute difference between b and c is less than or equal to d.
If either of these conditions is true, it prints "Yes" to the console, otherwise it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
