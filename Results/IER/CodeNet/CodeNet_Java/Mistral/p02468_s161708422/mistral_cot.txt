 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable m and variable n are initialized with 2 and 3 respectively according to the input.
It enters a method named modPow which takes two long arguments m and n.
Inside the method, it checks if n is equal to 0, if it is, it returns 1.
If n is even, it recursively calls the method with m * m % mod and n / 2 as arguments.
If n is odd, it recursively calls the method with m * m % mod and (n - 1) / 2 as arguments and then multiplies the result by m % mod.
Then it returns the result of the method.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code would be 11.
