 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 15 according to the input. And variable a and variable b are initialized with 1 and 15-1 respectively.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 15 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable a and variable b.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger a and variable b by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it creates a new array c and it initializes it with the sum of a and b for each iteration of the for loop.
After the loop finishes, it sort the array c in ascending order.
Finally, it print the second element of the sorted array c, which is 1.
