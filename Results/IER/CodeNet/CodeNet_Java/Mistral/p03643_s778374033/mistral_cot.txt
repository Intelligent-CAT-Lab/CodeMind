 <<<Analysis>>>
The code prompts the user to enter an integer n using the `Scanner` class. The user enters the integer `100`.
The `nextInt()` method of the `Scanner` class is used to read the integer input from the user.
The variable `n` is assigned the value `100`.
The `System.out.println("ABC"+n);` statement prints the string "ABC" followed by the value of `n` to the console.
The output of the program would be "ABC100".
<<<Output>>>
ABC100
