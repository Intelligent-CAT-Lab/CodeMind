 <<<Analysis>>>
The input is "3-2*3". The program first checks if the input is a valid expression. It does this by checking if the input contains an equal sign "=". Since the input does not contain an equal sign, the program proceeds to the next step.
The program then checks if the input is a valid expression in the form of "number operator number". In this case, the input is "3-2*3", which is a valid expression.
The program then proceeds to evaluate the expression. It does this by first evaluating the expression inside the parentheses "2*3", which is 6. It then subtracts 6 from 3, which gives a result of -3.
The program returns the result of -3.
<<<Output>>>
-3
