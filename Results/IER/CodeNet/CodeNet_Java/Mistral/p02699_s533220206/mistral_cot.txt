 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers from the standard input using the Scanner class. The first integer is read using the `nextInt()` method and stored in the variable `a`. The second integer is read using the `nextInt()` method and stored in the variable `b`.
Then it compares the value of `a` with `b` using the `>` operator. If `a` is greater than `b`, it prints "safe" to the standard output. Otherwise, it prints "unsafe" to the standard output.
<<<Output>>>
safe
