 <<<Analysis>>>
The code prompts the user to enter two integers using the `Scanner` class. The first integer is read using the `nextInt()` method and stored in the variable `a` and the second integer is read using the `nextInt()` method and stored in the variable `b`.
Then it calculates the sum of the two integers by adding the value of `a` and `b` and stores it in the variable `sum`.
Finally, it divides the sum by 2 and prints the result using the `System.out.println()` method.
