 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers from the user using the `Scanner` class and stores them in the variables `a` and `b`.
Then it calculates the average of these two integers by adding them and dividing by 2.
The result is then printed to the console using the `System.out.println()` method.
<<<Output>>>
5000.0
