 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and variable m are initialized with 2 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It enters an if statement and checks if the absolute difference between n and m is greater than 1. Since it is not, it proceeds to the next block of code.
It then calls the solve method with n and m as arguments.
The solve method takes two arguments, max and x, and uses a while loop to calculate the answer. It multiplies max by x and then multiplies the result by x again. It then subtracts 1 from both max and x and repeats the process until max is equal to 1.
After the solve method returns the answer, it is added to the answer variable and then divided by 1000000007 to get the final answer.
