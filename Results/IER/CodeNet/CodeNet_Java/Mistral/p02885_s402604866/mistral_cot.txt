 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable yoko is initialized with 12 and variable a is initialized with 4 according to the input.
It calculates the sum of yoko and 2*a by subtracting 2*a from yoko.
The condition yoko - 2*a> 0 is met, so the sum is calculated as 12 - 2*4 = 4.
Then it prints the value of variable sum as output, which is 4.
