 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the Scanner class from the java.util package. It then creates a new instance of the Scanner class by calling the constructor and passing System.in as an argument.
It then reads two integers x and y from the user using the nextInt() method of the Scanner class.
It then checks if x is divisible by y using the modulo operator (%). If x is divisible by y, it prints -1, otherwise it prints x.
It then closes the scanner object using the close() method.
<<<Output>>>
-1
