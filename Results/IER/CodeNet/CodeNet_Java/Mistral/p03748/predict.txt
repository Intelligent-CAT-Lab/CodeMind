The variable n and variable m are initialized with 2 and 3 respectively according to the input.
It creates a 3D array dp of size 2 x (n+1) x 2.
It initializes the first element of dp[0][0][1] with 1.
It initializes the first n elements of dp[0][i][0] with 1.
It initializes the first m elements of dp[i%2][j][0] with 1.
It initializes the first m elements of dp[i%2][j][1] with 1.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to m to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to n to check each integer j in this range.
Inside the second for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer k in this range.
