The variable n and variable m are initialized with 2 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable result.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of result by multiplying the value of factorial[n] and revFactorial[i] and revFactorial[n - i] and factorial[m] and revFactorial[m - i] and revFactorial[m - n] and revFactorial[m - n] and factorial[m - i] and revFactorial[m - i] and revFactorial[m - n] and revFactorial[m - n] and revFactorial[m - i] and revFactorial[m - i] and revFactorial[m - i] and revFactorial[m - i] and revFactorial[m - i] and revFactorial[m - i] and revFactorial[m - i] and revFactorial[m - i] and revFactorial[m - i] and revFactorial[m - i] and revFactorial[m - i] and revFactorial[m - i] and revFactorial[m - i] and revFactorial[m - i] and revFactorial[m - i] and revFactorial[m - i] and revFactorial[m - i] and revFactorial[m - i] and revFactorial[m - i] and revFactorial[m - i] and revFactorial[m - i] and revFactorial[m - i] and revFactorial[m - i] and revFactorial[m - i] and revFactorial[m - i] and revFactorial[m - i] and revFactorial[m - i] and revFactorial[m - i] and revFactorial[m - i] and revFactorial[m - i] and revFactorial[m - i] and revFactorial[m - i] and revFactorial[m - i] and revFactorial[m - i] and revFactorial[m - i] and revFactorial[m - i] and revFactorial[m - i] and revFactorial[m - i] and revFactorial[m - i] and revFactorial[m - i] and revFactorial[m - i] and revFactorial[m - i] and revFactorial[m - i] and revFactorial[m - i] and revFactorial[m - i] and revFactorial[m - i] and revFactorial[m - i] and revFactorial[m - i] and revFactorial[m - i] and revFactorial[m - i] and revFactorial[m - i] and revFactorial[m - i] and revFactorial[m - i] and revFactorial[m - i] and revFactorial[m - i] and revFactorial[m - i] and revFactorial[m - i] and revFactorial[m - i] and revFactorial[m - i] and revFactorial[m - i] and revFactorial[m - i] and revFactorial[m - i] and revFactorial[m - i] and revFactorial[m - i] and revFactorial[m - i] and revFactorial[m - i] and revFactor
