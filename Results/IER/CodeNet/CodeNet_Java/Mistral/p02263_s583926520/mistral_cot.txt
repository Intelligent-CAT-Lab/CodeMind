 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized with the input "1 2 +".
It enters a while loop and it iterates until it has no more input.
Inside the loop, it checks if the current string s is a number using the isNumber() method. If it is, it converts it to a long and adds it to the list.
If it is not a number, it checks if it is an operator "+", "-" or "*". If it is an operator, it performs the corresponding operation on the last two elements of the list and adds the result to the list.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of the first element of the list, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>
