 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized with the input string "RRLRL".
It enters a while loop and it iterates until the string s does not contain the substring "LR".
Inside the while loop, it finds the index of the first occurrence of the substring "LR" in the string s using the method indexOf().
It then finds the last index of the first occurrence of the substring "RL" in the string s using the method lastIndexOf().
It extracts the first occurrence of the substring "RL" in the string s using the method substring() and stores it in the variable firstRLBlock.
It then removes the first occurrence of the substring "RL" in the string s using the method substring() and stores it in the variable s.
It calls the method makeSubResult() with the variable firstRLBlock as an argument and stores the result in the variable result.
It then calls the method makeSubResult() again with the variable s as an argument and stores the result in the variable result.
Finally, it prints the result of the concatenation of the two substrings result using the method toString().
