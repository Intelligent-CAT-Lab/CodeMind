 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and variable m are initialized with 2 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable prod.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the product of variable prod by multiplying variable fact[n], variable inv[i], variable inv[n-i], variable fact[m-i] and variable inv[m-n] and then taking the modulo with variable num.
Then it adds the calculated product to variable ans.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 0.
<<<Output>>>
0
