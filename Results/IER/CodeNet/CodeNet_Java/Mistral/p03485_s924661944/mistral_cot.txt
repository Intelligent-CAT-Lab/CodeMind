 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the java.util package and creates a class named Main.
In the main method, it creates a Scanner object named s to read input from the user.
It then reads two integers from the user using the nextInt() method of the Scanner class and stores them in the variables n1 and n2.
It calculates the average of n1 and n2 by dividing the sum of n1 and n2 by 2.0 and then converting the result to an integer using the ceil() method of the Math class.
It then prints the calculated average value using the println() method of the System.out class.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code would be 2.5.
