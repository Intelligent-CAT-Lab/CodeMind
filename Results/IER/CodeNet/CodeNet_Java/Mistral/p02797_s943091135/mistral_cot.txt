The variable N, variable K and variable S are initialized with 4, 2 and 3 respectively according to the input. And variable ans is initialized with an array of size N.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it checks if i is less than or equal to K. If it is, it assigns the value of S to the current integer i. If it is not, it assigns the value of S+1 to the current integer i.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl array ans as output, which is [1, 2, 3, 4].
<<<Output>>>
[1, 2, 3, 4]
