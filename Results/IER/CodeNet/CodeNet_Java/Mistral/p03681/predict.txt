The return value of the code would be the sum of the digits of `n` and `m`. If the sum is greater than or equal to `2` and `m`, it would print the value of `sum`.

For example, if `n` is `2` and `m` is `2`, the sum of the digits of `n` and `m` is `4`, which is greater than or equal to `2` and `2`, so the code would print `4`.

Therefore, the return value of the code would be `4`.
