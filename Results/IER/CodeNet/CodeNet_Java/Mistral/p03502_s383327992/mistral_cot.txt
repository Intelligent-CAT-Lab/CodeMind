 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized with the input `12`. The variable c is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 11 to check each character in the input string s. The value of each character is subtracted by 48 and added to variable c.
After the loop finishes, it checks if the remainder of the division of variable d (which is 12) by variable c is 0. Since 12 % 0 is 0, the condition is met and it prints "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
