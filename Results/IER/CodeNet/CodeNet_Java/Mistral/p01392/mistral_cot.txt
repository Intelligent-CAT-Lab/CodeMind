 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable A and variable B are initialized with 18 and 2 respectively according to the input. And variable L and H are calculated as 2 and 20 respectively.
The variable primes is initialized with the prime numbers between 2 and 20, which are [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19].
It enters a for loop and it iterates from the last prime number to the first prime number.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable div by dividing L and p - 1 by p.
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from div \* p to H.
Inside the inner for loop, it calculates the value of variable cc by counting the number of times p divides v.
If the count of p in v is greater than the count of p in count[(int) (pos - L)], it sets ok[(int) (pos - L)] to false.
Then it updates the count of p in count[(int) (pos - L)].
After the inner for loop finishes, it checks if ok[(int) (pos - L)] is true. If it is, it increments the value of variable ret.
After the outer for loop finishes, it prints the value of variable ret.
