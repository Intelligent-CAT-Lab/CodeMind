 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable a is initialized with 5 according to the input.
It enters an if-else statement to check the value of variable a.
When a is 0, it prints the value of prepre, which is 2.
When a is 1, it prints the value of pre, which is 1.
When a is greater than 1, it enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to a-1.
Inside the for loop, it assigns the value of prepre to pre and the value of pre to now.
Then it calculates the value of now by adding prepre and pre.
After the loop finishes, it prints the value of now, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
