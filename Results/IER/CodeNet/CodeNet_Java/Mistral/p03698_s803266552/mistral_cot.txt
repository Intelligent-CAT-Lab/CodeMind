 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized with the input "uncopyrightable". The length of the string is calculated and stored in variable s.length().
Then it creates a new array of characters c with the same length as s. The string s is converted to a character array c using the toCharArray() method.
The array c is then sorted using the Arrays.sort() method.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to s.length()-2 to check each pair of characters in the array c.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character c[i] is equal to the next character c[i+1]. If it is, it prints "no" and returns immediately.
After the loop finishes, it prints "yes" because no two characters in the string are equal.
<<<Output>>>
yes
