 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 127 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 127 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable pow6 and pow9.
Inside the for loop, it calls the calc function with variable n as argument.
The calc function first checks if memo[n] is not equal to -1, if it is not, it means that the value of n has already been calculated before and it returns the memoized value.
Then it initializes variable res with n.
It enters two nested for loops, one for pow6 and one for pow9. In each loop, it calculates the minimum value of res and calc(n - pow6) + 1 or calc(n - pow9) + 1 respectively.
It updates the value of res with the minimum value calculated in each loop.
After the loops finish, it memoizes the value of n by storing it in memo[n] and returns it.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code would be 127.
