 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable a and variable b are initialized with -13 and 3 respectively according to the input.
It first calculates the sum of a and b and assigns it to variable max.
Then it checks if the value of max is less than the difference between a and b. If it is, it assigns the difference between a and b to variable max.
Then it checks if the value of max is less than the product of a and b. If it is, it assigns the product of a and b to variable max.
After the if-else statements, it prints the final value of variable max as output.
<<<Output>>>
-12
