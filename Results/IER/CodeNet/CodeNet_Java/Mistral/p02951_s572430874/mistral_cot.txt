 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integer inputs a, b and c from the user using the Scanner class.
It then calculates the difference between the maximum of a and b and the minimum of a and b, and assigns it to variable max.
It then checks if the value of c is less than the value of max. If it is, it prints 0, otherwise it prints the value of c - max.
In this case, the value of a is 6, the value of b is 4 and the value of c is 3.
The maximum of a and b is 6, the minimum of a and b is 4.
The difference between the maximum of a and b and the minimum of a and b is 6 - 4 = 2.
Since c is less than the value of max, it prints 0.
