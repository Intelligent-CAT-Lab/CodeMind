 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable A, variable B and variable C are initialized with 1, 2 and 3 respectively according to the input. And variable K is initialized with 1.
It enters an if-else statement to check if the absolute difference between A and B is greater than 1000000000000000000L. If it is, it prints "Unfair".
If it is not, it checks if K is even or odd. If it is even, it prints the absolute difference between A and B. If it is odd, it prints the absolute difference between B and A.
In this case, the absolute difference between A and B is 1, which is less than 1000000000000000000L, so it enters the else block.
Since K is odd, it prints the absolute difference between B and A, which is 1.
