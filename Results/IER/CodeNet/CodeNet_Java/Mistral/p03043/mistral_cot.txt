 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and variable K are initialized with 3 and 10 respectively.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to n to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable val.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable cnt by calling the calc() method with variable K and variable i as arguments.
Then it calculates the value of variable wk by dividing 1 by the product of variable cnt and variable N.
Finally, it adds the value of variable wk to the variable ans.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 0.0.
<<<Output>>>
0.0
