 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 25 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 25 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable head and tail.
Inside the for loop, it increments the value of array[tail][head] by 1.
Then it calculates the number of occurrences of each digit by iterating through the array.
It then iterates through the array again and adds the number of occurrences of each digit to the result variable.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable result as output, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
