The variable N and K are initialized with 2 and 2 respectively according to the input.
The variable fac and rev are initialized with 1 and 1 respectively.
The variable comb is a static method that calculates the number of combinations of choosing k elements from a set of n elements.
The variable pow is a static method that calculates the power of a number a raised to the power of b modulo the modulus.
The variable init is a static method that initializes the values of fac and rev.
The variable dp is a 2D array that stores the number of ways to choose k elements from a set of n elements.
The variable mod is a constant that represents the modulus.
The program enters a for loop that iterates from 0 to N.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of fac[i] and rev[i] using the init method.
Then it enters another for loop that iterates from 0 to N.
Inside the inner for loop, it calculates the value of dp[i][j] using the formula dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1]*comb(i+j*(K-1)-1, K-2).
It also calculates the value of dp[i][j] modulo the modulus.
After the loops finish, it calculates the final value of dp[N][N] and prints it as output.
