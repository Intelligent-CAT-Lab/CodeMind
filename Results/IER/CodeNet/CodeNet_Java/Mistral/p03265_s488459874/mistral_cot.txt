 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable x1, variable y1, variable x2 and variable y2 are initialized with 0, 0, 0 and 1 respectively according to the input.
It enters a series of calculations to find the coordinates of the points on the line that passes through the points (0,0) and (0,1).
It first calculates the slope of the line using the formula v1y = y2 - y1, which gives v1y = 1.
Then it calculates the y-intercept of the line using the formula x2 - x1 = -v1y, which gives x4 = 0.
Then it calculates the x-coordinate of the point where the line intersects the x-axis using the formula y = mx + b, where m is the slope of the line and b is the y-intercept, which gives y4 = 1.
Then it calculates the x-coordinate of the point where the line intersects the y-axis using the formula x = -b/m, which gives x3 = 0.
Finally it prints the coordinates of the points (x3, y3) and (x4, y4) as output, which are (0, 0) and (0, 1) respectively.
