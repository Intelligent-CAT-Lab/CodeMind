 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first creates a Scanner object to read input from the user. It then reads three integers from the user using the `nextInt()` method of the Scanner object and stores them in an array `in`.
The array `in` is then sorted using the `Arrays.sort()` method.
The code then checks if the first element of the sorted array is equal to 5, the second element is also equal to 5 and the third element is equal to 7. If all these conditions are met, it prints "YES" otherwise it prints "NO".
<<<Output>>>
NO
