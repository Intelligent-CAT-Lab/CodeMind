 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized with the input string "1118".
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to s.length()-1 to check each character of the string.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character is different from the previous character. If it is, it breaks out of the loop.
It also checks if the current character is the third character of the string. If it is, it prints "Yes" and returns immediately.
After the loop finishes, it prints "No" because none of the conditions were met.
<<<Output>>>
No
