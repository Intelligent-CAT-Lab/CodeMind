 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable mjs is initialized with 0 according to the input.
It enters an if-else statement to check the value of variable mjs.
If mjs is 0, it prints "1" to the console.
If mjs is 1, it prints "2" to the console.
If mjs is 2, it prints "1" to the console.
If mjs is greater than or equal to 3, it prints "0" to the console.
Since the input is 0, the if-else statement checks the first condition and prints "1" to the console.
