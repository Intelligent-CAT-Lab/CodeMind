 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n, variable a and variable b are initialized with 5, 1 and 5 respectively according to the input. And variable c and variable d are initialized with 2 and 4 respectively.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 4 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the difference between variable a and variable b.
Then it checks if the calculated variable diff falls within the range [2, 4]. If it does, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 1 to 4 to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable dw and variable up.
It calculates the value of variable dw and variable up by multiplying variable c and variable n-1-i and subtracting variable d * i and variable d * (n-1-i) respectively.
Then it checks if the calculated variable dw and variable up fall within the range [2, 4]. If it does, it sets the variable isOK to true and breaks out of the inner for loop.
After the inner for loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable isOK as output, which is false.
<<<Output>>>
false
