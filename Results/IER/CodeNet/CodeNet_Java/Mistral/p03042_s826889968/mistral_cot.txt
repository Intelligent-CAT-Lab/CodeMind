 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable number\_input is initialized with 1905 according to the input.
It calculates the upper and lower digits of the number by dividing the number\_input by 100 and taking the remainder respectively.
The upper digit is 19 and the lower digit is 05.
It checks the conditions of the if-else statements.
Since the upper digit is 19 which is greater than 12, the first if-else statement is not met.
Since the lower digit is 05 which is less than 12, the second if-else statement is not met.
Since the upper digit is 19 which is greater than 12, the third if-else statement is not met.
Since none of the conditions are met, the last if-else statement is executed and the output is "NA".
<<<Output>>>
NA
