 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable val is initialized with 12 according to the input.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until the value of variable val is less than or equal to a*a.
Inside the while loop, it checks if the value of variable val is divisible by variable a. If it is, it prints the value of variable a and divides the value of variable val by variable a.
If it is not divisible by variable a, it increments the value of variable a.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable val as output, which is 12.
<<<Output>>>
12
