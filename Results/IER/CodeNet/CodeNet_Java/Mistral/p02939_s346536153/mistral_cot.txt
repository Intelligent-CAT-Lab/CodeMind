The variable s is initialized with the input string "aabbaa". The variable ans is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the string s.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character is the second last character of the string. If it is, it checks if the current character is equal to the next character. If it is, it increments the variable i to skip the next character.
If the current character is not the second last character, it checks if the current character is equal to the next character. If it is, it increments the variable ans and also increments the variable i to skip the next character.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 3.
