 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input from the user and removes all the parentheses from it. It then converts the string to a character array and iterates through it to find the index of the first asterisk.
It then calculates the left and right indices of the substring between the first asterisk and the next asterisk or the end of the string.
It then iterates through the substring and counts the number of closing parentheses it encounters.
In this case, the input string is `((*)())`, the first asterisk is found at index 2, the left index is 1 and the right index is 4.
It then iterates through the substring `(())` and counts the number of closing parentheses, which is 2.
The return value of the code is 2.
