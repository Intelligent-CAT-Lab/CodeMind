 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable x is initialized with 8 according to the input.
It then converts the value of x to binary string using the Long.toBinaryString() method and stores it in variable twobit.
It then left shifts the binary string of x by 1 bit using the <<1 operator and stores it in variable left.
It then right shifts the binary string of x by 1 bit using the >>1 operator and stores it in variable right.
It then converts the binary string of twobit, left and right to 32-bit string using the to32() method and stores it in variable twobit, left and right respectively.
It then prints the binary string of twobit using a for loop to check if each bit is 0 or 1.
It then prints the concatenation of left and right variable.
