The code reads an integer input from the user using the Scanner class and stores it in variable D.
It then checks the value of variable D using a series of if-else statements.
If the value of variable D is 25, it prints "Christmas" as output.
If the value of variable D is 24, it prints "Christmas Eve" as output.
If the value of variable D is 23, it prints "Christmas Eve Eve" as output.
If the value of variable D is 22, it prints "Christmas Eve Eve Eve" as output.
