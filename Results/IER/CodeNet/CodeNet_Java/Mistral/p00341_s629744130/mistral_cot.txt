 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable e is initialized with 12 according to the input. And variable t is initialized with an array of size 12.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 11 to assign the input values to variable t.
It enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 10. Inside this loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 10 - x.
Inside the inner loop, it compares the current element of array t with its next element. If the current element is less than the next element, it swaps the current element with the next element.
After the inner loop finishes, it checks if all elements of array t are equal. If they are, it prints "yes", otherwise it prints "no".
<<<Output>>>
no
