 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N and variable M are initialized with 1 and 6 respectively according to the input.
It enters an if statement and it checks if N is greater than M. Since N is less than M, it moves to the next if statement.
It enters another if statement and it checks if N is equal to 1 and M is equal to 1. Since N is not equal to 1 and M is not equal to 1, it moves to the next if statement.
It enters another if statement and it checks if N is equal to 2 and M is equal to 1. Since N is not equal to 2 and M is not equal to 1, it moves to the next if statement.
It enters another if statement and it checks if N multiplied by 2 is greater than M. Since N multiplied by 2 is less than M, it moves to the next if statement.
It assigns the value of N + ((M - N * 2) / 4) to variable ans.
It calculates the value of ans as 3.
After the if statements, it prints the value of variable ans as output, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>
3
