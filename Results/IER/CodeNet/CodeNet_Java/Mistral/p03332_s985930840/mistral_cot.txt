The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized with 4, 1 and 2 respectively according to the input. And variable K is initialized with 5.
The variable fact and factInv are initialized with 1 and inv(1) respectively.
The variable comb is initialized with 1 and factInv[N] * factInv[0] % MOD * factInv[N - 1] % MOD.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 4 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable b.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable b by subtracting A * i from K and dividing it by B.
Then it checks if variable b is within the range [0, 4]. If it is, it adds the value of variable comb[i] * comb[(int)b] % MOD to variable ans. The condition is met when i is 0, 1, 2 and 3.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
