 <<<Analysis>>>
The program reads two integers from the standard input using the `InputUtil` class. The first integer is 3 and the second integer is 2.
The program then calls the `solve()` method of the `Main` class, passing in the values of N and K as arguments.
The `solve()` method calculates the value of `baisuu` by dividing N by K. It then calculates the value of `ans` by multiplying `baisuu` by itself three times.
If K is even, it checks if N is greater than or equal to K/2. If it is, it increments `baisuu` and adds it to the value of `ans`.
Finally, the program calls the `output()` method of the `Main` class to print the value of `ans` to the standard output.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is 12.
