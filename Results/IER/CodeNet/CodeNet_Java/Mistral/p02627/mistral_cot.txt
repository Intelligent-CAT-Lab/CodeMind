 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input from the user using the Scanner class and stores it in the variable str.
Then it uses the `matches()` method of the String class to check if the string contains only uppercase letters.
If it does, it prints "A" otherwise it prints "a".
In this case, the input string is "B" which contains only one uppercase letter "B", so the `matches()` method returns true and the code prints "A".
<<<Output>>>
A
