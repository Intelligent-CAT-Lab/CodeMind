The variable n is initialized with the length of the input string, which is 14. The variable p is initialized with 2019.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 14 to 0 to calculate the value of d[i] for each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of d'[i] by multiplying the value of c[i] with 10^i (mod 2019) and then calculates the value of d[i] by accumulating the values of d'[i] and d[i-1] (mod 2019).
It then enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to n-1 to calculate the value of d[i] for each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of d'[i] by multiplying the value of c[i] with 10^i (mod 2019) and then calculates the value of d[i] by accumulating the values of d'[i] and d[i-1] (mod 2019).
It then creates a map to store the frequency of each value of d[i].
It then iterates through the map and calculates the number of pairs of values that have the same frequency using the formula nC2.
Finally, it prints the value of ans, which is 1.
