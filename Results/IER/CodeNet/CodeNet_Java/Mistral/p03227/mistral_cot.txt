 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable a is initialized with the input "abc". The variable c is initialized with the length of the input string "abc", which is 3.
It enters a if statement and checks if the length of the input string is 3. Since it is, it assigns the value of the first element of the array b to the variable str, assigns the value of the last element of the array b to the first element of the array b, and assigns the value of the second element of the array b to the last element of the array b.
Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to print each element of the array b.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of the array b as output, which is "abc".
<<<Output>>>
abc
