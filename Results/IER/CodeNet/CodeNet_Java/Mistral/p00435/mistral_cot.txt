 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input from the user using the `Scanner` class and stores it in the variable `s`.
It then iterates through each character in the string using a for loop and for each character, it subtracts 42 from it and takes the modulo with 26. If the result is negative, it adds 26 to it. Then it adds 65 to the result to convert it back to an ASCII character.
The resulting character is then appended to the string `s`.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of the string `s` as output.
