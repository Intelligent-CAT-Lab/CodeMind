 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n, variable a and variable b are initialized with 10, 3 and 5 respectively according to the input. And variable max and variable min are initialized with 0.
It enters a if statement and it checks if the sum of variable a and variable b is greater than or equal to variable n. If it is, it sets the value of variable min to be the difference between the sum of variable a and variable b and variable n.
Then it sets the value of variable max to be the smaller of variable a and variable b.
After the if statement finishes, it print the fianl values of variable max and variable min as output, which are 3 2.
<<<Output>>>
3 2
