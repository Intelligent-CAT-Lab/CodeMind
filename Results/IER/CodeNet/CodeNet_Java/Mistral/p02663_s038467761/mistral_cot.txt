 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four integer inputs from the user, H1, M1, H2 and M2, representing the time in hours and minutes of the first and second person. The variable K is also an integer input representing the number of minutes the second person arrives late.
It calculates the difference between the time of the second person and the first person in hours and minutes, and then multiplies the difference in hours by 60 to convert it to minutes.
Then it adds the difference in minutes and subtracts the variable K to get the final answer.
The final answer is then printed to the console.
