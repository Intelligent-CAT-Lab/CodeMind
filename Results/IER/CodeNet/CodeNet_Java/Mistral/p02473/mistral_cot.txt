 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers a and b from the user using the Scanner class. The first integer is read using the `next()` method of the Scanner class and stored in the variable a. The second integer is read using the `next()` method of the Scanner class and stored in the variable b.
Then it subtracts the second integer b from the first integer a using the `subtract()` method of the BigInteger class and stores the result in the variable a.
Finally, it prints the value of the variable a using the `println()` method of the System.out class.
