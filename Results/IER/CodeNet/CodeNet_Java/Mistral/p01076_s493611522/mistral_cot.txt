 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N and variable D are initialized with 4 and 3 respectively according to the input.
It enters an if-else statement to check the value of variable D.
If D is equal to 1, it calculates the answer by multiplying N with N-1 and dividing it by 2.
If D is not equal to 1, it calculates the answer by first finding the value of dense by subtracting D from N. Then it calculates the answer by multiplying dense with dense-1 and dividing it by 2. Then it adds 2*dense, D-2 to the answer.
After the calculation, it prints the final value of variable ans as output.
