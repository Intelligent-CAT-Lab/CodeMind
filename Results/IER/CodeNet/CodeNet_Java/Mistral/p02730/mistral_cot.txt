 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized with the input "akasaka". The variable arr is initialized with the characters of the string s.
It enters two for loops. The first loop iterates from 0 to s.length()/2-1. The second loop iterates from 0 to s.length()/2-2.
Inside the first loop, it checks if the current character of the string s is equal to the character at the end of the string s. If it is not, it prints "No" and returns immediately.
Inside the second loop, it checks if the current character of the string s is equal to the character at the end of the string s. If it is not, it prints "No" and returns immediately.
After both loops finish, it prints "Yes" and returns immediately.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
