 <<<Analysis>>>
The input string is "?&?|?&?|?&?".
The program first tokenizes the input string into an array of characters using the `sc.next()` method.
Then it calls the `parseOr()` method to parse the input string.
The `parseOr()` method first creates an instance of `ExprOr` class and adds the first `parseAnd()` method to it.
It then enters a while loop that iterates until the end of the input string is reached.
Inside the while loop, it checks if the current character is '|'. If it is, it adds the next `parseAnd()` method to the `ExprOr` object.
After the while loop finishes, it returns the `ExprOr` object.
The `parseAnd()` method first creates an instance of `ExprAnd` class and adds the first `parseTerm()` method to it.
It then enters a while loop that iterates until the end of the input string is reached.
Inside the while loop, it checks if the current character is '&'. If it is, it adds the next `parseTerm()` method to the `ExprAnd` object.
After the while loop finishes, it returns the `ExprAnd` object.
The `parseTerm()` method first checks if the current character is '('. If it is, it creates an instance of `ExprOr` class and adds the next `parseAnd()` method to it.
It then increments the position of the input string and returns the `ExprOr` object.
If the current character is not '(', it creates an instance of `Term` class and increments the position of the input string.
It then returns the `Term` object.
The `Expr` abstract class has two abstract methods `cost0` and `cost1`.
The `ExprOr` class extends the `Expr` class and implements the `cost0` and `cost1` methods.
The `cost0` method returns the maximum value of the cost of all the `ExprAnd` objects in the `ands` list.
The `cost1` method returns the maximum value of the cost of all the `ExprAnd` objects in the `ands` list plus the cost of the current `ExprOr` object.
The `ExprAnd` class extends the `Expr` class and implements the `cost0` and `cost1` methods.
The `cost0` method returns the maximum value of the cost of all the `Term` objects in the `terms` list.
The `cost1` method returns the maximum value of the cost of all the `Term` objects in the `terms` list plus the cost of the current `ExprAnd` object.
The `Term` class extends the `Expr` class and implements the `cost0` and `cost1` methods.
The `cost0` method returns the cost of the `ExprOr` object if it is not null, otherwise it returns 1.
The `cost1` method returns the cost of the `ExprOr` object if it is not null, otherwise it returns 1.

<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code based on the above analysis is:

Or 1 2
And 2 3
Term 1 1

Therefore, the return value of the code based on the above analysis is 3.
