 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and variable k are initialized with 3 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It enters an if-else statement to check if k is even or odd.
If k is even, it calculates the value of x by dividing n by k and then calculates the value of y by dividing (n + k / 2) by k.
Then it calculates the cube of x and y and adds it to variable count.
If k is odd, it calculates the cube of x by dividing n by k and adds it to variable count.
After the if-else statement finishes, it prints the final value of variable count as output, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
