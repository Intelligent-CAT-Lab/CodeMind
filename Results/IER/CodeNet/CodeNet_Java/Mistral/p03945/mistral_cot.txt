 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized with the input string "BBBWW".
It creates an array of strings str with the length of the input string s.
It initializes a counter variable to 0.
It enters a for loop that iterates from 0 to the length of the array str-1.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current element of the array str is not equal to the next element of the array str. If it is not equal, it increments the counter variable.
After the loop finishes, it prints the value of the counter variable, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
