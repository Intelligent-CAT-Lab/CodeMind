 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 10 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from the maximum value of n to 1. The maximum value of n is calculated by taking the square root of n and rounding it up to the nearest integer using the Math.ceil() method.
Inside the for loop, it checks if n is divisible by i. If it is, it calculates the value of x by dividing n by i and then it prints the value of (i - 1) + (x - 1) and returns from the function.
After the loop finishes, it returns without printing anything because none of the values of i from 1 to the maximum value of n are divisors of 10.
<<<Output>>>
No output is returned because none of the values of i from 1 to the maximum value of n are divisors of 10.
