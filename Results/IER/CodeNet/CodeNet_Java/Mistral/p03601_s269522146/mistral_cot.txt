 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads the input as a list of integers, and then it sorts the list in ascending order. It then calculates the sum of the squares of the integers in the sorted list.

The code first reads the input using the `readNums()` method, which returns an array of integers. It then sorts the array using the `sort()` method of the `ArrayList` class.

The code then calculates the sum of the squares of the integers in the sorted array using a for loop. It initializes a variable `sum` to 0, and then iterates over the array, squaring each integer and adding it to the `sum`.

Finally, the code prints the value of `sum` to the console using the `println()` method.

<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code would be the sum of the squares of the integers in the input list, which is 120.
