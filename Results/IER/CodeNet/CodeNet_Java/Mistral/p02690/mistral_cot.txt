 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable x is initialized with 33 according to the input.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until the value of powVal - beforePow is greater than x.
Inside the while loop, it calculates the value of powVal by raising the base to the power of 5.
It then adds the current value of powVal and its corresponding base to the HashMap powMap.
After the while loop finishes, it iterates through the HashMap powMap and checks if the difference between x and the value of each key in the map is present in the map.
If it is, it prints the value of the corresponding base.
In this case, the difference between x and the value of each key in the map is 0, so it prints 0.
<<<Output>>>
