The variable s is initialized with the input "5 8" using the Scanner class.
It then splits the input string s into an array of strings using the split() method.
The first two elements of the array are assigned to the variables a and b respectively.
It then subtracts b from a and assigns the result to variable c.
Finally, it prints the value of variable c using the println() method.
