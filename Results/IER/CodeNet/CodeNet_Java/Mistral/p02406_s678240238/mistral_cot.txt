 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 30 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 30 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable x.
Inside the for loop, it checks if x is divisible by 3. If it is, it prints the current integer i.
If x is not divisible by 3, it enters a while loop and it repeatedly divides x by 10 until it reaches 0. If the last digit of x is 3, it prints the current integer i.
After the loop finishes, it print a newline character to move to the next line.
<<<Output>>>
1 3 9 15 21 27 33 39 45 51 57 63 69 75 81 87 93 99
