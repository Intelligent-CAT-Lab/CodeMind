 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input from the user using the Scanner class and stores it in the variable age.
It then checks if the value of age is equal to 3, 5 or 7 using an if-else statement.
If the value of age is equal to 3, 5 or 7, it prints "YES" to the console. Otherwise, it prints "NO".
Since the input value is 5, the if condition is not met and the code prints "NO" to the console.
<<<Output>>>
NO
