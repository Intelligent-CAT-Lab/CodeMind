 <<<Analysis>>>
The code prompts the user to enter the lengths of the sides of a right triangle. The user inputs 3, 4, and 5.
The variables a, b, and c are assigned the values of the user inputs.
The formula for the area of a right triangle is (base x height) / 2. In this case, the base and height are the two shorter sides of the triangle, which are a and b.
The formula is implemented in the code by multiplying the values of a and b, then dividing the result by 2.
The result is then printed to the console using the System.out.println() method.
