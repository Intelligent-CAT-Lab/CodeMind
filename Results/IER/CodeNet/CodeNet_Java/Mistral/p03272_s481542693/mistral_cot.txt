 <<<Analysis>>>
The program takes two integer inputs n and i from the user using the Scanner class.
It then calculates the output by subtracting i from n and adding 1 to the result.
The output is then printed to the console using the System.out.println() method.
<<<Output>>>
3

The return value of the code is 3, which is the output of the program when n is 4 and i is 2.
