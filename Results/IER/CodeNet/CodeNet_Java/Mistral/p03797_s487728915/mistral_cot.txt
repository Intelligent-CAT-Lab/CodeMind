 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and variable m are initialized with 1 and 6 respectively according to the input.
It enters an if-else statement to check if n * 2 is less than or equal to m.
If it is true, it assigns the value of n to variable c and subtracts n * 2 from variable m.
If it is false, it assigns the value of m / 2 to variable c and sets variable m to 0.
Then it adds the value of m / 4 to variable c.
After the if-else statement, it prints the value of variable c as output, which is 5.
<<<Output>>>
