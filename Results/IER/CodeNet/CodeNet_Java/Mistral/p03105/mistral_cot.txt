 <<<Analysis>>>
The program takes three integers A, B and C as input from the user. In this case, A = 2, B = 11 and C = 4.
The program calculates the value of N by dividing B by A and casting the result to an integer. N = 5.5.
Then it checks if N is greater than C. Since N is not greater than C, it prints the value of N, which is 5.
<<<Output>>>
5
