 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first creates a new instance of class `AOJ0257` and then calls its `doIt()` method.
The `doIt()` method reads input line by line using `in.nextLine()` until there is no more input.
For each input line, it calls the `solve()` method of the `AOJ0257` class and prints the result.
The `solve()` method takes a string input and returns "Open" if the input is "1 1 0" or "0 0 1", otherwise it returns "Close".

For the input "0 0 1", the `solve()` method returns "Close" because it doesn't match the condition of returning "Open".

<<<Output>>>
Close
