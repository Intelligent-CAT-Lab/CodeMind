 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable S is initialized with 15 according to the input. And variable ans is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 15 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current integer i is divisible by 3 or 5 using the modulo operator (%). If it is divisible by either 3 or 5, it skips the current integer i. Otherwise, it adds the current integer i to variable ans.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 30.
<<<Output>>>
30
