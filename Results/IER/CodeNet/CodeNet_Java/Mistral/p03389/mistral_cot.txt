 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable A, variable B and variable C are initialized with 2, 5 and 4 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the maximum value of A, B and C using the Math.max() method and assigns it to variable M.
Then it checks if the sum of A, B and C is even or odd by checking if the remainder of the sum divided by 2 is equal to the remainder of M divided by 2.
If the sum is even, it calculates the return value as (3*M-(A+B+C))/2. If the sum is odd, it calculates the return value as ((3*M+3)-(A+B+C))/2.
In this case, the sum of A, B and C is 11, which is odd. So the return value is ((3*M+3)-(A+B+C))/2 = ((3*M+3)-11)/2.
<<<Output>>>
((3*M+3)-11)/2
