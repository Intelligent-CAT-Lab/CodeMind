 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integer inputs A, B and C from the user.
It then checks if B divided by A is greater than or equal to C. If it is, it prints C. If it is not, it prints B divided by A.
In this case, B/A is 11/2 = 5.5 and C is 4. Since 5.5 is not greater than or equal to 4, the code prints B/A which is 5.5.
<<<Output>>>
5.5
