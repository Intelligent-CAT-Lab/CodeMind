 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable a, variable b, variable c and variable d are initialized with 1, 2, 1 and 1 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the product of the current interger num with variable a, variable b, variable c and variable d and store it in variable p1, p2, p3 and p4 respectively.
Then it calculate the maximum of p1, p2, p3 and p4 and store it in variable ans1 and ans2 respectively.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans1 and ans2 as output, which are 1 and 1 respectively.
<<<Output>>>
1 1
