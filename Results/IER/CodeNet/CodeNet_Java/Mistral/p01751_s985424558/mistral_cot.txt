 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized with 10, 10 and 5 respectively according to the input. And variable y is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 60 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable x.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of x by multiplying i with 60 and adding c.
Then it enters a while loop and it iterates until x-y is greater than or equal to a+b. In each iteration of this loop, it adds the value of a+b to y.
After the while loop finishes, it checks if 1<=x-y && x-y<=a. If it does, it prints the value of x and sets flag to false.
After the for loop finishes, it checks the value of flag. If it is true, it prints -1.
<<<Output>>>
-1
