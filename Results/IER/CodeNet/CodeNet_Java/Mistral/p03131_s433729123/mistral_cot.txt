 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable k, variable a and variable b are initialized with 4, 2 and 6 respectively according to the input.
It enters an if-else statement.
Inside the if statement, it checks if the difference between variable b and variable a is less than or equal to 2 or if variable a is greater than variable k.
Since the difference between variable b and variable a is 4 and variable a is less than variable k, the if statement is not met.
Therefore, it enters the else statement.
Inside the else statement, it calculates the value of variable exchange by dividing the difference between variable k and variable a by 2 and adding 1.
It then calculates the value of variable answer by adding the difference between variable k and variable exchange multiplied by 2, and the value of variable exchange multiplied by the difference between variable b and variable a.
It prints the value of variable answer as output, which is 11.
<<<Output>>>
11
