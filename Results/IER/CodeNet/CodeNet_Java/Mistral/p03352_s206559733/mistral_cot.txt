 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable X is initialized with 10 according to the input.
It enters an if-else statement.
Inside the if-else statement, it first checks if X is equal to 1, 2 or 3. If it is, it prints 1 as output.
If it is not, it initializes an array of integers with size 1000 and fills it with 0.
It then enters a while loop that continues until a is greater than X.
Inside the while loop, it calculates the value of a by multiplying i by itself.
It then enters a for loop that iterates from a to X in increments of i.
Inside the for loop, it adds the current value of j to the array.
After the for loop finishes, it increments i.
After the while loop finishes, it sorts the array in ascending order using the parallelSort() method.
Finally, it prints the last element of the array, which is the largest number in the array, as output.
<<<Output>>>
