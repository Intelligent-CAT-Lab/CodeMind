The variable y2, variable m2, variable d2 and variable y1, variable m1, variable d1 are initialized with 2015, 3, 13, 2015, 3, 13 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 2015 to check each integer y1 in this range. The value of variable y1 is also passed to variable y1s.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable y1a by taking the remainder of y1 divided by 400.
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from 1 to 3 to check each integer m1 in this range. The value of variable m1 is also passed to variable m1a.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable m1a by taking the remainder of m1 divided by 100.
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from 1 to d1 to check each integer d1 in this range. The value of variable d1 is also passed to variable d1a.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable d1a by taking the remainder of d1 divided by 100.
Then it calls the function `get13f` with the values of y1a, m1a and d1a as arguments.
The function `get13f` returns the number of days between y1 and y2, where y1 and y2 are two years in the range [1900, 2100] and y1 is a leap year if y1 % 4 == 0 and y1 % 100 != 0 or y1 % 400 == 0.
It also returns the number of days between m1 and m2, where m1 and m2 are two months in the range [1, 12] and m1 is a leap month if m1 % 4 == 0 and m1 % 100 != 0 or m1 % 400 == 0.
It also returns the number of days between d1 and d2, where d1 and d2 are two days in the range [1, 13] and d1 is a leap day if d1 % 4 == 0 and d1 % 100 != 0 or d1 % 400 == 0.
Then it adds the value returned by the function `get13f` and the number of days between y1s and y2s and returns the final value.
