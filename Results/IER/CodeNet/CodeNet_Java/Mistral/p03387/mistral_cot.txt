 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first creates a Scanner object to read input from the user. It then creates an integer array x of size 3 and reads the three integers from the user using the nextInt() method of the Scanner object.
It then sorts the array x in ascending order using the Arrays.sort() method.
It calculates the value of variable temp using the formula 2*x[2]-x[1]-x[0].
It then checks if the value of temp is odd or even. If it is odd, it calculates the value of ans as (temp+2)/2+1. If it is even, it calculates the value of ans as temp/2.
Finally, it prints the value of ans using the out.println() method.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code for the input `2 5 4` would be 10.
