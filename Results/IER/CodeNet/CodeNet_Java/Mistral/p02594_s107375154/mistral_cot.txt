 <<<Analysis>>>
The code prompts the user to enter an integer `x` using the `Scanner` class. The value of `x` is then read from the user using the `nextInt()` method of the `Scanner` class.
The code then checks if the value of `x` is greater than or equal to 30 using an `if` statement. If the condition is true, the code prints "Yes" to the console. Otherwise, it prints "No".

<<<Output>>>
No
