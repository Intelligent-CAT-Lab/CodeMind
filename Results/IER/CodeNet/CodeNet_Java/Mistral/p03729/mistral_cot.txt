 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads three input strings `a`, `b` and `c` from the user using the `Scanner` class.
It then checks if the last character of `a` is equal to the first character of `b` and if the last character of `b` is equal to the first character of `c`.
If both conditions are true, it prints "YES" otherwise it prints "NO".
<<<Output>>>
NO
