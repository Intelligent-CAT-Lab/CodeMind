 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 6 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 5 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current integer i is equal to n - 1. If it is, it prints the value of the current integer i, which is 5.
After the loop finishes, it prints the value of the current integer i, which is 5.
<<<Output>>>
