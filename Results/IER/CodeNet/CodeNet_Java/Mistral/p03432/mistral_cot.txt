 <<<Analysis>>>
The program reads two integers from the standard input stream. It then calculates the sum of the digits of the two integers and stores it in the variable sum.
It then checks if the sum is between 2 and 5 (inclusive) and if it is, it adds the current integer to the variable answer.
The program then prints the value of the variable answer.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is 10.
