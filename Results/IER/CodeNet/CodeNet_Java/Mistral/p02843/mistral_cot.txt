The variable x is initialized with 615 according to the input.
It enters an if-else statement to check if x is divisible by 100 and if it is divisible by 100, it checks if x is divisible by 5.
It checks if x % 100 <= x / 100 * 5.
It is true because 615 % 100 = 15 and 615 / 100 = 6.15 and 6.15 * 5 = 30.75 which is less than 615.
Therefore, it prints 1 as output.
