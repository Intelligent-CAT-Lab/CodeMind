 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable a and variable b are initialized with 1 and 3 respectively according to the input. And variable tmp is initialized with the product of a and b.
It enters an if-else statement to check if tmp is less than or equal to 0. If it is, it assigns 2 to variable an. Otherwise, it enters another if-else statement to check if a is less than 0. If it is, it calculates the value of tmp by subtracting a from b and adding 1 to it. Then it checks if the value of tmp is odd. If it is, it assigns 1 to variable an. Otherwise, it assigns 0 to variable an.
After the if-else statement, it prints the value of ans[an] as output, which is "Negative".
<<<Output>>>
Negative
