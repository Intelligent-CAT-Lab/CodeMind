 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized with 4, 12 and 20 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 1000000000.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of d, e and f by adding and dividing the variables a, b and c.
Then it updates the values of a, b and c with the values of d, e and f respectively.
It checks if the values of a, b and c are equal. If they are, it prints -1 and exits the loop.
It also checks if any of the variables a, b and c are odd. If any of them are odd, it prints the current value of i and exits the loop.
After the loop finishes, it prints -1 if no odd values were found and 0 if any odd values were found.
