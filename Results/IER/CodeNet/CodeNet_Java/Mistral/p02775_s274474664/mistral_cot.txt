The variable N is initialized with "36" according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable keta.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current integer keta is less than 5. If it is, it returns keta + sum(N, to-1). If it is not, it calls the add(N, to-1) method.
The add(N, to-1) method checks if the current integer keta is less than or equal to 8. If it is, it increments the current integer keta and returns. If it is not, it checks if the current integer keta is equal to 9. If it is, it resets the current integer keta to 0 and decrements i. If it is not, it increments the current integer keta and returns.
The sum(N, to-1) method is called recursively with N and to-1 as arguments. It checks if the current integer keta is less than 5. If it is, it returns keta + sum(N, to-1). If it is not, it calls the add(N, to-1) method.
