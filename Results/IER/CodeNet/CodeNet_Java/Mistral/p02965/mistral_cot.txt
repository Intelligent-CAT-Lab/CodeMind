 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and variable m are initialized with 2 and 2 respectively according to the input. And variable ans is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to 2 to check each integer nOdd in this range.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of cans, cans1 and cans2 using the formula c(x, y) = mul(mul(facts[x + y], factsInv[x]), factsInv[y]), cans1 = mul(facts[x + y], factsInv[y]) and cans2 = mul(x, cans1).
It also checks if nOdd is less than m, if it is, it calculates the value of cans2 by adding the value of cans2 and mul(n - nOdd, cans2 - 1).
Then it adds the value of cans, sub(cans1, cans2) to variable ans.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 0.
<<<Output>>>
0
