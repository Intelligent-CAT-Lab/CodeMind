 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 4 according to the input. And variable res is initialized with 1.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until the sum of variable res is greater than or equal to N.
Inside the while loop, it increments the value of variable res and adds it to variable sum.
After the loop finishes, it check if the value of variable sum is greater than N. If it is, it subtracts the value of variable res from variable sum and decrements the value of variable res.
It creates an array ans of size res+1 and initializes it with values from 1 to res.
Then it calculates the length of the remaining digits by subtracting the sum of digits from N.
It enters another for loop and it iterates from res to res+1-len. It increments the value of ans[j] by 1 for each iteration.
Finally, it creates a PrintWriter object and writes the values of the array ans to the standard output.
