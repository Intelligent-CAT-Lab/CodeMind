 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a line of input from the user using BufferedReader and stores it in the variable str.
Then it checks the value of str using if-else statements.
If str is equal to "A", it prints "T" to the console.
If str is equal to "T", it prints "A" to the console.
If str is equal to "C", it prints "G" to the console.
If str is not equal to any of the above values, it prints "C" to the console.

<<<Output>>>
T
