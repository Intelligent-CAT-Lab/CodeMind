 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integer inputs A, B and C from the user. It then checks if A is equal to B and B is equal to C or if A is not equal to B and B is not equal to C and A is not equal to C.
If all three conditions are true, it prints "No". Otherwise, it prints "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
