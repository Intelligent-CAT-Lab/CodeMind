 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four integer inputs from the user, a, b, c and d.
It calculates the remainder of c divided by b and assigns it to variable cntT. If the remainder is not 0, it increments cntT by 1.
It calculates the remainder of a divided by d and assigns it to variable cntA. If the remainder is not 0, it increments cntA by 1.
Then it compares cntT and cntA and prints "Yes" if cntT is less than or equal to cntA, otherwise it prints "No".
In this case, the input values are 10, 9, 10, 10.
The remainder of 10 divided by 9 is 1, so cntT is 1.
The remainder of 10 divided by 10 is 0, so cntA is 0.
Since cntT is less than or equal to cntA, the output is "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
