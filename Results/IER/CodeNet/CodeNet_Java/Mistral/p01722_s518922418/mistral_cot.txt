 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer n as input and returns the value of the function solve(n). The function solve(n) takes an integer n as input and returns the value of the function based on the value of n.
The function solve(n) checks the value of n and returns 1 if n is 0, 2 if n is 1 and 1 if n is 2. If n is not 0, 1 or 2, it returns 0.
In the main method, it creates an instance of the Main class and calls the run method passing System.in and System.out as arguments. The run method reads the input from System.in and calls the solve method passing the input as argument. The output of the solve method is printed to System.out.
