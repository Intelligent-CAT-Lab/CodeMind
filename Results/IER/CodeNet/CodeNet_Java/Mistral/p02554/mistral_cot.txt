 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 2 according to the input. And variable total is calculated as 2^2 modulo 1000000007 = 1. And variable partial is calculated as 2^2 modulo 1000000007 = 1. And variable both is calculated as 8 modulo 1000000007 = 8. And variable ans is calculated as (total - partial + both) modulo 1000000007 = (1 - 1 + 8) modulo 1000000007 = 9.
So the return value of the code would be 9.
<<<Output>>>
