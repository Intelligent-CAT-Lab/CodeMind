 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable a, variable b and variable x are initialized with 4, 8 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It enters a try-catch block to read the input from the user.
It reads the input from the user and splits it into an array of strings using the split() method.
It then converts the first, second and third elements of the array to long data type using the Long.parseLong() method.
It calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger b by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it calculates the difference between the sum of digits of a and the sum of digits of b.
It checks if the remainder of a divided by x is 0. If it is, it decrements the difference.
Finally, it prints the value of the difference between the sum of digits of a and the sum of digits of b.
