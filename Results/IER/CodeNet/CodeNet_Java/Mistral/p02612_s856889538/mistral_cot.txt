 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 1900 according to the input.
It calculates the remainder of n divided by 1000 and assigns it to variable x.
It checks if the value of variable x is greater than 0. If it is, it subtracts the value of x from 1000 and assigns the result to variable answer.
Then it prints the value of variable answer using the `String.valueOf()` method.
<<<Output>>>
1000
