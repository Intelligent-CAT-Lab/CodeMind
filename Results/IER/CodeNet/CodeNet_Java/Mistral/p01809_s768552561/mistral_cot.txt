The variable p is initialized with 1 and variable q is initialized with 2.
The variable a is calculated by dividing variable q by variable p and storing the result in variable a.
The variable ret is initialized with 1.
The for loop iterates from 2 to 1.
Inside the for loop, it checks if variable a is divisible by variable i. If it is, it multiplies variable ret by variable i and divides variable a by variable i.
The while loop is used to remove the common factors of variable a and variable i.
After the loop finishes, it prints the value of variable ret as output, which is 1.
