The variable str is initialized with the input "1234567876".
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to str.length() - 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable split.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the absolute value of 753 - split.
Then it compares the calculated variable abs with the current value of ans. If abs is less than ans, it updates the value of ans with abs.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 1.
