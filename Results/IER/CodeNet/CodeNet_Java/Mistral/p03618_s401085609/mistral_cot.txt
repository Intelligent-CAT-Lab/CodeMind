 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable a is initialized with the input "aatt" and it is converted to a character array. The length of the array is calculated and stored in variable l.
Then it creates an array x of size 26, where each element is initialized to 0.
It iterates through the characters in the array a and for each character, it increments the corresponding element in the array x by 1.
It calculates the sum of the squares of all the elements in the array x using java.util.stream.LongStream.of(x).map(e->e*e).sum() and stores it in a variable.
Finally, it calculates the return value by adding 2 to the sum of the squares of all the elements in the array x, then multiplying it by l and dividing it by 2.
The return value is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
