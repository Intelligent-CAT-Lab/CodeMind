The variable b1, variable b2 and variable b3 are initialized with 0, 0 and 1 respectively according to the input.
It enters an if-else statement and it checks the condition of the if block first. The condition is met when b1 is 1, b2 is 0 and b3 is 0. So it prints "Close" as output.
Since the condition of the if block is not met, it moves to the else block. The condition of the else block is met when b1 is 0, b2 is 0 and b3 is 1. So it prints "Open" as output.
<<<Output>>>
