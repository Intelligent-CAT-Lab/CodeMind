 <<<Analysis>>>
The program takes two integers a and b as input from the user. It checks if either of the two numbers is divisible by 3 or if the sum of the two numbers is divisible by 3.
It uses the modulo operator (%), which returns the remainder of the division of the left operand by the right operand.
If the remainder of a divided by 3 is 0, it means that a is divisible by 3.
If the remainder of b divided by 3 is 0, it means that b is divisible by 3.
If the remainder of (a + b) divided by 3 is 0, it means that the sum of a and b is divisible by 3.
If any of the above conditions are true, the program prints "Possible". Otherwise, it prints "Impossible".
<<<Output>>>
Impossible
