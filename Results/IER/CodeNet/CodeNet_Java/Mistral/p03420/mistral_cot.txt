 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and K are initialized with 5 and 2 respectively according to the input. And variable ans is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 3 to 5 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger num by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a for loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum falls within the range [2, 5]. If it does, it adds the current interger i to variable ans. The condition is met when i is 3,4 and 5.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
