 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a line of input from the user using BufferedReader and stores it in variable line. It then splits the line into an array of words using the split() method.
It reads the first element of the array of words and stores it in variable F.
It then calculates the temperature in Celsius by subtracting 30 from the temperature in Fahrenheit and dividing the result by 2.
The formula used to convert Fahrenheit to Celsius is (F - 32) x 5/9.
The temperature in Celsius is then printed to the console.
<<<Output>>>
32.0
