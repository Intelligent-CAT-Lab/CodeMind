 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized with the input "atcoder".
It creates a HashSet<Character> set and iterates through each character in the input string s using a for loop. It adds each character to the set.
It then checks if the length of the input string is 26. If it is not, it loops through each character in the alphabet and checks if it is in the set. If it is not, it prints the input string followed by the character and returns.
If the length of the input string is 26, it loops through the input string in reverse order using a for loop. For each character in the input string, it creates two substrings: cutted, which is the substring starting from the current character, and base, which is the substring ending before the current character.
It then removes each character in the cutted substring from the set using another for loop. It then checks if the character at the end of the base substring is in the set. If it is not, it prints the base substring followed by the character and returns.
If the character at the end of the base substring is in the set, it adds each character in the cutted substring back to the set using another for loop.
After the loop finishes, it prints -1 as output.
