 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable D and variable L are initialized with 10 and 5 respectively according to the input.
It enters a while loop and it reads each line of input until it reaches null.
Inside the while loop, it splits the input string with a space delimiter and stores the two integers in variables D and L.
Then it checks if D is divisible by L. If it is, it prints the quotient of D divided by L. If it is not, it prints the quotient of D divided by L plus the remainder of D divided by L.
In this case, D is not divisible by L, so it prints the quotient of 10 divided by 5 plus the remainder of 10 divided by 5, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
