 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the necessary classes: Scanner, HashMap and Map.
It then creates a new Scanner object to read input from the user.
It then creates a new HashMap object and adds three key-value pairs to it.
It then reads the input from the user using the Scanner object and stores it in the variable str.
It then uses the get() method of the HashMap object to retrieve the value associated with the key str.
The value associated with the key str is "Cloudy".
<<<Output>>>
Cloudy
