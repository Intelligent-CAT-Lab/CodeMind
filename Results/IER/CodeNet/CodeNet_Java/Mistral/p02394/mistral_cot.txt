 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable W, variable H, variable x, variable y and variable r are initialized with 5, 4, 2, 2 and 1 respectively according to the input.
It enters a if-else statement to check if the position of the point (x,y) is within the range of the rectangle with the center point (x-r,y-r) and the radius r.
The condition is met when x-r is between 0 and 5, x+r is between 0 and 5, y-r is between 0 and 4 and y+r is between 0 and 4.
Since the point (2,2) is within the range of the rectangle with the center point (2-1,2-1) and the radius 1, the variable judge is set to "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
