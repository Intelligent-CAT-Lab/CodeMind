 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable M and N are initialized with 2 and 3 respectively according to the input. And variable m0 and md are initialized with 1 and 3 respectively. And variable n0 and nd are initialized with 1 and 3 respectively.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable m.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable m by multiplying the value of variable m0 with 58 and adding md. Then it calculates the remainder of the result by dividing it by N+1.
It enters another for loop and it iterates from 1 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable n.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable n by multiplying the value of variable n0 with 58 and adding nd. Then it calculates the remainder of the result by dividing it by M+1.
After the loops finishes, it calls the sort method to sort the values of variable m and variable n in ascending order.
It enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to M to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable cur.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of variable m and variable n by adding the accumulated values of variable m and variable n up to the current value of variable i.
It enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to N to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable cur.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current value of variable j is greater than or equal to 1 and if the sum of variable m and variable n up to the current value of variable i is greater than or equal to the sum of variable m and variable n up to the current value of variable j plus the difference between M and i. If the condition is met, it decrements the value of variable cur.
It returns the final value of variable sum as output, which is 10.
