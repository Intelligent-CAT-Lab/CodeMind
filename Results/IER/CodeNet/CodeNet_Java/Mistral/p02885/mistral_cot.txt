 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable a and variable b are initialized with 12 and 4 respectively according to the input.
It enters an if-else statement and it checks if the value of variable a is greater than 2 times the value of variable b.
Since 12 is greater than 2 times 4, the condition is met and the code executes the first block of code.
It subtracts 2 times the value of variable b from the value of variable a and it prints the result, which is 4.
<<<Output>>>
4
