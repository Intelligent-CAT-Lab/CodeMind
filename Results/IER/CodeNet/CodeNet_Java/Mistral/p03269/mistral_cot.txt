 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable l is initialized with 4 according to the input.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until l is greater than 1.
Inside the while loop, it checks if the current value of l is odd by using the bitwise AND operator. If it is odd, it subtracts the current value of t from k and adds the current value of count, 20 and k to the ArrayList ans.
Then it adds the current value of count, (count+1) and t to the ArrayList ans.
It increments the count variable and shifts the value of l to the right by 1.
It multiplies the value of t by 2 and continues the loop.
After the loop finishes, it prints the value of 20 and the size of the ArrayList ans.
Then it prints the first 19 elements of the ArrayList ans.
Finally, it prints the elements of the ArrayList ans.
