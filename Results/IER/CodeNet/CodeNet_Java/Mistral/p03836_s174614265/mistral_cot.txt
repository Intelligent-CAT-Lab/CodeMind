The variable sx, variable sy, variable tx and variable ty are initialized with 0, 0, 1 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable s and variable t.
Inside the for loop, it calls the move() method and passes the variable s and variable t as arguments.
The move() method calls two other methods moveX() and moveY() and passes the variable s and variable t as arguments.
The moveX() method checks if the value of variable s is less than the value of variable t. If it is, it prints "R" for right. If it is not, it prints "L" for left.
The moveY() method checks if the value of variable s is less than the value of variable t. If it is, it prints "U" for up. If it is not, it prints "D" for down.
After the for loop finishes, it prints the final output, which is "RUDD".
