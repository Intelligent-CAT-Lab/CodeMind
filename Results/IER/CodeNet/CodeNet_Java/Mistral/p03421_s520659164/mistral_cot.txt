 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n, variable A and variable B are initialized with 5, 3 and 2 respectively according to the input. And variable lowerBound is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 3 to check each integer cnt in this range. The value of variable cnt is also passed to variable len.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the length of the current string by taking the minimum of variable B and n-start-A+cnt+1.
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to len-1. It prints the value of lowerBound+len-j in each iteration.
After the loops finishes, it print the final value of variable lowerBound as output, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
