 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the Scanner class from the java.util package.
Then it creates a new Scanner object named stdIn and uses it to read input from the user.
It reads the first input as a string and stores it in variable a.
It then concatenates the string "2018" with the last four characters of variable a using the substring() method and stores the result in variable b.
Finally, it prints the value of variable b using the println() method.
