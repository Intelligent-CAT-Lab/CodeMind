 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable A and variable B are initialized with 2 and 3 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to the maximum value of A and B. The maximum value is calculated using the Math.max() method.
Inside the for loop, it checks if both A and B are divisible by the current interger i. If they are, it assigns the value of i to variable gcd.
After the loop finishes, it calculates the least common multiple of A and B by dividing A and B by gcd and multiplying the result.
Finally, it print the fianl value of variable lcm as output, which is 6.
<<<Output>>>
6
