 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with the input "100" and it is converted to a character array using the `toCharArray()` method.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to n.length-1 to check each character in the array.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character is not equal to '9'. If it is not, it sets the flag variable to true and breaks out of the loop.
After the loop finishes, it calculates the answer by adding the first character of the array (which is '1') to 9 times the length of the array minus 1.
Since the flag variable is not set to true, the answer is calculated as (1-'0')+9*(n.length-1) = 100.
<<<Output>>>
100
