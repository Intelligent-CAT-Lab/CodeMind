 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a line of input from the user, which is split into two integers A and P using the split() method. The split() method splits a string into an array of strings based on a specified delimiter. In this case, the delimiter is a whitespace character.
Then it calculates the sum of P and 3 times A and divides it by 2.
The final output is printed to the console.
