 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized with 5, 2 and 4 respectively according to the input.
It enters an if-else-if statement to check the conditions.
The first condition checks if A is equal to B. Since A is 2 and B is 4, this condition is not met.
The second condition checks if the difference between B and A is even. Since B is 4 and A is 2, the difference is 2, which is not even.
The third condition checks if the difference between B and A is odd. Since B is 4 and A is 2, the difference is 2, which is not odd.
The fourth condition checks if the difference between A and 1 is less than the difference between N and B. Since A is 2 and N is 5, the difference between A and 1 is 1, which is less than the difference between N and B, which is 3.
The fifth condition checks if the difference between N and B is 2. Since N is 5 and B is 4, the difference is 1, which is not 2.
Since none of the conditions are met, the program prints 0.
