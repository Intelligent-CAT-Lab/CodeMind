 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable a, variable b and variable k are initialized with 8, 12 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to the maximum value of a and b, which is 12.
Inside the for loop, it checks if both a and b are divisible by the current interger i. If they are, it increments the count variable.
Then it checks if the count variable is equal to k. If it is, it assigns the current interger i to variable result.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable result as output, which is 6.
<<<Output>>>
6
