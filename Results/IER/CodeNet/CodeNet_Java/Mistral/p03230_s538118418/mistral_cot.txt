 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 3 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to 100000 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger num by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum falls within the range [2, 3]. If it does, it adds the current interger i to variable canner. The condition is met when i is 2 and 3.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable canner as output, which is 5.
<<<Output>>>
5
