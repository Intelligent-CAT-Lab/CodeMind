 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 67 according to the input.
It enters a if-else statement to check if the value of N is between 'A' and 'Z' or 'a' and 'z'.
Since 67 is not a letter, it does not fall within the range of 'A' and 'Z' or 'a' and 'z', so the value of variable r is 0.
It then prints the value of variable r as output, which is 0.
<<<Output>>>
