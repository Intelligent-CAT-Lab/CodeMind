 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 16 according to the input.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until t is 0.
Inside the while loop, it calls the solve() method.
The solve() method calculates the remainder of n divided by 10 and assigns it to variable x.
Then it checks the value of variable x using if-else statements.
If x is 2, 4, 5, 7 or 9, it prints "hon".
If x is 0, 1, 6 or 8, it prints "pon".
If none of the above conditions are met, it prints "bon".
Since x is 6, it prints "pon".
<<<Output>>>
pon
