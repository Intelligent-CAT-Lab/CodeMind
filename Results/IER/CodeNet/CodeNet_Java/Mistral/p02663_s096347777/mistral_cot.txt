 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes five integer inputs from the user, H1, M1, H2, M2 and K.
It calculates the start time by multiplying H1 and M1 and adding it with 60.
It calculates the end time by multiplying H2 and M2 and adding it with 60.
It then calculates the difference between the end time and start time by subtracting the start time from the end time.
Finally, it subtracts the value of K from the calculated difference to get the final output.
<<<Output>>>
