 <<<Analysis>>>
The program takes two integer inputs k and x from the user. It then calculates the minimum and maximum values that can be obtained by adding or subtracting k from x.
It then uses a for loop to iterate from the minimum value to the maximum value and prints each value with a space in between.
<<<Output>>>
