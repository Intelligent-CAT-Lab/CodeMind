The variable n, variable x and variable t are initialized with 20, 12 and 6 respectively according to the input.
It enters an if-else statement to check if n is divisible by x.
If n is divisible by x, it calculates the value of ans by dividing n by x and multiplying the result by t.
If n is not divisible by x, it calculates the value of ans by dividing n by x and adding 1 to the result, then multiplying the result by t.
After the calculation, it prints the value of ans as output.
<<<Output>>>
