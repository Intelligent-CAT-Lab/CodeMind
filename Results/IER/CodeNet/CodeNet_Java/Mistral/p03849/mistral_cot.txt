 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 3 according to the input.
The function f(n) is called with n as an argument.
Inside the function, it first checks if the value of n is already present in the HashMap mb. If it is, it returns the value associated with n from the HashMap.
If n is less than or equal to 2, it returns n itself.
Otherwise, it calculates the value of n by adding the values of f(n/2), f((n-1)/2) and f((n+1)/2). It then calculates the remainder of the result by dividing it by the value of MOD.
Finally, it stores the calculated value of n in the HashMap mb with n as the key and the calculated value as the value.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the function f(3) is 6.
