 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and variable k are initialized with 3 and 10 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable tmp.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable p by repeatedly multiplying 0.5 and 2 until tmp is less than k.
Then it adds the value of variable p divided by n to the variable ans.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 0.5.
<<<Output>>>
0.5
