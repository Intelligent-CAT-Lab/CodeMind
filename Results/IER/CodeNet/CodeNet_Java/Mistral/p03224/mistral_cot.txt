 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 3 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 3 to check each integer l in this range. The value of variable l is also passed to variable N.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable N by subtracting the current value of variable l from it.
Then it checks if the value of variable N is equal to the value of variable l. If it is not, it prints "No" and returns.
After the loop finishes, it prints "Yes" and the value of variable l+1, which is 4.
It then creates a 2D array called answer with dimensions (l+1) x (l).
It enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to l.
Inside the for loop, it creates a StringBuilder object called string and it appends the value of variable l to it.
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to i-1.
Inside this loop, it appends a space and the value of the element at position (j, i-1) of the answer array to the string.
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from i to l.
Inside this loop, it appends a space and the value of Index++ to the string.
Finally, it prints the string.
