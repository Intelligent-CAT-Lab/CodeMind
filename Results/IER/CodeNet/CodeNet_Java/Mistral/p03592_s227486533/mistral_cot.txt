 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n, variable m and variable k are initialized with 2, 2 and 2 respectively according to the input. And variable p1 and variable q are initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer p1 in this range.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer q in this range.
It calculates the value of expression p1 \* m + q \* n - 2 \* p1 \* q and checks if it is equal to k. If it is, it returns true.
After the loops finishes, it returns false.
<<<Output>>>
No
