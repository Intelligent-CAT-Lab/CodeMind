 <<<Analysis>>>
The program takes two integer inputs a and b from the user using the Scanner class.
It then checks if the sum of a and b is greater than or equal to 10. If it is, it prints "error" to the console. Otherwise, it prints the sum of a and b.
In this case, the sum of 6 and 3 is 9, which is less than 10, so it prints 9 to the console.
<<<Output>>>
9
