The variable W, variable H and variable C are initialized with 10, 20 and 5 respectively according to the input.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until the remainder of a divided by b is 0.
Inside the while loop, it assigns the value of variable b to variable c, then assigns the value of variable a to variable b and the value of variable c modulo variable a to variable a.
After the loop finishes, it calculates the area of the rectangle by multiplying the length and width of the rectangle and the number of columns.
The length and width of the rectangle are calculated by dividing the value of variable W by the remainder of variable a divided by variable b.
