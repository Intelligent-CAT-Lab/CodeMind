 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable sc is initialized with a try-with-resources statement to read input from the console. The while loop runs until there is no more input to read.
Inside the while loop, it reads a line of input from the console using the sc.nextLine() method and stores it in the variable str.
Then it replaces all occurrences of '.' with ',' and all occurrences of ',' with ' ' using the str.replace() method.
It then splits the string into an array of tokens using the str.split() method and stores it in the variable tokens.
It initializes a variable count to 0.
It then iterates through the tokens array using a for loop and for each token it checks if its length is between 3 and 6. If it is, it prints the first n characters of the token (where n is the length of the token) and increments the count variable.
After the loop finishes, if the count variable is greater than 0, it prints a newline character.

Rain, rain, go to Spain.
