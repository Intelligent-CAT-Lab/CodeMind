 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and c are initialized with 1 and 0 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to n to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable i by multiplying the value of variable a with 10 raised to the power of i.
Then it checks if the value of variable i is prime by calling the function `prime(Integer.valueOf(builder.toString()))`.
If the value of variable i is prime, it prints the value of variable i and returns true.
After the loop finishes, it returns false.
<<<Output>>>
false
