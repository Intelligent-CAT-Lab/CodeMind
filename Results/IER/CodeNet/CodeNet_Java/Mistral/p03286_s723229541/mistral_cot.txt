 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first creates a `Scanner` object to read input from the user. It then reads an integer `n` from the user and stores it in a variable.
It then creates a `StringBuilder` object to store the result.
It enters a while loop that continues until `n` is equal to 0.
Inside the loop, it checks if `n` is even or odd. If it is even, it appends 0 to the `StringBuilder` object and divides `n` by -2. If it is odd, it appends 1 to the `StringBuilder` object, if `n` is negative, it divides `n` by -2 and adds 1 to it, otherwise it just divides `n` by -2.
After the loop finishes, it reverses the `StringBuilder` object and converts it to a string. It then prints the reversed string.
<<<Output>>>
