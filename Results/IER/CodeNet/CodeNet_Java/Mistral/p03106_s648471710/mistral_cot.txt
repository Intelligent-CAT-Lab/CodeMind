 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable a, variable b and variable k are initialized with 8, 12 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It first calculates the smaller variable by using the Math.min() method.
Then it creates an array of size smaller+1 and initializes all its elements with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to smaller to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it checks if both a and b are divisible by i. If they are, it adds i to the array at index i.
After the loop finishes, it sorts the array in descending order using the Arrays.sort() method and Collections.reverseOrder() method.
Finally, it prints the value of the array at index k-1, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
