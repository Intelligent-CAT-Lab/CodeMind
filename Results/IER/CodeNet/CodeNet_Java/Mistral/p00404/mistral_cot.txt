 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable x and variable y are initialized with 0 according to the input.
The variable f, f1 and f2 are initialized with 1, 1 and 0 respectively.
It enters a for loop and it iterates until it finds a solution.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of f by adding f1 and f2.
Then it checks if the current position (x, y) is within the range [0, 0] and if it is, it returns the current position (x, y) + 1.
If the current position (x, y) is not within the range [0, 0], it updates the value of x\_min, x\_max, y\_min and y\_max based on the current position (x, y) and the value of f.
After the loop finishes, it returns the current position (x, y) + 1.
