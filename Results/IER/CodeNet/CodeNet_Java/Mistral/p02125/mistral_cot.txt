 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 2 according to the input.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until 2 \* c - 1 <= N.
Inside the while loop, it calculates the value of c by multiplying 2 with itself until it is greater than or equal to N.
After the while loop finishes, it creates a PrintWriter object and writes the number of bits in the integer c using the bitCount() method of the Long class.
Then it closes the PrintWriter object.
