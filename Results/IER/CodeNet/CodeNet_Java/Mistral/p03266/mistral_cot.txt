 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N and variable K are initialized with 3 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It enters an if-else statement to check if K is even or odd.
If K is even, it calculates the value of c1 by dividing N by K and then calculates the value of c2 by dividing N by (K / 2) and subtracting c1 from it.
Then it calculates the return value by multiplying c1, c1 and c1 and adding c2, c2 and c2.
If K is odd, it calculates the value of c by dividing N by K.
Then it calculates the return value by multiplying c, c and c.
After the if-else statement finishes, it print the fianl value of the return variable as output.
