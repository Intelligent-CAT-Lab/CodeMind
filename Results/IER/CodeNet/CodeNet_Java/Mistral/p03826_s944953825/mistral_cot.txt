 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the java.util package and creates a Scanner object to read input from the user.
It then creates an integer array a of size 4 and reads 4 integers from the user using the Scanner object and stores them in the array a.
It then uses the Math.max() method to find the maximum value between a[0]*a[1] and a[2]*a[3].
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is 70.
