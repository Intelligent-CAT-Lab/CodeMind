 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the Scanner class from the java.util package to read input from the user.
Then it creates a new Scanner object named sc and reads two integers a and b from the user using the nextInt() method.
It then calls the solve() method passing the values of a and b as arguments.
The solve() method takes two integer arguments a and b and returns the value of the formula (b - a + 1) * (b - a) / 2 - b.
When the input is 8 and 13, the value of the formula is (13 - 8 + 1) * (13 - 8) / 2 - 13 = 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
