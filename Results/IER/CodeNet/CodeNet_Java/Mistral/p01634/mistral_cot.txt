 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable c1, c2, and c3 are initialized with 0.
It enters a while loop and it reads each line of input until it reaches the end of the input.
Inside the while loop, it checks if the length of the line is less than 6. If it is, it prints "INVALID" and exits the loop.
If the length of the line is greater than or equal to 6, it iterates through each character in the line and checks if it is a digit, uppercase letter or lowercase letter.
If the character is a digit, it increments c1. If the character is an uppercase letter, it increments c2. If the character is a lowercase letter, it increments c3.
After the loop finishes, it checks if all three variables c1, c2, and c3 are greater than 0. If they are, it prints "VALID". If any of them are less than or equal to 0, it prints "INVALID".
For the input "password", the length of the line is 7, which is greater than or equal to 6.
It iterates through each character in the line and checks if it is a digit, uppercase letter or lowercase letter.
The first character is 'p', which is a lowercase letter, so it increments c3.
The second character is 'a', which is a lowercase letter, so it increments c3.
The third character is 's', which is a lowercase letter, so it increments c3.
The fourth character is 's', which is a lowercase letter, so it increments c3.
The fifth character is 'w', which is a lowercase letter, so it increments c3.
The sixth character is 'o', which is a lowercase letter, so it increments c3.
The seventh character is 'r', which is a lowercase letter, so it increments c3.
After the loop finishes, it checks if all three variables c1, c2, and c3 are greater than 0. Since all three variables are greater than 0, it prints "VALID".
<<<Output>>>
VALID
