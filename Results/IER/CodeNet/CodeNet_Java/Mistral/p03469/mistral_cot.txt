 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input from the user using the Scanner class. The string input is stored in the variable S. The variable S is then converted to a character array using the toCharArray() method.
It then prints the string "2018" to the console.
It enters a for loop that iterates from index 4 to the length of the character array c. It prints each character in the array c starting from index 4.
The output of the program would be:
2018
Since the input is not provided, the program will not execute and will not return any value.
