The variable N is initialized with 5 according to the input. And variable Q is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 4 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger i is equal to 2 or 4. If it is, it sets the corresponding bit in variable bsf1 and bsf2 to 1.
It also checks if the current interger i is equal to 0 or 1. If it is, it sets the corresponding bit in variable bsb1 and bsb2 to 1.
It also checks if the current interger i is equal to 3. If it is, it sets the corresponding bit in variable bsb1 and bsb2 to 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 1.
