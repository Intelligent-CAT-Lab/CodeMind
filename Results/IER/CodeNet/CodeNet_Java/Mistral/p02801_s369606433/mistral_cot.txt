 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a single character input from the user using the `Scanner` class and stores it in the variable `c`.
Then it calculates the next character by adding 1 to the ASCII value of the current character using the formula `next = c + 1`.
Finally, it prints the next character using the `System.out.println(Character.toChars(next))` statement.

<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is the next character after the input character. If the input character is 'a', the next character will be 'b'.

Therefore, the return value of the code will be 'b'.
