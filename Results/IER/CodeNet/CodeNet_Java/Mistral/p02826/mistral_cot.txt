 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N and MOD are initialized with 2 and 998244353 respectively.
It creates a 2D array table of size N+1 x N+1 and initializes it with the values 0 to N.
It then enters a for loop that iterates from N-1 to 1.
Inside the for loop, it iterates from 0 to N+1 and initializes the table[pos][rem] with the value of table[pos+1][rem].
It then calculates the factor as the minimum of pos and N+1-pos.
If the factor is less than rem, it adds the value of table[pos][rem-factor] to table[pos][rem] and then takes the modulo of the result with MOD.
After the loop finishes, it prints the value of table[1][N], which is 998244353.
<<<Output>>>
998244353
