The variable CMD is initialized with null. Then it reads the input from the user using BufferedReader and stores it in variable CMD. The input is split into an array of strings using the split() method and stored in variable str.
Then it extracts the first two elements of the array and stores them in variables x and y respectively.
It then uses if-else statements to compare the values of x and y and prints the appropriate message.
