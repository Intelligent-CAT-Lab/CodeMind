 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable w, variable h, variable v, variable t, variable x, variable y, variable p, and variable q are initialized with 10, 10, 1, 10, 3, 3, 7, and 7 respectively according to the input. And variable maxDist is initialized with 100.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 9 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable maxW.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable ans by calling the attack method.
The attack method first calculates the value of variable maxW by finding the maximum value of variable w that satisfies the condition maxW <= maxDist.
Then it calculates the value of variable ans by calling the getPowDistance method with different values of variable mx and my.
The getPowDistance method calculates the distance between two points using the Pythagorean theorem.
It returns the value of variable ans.
<<<Output>>>
100
