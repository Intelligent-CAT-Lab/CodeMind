 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and k are initialized with 2 and 0 respectively according to the input. And variable bad is initialized with a 2D boolean array of size 2*n x 2*n.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to k to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable k.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger k by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum falls within the range [0, 1]. If it does, it adds the current interger k to variable answer. The condition is met when k is 0.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable answer as output, which is 0.
<<<Output>>>
