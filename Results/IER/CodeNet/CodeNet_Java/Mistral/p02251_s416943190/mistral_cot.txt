 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 100 according to the input. And variable a is an array of integers [25, 10, 5, 1]. The variable count is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 3 to check each integer a[i] in this range.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the remainder of n divided by a[i] and assigns it to variable n.
Then it calculates the quotient of n divided by a[i] and adds it to variable count.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable count as output, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
