 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 11 according to the input.
It calculates the value of variable limit7 by dividing N by 7 and rounding down to the nearest integer.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to limit7 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable left by subtracting the value of i multiplied by 7 from N.
Then it checks if the value of left is divisible by 4. If it is, it sets the value of check to true.
After the loop finishes, it checks the value of check. If it is true, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
