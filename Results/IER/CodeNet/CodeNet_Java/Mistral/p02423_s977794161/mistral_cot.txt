 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 8 according to the input. And variable nishin is calculated by converting the decimal value of n to binary using Long.toBinaryString() method.
The length of the binary string is calculated and stored in variable start.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 31 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable index.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger i is less than start. If it is, it prints 0. Otherwise, it checks if the current interger i is less than start. If it is, it prints 1. Otherwise, it prints 0.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable nishin as output, which is 1000.
<<<Output>>>
1000
