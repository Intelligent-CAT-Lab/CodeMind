 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable A, variable B and variable K are initialized with 8, 12 and 2 respectively according to the input. And variable s is an array of size A+B.
It enters a while loop and it iterates from 1 to the maximum value of A and B. The value of variable z is also passed to variable num.
Inside the while loop, it checks if A and B are divisible by z. If they are, it adds the value of z to the array s and increments the variable y.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable s[y-K] as output, which is 4.
<<<Output>>>
4
