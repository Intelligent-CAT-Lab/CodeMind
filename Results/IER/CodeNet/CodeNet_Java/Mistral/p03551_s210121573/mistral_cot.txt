 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N and variable M are initialized with 1 and 1 respectively according to the input. And variable c is calculated as 1900.0*M + 100.0*(N-M) = 1900.0*1 + 100.0*(1-1) = 1900.0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to M to calculate the value of variable p. The value of variable p is calculated as p = 1.0*0.5^i.
It enters another for loop and it iterates from 1 to 3000000 to calculate the value of variable res. The value of variable res is calculated as res += i*c*p*q. The value of variable q is calculated as q *= 1-p.
After the loop finishes, it calculate the value of eps as 0.0000001.
It calculates the final value of res by adding eps to it and then converting it to an integer using Math.floor() function.
Finally, it prints the value of ret which is 0.
