 <<<Analysis>>>
The input string is passed to the `getShift` method, which first splits the string into an array of words using the `split` method. It then iterates through each word in the array and checks if it is one of the three specified words ("the", "this", "that"). If it is, it returns the corresponding shift value (2, 3, or 4). If it is not, it continues to the next word.

After the `getShift` method returns, the resulting shift value is passed to the `shiftWord` method, which takes a character and a shift value as input and returns the corresponding shifted character.

The resulting shifted characters are then concatenated together to form the output string, which is printed to the console.

The output of the code would be:
```
xmw xli tmgxyvi xlex m xsso mr xli xvmt.
