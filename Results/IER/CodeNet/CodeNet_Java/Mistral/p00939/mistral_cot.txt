The variable n, variable a and variable b are initialized with 20, 2 and 5 respectively according to the input. And variable sum is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 20 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger num by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum falls within the range [2, 5 ] by checking if the sum is greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 5. If it does, it adds the current interger i to variable answer.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable answer as output, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
