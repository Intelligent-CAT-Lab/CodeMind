The variable s is initialized with the input string "010". The variable n is initialized with the length of the string s, which is 3. The variable ans is initialized with n - 1, which is 2.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each character of the string s.
Inside the for loop, it compares the current character with the next character. If they are not equal, it calculates the maximum of the index of the current character plus 1 and the index of the next character minus 1. It then updates the value of ans with the minimum of the current value of ans and the calculated value.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
