 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N and M are initialized with 1 and 1 respectively according to the input. And variable s is calculated as (100 \* (N - M) + 1900 \* M) \* (int) Math.pow(2, M).
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable s by multiplying the value of variable i with the value of variable s.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable s as output, which is 1.
<<<Output>>>
