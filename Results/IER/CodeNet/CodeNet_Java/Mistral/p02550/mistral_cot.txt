 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable X and variable M are initialized with 6, 2 and 1001 respectively according to the input. And variable ans is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 999 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable prev.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the next integer now by multiplying the current integer prev by itself and taking the remainder with variable M.
Then it checks if the calculated variable now is 0. If it is, it adds the current integer i to variable ans and breaks out of the loop.
If it is not 0, it checks if the variable now is already in the set used. If it is, it sets variable L to i+1 and adds the current integer i to variable ans.
Then it calculates the substring of variable A from index K to index L and adds it to variable ans.
It also calculates the remainder of variable N divided by variable L - variable K and adds it to variable ans.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 1001.
<<<Output>>>
1001
