 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers A and B from the user using the Scanner class. The first integer A is read using the `nextInt()` method of the Scanner class. The second integer B is also read using the `nextInt()` method of the Scanner class.
Then it checks if A is equal to 2 and B is also equal to 2. If both conditions are true, it prints "Yes" otherwise it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
