 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 3 according to the input. And variable sum is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable sum.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger num by repeatedlylly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it prints the fianl value of variable sum as output, which is 6.
