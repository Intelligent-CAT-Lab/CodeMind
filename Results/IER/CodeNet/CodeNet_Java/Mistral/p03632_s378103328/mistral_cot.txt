The variable a, variable b, variable c and variable d are initialized with 0, 75, 25 and 100 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 100 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current integer i is less than or equal to variable a and variable b using boolean variable alice.
It also checks if the current integer i is less than or equal to variable c and variable d using boolean variable bob.
If both conditions are true, it updates the value of variable minSec and variable maxSec.
After the loop finishes, it checks if the value of variable minSec is equal to Integer.MAX\_VALUE. If it is, it prints 0. Otherwise, it prints the difference between variable maxSec and variable minSec.
