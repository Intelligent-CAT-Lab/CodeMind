 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable A and variable B are initialized with 4 and 5 respectively according to the input.
It enters a try-catch block and it reads the input line using BufferedReader.
It splits the input line using the split() method and stores the resulting array in variable sl.
It then extracts the values of A and B from the array sl and converts them to integers using Integer.parseInt() method.
It checks if either A or B is divisible by 3 or if the sum of A and B is divisible by 3 using the logical operator % and the condition (A % 3 == 0 || B % 3 == 0 || (A + B) % 3 == 0).
If the condition is true, it prints "Possible" otherwise it prints "Impossible".
<<<Output>>>
Impossible
