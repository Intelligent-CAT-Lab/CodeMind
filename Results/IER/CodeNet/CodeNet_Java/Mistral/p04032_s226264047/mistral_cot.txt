 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string input from the user and converts it to a character array. It then iterates through the array and checks if any two consecutive characters are the same. If it finds a pair of consecutive characters that are the same, it prints the index of the first character and the index of the next character. If it doesn't find any pair of consecutive characters that are the same, it prints -1 -1.
<<<Output>>>
-1 -1
