 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable S is initialized with the input "SENW".
It enters three if-else statements to check if the input string contains the substrings "N", "S", "E", and "W".
The first if-else statement checks if the input string contains all four substrings "N", "S", "E", and "W". If it does, it sets the value of variable ans to "Yes".
The second if-else statement checks if the input string contains the substrings "N", "S", and "E", but not "W". If it does, it sets the value of variable ans to "Yes".
The third if-else statement checks if the input string contains the substrings "N", "S", and "W", but not "E". If it does, it sets the value of variable ans to "Yes".
After all the if-else statements are checked, it prints the value of variable ans as output, which is "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
