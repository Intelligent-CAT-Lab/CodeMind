 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable h, variable w, variable a and variable b are initialized with 3, 3, 1 and 1 respectively according to the input.
It enters two for loops. The first for loop iterates from 0 to 2 and the second for loop iterates from 0 to 1.
Inside the first for loop, it checks if the current index j is less than variable a. If it is, it adds 0 to variable s1 and 1 to variable s2. If it is not, it adds 1 to variable s1 and 0 to variable s2.
Inside the second for loop, it checks if the current index i is less than variable b. If it is, it prints variable s1. If it is not, it prints variable s2.
After the loops finishes, it prints the final value of variable s1 and variable s2.
