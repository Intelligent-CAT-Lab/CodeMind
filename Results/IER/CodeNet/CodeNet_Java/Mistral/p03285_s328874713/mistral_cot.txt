 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 11 according to the input.
The program first checks if N is divisible by 4 or 7. If it is, it sets flag to true. Otherwise, it checks if N is divisible by 4 and 7 alternately starting from 4. If it finds a number that is divisible by both 4 and 7, it sets flag to true and breaks out of the loop.
It then prints the value of flag.
<<<Output>>>
No
