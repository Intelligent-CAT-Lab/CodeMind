 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable A, variable B and variable C are initialized with 4, 12 and 20 respectively according to the input.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until all three variables A, B and C are even.
Inside the while loop, it checks if all three variables are equal. If they are, it prints -1 and exits the loop.
Otherwise, it calculates the new values of A, B and C by taking the average of the two smaller variables.
It increments the count variable and continues the loop.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable count as output, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>
