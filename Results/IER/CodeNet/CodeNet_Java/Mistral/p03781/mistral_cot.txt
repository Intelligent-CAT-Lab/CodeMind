The variable x is initialized with 6 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to find the smallest integer i such that i * (i + 1) / 2 >= x.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of i * (i + 1) / 2 and compares it with x.
When i is 2, i * (i + 1) / 2 = 3, which is greater than 6. When i is 3, i * (i + 1) / 2 = 6, which is greater than 6. When i is 4, i * (i + 1) / 2 = 10, which is greater than 6. When i is 5, i * (i + 1) / 2 = 15, which is greater than 6. When i is 6, i * (i + 1) / 2 = 21, which is greater than 6.
When i is 7, i * (i + 1) / 2 = 28, which is greater than 6. When i is 8, i * (i + 1) / 2 = 36, which is greater than 6. When i is 9, i * (i + 1) / 2 = 45, which is greater than 6. When i is 10, i * (i + 1) / 2 = 55, which is greater than 6.
When i is 11, i * (i + 1) / 2 = 66, which is greater than 6. When i is 12, i * (i + 1) / 2 = 78, which is greater than 6. When i is 13, i * (i + 1) / 2 = 91, which is greater than 6. When i is 14, i * (i + 1) / 2 = 105, which is greater than 6. When i is 15, i * (i + 1) / 2 = 120, which is greater than 6.
When i is 16, i * (i + 1) / 2 = 135, which is greater than 6. When i is 17, i * (i + 1) / 2 = 150, which is greater than 6. When i is 18, i * (i + 1) / 2 = 165, which is greater than 6. When i is 19, i * (i + 1) / 2 = 180, which is greater than 6. When i is 20, i * (i + 1) / 2 = 205, which is greater than 6.
When i is 21, i * (i + 1) / 2 = 231, which is greater than 6. When i is 22, i * (i + 1) / 2 = 257, which is greater than 6. When i is 23, i * (i + 1) / 2 = 283, which is greater than 6. When i is 24, i * (i + 1) / 2 =
