 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable H and variable W are initialized with 4 and 5 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 5 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current integer i is even and H is odd. If it is, it adds the value of h - 1 to variable ans. Otherwise, it adds the value of h to variable ans.
The value of variable h is calculated as (H + 1) / 2, which is 2.5.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
