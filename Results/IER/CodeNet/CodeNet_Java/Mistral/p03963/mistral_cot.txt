 <<<Analysis>>>
The program takes two integers N and K as input from the user. N is the number of elements in the array and K is the number of elements to be removed.
It initializes the variable ans with the value of K.
Then it enters a for loop that iterates from 2 to N. In each iteration, it multiplies the current value of ans by K-1.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of ans as output.
<<<Output>>>
4

The return value of the code based on the input `2 2` is 4.
