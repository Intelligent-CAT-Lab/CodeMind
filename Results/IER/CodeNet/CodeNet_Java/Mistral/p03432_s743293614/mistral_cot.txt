 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads the input as a string and then tokenizes it into an array of strings. It then iterates through the array and converts each string to an integer. The integers are stored in a list.

The code then iterates through the list and calculates the sum of the digits of each integer. It does this by repeatedly dividing the integer by 10 and taking the remainder. The sum of the remainders is then added to a variable `sum`.

The code then checks if the sum is greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 5. If it is, it adds the current integer to a variable `answer`.

Finally, the code prints the value of `answer`.

<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code would be 84.
