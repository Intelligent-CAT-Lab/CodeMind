 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 2 according to the input. And variable result is initialized with 1.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable result.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable result by multiplying the current value of variable result by 10 and then taking the modulo with mod.
Then it calculates the value of variable src by multiplying the current value of variable src by 9 and then taking the modulo with mod.
After the loop finishes, it calculates the final value of variable result by multiplying the final value of variable result by 2, subtracting the final value of variable src and then taking the modulo with mod.
The final value of variable result is 1.
<<<Output>>>
