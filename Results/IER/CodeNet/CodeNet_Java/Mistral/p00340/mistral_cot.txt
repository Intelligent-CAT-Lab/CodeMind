 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable sides is initialized with 1, 1, 3 and 4 respectively according to the input. And variable total is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 3 to check each integer sides[i] in this range. The value of variable sides[i] is also passed to variable total.
After the loop finishes, it sort the sides array in ascending order.
Then it checks if all sides of the rectangle are equal. If they are, it prints "yes", otherwise it prints "no".
In this case, the sides of the rectangle are not equal, so it prints "no".
<<<Output>>>
no
