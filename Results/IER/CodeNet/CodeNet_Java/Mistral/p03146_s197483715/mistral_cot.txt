The variable s is initialized with 8 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 8 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable a.
Inside the for loop, it calls the solve method with variable i and variable a as arguments.
The solve method returns the value of variable a divided by 2 if a is even, otherwise it returns 3 times the value of a plus 1.
Then it calls the func method with HashMap hmap, variable a and variable i as arguments.
The func method checks if the value of variable a is already present in the HashMap hmap. If it is, it returns the value of variable i. Otherwise, it adds the value of variable a to the HashMap hmap with the value of variable i as its key and returns the result of calling the func method recursively with HashMap hmap, solve(i+1,a) and i+1 as arguments.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable i as output, which is 8.
<<<Output>>>
8
