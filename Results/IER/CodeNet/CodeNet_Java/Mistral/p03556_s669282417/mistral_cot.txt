 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 10 according to the input.
It enters an infinite while loop and it decrements the value of n in each iteration.
Inside the loop, it calculates the square root of n using the Math.sqrt() method and then it multiplies it by itself to get n.
If the square of the square root of n is equal to n, it means that n is a perfect square and it prints the value of n.
Since 10 is not a perfect square, the loop continues and n is decremented until it reaches 1, which is not a perfect square either.
Therefore, the loop will continue indefinitely and the program will not terminate.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is undefined, as the program will not terminate.
