 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and variable a are initialized with 8 and 1 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 16 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable k.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable t by multiplying variable a with (i-1) and then it calls the function f(i, n) to find the maximum value of k that satisfies the condition k1*k2*k3*...*ki>=n.
It then checks if the calculated variable t is less than the current value of ans. If it is, it updates the value of ans with t.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 16.
<<<Output>>>
16
