The variable s is initialized with the input string "BBBWW". The variable c is initialized with the first character of the string "B". The variable sum is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 5 to check each character of the string s.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character of the string s is equal to the current value of variable c. If it is, it continues to the next iteration. If it is not, it increments the value of variable sum and updates the value of variable c with the current character of the string s.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable sum as output, which is 4.
