 <<<Analysis>>>
The program takes two long inputs w and h from the user. It first checks if either w or h is equal to 1. If either of them is equal to 1, it prints 1 and returns from the function.
If neither of them is equal to 1, it calculates the value of c by taking the average of w and h. If w and h are even, it takes the average by dividing w and h by 2. If w and h are odd, it takes the average by adding 1 to the result of dividing w and h by 2.
Then it prints the value of c.
