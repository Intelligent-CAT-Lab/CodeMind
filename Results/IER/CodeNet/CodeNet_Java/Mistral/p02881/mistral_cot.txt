 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 10 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to 10 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable x.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the greatest common divisor of n and x using the gcd function.
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from x to 1 to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable y.
Inside the inner for loop, it checks if the greatest common divisor of x and j is equal to 2. If it is, it creates a Pair object with x and j and adds it to a list of pairs.
After the inner for loop finishes, it sorts the list of pairs in ascending order of x.
Then it prints the first element of the sorted list, which is the pair with the smallest x value.
<<<Output>>>
(2, 2)
