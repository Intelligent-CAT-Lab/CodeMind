 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with the length of the input string "aatt". The input string is converted to a character array A.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 3 to check each character in the array A.
Inside the for loop, it increments the count of the character in the array A by 1.
Then it calculates the total number of unique characters in the array A by multiplying the length of the array by (length of the array + 1) and adding 1.
It enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 25 to check each character in the alphabet.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the count of the current character in the alphabet is greater than 0. If it is, it subtracts the product of the count of the current character and (count of the current character + 1) divided by 2 from the total number of unique characters.
After the second loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
