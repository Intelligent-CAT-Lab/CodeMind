The variable l is initialized with 4 according to the input.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until the value of (1<<n-1)-1 is less than or equal to 4.
The variable n is initialized with 1 and it is incremented until the condition is met.
Inside the while loop, it creates a StringBuilder object and it appends the current value of n and n+1 followed by 0.
Then it appends the current value of n and n+1 followed by the value of 1<<(n-1).
It increments the variable m by 2 after each iteration.
After the loop finishes, it enters another while loop and it iterates until the value of l-max is greater than 1.
The variable k is initialized with 1 and it is incremented until the condition (1<<k-1)<l-max is met.
Then it appends the current value of k, n and max+1 to the StringBuilder object.
It increments the variable m by 1 and max by (1<<k-1) after each iteration.
After the second loop finishes, it prints the value of n and m followed by the StringBuilder object.
The value of n is 3 and m is 4.
The StringBuilder object contains the following string:
```
1 2 0 
1 2 1 
1 3 2 
1 3 3 
1 4 4 
```
<<<Output>>>
3 4
