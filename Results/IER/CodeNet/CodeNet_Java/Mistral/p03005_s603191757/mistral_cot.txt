 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, n and k. The variable n is assigned the value 3 and k is assigned the value 2.
The main method then calls the method arrayInt() passing in the scanner object and the value of n.
The arrayInt() method creates an integer array of size n and reads n integers from the scanner object and assigns them to the array.
The main method then prints the value of k == 1 ? 0 : n - k, which is 1.
