The variable N, variable V, X, Y are initialized with 0, 7, 3, 1 respectively according to the input. And variable L, B, R, T are initialized with 0, 0, 0, 0 respectively.
The program enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to N-1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable lb, ub, qx, qy and yt.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the position of bird yt using the function calc() and checks if it is within the range [0, N-1]. If it is not, it continues to the next iteration.
Then it checks if the bird is within the range [0, N-1] and if it is not, it continues to the next iteration.
Then it checks if the bird is within the range [0, N-1] and if it is not, it continues to the next iteration.
