 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable a and variable b are initialized with 3 and 3 respectively according to the input. And variable ans is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable reds.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable blues by subtracting the value of variable reds from the total number of balls.
Then it calculates the value of variable ans by subtracting the value of variable reds from the total number of balls and then multiplying it by the value of variable blues.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 12.
<<<Output>>>
12
