 <<<Analysis>>>
The program takes three long inputs from the user, a, b and k.
It first checks if k is greater than or equal to a. If it is, it subtracts k from b and assigns the result to b. Then it assigns 0 to a.
If k is less than a, it subtracts k from a and assigns the result to a.
Then it checks if b is less than 0, if it is, it assigns 0 to b.
Finally, it prints the values of a and b.
