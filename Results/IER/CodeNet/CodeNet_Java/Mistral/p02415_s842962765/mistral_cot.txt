 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input from the user using the Scanner class. It then iterates through each character in the string using a for loop. For each character, it checks if it is a lowercase or uppercase letter using an if-else statement. If the character is a lowercase letter, it subtracts 32 from its ASCII value to convert it to uppercase. If the character is an uppercase letter, it adds 32 to its ASCII value to convert it to lowercase. Finally, it prints the converted character to the console.
