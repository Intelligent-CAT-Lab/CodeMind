 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers a, b and c as input from the user. In this case, a = 1000, b = 900 and c = 850.
The first if-else statement checks if a is less than b. Since a = 1000 and b = 900, this condition is true.
The second if-else statement checks if b is less than c. Since b = 900 and c = 850, this condition is true.
Therefore, the output of the code will be "C".
<<<Output>>>
C
