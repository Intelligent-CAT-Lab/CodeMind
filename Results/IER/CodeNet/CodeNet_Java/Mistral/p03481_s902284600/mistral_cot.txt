 <<<Analysis>>>
The program starts by importing the Scanner class from the java.util package. It then creates a new Scanner object named sc and uses it to read input from the user. The program then reads two long integers x and y from the user using the sc.nextLong() method.
It then enters an infinite while loop that continues until x is greater than y. Inside the loop, it multiplies x by 2 and increments the count variable.
After the loop finishes, it prints the value of count as output.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is 16.
