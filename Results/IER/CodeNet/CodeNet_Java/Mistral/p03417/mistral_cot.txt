 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the Scanner class from the java.util package to read input from the user.
It then creates a new Scanner object named sc and uses it to read two long integers N and M from the user.
It then calculates the absolute value of the difference between N and 2, and the difference between M and 2, and multiplies them together.
The final output is the result of this calculation.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code would be 16.
