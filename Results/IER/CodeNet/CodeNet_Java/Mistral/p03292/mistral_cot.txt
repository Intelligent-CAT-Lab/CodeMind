The code takes three integers as input, T, R and Y. T is the maximum number of times a person can go to the store, R is the maximum number of items a person can buy at a time and Y is the number of items the person wants to buy.
It calculates the maximum and minimum values of T, R and Y using the Math.max() and Math.min() methods and assigns them to variables A and B respectively.
It then prints the difference between A and B as output.
