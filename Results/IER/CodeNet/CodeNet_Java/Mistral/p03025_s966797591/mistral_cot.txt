The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized with 1, 25 and 25 respectively according to the input. And variable sum is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to N to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable a and variable b.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger a and b by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum falls within the range [2, 50]. If it does, it adds the current interger i to variable answer. The condition is met when i is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable answer as output, which is 100.
