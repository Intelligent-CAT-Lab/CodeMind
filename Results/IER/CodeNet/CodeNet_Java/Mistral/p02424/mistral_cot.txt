 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the java.util package and creates a Scanner object to read input from the user.
It then reads two long integers a and b from the user using the nextLong() method of the Scanner object.
It then calls the toString() method on the bitwise AND, OR and XOR operations of a and b respectively.
The toString() method converts the long integer value to a string representation of its binary digits.
It uses a StringBuilder object to append the binary digits of the long integer value in reverse order.
The return value of the toString() method is the string representation of the binary digits of the long integer value.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code would be:
00000000000000000000000000000000
00000000000000000000000000000000
00000000000000000000000000000000
