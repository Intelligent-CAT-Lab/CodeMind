 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers a and b from the user using the Scanner class. The first integer a is read using the `nextInt()` method of the Scanner class and stored in the variable a. The second integer b is also read using the `nextInt()` method of the Scanner class and stored in the variable b.
Then it checks if the sum of a and b is less than 10. If it is, it prints the sum of a and b using the `print()` method of the System.out class. If it is not, it prints "error" using the `print()` method of the System.out class.
