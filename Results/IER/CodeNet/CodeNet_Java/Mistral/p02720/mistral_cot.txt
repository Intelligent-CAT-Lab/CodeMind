 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable k is initialized with 15 according to the input.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until k is 0.
Inside the while loop, it calculates the value of variable val by calling the getFirst() method of the LinkedList object list.
It then removes the first element from the list by calling the removeFirst() method of the LinkedList object list.
Then it checks if the value of variable val is not 0. If it is not 0, it adds the value of 10*val + val%10 - 1 to the list by calling the add() method of the LinkedList object list.
Then it adds the value of 10*val + val%10 to the list by calling the add() method of the LinkedList object list.
Then it checks if the value of variable val is not 9. If it is not 9, it adds the value of 10*val + val%10 + 1 to the list by calling the add() method of the LinkedList object list.
Then it decrements the value of k.
After the loop finishes, it print the value of variable val as output, which is 15.
<<<Output>>>
15
