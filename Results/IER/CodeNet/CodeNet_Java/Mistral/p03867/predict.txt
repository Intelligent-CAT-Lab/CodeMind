The variable N and K are initialized with 4 and 2 respectively according to the input. And variable divisor is initialized with the divisors of N, which are [1, 2, 4].
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each divisor of N. The value of variable divisor[i] is also passed to variable num[i].
It calculates the value of num[i] by raising K to the power of (divisor[i]+1)/2 and then subtracting the product of K raised to the power of divisor[j] for all divisor[j] less than divisor[i].
It then checks if num[i] is less than 0, if it is, it adds MOD to it.
It then adds the value of num[i] to variable tmpSum and then takes the modulo of tmpSum with MOD.
After the loop finishes, it calculates the final value of ans by multiplying divisor[i] with num[i] modulo MOD and then adding it to ans.
After that it calculates the final value of ans by multiplying divisor[i] with num[i] modulo MOD and then adding it to ans.
