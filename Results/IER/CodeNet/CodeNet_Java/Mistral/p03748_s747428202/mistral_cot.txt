The variable n and m are initialized with 2 and 3 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable k.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of dp[i][j][k] for each j and k using the following rules:
- If j-1 >= 0, it adds dp[i%2][j-1][k] to dp[i+1%2][j][k] if k=0, otherwise it adds dp[i%2][j-1][1] to dp[i+1%2][j][k].
- If j+1 <= n, it adds dp[i%2][j+1][k] to dp[i+1%2][j][k].
- If j-1 >= 0, it adds dp[i%2][j][k] to dp[i+1%2][j][k] if k=0, otherwise it adds dp[i%2][j][1] to dp[i+1%2][j][k].
- If j+1 <= n, it adds dp[i%2][j][k] to dp[i+1%2][j][k].
After the loop finishes, it calculates the final value of ans by adding dp[m%2][i][1] for all i from 0 to n.
After that, it calculates the final value of ans by adding dp[m%2][i][1] for all i from 0 to n.
Finally, it prints the value of ans as output, which is 1.
