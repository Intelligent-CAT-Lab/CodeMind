 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a single integer `n` from standard input. It then reads an array of `n` integers and stores them in a variable `arr`. The code then calculates the sum of all the elements in the array and stores it in a variable `sum`. Finally, the code prints the value of `sum`.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is the sum of all the elements in the array.
