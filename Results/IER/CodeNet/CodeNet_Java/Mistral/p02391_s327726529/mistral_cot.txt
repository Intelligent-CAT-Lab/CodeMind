 <<<Analysis>>>
The program takes two integer inputs a and b from the user using the Scanner class. It then compares the two values using if-else statements.
If a is less than b, it prints "a < b".
If a is greater than b, it prints "a > b".
If a is equal to b, it prints "a == b".
In this case, the input is 1 and 2, so the output will be "a < b".
<<<Output>>>
a < b
