 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 7 according to the input.
It calculates the value of variable cnt by dividing N by 11 and rounding down to the nearest integer. The remainder of N divided by 11 is 4.
It then multiplies the value of variable cnt by 2 to get 12.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until N is greater than 0.
Inside the while loop, it checks if the remainder of N divided by 2 is 0. If it is, it subtracts 6 from N. Otherwise, it subtracts 5 from N.
It increments the value of variable cnt by 1 in each iteration.
After the loop finishes, it prints the value of variable cnt as output, which is 12.
<<<Output>>>
12
