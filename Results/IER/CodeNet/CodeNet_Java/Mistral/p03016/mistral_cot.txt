 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable L, variable A, variable B and variable M are initialized with 5, 3, 4 and 10007 respectively according to the input. And variable k is initialized with 10.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until A is greater than k.
Inside the loop, it calculates the value of k by multiplying 10 with the current value of k.
Then it calculates the value of l by subtracting the value of k from L.
It enters another while loop and it iterates until l is less than or equal to L.
Inside the loop, it sets the value of m[0][0] to k modulo M.
Then it calculates the value of r by taking the minimum of (k - A - 1) divided by B and L - 1.
It calls the mult function with the current value of res, the current value of m and the current value of r.
Then it increments the value of l by 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable res[0] as output, which is 1.
