 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable X and variable Y are initialized with 3 and 3 respectively according to the input.
The function solve(X, Y) is called with these values.
The function solve(X, Y) first checks if the sum of X and Y is divisible by 3. If it is not, it returns 0.
If it is divisible by 3, it calculates the value of turn by dividing the sum of X and Y by 3.
Then it calculates the value of upper and right by subtracting turn from X and Y respectively.
Finally, it calculates the value of combination(turn, upper) using the combination function of ModInt class.
The combination function calculates the number of ways to choose turn elements from the set of upper elements.
The return value of the function solve(X, Y) is the value of combination(turn, upper).
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the function solve(X, Y) is 1.
