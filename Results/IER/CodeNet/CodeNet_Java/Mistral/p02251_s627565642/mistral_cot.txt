 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 100 according to the input.
The program first calculates the remainder of n divided by 25, which is 0.
Then it calculates the remainder of n divided by 10, which is 0.
Then it calculates the remainder of n divided by 5, which is 0.
Then it calculates the remainder of n divided by 1, which is 0.
Since all the remainders are 0, the variable result is 0.
Then it adds the variable n to the result, which is 0.
So the final value of result is 0.
<<<Output>>>
0
