The variable X is initialized with the input string "TSTTSS". The variable N is initialized with the length of the string X, which is 6.
The variable s is initialized with 0 and t is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 5 to check each character a in this range.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character a is 'S'. If it is, it increments the variable s.
If the current character a is not 'S', it checks if the variable s is not 0. If it is not, it decrements the variable s and subtracts 2 from the variable ans.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
