 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers x1 and x2 from the user using the Scanner class. The first integer is read using the `nextInt()` method and stored in variable x1. The second integer is read using the `nextInt()` method and stored in variable x2.
Then it calculates the absolute difference between x1 and x2 using the `Math.abs()` method and stores the result in variable `abs_diff`.
Finally, it prints the value of `abs_diff` using the `System.out.println()` method.
