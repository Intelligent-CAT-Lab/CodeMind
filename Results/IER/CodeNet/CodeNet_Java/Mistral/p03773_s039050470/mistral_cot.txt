 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a line of input from the user using BufferedReader and StringTokenizer. It then uses StringTokenizer to split the input into two tokens, which are stored in the variables a and b.
The variable a is calculated by adding the two tokens, which are integers.
Then it calculates the remainder of the variable a divided by 24 using the modulo operator (%).
