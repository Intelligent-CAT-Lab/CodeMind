 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integer inputs a and b from the user. In this case, a = 3 and b = 1.
It calculates the sum of a and b and assigns it to variable add, which is 4.
It also calculates the difference between a and b and assigns it to variable sub, which is 2.
It calculates the product of a and b and assigns it to variable p, which is 3.
It then compares the three variables add, sub and p to determine which one is the largest.
Since add is the largest, it prints the value of add, which is 4.
<<<Output>>>
4
