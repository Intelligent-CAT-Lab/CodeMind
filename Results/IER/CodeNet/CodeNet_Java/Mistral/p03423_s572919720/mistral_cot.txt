 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 8 according to the input.
It enters an if-else statement and checks if n is less than 3. Since n is 8, the condition is false and it moves to the else block.
In the else block, it calculates the result by dividing n by 3, which is 2.6666666666666667.
It then prints the value of the result variable, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
