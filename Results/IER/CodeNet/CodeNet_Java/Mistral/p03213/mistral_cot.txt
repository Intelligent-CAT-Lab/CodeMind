The variable N is initialized with 9 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to 9 to check each integer i in this range.
The variable tmp is initialized with i and it is used to check if i divides tmp without any remainder.
If it does, it enters a while loop and it repeatedly divides tmp by i and increments the variable cnt.
Then it adds the pair [i, cnt] to the ArrayList list.
After the loop finishes, it adds the pair [tmp, 1] to the ArrayList list.
After the for loop finishes, it adds the pair [N, 1] to the ArrayList list.
It then creates an ArrayList of the pairs in the list and sorts them in ascending order.
It then creates an ArrayList of the values in the sorted ArrayList and reverses the order.
It then iterates through the reversed ArrayList and increments the variable ans if the value is greater than or equal to 74.
It then iterates through the reversed ArrayList again and for each value it iterates through the remaining values in the reversed ArrayList and increments the variable ans if the value is greater than or equal to 24.
It then iterates through the reversed ArrayList again and for each value it iterates through the remaining values in the reversed ArrayList and increments the variable ans if the value is greater than or equal to 14.
It then iterates through the reversed ArrayList again and for each value it iterates through the remaining values in the reversed ArrayList and increments the variable ans if the value is greater than or equal to 4.
It then iterates through the reversed ArrayList again and for each value it iterates through the remaining values in the reversed ArrayList and increments the variable ans if the value is greater than or equal to 4.
It then iterates through the reversed ArrayList again and for each value it iterates through the remaining values in the reversed ArrayList and increments the variable ans if the value is greater than or equal to 4.
