The variable X and variable Y are initialized with 1 and 1 respectively according to the input.
It enters an if-else statement and checks if both X and Y are equal to 1. If they are, it assigns the value 1000000 to variable ans.
If not, it enters another if-else statement and checks if either X or Y is equal to 1. If X is equal to 1, it adds 300000 to variable ans. If Y is equal to 1, it adds 300000 to variable ans.
If neither X nor Y is equal to 1, it enters another if-else statement and checks if either X or Y is equal to 2. If X is equal to 2, it adds 200000 to variable ans. If Y is equal to 2, it adds 200000 to variable ans.
If neither X nor Y is equal to 1 or 2, it enters another if-else statement and checks if either X or Y is equal to 3. If X is equal to 3, it adds 100000 to variable ans. If Y is equal to 3, it adds 100000 to variable ans.
After the if-else statement finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 1000000.
<<<Output>>>
