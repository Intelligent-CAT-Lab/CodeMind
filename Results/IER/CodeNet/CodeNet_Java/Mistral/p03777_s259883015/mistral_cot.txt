 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the java.util.Scanner class to read input from the user.
Then it creates a new Scanner object named sc and reads two strings a and b from the user using the next() method.
It then uses the equals() method to compare the two strings a and b. If they are equal, it prints "H" otherwise it prints "D".
<<<Output>>>
H
