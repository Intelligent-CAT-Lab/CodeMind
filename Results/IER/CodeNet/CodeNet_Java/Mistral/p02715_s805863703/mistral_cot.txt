 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N and K are initialized with 3 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to 1.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of num[x] by adding the value of mpow(K/x, N) and subtracting the value of num[j] for j in the range [2*x, K].
Then it calculates the value of ans by multiplying x with num[x] and adding it to the previous value of ans.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
