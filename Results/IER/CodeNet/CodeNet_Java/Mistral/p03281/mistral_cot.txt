 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 105 according to the input. And variable ans is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 105 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current integer i is odd by using the modulo operator (%). If it is odd, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 1 to n to check each integer k in this range. The value of variable k is also passed to variable num.
Inside the inner for loop, it checks if the current integer i is divisible by the current integer k by using the modulo operator (%). If it is divisible, it increments the variable divcount.
After the inner for loop finishes, it checks if the variable divcount is equal to 8. If it is, it increments the variable ans.
After the outer for loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 1.
