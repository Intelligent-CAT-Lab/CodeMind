The variable h and variable w are initialized with 3 and 5 respectively according to the input. And variable ans is initialized with Long.MAX\_VALUE.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 1 to check each integer k in this range.
Inside the for loop, it checks if k is equal to 1. If it is, it swaps the value of h and w.
Then it enters two nested for loops. The outer for loop iterates from 1 to w and the inner for loop iterates from 1 to h.
Inside the outer for loop, it checks if w is greater than or equal to 3. If it is, it calculates the minimum value of ans by calling the calc() method with the values of w1, w2 and w3.
Inside the inner for loop, it calculates the minimum value of ans by calling the calc() method with the values of w1, w2 and w3.
After the loops finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
