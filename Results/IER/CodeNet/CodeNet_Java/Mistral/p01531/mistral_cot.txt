 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable fl is initialized with the input "5R2D".
It enters a while loop and it iterates as long as there is input available.
Inside the loop, it extracts the next line of input and converts it to a character array.
Then it iterates over the characters in the array and for each character it checks its value using a switch statement.
If the character value is 'T', it prints the character 'a'.
If the character value is 'L', it prints the character 'u'.
If the character value is 'U', it prints the character 'o'.
If the character value is 'R', it prints the character 'i'.
If the character value is 'D', it prints the character 'e'.
After the loop finishes, it prints a newline character.
