 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized with the input string "3776".
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each character in the string.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character is equal to the next character in the string. If it is, it sets the flag variable to false.
After the loop finishes, it checks the value of flag. If it is true, it prints "Good" otherwise it prints "Bad".
Since the first character is not equal to the next character, the flag variable is not set to false and the output is "Good".
<<<Output>>>
Good
