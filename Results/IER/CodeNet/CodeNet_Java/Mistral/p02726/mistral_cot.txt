 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n, variable x and variable y are initialized with 5, 2 and 4 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 4 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the number of edges between the current interger num and all other integers in the range [0, 4] using a nested for loop.
It uses the formula Math.min(j-i, Math.min(Math.abs(x-i)+Math.abs(j-y), Math.abs(y-i)+Math.abs(j-x))+1) to calculate the number of edges.
Then it increments the value of edges[edge] for each edge.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable edges as output, which is [0, 1, 2, 3, 4].
<<<Output>>>
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
