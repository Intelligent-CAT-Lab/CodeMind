 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 101 according to the input.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until it finds a value of m that is not already visited.
Inside the loop, it checks if the current value of m is 0, if it is, it prints the value of i and breaks out of the loop.
It calculates the value of m by multiplying 10 with the current value of m and adding 7, then taking the remainder of the result divided by N.
It also keeps track of the length of the string representation of N using variable l.
It also keeps track of the current value of i using variable i.
It also keeps track of whether a value of m has already been visited using boolean array vis.
After the loop finishes, it prints -1 if no value of m is found that is not already visited, otherwise it prints the value of i.
<<<Output>>>
-1
