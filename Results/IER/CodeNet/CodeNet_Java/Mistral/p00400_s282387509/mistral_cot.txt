 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 67 according to the input.
It enters an if-else statement to check if the value of n is between 'a' and 'z' or 'A' and 'Z'.
Since 67 is not a letter, it does not match any of the conditions in the if-else statement.
Therefore, the value of variable ans is 0.
<<<Output>>>
