 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integer inputs x and y from the user. The function solution() takes these two integer inputs and checks if the sum of x and y is even or odd. If the sum is even, it divides the sum by 2 and prints the result. If the sum is odd, it prints "IMPOSSIBLE".
In the main method, it creates a Scanner object to read input from the user and then calls the solution() function with the two inputs.
<<<Output>>>
IMPOSSIBLE
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
