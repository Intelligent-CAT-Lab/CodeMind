 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input from the user using the Scanner class. The input string is stored in the variable s.
Then it uses the replaceAll() method of the String class to replace all occurrences of the comma character (,) with a space character ( ).
The resulting string is then printed to the console using the println() method of the System.out object.
