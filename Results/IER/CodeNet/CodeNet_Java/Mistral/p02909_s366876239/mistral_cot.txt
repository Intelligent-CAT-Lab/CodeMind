 <<<Analysis>>>
The code prompts the user to enter the current weather condition using the `Scanner` class. The user inputs `Sunny` and the variable `today` is assigned the value `Sunny`.
The code then enters an if-else statement to check the value of `today`. If `today` is equal to `Sunny`, the code prints `Cloudy`. If `today` is equal to `Cloudy`, the code prints `Rainy`. If `today` is neither `Sunny` nor `Cloudy`, the code prints `Sunny`.
Since the user input `Sunny`, the code will print `Cloudy` as the output.
<<<Output>>>
Cloudy
