 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes five integers as input, h1, m1, h2, m2 and k. It uses the `nextInt()` method to read each integer from the user.
It calculates the difference between h2 and h1 to get the hours difference and the difference between m2 and m1 to get the minutes difference.
Then it adds the hours difference multiplied by 60 to the minutes difference to get the total time difference in minutes.
Finally, it subtracts the value of k from the total time difference to get the final output.
<<<Output>>>
-30
