 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable casenum is initialized with 1.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to the value of casenum, which is 1 in this case.
Inside the for loop, it reads the input line "erasedream" and stores it in variable s.
It creates an array of strings called good with the values "dream" and "dreamer".
It creates a boolean array called poss with the length of the input string s plus 1, initialized with true.
It iterates through each character in the input string s.
For each character, it checks if the character is already in the poss array.
If it is not, it continues to the next iteration.
If it is, it iterates through the good array and checks if the current substring of s starting from the current character and ending at the end of the good substring matches the good substring.
If it does, it sets the corresponding element in the poss array to true.
After the loop finishes, it checks if the last element of the poss array is true.
If it is, it prints "YES" to the output stream.
If it is not, it prints "NO" to the output stream.
<<<Output>>>
NO
