 <<<Analysis>>>
The program takes two integer inputs A and B from the user. In this case, A is 2 and B is 3.
The program then calls the function `lcm(A,B)` which calculates the least common multiple of A and B.
The function `lcm(A,B)` first calculates the greatest common divisor of A and B using the `gcd(A,B)` function.
Then it calculates the least common multiple of A and B by dividing the product of A and B by the greatest common divisor.
In this case, the greatest common divisor of 2 and 3 is 1, so the least common multiple of 2 and 3 is 2 \* 3 = 6.
The function returns the value 6.
<<<Output>>>
6
