 <<<Analysis>>>
The code prompts the user to enter two integers using the `Scanner` class. The first integer is stored in the variable `a` and the second integer is stored in the variable `b`.
Then it calculates the product of `a` and `b` by multiplying `a` and `b` and subtracting 1 from both of them.
The formula used to calculate the product is `(a-1)*(b-1)`.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is 15.
