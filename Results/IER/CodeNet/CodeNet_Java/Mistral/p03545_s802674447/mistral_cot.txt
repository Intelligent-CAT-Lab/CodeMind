 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized with the input "1222".
It creates an array a of size 4 and initializes it with the values of the digits of the input string s.
It enters a for loop that iterates 2^3 times.
Inside the for loop, it initializes a variable num with the value of the first element of array a.
It creates an array op of size 3 and initializes it with the operators '+' and '-'.
It enters another for loop that iterates 3 times.
Inside this loop, it checks if the current bit of the number i is set to 1. If it is, it adds the value of the current element of array a to num and sets the corresponding element of op to '+'. If it is not, it subtracts the value of the current element of array a from num and sets the corresponding element of op to '-'.
After the loops finish, it checks if the final value of num is equal to 7. If it is, it creates a string ans by concatenating the values of the elements of array a with the corresponding operators from op and the final value of num. It then prints the value of ans.
<<<Output>>>
1222+222=7
