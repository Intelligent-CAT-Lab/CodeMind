 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a line of input from the user using the Scanner class and stores it in the variable t.
It then uses the replace() method to replace the substring "apple" with a newline character "\n" and the substring "peach" with the substring "apple".
Finally, it replaces the newline character "\n" with the substring "peach" using the replace() method.
The resulting string is then printed to the console using the println() method.
The output of the code would be:
```
the cost of one apple is higher than that of one peach.
```
<<<Output>>>
the cost of one apple is higher than that of one peach.
