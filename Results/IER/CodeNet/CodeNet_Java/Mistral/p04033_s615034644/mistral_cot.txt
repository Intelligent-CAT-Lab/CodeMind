 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable a and variable b are initialized with 1 and 3 respectively according to the input.
It enters the solve method and it first checks if the product of a and b is less than or equal to zero. Since it is not, it prints "Zero" and returns from the method.
Then it checks if a is greater than zero. Since it is, it prints "Positive" and returns from the method.
Since both the above conditions are not met, it checks if the difference between b and a is odd. Since it is not, it prints "Negative" and returns from the method.
<<<Output>>>
Negative
