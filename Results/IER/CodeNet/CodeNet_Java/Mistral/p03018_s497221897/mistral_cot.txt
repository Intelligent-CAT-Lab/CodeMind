 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized with the input string "ABCABC". The variable acnt is initialized with 0 and variable sum is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the string s. The value of variable i is also passed to variable c.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character c is 'A'. If it is, it increments the value of variable acnt.
If the current character c is 'B' and the next character is 'C', it adds the value of variable acnt to variable sum and increments the value of variable i.
If the current character c is not 'A' or 'B', it resets the value of variable acnt to 0.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable sum as output, which is 6.
<<<Output>>>
6
