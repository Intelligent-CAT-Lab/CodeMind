 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, H and R. It then calculates the value of H*(-1) and compares it with R.
If H*(-1) is equal to R, it prints 0.
If H*(-1) is greater than R, it prints -1.
If H*(-1) is less than R, it prints 1.

For the given input -3 3, H is -3 and R is 3.
Since H*(-1) is equal to R, it prints 0.

<<<Output>>>
0
