 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input from the standard input stream and then it iterates through each character in the string. For each character, it checks if it is a digit or not. If it is a digit, it adds it to a variable `sum`. If it is not a digit, it adds it to a variable `count`. After the iteration, it prints the value of `sum` and `count`.
If the input string is empty, it prints -1 and -1.
If the input string contains only digits, it prints the sum of the digits and 0.
If the input string contains only non-digit characters, it prints -1 and the count of non-digit characters.
<<<Output>>>
-1 -1
1 0
-1 3
