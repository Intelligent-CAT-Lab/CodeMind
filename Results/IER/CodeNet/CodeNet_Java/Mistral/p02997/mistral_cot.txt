 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N and variable K are initialized with 5 and 3 respectively according to the input. And variable max is calculated as 10.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 10 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger num by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum falls within the range [1, 10]. If it does, it adds the current interger i to variable answer. The condition is met when i is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable answer as output, which is 45.
<<<Output>>>
45
