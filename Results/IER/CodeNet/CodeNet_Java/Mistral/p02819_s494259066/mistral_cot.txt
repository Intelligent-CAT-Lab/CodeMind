 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable X is initialized with 20 according to the input.
It enters the main method and it calls the check method with variable X as an argument.
Inside the check method, it initializes variable n with 3 and it enters a while loop that continues until n*n is less than or equal to X.
Inside the while loop, it checks if X is divisible by n by using the modulo operator (%). If it is divisible, it returns false. Otherwise, it increments n by 2.
After the while loop finishes, it returns true.
Since the check method returns true, the main method continues and it prints the value of X, which is 20.
<<<Output>>>
20
