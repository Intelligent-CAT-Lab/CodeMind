 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads an integer n, two integers a and b, and then iterates from 1 to n. For each integer i, it calculates the sum of the digits of i by repeatedly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum. Then it checks if the calculated variable sum falls within the range [2, 5]. If it does, it adds the current interger i to variable answer. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable answer as output, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
