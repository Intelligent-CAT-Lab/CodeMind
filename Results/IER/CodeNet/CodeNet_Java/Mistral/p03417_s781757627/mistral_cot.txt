The code takes two long inputs n and m from the user using the Scanner class.
It calculates the absolute value of the difference between n and 2, and the difference between m and 2 using the Math.abs() method.
Then it multiplies the two absolute values together and stores the result in variable ans.
Finally, it prints the value of variable ans as output.
