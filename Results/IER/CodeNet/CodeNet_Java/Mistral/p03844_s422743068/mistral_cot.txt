 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three inputs from the user, two integers a and b and an operator op. The operator op can be either + or -.
It then checks the value of the operator op using the equals() method. If the operator is +, it adds the two integers a and b and prints the result using the println() method. If the operator is -, it subtracts the second integer b from the first integer a and prints the result using the println() method.
In this case, the input is `1 + 2` which means that the operator op is + and the two integers a and b are 1 and 2 respectively.
