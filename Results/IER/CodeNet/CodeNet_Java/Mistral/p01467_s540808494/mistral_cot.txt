The variable A, B and k are initialized with 99, 98 and 1 respectively according to the input. And variable t is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 98 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable an and bn.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable t by recursively calling the function dfs with the current value of i.
The function dfs takes three arguments: i, k and b. It first checks if the length of A is equal to i. If it is, it returns 0.
It then calculates the value of variable an and bn by subtracting '0' from the corresponding characters of A and B.
It then checks if the value of an - b is greater than or equal to bn. If it is, it calculates the value of variable v by subtracting bn from an - b and multiplying it by the value of pow[i]. It then adds this value to the result of the recursive call of dfs with i+1, k and 0.
It else, it calculates the value of variable v by subtracting bn from an - b + 10 and multiplying it by the value of pow[i]. It then adds this value to the result of the recursive call of dfs with i+1, k and 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable t as output, which is 100.
