 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 2 according to the input.
It calculates the number of binary digits of N by converting N to binary string and finding the length of the string. The length of the binary string of 2 is 1.
Then it checks if N is equal to 2^(binaryNumDigits) - 1. Since 2^1 = 2 and 2^1 - 1 = 1, the condition is not met.
Since the condition is not met, it returns the value of binaryNumDigits - 1, which is 0.
<<<Output>>>
