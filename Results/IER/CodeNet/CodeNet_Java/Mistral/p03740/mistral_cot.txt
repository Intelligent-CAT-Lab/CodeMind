 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the Scanner class from the java.util package.
Then it creates a new Scanner object named sc and uses it to read input from the user.
It reads two long integers from the user using the nextLong() method of the Scanner class and stores them in two variables.
It then calculates the absolute difference between the two integers using the Math.abs() method and compares it with 1.
If the absolute difference is less than or equal to 1, it prints "Brown" otherwise it prints "Alice".
<<<Output>>>
Alice
