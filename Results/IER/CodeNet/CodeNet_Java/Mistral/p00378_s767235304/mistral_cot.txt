 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable A, variable B and variable X are initialized with 180, 100 and 2400 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 1000 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable z.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable y by dividing variable z by 500.
Then it calculates the value of variable nedan by multiplying variable i with A and adding variable y multiplied by B.
It also checks if variable z is divisible by 500. If it is, it calculates the value of variable G by multiplying variable B with variable T. If it is not, it calculates the value of variable G by multiplying variable B with variable T plus 1.
It also checks if variable O is less than variable G and variable mini. If it is, it prints the value of variable O. If variable G is less than variable O and variable mini, it prints the value of variable G. If variable mini is less than or equal to variable O and variable G, it prints the value of variable mini.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable mini as output, which is 180.
<<<Output>>>
180
