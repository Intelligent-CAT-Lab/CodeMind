The variable numN is initialized with 1 and variable resX is initialized with 800.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 6 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger num by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum falls within the range [1, 6]. If it does, it adds the current interger i to variable resX. The condition is met when i is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable resX as output, which is 800.
<<<Output>>>
800
