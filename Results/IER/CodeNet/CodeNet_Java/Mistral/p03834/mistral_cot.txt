 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a line of input from the user using BufferedReader and InputStreamReader. The line of input is stored in the variable s.
Then it uses the replace() method of the String class to replace all occurrences of the comma character (',') with a space character (' ') in the string s.
Finally, it prints the modified string using the println() method of the System.out object.
