 <<<Analysis>>>
The code is a Java program that uses the FastScanner class to read input from the user and the PrintWriter class to write output to the console. The program reads an integer n from the user and then checks if n is divisible by 7. If n is divisible by 7, the program prints "fri" to the console. If n is not divisible by 7, the program prints the day of the week corresponding to n using a series of if-else statements.
The program uses a static class called Methods to perform various mathematical operations such as calculating the greatest common divisor (gcd), least common multiple (lcm), factorial, and manhattan distance.
The program also uses a static class called FastScanner to read input from the user. The FastScanner class has several methods such as hasNextByte, readByte, skip, hasNext, next, nextArray, nextInt, nextIntArray, nextLong, nextLongArray, nextDouble, and nextDoubleArray that are used to read different types of input from the user.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is the output that is printed to the console. If n is divisible by 7, the program prints "fri" to the console. If n is not divisible by 7, the program prints the day of the week corresponding to n using a series of if-else statements. The output of the program depends on the value of n that is entered by the user.
