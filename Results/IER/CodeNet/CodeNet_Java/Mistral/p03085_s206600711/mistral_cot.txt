 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input from the standard input stream using the Scanner class. The string input is stored in the variable s.
Then it checks the value of s using a series of if-else statements. If the value of s is "A", it prints "T" to the standard output stream using the PrintStream class. If the value of s is "T", it prints "A" to the standard output stream. If the value of s is "G", it prints "C" to the standard output stream. If the value of s is "C", it prints "G" to the standard output stream.

<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is not applicable as it is a void function. It only prints the output to the standard output stream.
