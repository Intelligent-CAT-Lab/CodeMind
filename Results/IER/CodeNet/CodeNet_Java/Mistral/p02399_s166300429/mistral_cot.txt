 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the Scanner class from the java.util package. It then creates a new Scanner object named in and uses it to read two integers a and b from the user.
It then calculates the value of c by dividing a by b and converting the result to a double by multiplying it by 1.0.
Finally, it prints the values of a, b, and c using the System.out.println() method.
<<<Output>>>
