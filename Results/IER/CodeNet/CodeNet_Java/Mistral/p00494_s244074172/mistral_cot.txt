 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable str is initialized with the input "OJJOOIIOJOI".
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 9 to check each character in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable tmp.
Inside the for loop, it checks the current character of string str and assigns it to variable tmp[0].
It then checks if the current character is repeated by using a while loop. If it is, it increments the variable cnt and increments the value of i.
It then adds the current character and the value of cnt to the tmp array and adds it to the list.
After the loop finishes, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 1 to 8 to check each string in the list.
It then checks if the current string has the character "O" and if it does, it checks if the next string has the character "I" and if it does, it checks if the next string has the character "J" and if it does, it checks if the value of the current string's second element is greater than or equal to the value of the next string's second element and if it is, it updates the value of answer.
It then prints the final value of variable answer as output.
