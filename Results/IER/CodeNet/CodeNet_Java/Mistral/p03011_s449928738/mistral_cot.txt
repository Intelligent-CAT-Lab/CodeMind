 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first creates a Scanner object to read input from the user. It then creates an integer array X of size 3.
The user is prompted to enter three integers, which are stored in the array X.
The array X is then sorted using the Arrays.sort() method.
Finally, the sum of the first two elements of the sorted array X is printed to the console.
