 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input from the user using the Scanner class. The first integer is 100 and the second integer is 17.
It subtracts the second integer from the first integer and stores the result in variable sum.
It then checks if the value of variable sum is less than or equal to 0. If it is, it prints 0 as output. Otherwise, it prints the value of variable sum as output.
<<<Output>>>
0
