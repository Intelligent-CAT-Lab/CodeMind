 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 117 according to the input.
It then converts the integer n to a string using the `String.valueOf()` method and stores it in the variable string.
Then it uses the `contains()` method of the string class to check if the string contains the character "7".
Since the string "117" contains the character "7", the `contains()` method returns true and the `if` statement evaluates to true.
Therefore, the return value of the code is "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
