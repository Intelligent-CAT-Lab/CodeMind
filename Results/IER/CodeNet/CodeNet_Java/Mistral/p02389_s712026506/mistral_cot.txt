The variable a and variable b are initialized with 3 and 5 respectively according to the input.
It creates a new integer object by multiplying the values of a and b using the `*` operator and then converts it to a string using the `toString()` method.
It then concatenates the string representation of the integer object with the string representation of the sum of 2 times the values of a and b using the `+` operator.
Finally, it prints the concatenated string as output.
