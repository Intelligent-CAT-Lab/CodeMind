The variable n and variable m are initialized with 2 and 1 respectively according to the input.
The variable dp is initialized with an array of size n+1 and its first element is set to 1.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to n to calculate the value of dp[j] for each j.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 1 to min(m, j) to calculate the value of dp[j] for each j.
It calculates the value of dp[j] by adding the value of dp[j-i]/j for each i.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of dp[n] as output, which is 1.
