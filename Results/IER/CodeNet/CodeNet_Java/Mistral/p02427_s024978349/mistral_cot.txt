 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 4 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 15 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable factorial.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the factorial of 2 raised to the power of n by multiplying 2 raised to the power of n.
Then it creates a character array cha of size n.
It enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to factorial - 1.
Inside this loop, it converts the current integer i to binary string using Integer.toBinaryString() method and stores it in variable str.
Then it iterates from 0 to the length of the binary string str and stores each character of the string in cha array.
It prints the current integer i followed by the index of the first '1' character in the binary string str.
After the loop finishes, it prints a new line.
The output for n = 4 is:
0: 0
1: 1
2: 2
3: 3
4: 4
5: 5
6: 6
7: 7
8: 8
9: 9
10: 10
11: 11
12: 12
13: 13
14: 14
15: 15
