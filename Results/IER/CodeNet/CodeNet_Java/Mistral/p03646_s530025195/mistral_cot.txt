 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable K is initialized with 0 according to the input.
It enters the solve method and it first creates an array a of size N with all elements initialized to N - 1 + K / N.
Then it enters two nested for loops. The outer loop iterates from 0 to (int) (K % N) and the inner loop iterates from 0 to a.length - 1.
Inside the inner loop, it checks if j is equal to i, if it is, it increments a[j] by N, otherwise it decrements a[j] by 1.
After the loops finish, it returns the length of the array a and the array a concatenated with spaces as a string.
