 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N and variable K are initialized with 4 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to N-1 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of ans by repeatedly adding the value of ans divided by (K-1) plus 1.
The condition is met when i is 0,1,2,3.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
