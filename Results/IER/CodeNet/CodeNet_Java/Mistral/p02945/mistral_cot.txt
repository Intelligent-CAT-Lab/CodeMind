 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable a and variable b are initialized with -13 and 3 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 2 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger i by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum falls within the range [2, 5]. If it does, it adds the current interger i to variable answer. The condition is met when i is 1, 2 and 3.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable answer as output, which is 1.
