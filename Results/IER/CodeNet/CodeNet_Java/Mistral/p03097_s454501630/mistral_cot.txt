 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n, variable a and variable b are initialized with 2, 1 and 3 respectively according to the input.
The variable mask is initialized with 15, which is the value of (1 << n) - 1.
The variable div is initialized with -1.
The variable c is initialized with 0.
The variable C is initialized with 14, which is the value of A ^ c.
The variable ans is initialized with an empty ArrayList.

It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to n to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable div.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger i is set in the mask by checking if (((A ^ B) & mask) & (1 << i)) > 0. If it is, it sets the variable div to i.
Then it calculates the value of variable c by performing bitwise AND operation between mask and (-mask).
It performs bitwise XOR operation between mask and (1 << div) to get the value of C.
It enters two recursive calls to solve method with variable A, variable C and variable mask, and variable C^ (1 << div), variable B and variable mask.
After the recursive calls finish, it adds the value of variable C to variable ans.
After the for loop finishes, it prints the values of variable ans and variable b.

The output of the code is:
```
1 3
```
