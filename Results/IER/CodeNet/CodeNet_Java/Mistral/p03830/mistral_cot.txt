The variable N is initialized with 3 according to the input. And variable cnt is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable temp.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the count of factors of the current interger temp by repeatedlly extracting the factors of number with a while loop and adding it to variable cnt.
The factors of 2 are 1 and 2, the factors of 3 are 1 and 3.
Then it checks if the current interger temp is greater than 1. Since temp is 2 and 3, it is not greater than 1, so no additional factor is added to variable cnt.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable cnt as output, which is [1, 2].
<<<Output>>>
[1, 2]
