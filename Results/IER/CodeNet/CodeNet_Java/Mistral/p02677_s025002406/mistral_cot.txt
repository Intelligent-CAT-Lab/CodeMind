 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable A, variable B, variable H and variable M are initialized with 3, 4, 9 and 0 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 360 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable H and variable M.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the values of H1 and H2 by multiplying variable A with the sine and cosine of the angle H*30+M*0.5 in radians.
Then it calculates the values of M1 and M2 by multiplying variable B with the sine and cosine of the angle M*6 in radians.
After the loop finishes, it calculates the square root of the sum of the squares of the differences between H1, H2, M1 and M2.
Finally, it print the fianl value of the square root of the sum of the squares of the differences as output.
<<<Output>>>
10.0
