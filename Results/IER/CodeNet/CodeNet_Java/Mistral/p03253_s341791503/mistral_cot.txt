 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N and M are initialized with 2 and 6 respectively according to the input. And variable unko is initialized with an empty ArrayList.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until the size of unko is 0.
Inside the while loop, it calls the fra() method with variable M and variable unko as arguments.
The fra() method uses a for loop to iterate from 2 to the square root of variable M. If variable M is divisible by variable i, it adds variable i to the unko ArrayList.
After the while loop finishes, it enters another while loop and it iterates until the size of unko is 0.
Inside the while loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger num by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum falls within the range [2, 6]. If it does, it adds the current interger i to variable answer. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,6.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable answer as output, which is 15.
<<<Output>>>
15
