 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 2 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 3 to 3500 to check each integer h in this range.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 1 to 3*N/4 to check each integer w in this range.
It calculates the value of variable n by dividing N*h*w by 4*h*w-N*w-N*h.
Then it checks if the calculated variable n is greater than 0 and if 4*h*n*w==N*(h*n+n*w+h*w). If both conditions are met, it prints the value of h, n and w and returns from the function.
After the loops finish, it returns from the function without printing anything.
<<<Output>>>
No output is returned.
