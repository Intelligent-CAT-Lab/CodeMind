 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two BigInteger inputs from the user using Scanner class and then calculates the remainder of the first BigInteger divided by the second BigInteger using the remainder() method of the BigInteger class.
It enters an infinite loop using while(in.hasNext()) and it continues to read inputs until the user enters a non-numeric input.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code for the input `5 8` would be 3.
