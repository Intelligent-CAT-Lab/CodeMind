 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized with the input string "CODEFESTIVAL". The variable b1 is initialized with false and variable b2 is initialized with false.
It enters a for loop and it iterates through each character in the string s.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character c is equal to 'C'. If it is, it sets variable b1 to true.
Then it checks if variable b1 is true and the current character c is equal to 'F'. If it is, it sets variable b2 to true.
After the loop finishes, it checks the value of variable b2. If it is true, it prints "Yes" otherwise it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
