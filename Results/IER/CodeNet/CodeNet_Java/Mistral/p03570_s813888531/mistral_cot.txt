 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 9 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 8 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable mask.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the minimum value of dp[mask] by checking all possible values of dp[mask ^ 1 << j] for j = 0 to 25.
Then it prints the maximum value of dp[mask] as output, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
