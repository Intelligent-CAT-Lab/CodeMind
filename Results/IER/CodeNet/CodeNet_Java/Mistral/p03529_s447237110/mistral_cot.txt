 <<<Analysis>>>
The program reads two integers from the standard input, which are 2 and 2. It then calls the `calcSum` method of the `GMancala` class with these two integers as arguments. The `calcSum` method calculates the sum of the digits of the two integers and returns the result.

The program then calls the `calcSubtract` method of the `GMancala` class with the same two integers as arguments. The `calcSubtract` method calculates the sum of the digits of the two integers and returns the result.

Finally, the program subtracts the result of the `calcSubtract` method from the result of the `calcSum` method and returns the result.

<<<Output>>>
The return value of the program is 0.
