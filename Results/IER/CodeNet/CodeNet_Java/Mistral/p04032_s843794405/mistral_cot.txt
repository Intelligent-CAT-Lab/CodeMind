 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first reads a string input from the user using the Scanner class. It then calculates the length of the string using the length() method.
It then enters two for loops, the first one iterates from 1 to the length of the string minus 1, and the second one iterates from 2 to the length of the string minus 1.
Inside the first loop, it checks if the current character is equal to the previous character. If it is, it prints the index of the current character plus 1 and the index of the previous character plus 1, and then exits the program using the System.exit(0) method.
Inside the second loop, it checks if the current character is equal to the previous character plus 2. If it is, it prints the index of the previous character plus 1 minus 1 and the index of the current character plus 1, and then exits the program using the System.exit(0) method.
If none of the conditions are met, it prints -1 -1 as output.
<<<Output>>>
-1 -1
