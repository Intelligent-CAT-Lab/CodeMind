The variable K is initialized with 6 according to the input. And variable dp is initialized with an array of size 6, all elements are initialized with Integer.MAX\_VALUE.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until the deque is empty.
Inside the while loop, it polls the first element from the deque and assigns it to variable curr.
It calculates two new variables v1 and v2 by taking the next digit of curr and the last digit of curr respectively.
It then checks if dp[v1] is greater than dp[curr] + 1. If it is, it adds v1 to the deque and updates dp[v1] to dp[curr] + 1.
It also checks if dp[v2] is greater than dp[curr]. If it is, it adds v2 to the deque and updates dp[v2] to dp[curr].
After the loop finishes, it prints the value of dp[0], which is 1.
