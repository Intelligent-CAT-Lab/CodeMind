 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable e is initialized as a LinkedList<Integer> and it is used to store the input values. The variable each is used to count the number of occurrences of each distinct element in the list. The variable disinct is used to store the distinct elements of the list.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 11 to add each integer to the list e.
Then it checks if the number of distinct elements in the list is greater than 3. If it is, it prints "no" and returns.
After that, it sorts the list e in ascending order.
Then it converts the sorted list to an array using the stream() method and the toArray() method.
It enters another for loop and it iterates over the array disinct. For each element in the array, it counts the number of occurrences of that element in the list e using the stream() method and the filter() method.
If the number of occurrences is not 4, 8 or 12, it prints "no" and returns.
After the loop finishes, it prints "yes" as output.
<<<Output>>>
