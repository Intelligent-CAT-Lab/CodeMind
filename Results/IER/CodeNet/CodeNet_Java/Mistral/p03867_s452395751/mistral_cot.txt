 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and k are initialized with 4 and 2 respectively according to the input. And variable divisors is initialized as an empty list.
For each integer i from 1 to n, it checks if n is divisible by i. If it is, it adds i to the list of divisors.
It then sorts the list of divisors in ascending order.

It then initializes an array ptn of size equal to the size of the list of divisors. For each integer i in the list of divisors, it calculates the value of ptn[i] as follows:
- If n is divisible by i, it calculates ptn[i] as (k^(i+1)/2) modulo 1000000007.
- If n is not divisible by i, it calculates ptn[i] as 0.

It then iterates over the list of divisors and calculates the value of add for each divisor i as follows:
- If n is divisible by i, it calculates add as (ptn[i] * i) modulo 1000000007.
- If n is not divisible by i, it calculates add as 0.

It then calculates the final value of ans as the sum of all the values of add.

After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of ans as output, which is 10.
