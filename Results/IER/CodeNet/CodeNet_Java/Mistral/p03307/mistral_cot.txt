 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 3 according to the input.
The function problem102a takes an integer n as an argument and returns the value of n if it is even, otherwise it returns the value of n multiplied by 2.
In this case, since n is 3, which is an odd number, the function returns the value of 3 multiplied by 2, which is 6.
<<<Output>>>
6
