 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable a and variable b are initialized with 4 and 12 respectively according to the input.
It enters a while loop and it reads each line of input until it reaches the end of the input.
Inside the while loop, it extracts the values of a and b from the input line using StringTokenizer.
Then it calls the egcd function with the values of a and b as arguments.
The egcd function uses the extended Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of a and b.
It returns an array of two integers, which are the values of x and y that satisfy the equation a = mx + ny, where m and n are integers with no common factors other than 1.
In this case, the values of x and y are 2 and 1 respectively.
After the loop finishes, it prints the values of x and y as output, which are 2 and 1 respectively.
<<<Output>>>
