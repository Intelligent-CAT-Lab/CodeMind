 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 8 according to the input.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until the condition n % 2 == 0 is met.
Inside the loop, it calculates the next value of n by dividing it by 2 if n is even or multiplying it by 3 and adding 1 if n is odd.
It also checks if the value of n - 1 is already in the array A by checking the boolean value of A[n - 1].
If it is true, it means that the value of n - 1 is already in the array A and the loop breaks.
If it is false, it means that the value of n - 1 is not in the array A, so it adds it to the array A and increments the count variable.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable count as output, which is 5.
<<<Output>>>
5
