 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable a, variable b, variable c and variable k are initialized with 1, 2, 3 and 1 respectively according to the input.
It first calculates the value of ans by subtracting variable b from variable a.
Then it checks if the absolute value of ans is greater than 10^18. If it is, it prints "Unfair" and returns.
Then it checks if k is even. If it is, it prints the value of ans. If it is odd, it prints the value of ans multiplied by -1.
In this case, the value of ans is 1, which is less than 10^18, k is 1 which is odd, so it prints the value of ans multiplied by -1, which is -1.
<<<Output>>>
-1
