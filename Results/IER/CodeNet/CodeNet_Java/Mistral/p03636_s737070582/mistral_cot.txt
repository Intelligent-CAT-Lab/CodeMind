 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized with the input "internationalization". The length of the string is calculated by subtracting 2 from the length of the string.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the string minus 2. The value of variable i is also passed to variable word.
Inside the for loop, it assigns the character at index i of the string s to the corresponding index of the character array word.
Then it prints the first character of the string, the length of the string minus 2 and the last character of the string.
The first character is 'i', the length of the string minus 2 is 9 and the last character is 'n'.
So the output of the code will be "in".
