 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable a, variable b and variable n are initialized with 5, 7 and 4 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to n to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable x.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of x by taking the minimum of b - 1 and n.
Then it calculates the final value of ans by multiplying variable a with x and dividing it by variable b.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
