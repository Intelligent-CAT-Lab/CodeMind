 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable X and variable Y are initialized with 1 and 1 respectively according to the input.
It enters the solve method and it calculates the value of ans by adding the maximum of 0 and 4 - X and 4 - Y multiplied by 100000.
It also checks if X and Y are equal to 1, in which case it adds 400000 to ans.
After the calculation, it prints the value of ans as output.
<<<Output>>>
