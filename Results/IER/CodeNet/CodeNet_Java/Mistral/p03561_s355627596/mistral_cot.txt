 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable k and n are initialized with 3 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable num by repeatedly subtracting 1 from variable k.
Then it checks if the value of variable num is equal to 1. If it is, it prints the value of variable k.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable k as output, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
