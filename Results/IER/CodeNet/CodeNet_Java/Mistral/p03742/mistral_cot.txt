 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers from the standard input, which are 2 and 1 respectively. It then calls the `solve()` method, which is the main logic of the program.
The `solve()` method first reads two integers from the standard input, which are X and Y. It then calls the `dfs()` method, which is a recursive function that performs a depth-first search on a grid of size X by Y.
The `dfs()` method takes two integer arguments, x and y, which represent the current position in the grid. It first checks if the current position has already been visited. If it has, it returns false. If it hasn't, it marks the current position as visited and recursively calls itself with the next position in the grid.
The `dfs()` method uses a boolean array `dp` to keep track of whether a position has been visited or not. It also uses a boolean array `visited` to keep track of whether a position has been visited or not.
The `dfs()` method returns true if it reaches the end of the grid (i.e., if it reaches the position (x, y) such that x = 0 or y = 0). If it reaches the end of the grid, it returns false.
The `solve()` method returns true if the `dfs()` method returns true for any position in the grid. If the `dfs()` method returns false for all positions in the grid, the `solve()` method returns false.
The `solve()` method then returns the result of the `printlnYN()` method, which prints "Brown" if the `dfs()` method returns true for at least one position in the grid, and "Alice" otherwise.

Brown
