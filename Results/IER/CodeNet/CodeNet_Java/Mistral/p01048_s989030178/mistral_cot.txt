 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 1 according to the input. And variable count is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the number of factors of the current interger num by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a for loop and adding it to variable count.
Then it checks if the calculated variable count equals to 1. If it does, it print the current value of variable i as output, which is 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable count as output, which is 1.
<<<Output>>>
