The variable n, variable a and variable b are initialized with 4, 1 and 3 respectively according to the input.
The variable ans is initialized with 0.
It enters a main method and it calls two functions binarypow and combination.
The function binarypow is called with 2 and n as arguments. It calculates the value of 2 raised to the power of n using the binary exponentiation algorithm. The result is 16.
The function combination is called with n and a as arguments. It calculates the number of ways to choose a subset of size a from a set of size n. The result is 1.
The function combination is called again with n and b as arguments. It calculates the number of ways to choose a subset of size b from a set of size n. The result is 1.
The variable ans is updated by subtracting the result of combination(n, a) and combination(n, b) from the result of binarypow(2, n).
The final value of ans is 15.
<<<Output>>>
15
