 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized with "?12345678901".
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 9 to check each integer j in this range.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger j by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum is equal to 12345678901. If it is, it increments the variable cnt and assigns the value of j to variable ans.
The condition is met when j is 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 and 9.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 0.
<<<Output>>>
