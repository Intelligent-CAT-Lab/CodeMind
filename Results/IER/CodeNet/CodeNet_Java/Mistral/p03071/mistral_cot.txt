 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable A and variable B are initialized with 5 and 3 respectively according to the input. The variable c is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the value of variable A is greater than or equal to the value of variable B. If it is, it adds the value of variable A to variable c and subtracts 1 from variable A. If it is not, it adds the value of variable B to variable c and subtracts 1 from variable B.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable c as output, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
