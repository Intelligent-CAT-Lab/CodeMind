 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable a, variable b, variable c and variable d are initialized with 1, 1, 3 and 4 respectively according to the input.
It enters a static method called help(w,h) and it takes two parameters w and h.
It first checks if w is equal to 0, if it is, it returns 0.
Then it checks if w is less than or equal to h, if it is, it calls the gcd(w,h) method to find the greatest common divisor of w and h.
If the greatest common divisor is equal to 1, it returns the sum of w and h minus 1.
Otherwise, it calls the help(w/c,h/c) method recursively with the new values of w and h divided by the greatest common divisor.
It enters a while loop in the gcd(a,b) method to find the greatest common divisor of a and b.
It repeatedly subtracts the remainder of a divided by b from a and assigns the new value of a to b.
It continues this process until the remainder of a divided by b is 0.
Then it returns the value of b.
After the method returns, it prints the return value of the help method.
