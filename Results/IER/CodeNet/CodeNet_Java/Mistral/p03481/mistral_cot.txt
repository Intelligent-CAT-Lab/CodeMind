 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two long inputs X and Y from the user. It initializes a variable i to 0 and enters a while loop. The loop continues until X is less than or equal to Y. Inside the loop, it increments the value of i and multiplies the value of X by 2.
After the loop finishes, it prints the value of i as output.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code would be 10.
