The variable k is initialized with 6 according to the input.
It creates an array of size k and initializes all elements of this array with INF.
It creates an adjacency list of size k and initializes all elements of this list with an empty list.
It adds two edges to the adjacency list of node 1, one to node 2 with cost 1 and one to node 6 with cost 0.
It adds two edges to the adjacency list of node 2, one to node 3 with cost 1 and one to node 5 with cost 0.
It adds two edges to the adjacency list of node 3, one to node 4 with cost 1 and one to node 5 with cost 0.
It adds two edges to the adjacency list of node 4, one to node 5 with cost 1 and one to node 6 with cost 0.
It adds two edges to the adjacency list of node 5, one to node 6 with cost 1 and one to node 7 with cost 0.
It adds two edges to the adjacency list of node 6, one to node 7 with cost 1 and one to node 0 with cost 0.
It adds two edges to the adjacency list of node 7, one to node 0 with cost 1 and one to node 1 with cost 0.
It calls the calc() method with the starting node 1.
Inside the calc() method, it creates a priority queue and adds a new P object with the starting node 1 and distance 0.
It sets the distance of the starting node 1 to 0.
It enters a while loop that continues until the priority queue is empty.
Inside the while loop, it polls the priority queue and gets the P object with the smallest distance.
It checks if the distance of the current node is smaller than the distance stored in the P object. If it is, it continues to the next iteration of the while loop.
Otherwise, it iterates through the adjacency list of the current node and for each edge, it checks if the distance to the destination node is smaller than the sum of the distance to the current node and the cost of the edge. If it is, it updates the distance of the destination node and adds it to the priority queue.
After the while loop finishes, it returns the distance of the destination node, which is 6.
