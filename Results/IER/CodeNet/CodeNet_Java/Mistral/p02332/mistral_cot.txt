 <<<Analysis>>>
The program reads two integers n and k from the standard input using the FastScanner class.
It then creates an instance of the Combinatrics class with k as an argument.
The program then calls the permutation method of the Combinatrics class with n and k as arguments.
The permutation method calculates the number of permutations of k items taken from a set of n items.
It returns the result of the permutation method, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
