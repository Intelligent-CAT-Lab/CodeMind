 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable data is initialized with an array of integers [1, 6, 3] according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to extract the values of the array and store it in variable data[i].
Then it sorts the array in ascending order using the Arrays.sort() method.
It calculates the sum of the absolute difference between adjacent elements of the array by using two for loops. The first loop iterates from 0 to 1 and the second loop iterates from 1 to 2.
It calculates the absolute difference between data[1] and data[0] and adds it to variable sum.
It calculates the absolute difference between data[1] and data[2] and adds it to variable sum.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable sum as output, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
