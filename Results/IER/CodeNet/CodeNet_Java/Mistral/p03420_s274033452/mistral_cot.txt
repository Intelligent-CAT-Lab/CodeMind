 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N and variable K are initialized with 5 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 3 to 5 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable ans.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of ans by multiplying the value of i-K and N/i.
Then it checks if N%i is not equal to 0 and N%i is greater than or equal to K. If it is true, it adds the value of K to ans.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
