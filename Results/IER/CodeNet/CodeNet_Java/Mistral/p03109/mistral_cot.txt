 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable time is initialized with the input string "2019/04/30". The substring() method is used to extract the last 4 characters of the string, which is "30".
Then it checks if the first character of the extracted string is "1" or if the second character of the extracted string is greater than 4.
Since the first character of the extracted string is "3" and the second character is "0", both conditions are false.
Therefore, the output of the code is "Heisei".
<<<Output>>>
Heisei
