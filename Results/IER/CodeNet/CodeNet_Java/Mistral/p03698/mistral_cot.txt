 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable inputString is initialized with the input string "uncopyrightable" by splitting it into a list of strings using the split() method.
It then creates a HashSet called removeDuplication and adds each string from the inputString list to it.
It then checks if the size of the inputString list is equal to the size of the removeDuplication set. If it is, it sets the ans variable to "yes", otherwise it sets it to "no".
<<<Output>>>
no
