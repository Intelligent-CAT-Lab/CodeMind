The variable arr is initialized with 4 integers, which are read from the user using the Scanner class. The variable total is initialized with 0 and it is incremented by adding each element of the array in the for loop.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable diff.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the difference between total and the sum of the first element and the current element of the array multiplied by 2. It then updates the value of variable min with the minimum of the current value of min and the calculated difference.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable min as output, which is 1.
