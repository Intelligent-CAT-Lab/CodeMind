 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable a, variable b and variable angle are initialized with 4, 3 and 90 respectively according to the input. And variable rad is calculated by converting the value of variable angle from degree to radians.
It enters an if-else statement to check the value of variable angle. If it is 90, it calculates the area of the rectangle by multiplying the length and width of the rectangle and dividing it by 2. It also calculates the circumference of the rectangle by adding the length and width of the rectangle and taking the square root of the sum. Finally, it calculates the height of the rectangle by taking the width of the rectangle.
If the value of variable angle is not 90, it calculates the area of the triangle by multiplying the length and width of the triangle and multiplying it by the sine of the angle in radians and dividing it by 2. It also calculates the circumference of the triangle by adding the length and width of the triangle and taking the square root of the sum minus twice the product of the length and width of the triangle and the cosine of the angle in radians. Finally, it calculates the height of the triangle by multiplying the width of the triangle by the sine of the angle in radians.
After the calculation, it prints the values of area, circumference and height.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is:
```
12.0
24.0
18.0
```
This is the output of the program when the input is `4 3 90`.
