 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first creates a Stack object and a Scanner object. It then reads the input line from the Scanner object and splits it into an array of strings using the split() method.
It then iterates through the array of strings and performs the operation specified by each string. If the string is "+", it adds the top two elements of the stack together and pushes the result onto the stack. If the string is "-", it pops the top two elements of the stack, subtracts the second element from the first element, and pushes the result onto the stack. If the string is "*", it multiplies the top two elements of the stack and pushes the result onto the stack. If the string is anything else, it converts the string to an integer and pushes it onto the stack.
After the loop finishes, it pops the top element of the stack and prints it as output.
