 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable m and variable n are initialized with 2 and 3 respectively according to the input.
The function `pow(long m, long n)` is called with m and n as arguments.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until n is greater than 0.
Inside the while loop, it checks if the remainder of n divided by 2 is equal to 1. If it is, it multiplies the current value of res by m.
Then it multiplies the current value of m by itself and shifts the bits of n to the right by 1.
After the loop finishes, it returns the final value of res, which is 8.
<<<Output>>>
8
