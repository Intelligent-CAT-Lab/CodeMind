 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads the input as a string and then converts it to an integer using the `Integer.parseInt()` method.
It then checks if the integer is less than or equal to 255. If it is, it increments the `ans` variable.
The `solve()` method is called with the input string, a `PrintWriter` object and a `Methods` object.
The `solve()` method uses nested loops to iterate over all possible substrings of the input string. For each substring, it checks if all four substrings have the same length. If they do, it converts each substring to an integer using the `Integer.parseInt()` method and checks if each integer is less than or equal to 255. If all four integers are less than or equal to 255, it increments the `ans` variable.
The `solve()` method returns the value of the `ans` variable.
