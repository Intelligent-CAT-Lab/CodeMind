 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 3 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable ex.
Inside the for loop, it calls the function primeFactorize(i) and it returns a list of maps.
The function primeFactorize(i) takes an integer n as input and it returns a list of maps. It iterates from 2 to n and for each integer a, it checks if n is divisible by a. If it is, it initializes a variable ex to 0 and it increments it until n is no longer divisible by a. Then it adds a map with key a and value ex to the list of maps.
If n is not divisible by any integer from 2 to n, it adds a map with key n and value 1 to the list of maps.
After the for loop finishes, it calculates the final value of variable ans by multiplying all the values of ex + 1 and then taking the modulo with 1000000007.
The final value of variable ans is 1.
