 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable k is initialized with 15 according to the input.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until the value of variable cnt is equal to 15.
Inside the while loop, it first increments the value of variable cnt.
Then it extracts the last element of the deque by calling the pollLast() method and stores it in variable temp.
It calculates the remainder of variable temp divided by 10 and stores it in variable modTen.
If modTen is not equal to 0, it adds the element (temp * 10 + modTen - 1) to the front of the deque by calling the addFirst() method.
Then it adds the element (temp * 10 + modTen) to the front of the deque by calling the addFirst() method.
If modTen is not equal to 9, it adds the element (temp * 10 + modTen + 1) to the front of the deque by calling the addFirst() method.
After the loop finishes, it prints the value of variable temp as output, which is 15.
<<<Output>>>
15
