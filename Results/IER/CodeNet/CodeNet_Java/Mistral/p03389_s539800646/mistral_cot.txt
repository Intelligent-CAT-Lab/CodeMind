The variable list is initialized with 2, 5 and 4 according to the input.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until the value of list[2] is less than or equal to 52.
Inside the while loop, it checks if the three elements of the list are equal. If they are, it breaks out of the loop.
If they are not equal, it increments the first two elements of the list by 1 and sorts them again.
If the first two elements are equal, it increments the first element by 2 and sorts the list again.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable times as output, which is 1.
