 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and variable m are initialized with 1 and 1 respectively according to the input.
It enters a void function run() and it reads the values of n and m from the user using the Scanner class.
Then it calculates the value of variable base by multiplying n with 100 and m with 1800 and adding them together.
It prints the value of base followed by the value of m using the System.out.println() method.
The output of the program would be 1801.
<<<Output>>>
