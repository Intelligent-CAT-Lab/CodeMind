The variable s is initialized with the input string "+-++". The variable ch is initialized with the character array representation of the string s. The variable x is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the string s. The value of variable ch[i] is checked in each iteration.
If ch[i] is '+', x is incremented by 1. If ch[i] is '-', x is decremented by 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable x as output, which is 2.
