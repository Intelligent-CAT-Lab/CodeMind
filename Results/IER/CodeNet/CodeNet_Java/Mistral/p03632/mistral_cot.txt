 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads the input from the console using BufferedReader and InputStreamReader. It then uses the lines() method to read each line of the input and the map() method to convert each line into an array of integers. The mapToInt() method is used to convert the array of integers into an int[] array.
It then uses the forEach() method to iterate over each int[] array and extract the values of a, b, c and d.
It calculates the start and end values by finding the maximum of a and c and the minimum of b and d respectively.
Finally, it prints the difference between end and start.
