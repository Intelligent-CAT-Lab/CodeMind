 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable x, variable k and variable d are initialized with 6, 2 and 4 respectively according to the input.
It enters a if-else statement to check if the absolute value of x is greater than or equal to k times d.
If it is, it calculates the answer by subtracting k times d from the absolute value of x.
If it is not, it calculates the answer by dividing the absolute value of x by d and finding the remainder.
If k - d is even, it takes the remainder as the answer.
If k - d is odd, it takes d - remainder as the answer.
After the calculation, it prints the final value of variable ans as output.
