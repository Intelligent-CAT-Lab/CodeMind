The variable n, variable a and variable b are initialized with 6, 200 and 2, 3 and 4, 5 respectively according to the input. And variable p and variable q are initialized with 2 and 3 respectively.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until p * Math.pow(a, lim) + q * Math.pow(b, lim) <= m.
Inside the while loop, it calculates the value of lim by repeatedly checking the condition p * Math.pow(a, lim) + q * Math.pow(b, lim) <= m.
It then creates two ArrayLists pending1 and pending2 to store the possible values of the sum of p and q raised to the power of a and b respectively.
It then creates two long arrays powA and powB to store the values of p and q raised to the power of a and b respectively.
It then enters two nested for loops to iterate over all possible combinations of p and q raised to the power of a and b respectively.
It then calculates the sum of p and q raised to the power of a and b respectively and adds it to the corresponding ArrayList.
After the while loop finishes, it sorts the two ArrayLists in ascending order.
It then enters two nested for loops to iterate over all possible combinations of the two ArrayLists.
It then calculates the minimum possible value of m - pending1.get(i) - pending2.get(j) and adds it to the variable ans.
After the nested for loops finishes, it prints the value of ans as output.
