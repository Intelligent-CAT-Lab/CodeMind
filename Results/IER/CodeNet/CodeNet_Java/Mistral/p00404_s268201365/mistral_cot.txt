 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable x and y are initialized with 0 according to the input. And variable px, py, mx, my, ans are initialized with 0.
It enters a while loop and it iterates indefinitely.
Inside the while loop, it calculates the value of px, py, mx, my and ans based on the current values of x and y.
Then it checks if the current values of x and y satisfy the conditions of the while loop. If they do, it prints the value of ans and exits the program.
The conditions are met when x and y are both 0.
After the loop finishes, it doesn't print anything and the program continues to run indefinitely.
<<<Output>>>
0
