 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 2 according to the input. And variable res is initialized with 1.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable na.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of res by multiplying the current value of res with 3 modulo MODULO.
Then it calculates the value of res by subtracting the value of facts[n] * (long) invfacts[na] % MODULO * invfacts[n - na] % MODULO * p2 from the current value of res.
Then it calculates the value of p2 by multiplying the current value of p2 with 2 modulo MODULO.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable res as output, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>
3
