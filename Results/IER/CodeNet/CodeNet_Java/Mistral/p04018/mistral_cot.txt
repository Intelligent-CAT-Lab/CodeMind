 <<<Analysis>>>
The input is a string "aab". The program reads the string character by character and stores it in a StringBuilder. It then checks if the next character is 'a' or 'b'. If it is 'a', it adds 1 to the count of 'a' and if it is 'b', it adds 1 to the count of 'b'. Finally, it prints the counts of 'a' and 'b'.
