 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized with the input string "SENW".
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the string s.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character of the string s is 'S', 'N', 'W' or 'E' and if it is, it sets the corresponding boolean variable checkS, checkN, checkW or checkE to true.
After the loop finishes, it checks if all four boolean variables checkS, checkN, checkW and checkE are true. If they are, it prints "Yes" otherwise it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
