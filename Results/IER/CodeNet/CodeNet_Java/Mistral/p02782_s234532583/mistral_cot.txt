The variable r1, variable c1, variable r2 and variable c2 are initialized with 1, 1, 2 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 2000003 to calculate the value of nCr(r2 + c2 + 2, r2 + 1, mod, p, pi) for each integer i in this range.
It calculates the value of nCr(r2 + c2 + 2, r2 + 1, mod, p, pi) by calling the function nCr(r2 + c2 + 2, r2 + 1, mod, p, pi) and passing the values of r2 + c2 + 2, r2 + 1, mod, p and pi as arguments.
The function nCr(r2 + c2 + 2, r2 + 1, mod, p, pi) calculates the value of the combination of r2 + c2 + 2 choose r2 + 1 using the values of p and pi.
It then calculates the value of nCr(r1 + c2 + 1, c1, mod, p, pi) by calling the function nCr(r1 + c2 + 1, c1, mod, p, pi) and passing the values of r1 + c2 + 1, c1, mod, p and pi as arguments.
It calculates the value of nCr(r2 + c1 + 1, c1, mod, p, pi) by calling the function nCr(r2 + c1 + 1, c1, mod, p, pi) and passing the values of r2 + c1 + 1, c1, mod, p and pi as arguments.
It calculates the value of nCr(r1 + c1, r1, mod, p, pi) by calling the function nCr(r1 + c1, r1, mod, p, pi) and passing the values of r1 + c1, r1, mod, p and pi as arguments.
It then calculates the final value of ans by subtracting the value of v2 from the value of v1, adding the value of v3 to the value of ans, subtracting the value of v4 from the value of ans and finally taking the modulo of ans with mod.
It then prints the final value of ans as output.
