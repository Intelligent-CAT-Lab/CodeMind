 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable mstr and nstr are initialized with "AADINNUY" and "AIZUNYAN" respectively.
It enters a while loop and it reads input string dstr from the user until it has 8 characters.
Inside the while loop, it checks if the length of the current string dstr is less than 8. If it is, it prints the current string dstr and continues to the next iteration.
If the length of the current string dstr is 8 or more, it extracts a substring of length 8 from the current string dstr starting from the 0th index and stores it in variable t.
It then converts the t array to a string and stores it in variable tt.
It calls the sort() method to sort the characters in the t array in ascending order.
It then compares the sorted string tt with the string mstr. If they are equal, it replaces the substring tt in the current string dstr with the string nstr and updates the index i to 7.
After the while loop finishes, it prints the final string dstr as output.
