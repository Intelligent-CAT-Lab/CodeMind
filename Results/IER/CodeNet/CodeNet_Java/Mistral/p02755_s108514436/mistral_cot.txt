 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable A and variable B are initialized with 2 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until low is less than or equal to high.
Inside the while loop, it calculates the consumption rate of the current integer p by calling the consumptionRate method with p and 8 as arguments.
Then it calculates the consumption rate of the current integer p with 10 as argument by calling the consumptionRate method with p and 10 as arguments.
Then it checks if the calculated consumption rate of p with 8 is equal to A and the consumption rate of p with 10 is equal to B. If it is, it sets the variable ans to p and decreases the high value by 1.
After the loop finishes, it returns the value of variable ans.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is 2.
