 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized with 20, 2 and 5 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to 20 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it converts the integer i to a string and then converts it to a character array using the `toCharArray()` method.
Then it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger num by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a for loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum falls within the range [2, 5]. If it does, it adds the current interger i to variable answer. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable answer as output, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
