 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four input values, x1, y1, x2 and y2, which are all initialized with 0.0.
It calculates the distance between the two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) using the distance formula, which is the square root of the sum of the squares of the differences between the x and y coordinates of the two points.
The calculated value is stored in the variable ans.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is 1.0.
