 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 1900.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to n to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger num by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum is equal to 1900. If it is, it adds the current interger i to variable answer. The condition is met when i is 1900.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable answer as output, which is 1.
