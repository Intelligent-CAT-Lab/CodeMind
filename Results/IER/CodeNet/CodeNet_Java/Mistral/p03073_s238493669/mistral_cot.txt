 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized with the input "000". The length of the string is 3.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each character in this range. The value of variable c is also passed to variable p1 and p2.
Inside the for loop, it increments pattern1 and pattern2 whenever it encounters a character that is not equal to p1 or p2.
Then it updates the values of p1 and p2 by flipping their bits.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of Math.min(pattern1, pattern2) as output, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
