The variable n is initialized with 1199 according to the input.
It enters a if-else-else if statement to check the value of n.
If n is less than 1200, it prints "ABC".
If n is less than 2800, it prints "ARC".
If n is greater than or equal to 2800, it prints "AGC".
Since n is 1199, it falls in the first condition and prints "ABC".
<<<Output>>>
ABC
