 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a line of input from the user and splits it into an array of strings using the `split()` method. It then iterates through the array and checks for two consecutive occurrences of the same string. If it finds two consecutive occurrences, it assigns the index of the first occurrence to `resultNum1` and the index of the second occurrence to `resultNum2`.
It then prints the values of `resultNum1` and `resultNum2` to the console.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is the output that is printed to the console, which is the pair of indices of the two consecutive occurrences of the same string in the input line.
For example, if the input line is "hello hello", the output will be "1 2".
If the input line is "hello world", the output will be "0 0".
If the input line is "hello hello world", the output will be "1 2".
If the input line is "hello world hello", the output will be "0 0".
If the input line is "hello world hello world", the output will be "0 0".
