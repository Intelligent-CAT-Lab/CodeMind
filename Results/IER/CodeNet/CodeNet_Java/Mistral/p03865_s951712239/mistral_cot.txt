 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first creates a Scanner object to read input from the user. It then reads the input string using the `next()` method of the Scanner object and stores it in a char array S.
It then calculates two boolean variables even and match. The variable even is set to true if the length of the string is even, otherwise it is false. The variable match is set to true if the first character of the string is equal to the last character of the string, otherwise it is false.
Finally, it uses the XOR operator to compare the two boolean variables and prints the result. If even and match are both true, it prints "Second", otherwise it prints "First".
