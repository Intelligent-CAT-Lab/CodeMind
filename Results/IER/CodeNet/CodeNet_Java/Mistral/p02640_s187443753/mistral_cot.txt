 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first reads two integers x and y from the user using the Scanner class.
Then it checks if x multiplied by 2 is less than or equal to y and if x multiplied by 4 is greater than or equal to y.
If both conditions are true, it checks if y is even by using the modulo operator (%). If y is even, it prints "Yes" and returns immediately.
If none of the conditions are true, it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
