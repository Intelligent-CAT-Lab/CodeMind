 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the Scanner class from the java.util package. It then creates a new Scanner object named sc and uses it to read three integers a, b and c from the user.
It then uses an if-else statement to check if the values of a, b and c are equal to 5, 7 and 5 respectively. If all three conditions are met, it prints "YES" otherwise it prints "NO".
<<<Output>>>
NO
