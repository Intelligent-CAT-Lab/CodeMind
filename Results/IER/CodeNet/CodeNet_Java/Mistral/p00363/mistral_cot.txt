 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable W and variable H are initialized with 3 and 3 respectively according to the input. And variable c is initialized with B.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable y.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable x.
It checks the condition for each combination of i and j and prints the corresponding character.
The condition is met when i is 0 and j is 0, i is 0 and j is 2, i is 2 and j is 0, i is 2 and j is 2, i is 0 and j is 1, i is 0 and j is 0, i is 1 and j is 0, i is 1 and j is 1, i is 1 and j is 2, i is 2 and j is 0, i is 2 and j is 1, i is 2 and j is 2.
It prints the character 'B' in the position (0,0), 'B' in the position (0,2), 'B' in the position (2,0), 'B' in the position (2,2), '.' in the position (0,1), '.' in the position (0,0), '.' in the position (1,0), '.' in the position (1,1), '.' in the position (1,2), '.' in the position (2,0), '.' in the position (2,1), '.' in the position (2,2).
