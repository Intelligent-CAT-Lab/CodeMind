 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and variable d are initialized with 6 and 2 respectively according to the input. And variable ans is initialized with 0.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until n becomes 0.
Inside the while loop, it increments the value of variable ans by 1.
Then it calculates the next value of n by subtracting 1 and 2*d from it.
The condition is met when n becomes 0.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>
