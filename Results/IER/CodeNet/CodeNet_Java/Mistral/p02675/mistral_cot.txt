 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 16 according to the input.
It enters a switch statement and it checks the remainder of N divided by 10.
Since N is 16, the remainder is 6, which corresponds to the case 6 in the switch statement.
The code inside the case 6 block is executed, which prints "pon" to the console.
<<<Output>>>
