 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable m and variable d are initialized with 15 and 40 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 15 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 1 to 40 to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable num.
It checks if the current integer j is greater than or equal to 2 in both its digits. If it is, it checks if the product of the digits of j is equal to i. If it is, it increments the variable result.
The condition is met when j is 12, 22, 32, 42 and 52.
After the loops finishes, it print the fianl value of variable result as output, which is 5.
<<<Output>>>
5
