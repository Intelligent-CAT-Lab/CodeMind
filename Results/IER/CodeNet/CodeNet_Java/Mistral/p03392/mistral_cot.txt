The variable n is initialized with the length of the input string "abc", which is 3.
The variable diff is initialized with 0.
The variable abc is a set of strings that contains the permutations of the characters "abc". It is initialized with the strings "abc", "acb", "bac", "bca", "cab", and "cba".
The variable ans is initialized with 1.
The variable sum is initialized with 0.
The variable mod is initialized with 998244353.
The variable dp is a 3D array that is used to store the number of ways to reach a given remainder when the last digit is a, b, or c.
The variable dp\_no\_dpl is a 3D array that is used to store the number of ways to reach a given remainder when the last digit is a, b, or c and the last remainder is 0, 1, or 2.
The variable exp is a helper function that is used to calculate the value of (base^e) modulo mod.
The for loop iterates from 0 to n-1 and checks if the current character is the same as the next character. If it is, the variable ans is set to 0.
The if statement checks if n is less than or equal to 2. If it is, it checks if the first character is the same as the second character. If it is, it prints 1. Otherwise, it prints 2.
The if statement checks if the set abc contains the input string. If it does, it prints 3.
The if statement checks if the variable diff is equal to 0. If it is, it prints 1.
The for loop iterates from 0 to n-1 and calculates the value of dp\_no\_dpl. It uses the values of dp\_no\_dpl from the previous iteration to calculate the value of dp\_no\_dpl for the current iteration.
The variable ans is updated by adding the value of exp(3, n-1, mod) and mod to it. It is then updated by subtracting the values of dp\_no\_dpl[n-1][0][sum], dp\_no\_dpl[n-1][1][sum], and dp\_no\_dpl[n-1][2][sum] from it.
The variable ans is then printed.
