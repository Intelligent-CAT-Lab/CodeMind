 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable S is initialized with the input `2019/04/30`.
It then uses the `split()` method to split the string S into an array of strings s, with the delimiter "/".
The first element of the array s is assigned to variable year, the second element is assigned to variable month and the third element is assigned to variable day.
It then checks the value of variable year using if-else statements.
Since year is 2019, it checks the value of variable month.
Since month is 4, it prints "Heisei" as the return value.
<<<Output>>>
Heisei
