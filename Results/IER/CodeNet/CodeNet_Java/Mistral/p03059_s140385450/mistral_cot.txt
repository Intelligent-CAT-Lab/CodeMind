 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable x, variable y and variable z are initialized with 3, 5 and 7 respectively according to the input. And variable sum is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from x to z+1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger num by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum is equal to y. If it is, it adds the current interger i to variable answer. The condition is met when i is 3, 5, 7, 10, 12, 15, 18, 20, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 32, 35, 37, 39, 40, 42, 43, 45, 47, 48, 49, 51, 52, 54, 55, 56, 58, 59, 61, 62, 64, 65, 66, 68, 69, 71, 72, 74, 75, 76, 78, 79, 81, 82, 84, 85, 86, 88, 89, 91, 92, 94, 95, 96, 98, 99, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 17
