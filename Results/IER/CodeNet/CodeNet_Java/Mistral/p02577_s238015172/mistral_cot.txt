 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 123456789 according to the input. And variable work is initialized with a character array of length n.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to n-1 to extract each character of the input string n and store it in variable work[i].
Then it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger num by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a for loop and adding it to variable num.
Then it checks if the calculated variable num is divisible by 9. If it is, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
