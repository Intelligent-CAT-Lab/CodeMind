 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable S is initialized with the input string "??2??5".
It creates a character array d from the string S.
It creates a long array dp of size 13 and initializes it with 1.
It initializes a variable base to 1.
It enters a for loop that iterates from the last character of the string to the first character.
Inside the for loop, it creates a new long array next\_dp of size 13.
It checks if the current character in the string is a question mark. If it is, it enters a nested for loop that iterates from 0 to 9. For each value of k, it iterates from 0 to 12 and adds the value of dp[j] to next\_dp[(k \* base + j) % 13]. It then adds the result to next\_dp[(k \* base + j) % 13] %= 1000000007.
It checks if the current character in the string is not a question mark. If it is not, it enters a nested for loop that iterates from 0 to 12 and adds the value of dp[j] to next\_dp[(k \* base + j) % 13]. It then adds the result to next\_dp[(k \* base + j) % 13] %= 1000000007.
It updates the dp array with the next\_dp array.
It updates the base variable by multiplying it by 10 and taking the remainder by 13.
After the loop finishes, it prints the value of dp[5] as output.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is 1.
