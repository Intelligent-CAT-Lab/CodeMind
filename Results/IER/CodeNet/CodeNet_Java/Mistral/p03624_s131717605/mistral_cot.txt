 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable table is initialized as a HashSet<Character>.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the input string str. The character at each index of the string is added to the HashSet table.
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from 'a' to 'z'. For each character in this range, it checks if the character is present in the HashSet table. If it is not present, it prints the character and returns immediately.
Since the input string "atcoderregularcontest" contains all the characters from 'a' to 'z', none of the characters are present in the HashSet table. Therefore, it prints "None" as output.
<<<Output>>>
None
