The variable height and variable width are initialized with 2 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer common in this range.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the number of ways to choose common number of rows and columns from the given height and width.
It uses the fact that the number of ways to choose k rows from a set of n elements is n choose k, which is calculated using the formula n! / (k!(n-k)!).
