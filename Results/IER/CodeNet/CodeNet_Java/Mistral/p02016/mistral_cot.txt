The variable `in` is an instance of `FastScanner` class that reads input from the standard input stream. The variable `out` is an instance of `PrintWriter` class that writes output to the standard output stream. The variable `ms` is an instance of `Methods` class that contains utility methods.
The `solve` method takes three arguments: `FastScanner in`, `PrintWriter out` and `Methods ms`. It reads the first line of input using `in.next()` method and checks if it is equal to "ani". If it is, it prints "square1001" to the standard output stream using `out.println()` method. If it is not, it prints "e869120" to the standard output stream using `out.println()` method.
<<<Output>>>
"square1001"
