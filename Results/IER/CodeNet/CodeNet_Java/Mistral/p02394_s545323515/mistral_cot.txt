 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable W, variable H, variable x, variable y and variable r are initialized with 5, 4, 2, 2 and 1 respectively according to the input.
It enters an if statement and it checks if the condition (x-r)>=0 && (x+r)<=W && (y-r)>=0 && (y+r)<=H is met.
The condition is met when x-r>=0, x+r<=5, y-r>=0 and y+r<=4.
Since x-r>=0 and x+r<=5, it is true that x is within the range [0, 5].
Since y-r>=0 and y+r<=4, it is true that y is within the range [0, 4].
Therefore, the condition is met and the program prints "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
