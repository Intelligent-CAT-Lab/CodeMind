 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and variable k are initialized with 3 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it increments the value of variable num[i % k] by 1.
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2. The variable a is initialized with 0 and it increments by 1 in each iteration.
Inside the second for loop, it calculates the value of variable b and variable c by subtracting variable a from variable k and taking the remainder of the result.
Then it checks if the sum of variable b and variable c is divisible by k. If it is, it calculates the product of variable num[a], variable num[b] and variable num[c] and adds it to variable res.
After the second for loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable res as output, which is 12.
<<<Output>>>
12
