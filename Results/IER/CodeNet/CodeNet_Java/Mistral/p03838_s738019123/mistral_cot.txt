 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable x and variable y are initialized with 10 and 20 respectively according to the input.
It enters a series of if-else statements to check the possible values of x and y.
It first checks if x is less than or equal to y, if it is true it assigns the value of y - x to variable ans.
Then it checks if -x is less than or equal to y, if it is true it assigns the value of y + x + 1 to variable ans.
Then it checks if x is less than or equal to -y, if it is true it assigns the value of -y - x + 1 to variable ans.
Then it checks if -x is less than or equal to -y, if it is true it assigns the value of -y + x + 2 to variable ans.
After all the conditions are checked, it prints the final value of variable ans, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
