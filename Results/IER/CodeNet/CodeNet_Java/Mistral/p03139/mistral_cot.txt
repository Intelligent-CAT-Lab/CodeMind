The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized with 10, 3 and 5 respectively according to the input.
It enters a main method and it uses the Scanner class to read the input from the user.
It uses the nextInt() method to read the values of N, A and B from the user.
Then it calculates the minimum value between A and B using the Math.min() method and assigns it to variable min.
Then it calculates the maximum value between 0 and A + B - N using the Math.max() method and assigns it to variable max.
Finally it prints the sum of min and max using the + operator.
