 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the java.util package and creates a Scanner object to read input from the user.
It then reads two integers a and b from the user using the nextInt() method of the Scanner object.
It then checks the value of variable a using if-else statements.
If a is less than or equal to 5, it prints 0.
If a is less than or equal to 12, it divides b by 2 and prints the integer value of the result.
If a is greater than 12, it prints the value of variable b.
In this case, a is 30 and b is 100.
Since a is greater than 12, it prints the value of variable b, which is 100.
<<<Output>>>
100
