The variable N is initialized with 3 according to the input.
It enters the solve function and it calculates the value of variable a and variable b.
It calculates the value of variable a by calling the solve function with n/2 as argument, which is 1.5. Since 1.5 is not an integer, it is converted to 2 and the remainder is calculated as 1. The remainder is then passed to the solve function as n/2-1, which is 0.5. Since 0.5 is not an integer, it is converted to 1 and the remainder is calculated as 0. The remainder is then passed to the solve function as n/2-1, which is 0.5. Since 0.5 is not an integer, it is converted to 1 and the remainder is calculated as 0. The remainder is then passed to the solve function as n/2-1, which is 0.5. Since 0.5 is not an integer, it is converted to 1 and the remainder is calculated as 0. The remainder is then passed to the solve function as n/2-1, which is 0.5. Since 0.5 is not an integer, it is converted to 1 and the remainder is calculated as 0. The remainder is then passed to the solve function as n/2-1, which is 0.5. Since 0.5 is not an integer, it is converted to 1 and the remainder is calculated as 0. The remainder is then passed to the solve function as n/2-1, which is 0.5. Since 0.5 is not an integer, it is converted to 1 and the remainder is calculated as 0. The remainder is then passed to the solve function as n/2-1, which is 0.5. Since 0.5 is not an integer, it is converted to 1 and the remainder is calculated as 0. The remainder is then passed to the solve function as n/2-1, which is 0.5. Since 0.5 is not an integer, it is converted to 1 and the remainder is calculated as 0. The remainder is then passed to the solve function as n/2-1, which is 0.5. Since 0.5 is not an integer, it is converted to 1 and the remainder is calculated as 0. The remainder is then passed to the solve function as n/2-1, which is 0.5. Since 0.5 is not an integer, it is converted to 1 and the remainder is calculated as 0. The remainder is then passed to the solve function as n/2-1, which is 0.5. Since 0.5 is not an integer, it is converted to 1 and the remainder is calculated as 0. The remainder is then passed to the solve function as n/2-1, which is 0.5. Since 0.5 is not an integer, it is converted to 1 and the remainder is calculated as 0. The remainder is then passed to the solve function as n/2-1, which is 0.5. Since 0.5 is not an integer, it is converted to 1 and the remainder is calculated as 0. The remainder is then passed to the solve function as n/2-1, which is 0.5. Since 0.5 is not an integer, it is converted to 1 and the remainder is calculated as 0. The remainder is then passed to
