 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 3 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger j by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum is greater than 0. If it is, it increments the value of variable answer by multiplying it with the value of variable i and adding 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable answer as output, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>
3
