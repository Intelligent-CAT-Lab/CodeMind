 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads three strings from the standard input, which are "rng", "gorilla" and "apple".
It then checks if the last character of the first string "rng" is equal to the first character of the second string "gorilla" and if the last character of the second string "gorilla" is equal to the first character of the third string "apple".
Since the last character of "rng" is 'n' and the first character of "gorilla" is 'g' and the last character of "gorilla" is 'i' and the first character of "apple" is 'a', the condition is not met.
Therefore, the return value of the code is "NO".
<<<Output>>>
NO
