 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two long inputs x and y from the user. It then performs bitwise AND, OR and XOR operations on x and y and converts the result to binary string using Long.toBinaryString() method. The binary string is then formatted to have 32 digits using String.format() method and the leading zeros are replaced with spaces using replace() method. Finally, the substring() method is used to extract the last 32 digits of the binary string.

The code then repeats the same process for the OR and XOR operations.

<<<Output>>>
10000000000000000000000000000000
10000000000000000000000000000000
10000000000000000000000000000000

The return value of the code is the output of the last operation, which is the binary representation of x ^ y.

The output for the input `8 10` is `10000000000000000000000000000000`.
