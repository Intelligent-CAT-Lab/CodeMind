The variable n and m are initialized with 1 and 1 respectively according to the input.
The variable in is initialized with a FastScanner object.
The variable out is initialized with a PrintWriter object.
It enters a void method solve() and it calls the method to solve the problem.
Inside the solve() method, it reads the value of n and m from the input using the FastScanner object.
It calculates the output using the formula (1L << m) * (1900 * m + 100 * (n - m)).
It prints the output using the PrintWriter object.
