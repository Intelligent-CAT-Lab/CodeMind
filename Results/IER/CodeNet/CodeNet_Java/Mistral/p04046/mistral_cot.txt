The variable h, w, a and b are initialized with 2, 3, 1 and 1 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to h - a - 1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable t.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable res by adding the product of variable t and the product of variable t and the number of ways to choose k elements from the range [0, w - b - 1 + h - 1 - i] to the product of variable t and the number of ways to choose k elements from the range [0, w - b - 1 + h - 1 - i] to the product of variable t and the number of ways to choose k elements from the range [0, w - b - 1 + h - 1 - i].
The condition is met when i is 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60,61,62,63,64,65,66,67,68,69,70,71,72,73,74,75,76,77,78,79,80,81,82,83,84,85,86,87,88,89,90,91,92,93,94,95,96,97,98,99,100,101,102,103,104,105,106,107,108,109,110,111,112,113,114,115,116,117,118,119,120,121,122,123,124,125,126,127,128,129,130,131,132,133,134,135,136,137,138,139,140,141,142,143,144,145,146,147,148,149,150,151,152,153,154,155,156,157,158,159,160,161,162,163,164,165,166
