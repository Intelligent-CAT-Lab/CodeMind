The variable a is initialized with the string "CODEFESTIVAL2016". The variable s is initialized with the string "ns()".
The variable ans is initialized with 0.
The variable solver() is called which iterates through each character of the string "a".
For each character, it checks if it is equal to the corresponding character in the string "s". If it is not, it increments the value of ans.
After the loop finishes, it prints the value of ans which is 1.
