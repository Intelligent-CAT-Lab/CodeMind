The variable c[] is initialized with the input "1111". The length of the string is 4.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 1.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character c[i] is equal to c[l-i-2]. Since c[0] is '1' and c[3] is '1', the condition is met and the loop exits.
It then prints 1 2 and 3.
It then enters another for loop and it iterates from 4 to 7.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character c[i] is equal to c[l-i-2]. Since c[4] is '1' and c[2] is '1', the condition is met and the loop exits.
It then prints 4 5.
It then enters another for loop and it iterates from 6 to 10.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character c[i] is equal to c[l-i-2]. Since c[6] is '1' and c[4] is '1', the condition is met and the loop exits.
It then prints 6 7.
It then enters another for loop and it iterates from 8 to 11.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character c[i] is equal to c[l-i-2]. Since c[8] is '1' and c[6] is '1', the condition is met and the loop exits.
It then prints 8 9.
It then enters another for loop and it iterates from 12 to 15.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character c[i] is equal to c[l-i-2]. Since c[12] is '1' and c[10] is '1', the condition is met and the loop exits.
It then prints 12 13.
It then enters another for loop and it iterates from 14 to 17.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character c[i] is equal to c[l-i-2]. Since c[14] is '1' and c[12] is '1', the condition is met and the loop exits.
It then prints 14 15.
It then enters another for loop and it iterates from 16 to 19.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character c[i] is equal to c[l-i-2]. Since c[16] is '1' and c[14] is '1', the condition is met and the loop exits.
It then prints 16 17.
It then enters another for loop and it iterates from 20 to 23.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character c[i] is equal to c[l-i-2]. Since c[20] is '1' and c[18] is '1', the condition is met and the loop exits.
It then prints 20 21.
It then enters another for loop and it iterates from 22 to 25.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character c[i] is equal to c[l-i-2
