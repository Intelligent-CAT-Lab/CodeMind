 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable ans is initialized with Integer.MAX\_VALUE.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 25 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it initializes variable tmp to 0 and variable u to the input string.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until it finds a string that has no repeated characters.
Inside the while loop, it initializes variable comp to true and it iterates through the string u.
If it finds a character that is not equal to the first character of the string, it sets comp to false and breaks out of the loop.
If comp is still true after the loop, it means that the string has no repeated characters and it updates the value of ans to be the minimum of ans and tmp.
It then creates a new string w by removing the first character of the string and appending the second character.
It continues this process until it has removed all the repeated characters from the string.
After the loop finishes, it updates the value of u to be w and increments tmp.
After the for loop finishes, it prints the value of ans.
