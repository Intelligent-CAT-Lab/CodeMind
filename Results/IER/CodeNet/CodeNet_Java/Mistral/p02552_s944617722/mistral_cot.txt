 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the necessary classes: Scanner, BigInteger, and Arrays.
It then declares a static variable ret with a value of 10.
In the main method, it creates a Scanner object to read input from the user.
It then declares variables a, b, c, i, n, and f, and a String variable s and s1.
It reads the first integer n from the user using the Scanner object and stores it in the variable n.
If n is equal to 1, it prints 0 to the console. Otherwise, it prints 1.
<<<Output>>>
