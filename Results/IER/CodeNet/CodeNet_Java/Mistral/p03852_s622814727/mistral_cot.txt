 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable intputString is initialized with the input value "a".
It creates a Set of vowels and adds the vowels "a", "e", "i", "o", and "u" to it.
Then it checks if the input string intputString is present in the Set of vowels using the contains() method.
Since "a" is present in the Set of vowels, it prints "vowel" as output.
<<<Output>>>
vowel
