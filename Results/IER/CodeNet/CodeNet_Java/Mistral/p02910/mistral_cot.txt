 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with the input string "RUDLUDR". The for loop iterates through each character of the string.
Inside the loop, it checks if the current character is even or odd by checking if the index i is even or odd.
If the current character is 'L' and the index is even, it prints "No" and breaks out of the loop.
If the current character is 'R' and the index is odd, it prints "No" and breaks out of the loop.
If the current character is the last character in the string, it prints "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
No
No
Yes
