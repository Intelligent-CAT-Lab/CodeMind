 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and k are initialized with 3 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It enters a if-else statement and it checks if k is equal to 1. If it is, it prints 0 as output. If it is not, it prints n - k as output.
In this case, k is not equal to 1, so it prints n - k = 3 - 2 = 1 as output.
