 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable Month, variable Day and variable Dayone are initialized with 15, 40 and 0 respectively according to the input. And variable Dayten is calculated by dividing Day by 10.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 15 to check each integer tuki in this range.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 2 to Dayten.
Inside the second for loop, it checks if the product of i and j is equal to tuki. If it is, it increments the count variable.
After the second for loop finishes, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 2 to k.
Inside the third for loop, it checks if the product of i and j is equal to tuki. If it is, it increments the count variable.
After the third for loop finishes, it prints the value of count.
