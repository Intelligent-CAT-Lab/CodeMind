It calculates the area of the rectangle by multiplying the width and height and dividing by 2.
It then checks if the sum of x and y is equal to the width and height of the rectangle respectively. If it is, it sets the variable a to 1.
Finally, it prints the area of the rectangle and the value of variable a.
