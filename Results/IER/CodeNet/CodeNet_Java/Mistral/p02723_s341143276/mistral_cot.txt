 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable S is initialized with the input string "sippuu".
It checks if the third and fourth characters of the string are equal and if the fifth and sixth characters are also equal.
Since the third and fourth characters of the string are "p" and "p" which are not equal, the condition is not met and the output is "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
