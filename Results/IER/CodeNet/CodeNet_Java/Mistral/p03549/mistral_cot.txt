The variable N and variable M are initialized with 1 and 1 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable rate.
Inside the for loop, it multiplies the current value of variable rate by 2.
After the loop finishes, it calculates the final value of variable X by multiplying the final value of variable rate by the value of variable X.
The value of variable X is calculated as 1900 * M + 100 * (N - M).
Since M is 1 and N is 1, the value of variable X is calculated as 1900 * 1 + 100 * (1 - 1) = 1900 + 0 = 1900.
Then it multiplies the final value of variable rate by the value of variable X and the final output is 1900 * 2 = 3800.
<<<Output>>>
3800
