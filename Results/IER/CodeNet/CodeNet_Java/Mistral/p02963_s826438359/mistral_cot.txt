 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized with 3 according to the input.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until the value of variable mid is less than or equal to 1.
Inside the while loop, it calculates the value of mid by taking the average of ng and ok.
Then it checks if mid * mid is less than or equal to N. If it is, it sets ok to mid. Otherwise, it sets ng to mid.
After the loop finishes, it returns the value of ok, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
