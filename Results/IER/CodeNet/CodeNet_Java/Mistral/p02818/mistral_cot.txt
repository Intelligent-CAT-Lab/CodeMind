 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads three integers A, B and K from the standard input using the Scanner class.
It then checks the value of K with respect to A and B.
If K is less than or equal to A, it subtracts K from A.
If K is less than or equal to A+B, it subtracts K-A from B and sets A to 0.
If K is greater than A+B, it sets both A and B to 0.
Finally, it prints the values of A and B.

<<<Output>>>
