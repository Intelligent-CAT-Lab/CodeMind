 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the Scanner class from the java.util package.
It creates a new Scanner object named sc and uses it to read input from the user.
It reads the first integer N from the user using the nextInt() method of the Scanner class.
It reads the second integer i from the user using the nextInt() method of the Scanner class.
It closes the scanner object using the close() method.
It then prints the value of N-i+1 using the System.out.println() method.
