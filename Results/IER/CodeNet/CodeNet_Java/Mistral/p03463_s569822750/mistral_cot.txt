 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the java.util package and creates a Scanner object to read input from the user.
It then prompts the user to enter three integers separated by spaces, which are 5, 2 and 4.
It then calculates the expression `(5 * 0 + 2 + 4) % 2` which equals 11.
It then checks if 11 is even by using the modulo operator `%` and comparing it to 0. Since 11 is not even, it prints "Borys" as the return value.
<<<Output>>>
Borys
