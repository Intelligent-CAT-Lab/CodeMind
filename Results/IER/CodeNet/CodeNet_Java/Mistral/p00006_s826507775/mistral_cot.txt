 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable str is initialized with an empty string.
It reads a line of input from the user using BufferedReader and stores it in variable str.
It then creates a new array of characters chr with the same length as str.
It iterates through the characters in str and assigns each character to the corresponding index in chr.
It then creates an empty string ans.
It iterates through the characters in chr in reverse order and appends each character to ans.
Finally, it prints the value of ans.
