 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and P are initialized with 3 and 24 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to the square root of P (which is 5) to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable upper.
Inside the for loop, it checks if P is divisible by i using the modulo operator. If it is, it enters another for loop to count the number of times P is divisible by i. The variable cnt is used to count the number of times P is divisible by i.
Then it calculates the remainder of P divided by i and stores it in variable now. It then multiplies the value of i raised to the power of now (which is the number of times P is divisible by i) with variable ans.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 120.
<<<Output>>>
120
