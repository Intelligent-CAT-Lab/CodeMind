 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable a and variable b are initialized with 8 and 13 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the difference between variable b and variable a, which is 5.
Then it calculates the value of n by multiplying the difference by 2 and adding 1.
It calculates the value of n*(n+1)/2 and subtracts variable b from it.
The final value of n*(n+1)/2 is 30.
After the calculation, it prints the final value of n*(n+1)/2 - b, which is 25.
<<<Output>>>
25
