 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input from the user and then it calls the `check` method to check if the string contains the substring "mew".
The `check` method takes three parameters: `char[] c`, `int len` and `int pointer`.
It iterates through the characters in the string starting from the second character (index 1) and checks if the current character is 'm'. If it is, it increments the `pointer` variable.
It then checks if the next character is 'e'. If it is, it increments the `pointer` variable again.
It then checks if the next character is 'w'. If it is, it increments the `pointer` variable again.
If the `pointer` variable is greater than or equal to the length of the string, it means that the substring "mew" has been found and the method returns the index of the last character in the substring.
If the `pointer` variable is less than the length of the string, it means that the substring "mew" has not been found and the method returns -1.
The `check` method is called with the input string "mmemewwemeww" and the length of the string (11).
Since the substring "mew" is found in the input string, the `check` method returns the index of the last character in the substring, which is 9.
