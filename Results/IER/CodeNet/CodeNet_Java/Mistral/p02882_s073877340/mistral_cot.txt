 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable a, variable b and variable x are initialized with 2, 2 and 4 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the bottle capacity by multiplying the value of a, a and b.
It then checks if x is less than the bottle capacity. If it is, it solves the equation a*b*b/2tan8 = x and prints the result in degrees. If it is not, it solves the equation a*a*a*tan8/2 = cap-x and prints the result in degrees.
Since x is less than the bottle capacity, it solves the equation a*b*b/2tan8 = x and prints the result in degrees.
<<<Output>>>
