 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable h is initialized with 2 according to the input. The variable ans is initialized with 0 and variable t is initialized with 1.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until the value of variable h is greater than or equal to the value of variable t.
Inside the while loop, it adds the value of variable t to variable ans and then multiplies variable t by 2.
The loop continues until the value of variable h is greater than or equal to the value of variable t, which is 2.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
