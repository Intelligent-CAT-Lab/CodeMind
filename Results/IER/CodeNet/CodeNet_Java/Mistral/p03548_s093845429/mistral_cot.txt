The variable x, variable y and variable z are initialized with 13, 3 and 1 respectively according to the input.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until the value of variable answer is not equal to 0.
Inside the while loop, it checks if the value of variable answer is equal to 0. If it is, it checks if the sum of y and 2 times z is greater than x. If it is, it increments the value of variable answer by 1 and subtracts the sum of y and 2 times z from x.
If the value of variable answer is not equal to 0, it checks if the sum of y and z is greater than x. If it is, it increments the value of variable answer by 1 and subtracts the sum of y and z from x.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable answer as output, which is 4.
<<<Output>>>
4
