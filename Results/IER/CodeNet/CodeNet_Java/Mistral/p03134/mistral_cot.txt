 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n, variable r and variable b are initialized with 2, 2 and 0 respectively according to the input. And variable mod is initialized with 998244353.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable r and variable b based on the input.
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to i to check each integer prevUseRed in this range.
Inside the inner for loop, it checks if the current integer prevUseRed + 1 is less than or equal to r. If it is, it adds the value of dp[i][prevUseRed] to dp[i + 1][prevUseRed + 1] and then it calculates the remainder of dp[i + 1][prevUseRed + 1] by dividing it by mod.
It also enters another for loop and it iterates from i to 0 to check each integer prevUseBlue in this range.
Inside the inner for loop, it checks if the current integer prevUseBlue + 1 is less than or equal to b. If it is, it adds the value of dp[i + 1][prevUseRed] to dp[i + 1][prevUseBlue] and then it calculates the remainder of dp[i + 1][prevUseBlue] by dividing it by mod.
After the loops finish, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to Math.min(r, n) to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the inner for loop, it calculates the value of ways by multiplying dp[n][i] by combin[n][i] and then it calculates the remainder of ways by dividing it by mod.
It then adds the value of tto by adding the value of ways and then it calculates the remainder of tto by dividing it by mod.
Finally, it prints the value of tto as output.
