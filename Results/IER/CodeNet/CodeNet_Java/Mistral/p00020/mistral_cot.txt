 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a line of input from the user using BufferedReader. The line is stored in the variable s. It then initializes an empty string variable t.
It then enters a while loop that continues until the end of the input stream is reached.
Inside the loop, it iterates through each character in the input string s using a for loop. For each character, it converts it to uppercase using the (char)((c>=97&&c<=123)?(c-32):(c)) expression.
It then appends the uppercase character to the variable t.
After the loop finishes, it prints the value of variable t, which is "thisisapen."
<<<Output>>>
thisisapen.
