 <<<Analysis>>>
The input is a string of four integers separated by spaces. The program reads the input using the `sc` class and stores it in the `a`, `b`, `c` and `d` variables.
Then it calls the `WF` function which takes four arrays as input and initializes them with the values of the input integers.
The `WF` function then performs a breadth-first search on the graph represented by the adjacency matrix. It starts at the node with index `a` and visits all its neighbors recursively.
For each neighbor, it updates the minimum value of the target node by adding the minimum value of its neighbors.
Finally, the program prints the minimum value of the target node.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is the minimum value of the target node, which is 10.
