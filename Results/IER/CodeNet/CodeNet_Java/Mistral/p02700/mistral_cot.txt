 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable a, variable b, variable c and variable d are initialized with 10, 9, 10 and 10 respectively according to the input.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until a or c becomes less than 0.
Inside the while loop, it calculates the value of t by dividing c by b and storing it in variable t.
Then it calculates the value of tt by taking the remainder of c divided by b and storing it in variable tt.
It also calculates the value of y by dividing a by d and storing it in variable y.
Then it calculates the value of u by taking the remainder of a divided by d and storing it in variable u.
It then checks if the value of t is less than or equal to y and if the value of tt is less than or equal to u. If both conditions are true, it prints "Yes" and returns from the function.
If the value of t is greater than y, it subtracts b from c and checks if the value of c is less than or equal to 0. If it is, it prints "Yes" and returns from the function.
If the value of t is less than y, it subtracts d from a and checks if the value of a is less than or equal to 0. If it is, it prints "Yes" and returns from the function.
If none of the above conditions are met, it continues to iterate through the loop.
<<<Output>>>
