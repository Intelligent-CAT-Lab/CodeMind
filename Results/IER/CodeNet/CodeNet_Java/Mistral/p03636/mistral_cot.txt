 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input from the user using the Scanner class and stores it in the variable s. It then calculates the length of the string using the length() method and stores it in the variable leng.
It then prints the first character of the string using the charAt(0) method, the length of the string minus 2 using the expression leng-2 and the last character of the string using the charAt(leng-1) method.

<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is not applicable as it does not return any value. It only prints the output to the console.

The output of the code would be:
```
i
n
t
e
r
n
a
t
i
o
n
a
l
i
z
a
t
i
o
n
```
