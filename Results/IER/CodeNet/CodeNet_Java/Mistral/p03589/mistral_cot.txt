 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 2 according to the input.
It enters a nested for loop and it iterates from 1 to 3500 for both variables h and n.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the condition 4*h*n-N*n-N*h!=0 and (N*h*n)/(4*h*n-N*n-N*h)>0 and (N*h*n)%(4*h*n-N*n-N*h)==0 are met.
The condition is met when h=1 and n=2.
It prints the values of h, n and (N*h*n)/(4*h*n-N*n-N*h) as output, which is 1 2 1.
<<<Output>>>
1 2 1
