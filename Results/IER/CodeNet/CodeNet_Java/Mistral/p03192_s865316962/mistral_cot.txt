 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with the input "1222". The variable cnt is initialized with 0.
It enters a series of if statements that check if the first, second, third and fourth digits of the input string N are equal to "2". If they are, it increments the variable cnt by 1.
The first digit is checked with the condition N.substring(0, 1).equals("2") which returns true. So cnt is incremented by 1.
The second digit is checked with the condition N.substring(1, 2).equals("2") which returns true. So cnt is incremented by 1.
The third digit is checked with the condition N.substring(2, 3).equals("2") which returns true. So cnt is incremented by 1.
The fourth digit is checked with the condition N.substring(3, 4).equals("2") which returns true. So cnt is incremented by 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable cnt as output, which is 4.
