 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable k is initialized with 4 according to the input.
It calculates the value of N using the formula `N = sqrt(8*k + 1) - 1` and converts it to an integer.
It then checks if the sum of the first N natural numbers is less than k. If it is, it calculates the missing number by subtracting the sum of the first N natural numbers from k.
It then prints all the numbers from 1 to N, excluding the missing number.
In this case, the sum of the first 3 natural numbers is 6, which is less than 4. So, it calculates the missing number as 4 - 6 = -2. Since it is not possible to have a negative number, it increments the value of N by 1.
So, the final value of N is 4 and the final value of missing is 0.
