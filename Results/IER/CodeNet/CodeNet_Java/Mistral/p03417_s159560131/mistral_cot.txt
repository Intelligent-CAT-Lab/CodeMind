 <<<Analysis>>>
The program takes two long inputs n and m from the user using the Scanner class.
It calculates the absolute value of the difference between n and 2, and the difference between m and 2 using the Math.abs() method.
Then it multiplies the two absolute values together and prints the result.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code for the input `2 2` would be 0.

The calculation is as follows:

* The absolute value of n - 2 is 2 - 2 = 0
* The absolute value of m - 2 is 2 - 2 = 0
* 0 * 0 = 0

Therefore, the return value of the code for the input `2 2` would be 0.
