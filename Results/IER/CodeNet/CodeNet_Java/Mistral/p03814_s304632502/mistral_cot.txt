The variable s is initialized with the input string "QWERTYASDFZXCV".
The variable A is initialized with the index of the first occurrence of the character 'A' in the string s. Since 'A' is not present in the string, the value of A is 0.
The variable Z is initialized with the index of the last occurrence of the character 'Z' in the string s. Since 'Z' is not present in the string, the value of Z is 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the string s.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character of the string s is 'Z'. If it is, it assigns the current index i to variable Z.
After the loop finishes, it calculates the difference between the index of the last occurrence of 'Z' and the index of the first occurrence of 'A' and adds 1 to it. Since 'A' is not present in the string, the difference is 0 and the final value of the expression is 1.
