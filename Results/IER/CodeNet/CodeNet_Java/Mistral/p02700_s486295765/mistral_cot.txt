 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four integer inputs from the user, a, b, c and d.
It enters a while loop that runs as long as both a and c are greater than 0.
Inside the loop, it subtracts d from a and b from c.
After the loop finishes, it checks if c is greater than 0. If it is, it prints "No", otherwise it prints "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
