 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable a, variable b, variable c and variable d are initialized with 2, 1, 3 and 4 respectively according to the input. And variable sum is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 4 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger num by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it calculates the value of s1, s2 and s3 by subtracting the sum from the product of a+b, a+c and a+d respectively.
Then it finds the minimum value of s1, s2 and s3 and assigns it to variable min.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable min as output, which is 1.
