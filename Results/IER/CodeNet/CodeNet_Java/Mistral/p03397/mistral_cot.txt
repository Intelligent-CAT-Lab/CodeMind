The variable s is initialized with the input string "1??00".
It enters a for loop and it iterates through each character in the string.
For each character, it checks if it is '0', '1' or '?'.
If it is '0', it moves to the next character.
If it is '1', it moves to the next character.
If it is '?', it moves to the next character.
It then moves to the next row of the go matrix.
