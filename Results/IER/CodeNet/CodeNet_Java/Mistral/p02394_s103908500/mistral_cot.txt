 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable W, variable H, variable x, variable y and variable r are initialized with 5, 4, 2, 2 and 1 respectively according to the input.
It enters an if statement and it checks if the value of variable r is less than or equal to x, x is less than or equal to (W - r), r is less than or equal to y, y is less than or equal to (H - r).
Since the value of variable r is 1, it is less than or equal to x, x is less than or equal to (W - r) which is 4, r is less than or equal to y, y is less than or equal to (H - r) which is 3.
Since all the conditions are met, the program prints "Yes" as output.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
