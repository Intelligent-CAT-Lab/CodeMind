 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 575 according to the input.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until the queue is empty.
Inside the while loop, it polls the first element from the queue, which is "357".
It checks if the current number is less than or equal to N. Since 357 is less than 575, it increments the count variable.
Then it enters a for loop that iterates from 0 to the length of the current number.
Inside the for loop, it iterates from 0 to the length of the character array ch.
It calls the addChar method with the current number, the current index and the current character from the character array.
The addChar method returns a new string by inserting the current character at the current index of the current number.
It checks if the new string is already in the set. If it is not, it adds it to the set and the queue.
After the for loop finishes, it continues to the next iteration of the while loop.
After the while loop finishes, it prints the final value of the count variable, which is 1.
