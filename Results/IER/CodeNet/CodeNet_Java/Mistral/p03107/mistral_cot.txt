 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable S is initialized with the input string "0011". The variable S0 is initialized with '0' and S0mas is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates through each character of the input string S.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character str is equal to S0. If it is, it increments the value of S0mas.
After the loop finishes, it calculates the length of the input string S and subtracts the value of S0mas from it to get S1mas.
Then it compares the value of S0mas with S1mas and prints the value of S0mas multiplied by 2 if it is less than S1mas, otherwise it prints the value of S1mas multiplied by 2.
In this case, S0mas is 1 and S1mas is 4. Since S0mas is less than S1mas, it prints 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
