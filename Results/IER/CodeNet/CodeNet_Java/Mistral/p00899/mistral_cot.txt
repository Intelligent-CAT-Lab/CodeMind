 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 3 according to the input.
It enters a while loop that continues until it has read all input.
Inside the while loop, it reads the next integer N from the input and checks if it is 0. If it is, it breaks out of the loop.
It then calls the solve() method to solve the problem.
The solve() method first initializes the variables N and N2 with the value of N and the number of unique strings in the input, respectively.
It then initializes the variable INF with a very large value.
It then calls the solve() method to solve the problem.
The solve() method first initializes the variables str, eq, str2, len, and dp with the input strings, a boolean array to keep track of which strings are unique, an ArrayList to store the unique strings, a 2D array to store the lengths of the substrings, and a 2D array to store the lengths of the longest common substrings, respectively.
It then loops through all pairs of strings in the input and checks if they are unique. If they are, it adds the shorter string to the ArrayList str2.
It then initializes the variable N2 with the size of the ArrayList str2.
It then initializes the variable len with the lengths of the substrings in the ArrayList str2.
It then initializes the variable dp with very large values.
It then loops through all pairs of strings in the input and initializes the dp array with the length of the longest common substring between the two strings.
It then loops through all pairs of strings in the input and updates the dp array with the length of the longest common substring between the two strings.
It then loops through all pairs of strings in the input and finds the length of the longest common substring between the two strings.
It then prints the length of the longest common substring between the two strings.
