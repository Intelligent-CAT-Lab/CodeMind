The code reads a string input from the user using the Scanner class. The input string is stored in the variable s.
It then uses the replace() method of the String class to replace all occurrences of the character "?" with the character "D".
The resulting string is stored in the variable result.
Finally, it prints the value of the result variable using the println() method of the System.out class.
