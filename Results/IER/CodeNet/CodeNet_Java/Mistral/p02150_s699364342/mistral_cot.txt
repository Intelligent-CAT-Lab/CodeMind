 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable a, variable b and variable x are initialized with 3, 1 and 5 respectively according to the input.
It enters an if statement and it checks if the value of variable x is greater than or equal to variable a.
If it is, it calculates the value of variable figure by dividing the difference between x and a by the difference between a and b, and adding 1 to the result.
Then it calculates the value of variable count by adding the remainder of x divided by 1000000007 to the product of figure and b divided by 1000000007.
Finally, it prints the remainder of count divided by 1000000007.
If the condition is not met, it prints the remainder of x divided by 1000000007.
In this case, the condition is not met, so it prints the remainder of 5 divided by 1000000007 which is 5.
<<<Output>>>
5
