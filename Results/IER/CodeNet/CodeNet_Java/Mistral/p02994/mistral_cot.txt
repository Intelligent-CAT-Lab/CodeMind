 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and variable l are initialized with 5 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 6 to calculate the value of variable value for each integer i in this range.
The value of variable value is calculated by adding l and i-1 and then subtracting 1. If the value of variable value is less than 0, it is negated.
Then it adds the value of variable value to a list called diff.
After the loop finishes, it finds the minimum value in the list diff using the indexOf() method and then adds 1 to it to get the index of the minimum value.
It then calculates the final value by multiplying n and l, adding n*(n+1)/2, subtracting n and finally subtracting l+removeK-1.
The final value is 25.
<<<Output>>>
25
