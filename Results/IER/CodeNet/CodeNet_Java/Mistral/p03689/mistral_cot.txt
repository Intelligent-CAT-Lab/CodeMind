 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable r, variable c, variable h and variable w are initialized with 3, 3, 2 and 2 respectively according to the input. And variable mcnt is calculated as (r / h) * (c / w) = 1.
Space is calculated as r * c - ((r / h) * h) * ((c / w) * w) = 12.
The variable plusNumber is calculated as ((mcnt + space) / space) + 1 = 2.
The variable minusNumber is calculated as -(plusNumber * (h * w - 1) + 1) = -1.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it checks if j >= 1 and if j+1 % w == 0. If both conditions are met, it prints the value of variable num.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable num as output, which is 2.

2
