 <<<Analysis>>>
The program takes three integer inputs from the user through the Scanner class. The first input is stored in variable x, the second input is stored in variable a and the third input is stored in variable b.
It then compares the absolute difference between x and a with the absolute difference between x and b using the Math.abs() method. If the absolute difference between x and a is greater than the absolute difference between x and b, it assigns "B" to variable ans. Otherwise, it assigns "A" to variable ans.
Finally, it prints the value of variable ans as output.
<<<Output>>>
A
