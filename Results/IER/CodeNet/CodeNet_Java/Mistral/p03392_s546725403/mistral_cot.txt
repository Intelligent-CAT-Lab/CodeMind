 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 4 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 3 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger i is equal to the next interger i+1. If it is, it sets the variable all to false. Otherwise, it sets the variable any to true.
It also calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger i by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger i by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
