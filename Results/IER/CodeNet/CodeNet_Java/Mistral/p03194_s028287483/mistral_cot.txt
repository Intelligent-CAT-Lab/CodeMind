 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and variable p are initialized with 3 and 24 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to 23 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable t by raising i to the power of n using the Math.pow() method.
Then it checks if p is divisible by t. If it is, it sets the value of variable ans to i.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
