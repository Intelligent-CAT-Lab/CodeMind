 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N and K are initialized with 4 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to N-1 to calculate the value of ans.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of ans using the formula K \* ((ans / (K - 1)) + ans % (K - 1) + 1)
It starts with ans = 0 and then it calculates ans = K \* ((ans / (K - 1)) + ans % (K - 1) + 1)
It continues this process until it reaches the end of the loop.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 11.
<<<Output>>>
11
