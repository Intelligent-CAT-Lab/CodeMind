The variable cnt is initialized with 3 integers 0, 0 and 0 respectively.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable c.
Inside the for loop, it checks if c is equal to 'a', 'b' or 'c' and increments the corresponding element of cnt array.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable cnt as output, which is [3, 3, 3].
