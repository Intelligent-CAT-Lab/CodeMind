 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable X is initialized with 7 according to the input.
It enters an if-else-if-else statement to check the value of variable X.
When X is less than or equal to 6, it prints 1.
When X is less than or equal to 11, it prints 2.
When X is greater than 11, it checks if X is divisible by 11. If it is, it calculates the quotient of X divided by 11 and multiplies it by 2 and prints the result as a long value.
If X is greater than 11 and X is not divisible by 11, it calculates the quotient of X divided by 11, multiplies it by 2 and adds 2 to the result and prints it as a long value.
If X is greater than 11 and X is not divisible by 11, it calculates the quotient of X divided by 11, multiplies it by 2 and adds 1 to the result and prints it as a long value.
Since X is 7, it enters the first if statement and prints 1.
