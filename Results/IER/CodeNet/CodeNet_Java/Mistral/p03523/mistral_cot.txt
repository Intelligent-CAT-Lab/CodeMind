 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable akihabara is initialized with "AKIHABARA" and kihbr is initialized with "KIHBR". The variable s is initialized with the input "KIHBR".
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the input string s.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character of the input string s is not equal to the current character of the string akihabara. If it is not equal, it increments the variable j.
It also checks if the current character of the input string s is equal to the current character of the string kihbr. If it is, it increments the variable k.
After the loop finishes, it checks if the variable k is equal to the length of the string kihbr. If it is, it prints "YES" otherwise it prints "NO".
<<<Output>>>
NO
