 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n, variable k and variable s are initialized with 4, 2 and 3 respectively according to the input. And variable ans is initialized with a long array of size n.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable ans.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger ans[i] is equal to 0. If it is, it assigns the value of s+1 to ans[i] otherwise it assigns the value of ans[i] to ans[i].
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to n-1. Inside this loop, it checks if the current interger ans[i] is equal to 0. If it is, it assigns the value of s+1 to ans[i] otherwise it assigns the value of ans[i] to ans[i].
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is [3, 3, 3, 3].
<<<Output>>>
[3, 3, 3, 3]
