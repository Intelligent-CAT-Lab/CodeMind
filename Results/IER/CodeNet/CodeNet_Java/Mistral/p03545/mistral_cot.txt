The variable a, variable b, variable c and variable d are initialized with 1, 2, 2 and 2 respectively according to the input. And variable ans is initialized with 0, 0 and 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable ans.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the sum of the digits of the current interger a, b, c and d is equal to 7. If it is, it assigns "+", "+", "+", and "=" to variable ans[0], variable ans[1], variable ans[2] and variable ans[3] respectively.
Else it checks if the sum of the digits of the current interger a, b, c and d is equal to -7. If it is, it assigns "-", "+", "+", and "=" to variable ans[0], variable ans[1], variable ans[2] and variable ans[3] respectively.
Else it checks if the sum of the digits of the current interger a, b, c and d is equal to 0. If it is, it assigns "-", "-", "+", and "=" to variable ans[0], variable ans[1], variable ans[2] and variable ans[3] respectively.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans[0], variable ans[1], variable ans[2] and variable ans[3] as output, which is -1, +1, +1 and =.
<<<Output>>>
-1 +1 +1 =
