 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable a and variable b are initialized with 4 and 12 respectively according to the input.
It enters a conditional statement to check if b is divisible by a.
If it is divisible, it prints the sum of a and b. Otherwise, it prints the difference between b and a.
Since 12 is not divisible by 4, it prints 12 - 4 = 8.
<<<Output>>>
8
