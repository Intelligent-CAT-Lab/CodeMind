The variable s is initialized with the input "oxo".
The method gs() returns the input string "oxo".
The method (s.length() - s.replace("o","").length())*100+700 is then called.
The length of the string is calculated by calling the length() method on the string object s.
The number of "o" in the string is calculated by calling the replace() method on the string object s with the parameter "o" and returning the length of the resulting string.
The length of the string minus the number of "o" is then multiplied by 100 and added to 700.
The final value of the expression is 100*3+700=1000.
<<<Output>>>
1000
