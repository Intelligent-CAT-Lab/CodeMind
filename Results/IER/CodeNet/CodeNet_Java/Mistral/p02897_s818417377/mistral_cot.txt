 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 4 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 4 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable odds.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of odds by checking if n is even or odd. If n is even, it divides n by 2, otherwise it divides (n+1) by 2.
Then it prints the value of odds as output.
After the loop finishes, it prints the fianl value of odds as output, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
