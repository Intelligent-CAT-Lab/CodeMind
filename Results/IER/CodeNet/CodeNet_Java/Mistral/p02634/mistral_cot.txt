 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable A, variable B, variable C and variable D are initialized with 1, 1, 2 and 2 respectively according to the input. And variable MOD is initialized with 998244353L.
The variable cell is a 2D array of size C x D and it is initialized with 0L.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of cell[i][j] by multiplying cell[i-1][j] with j and adding cell[i][j-1] * i.
Then it calculates the value of cell[i][j] by multiplying cell[i-1][j-1] with i and adding cell[i][j-1] * i.
Then it subtracts the value of cell[i-1][j-1] * i from cell[i][j] and adds cell[i-1][j] and cell[i][j-1] to cell[i][j].
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of cell[C-1][D-1] as output, which is 1.
