 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a line of input from the standard input stream and stores it in a variable called `line`. It then iterates through each character in the line and removes it from a set called `set`. If the set contains only one character after all characters have been removed, the code prints the line followed by the remaining character. If the set contains more than one character after all characters have been removed, the code prints `-1`. If the line is equal to `zyxwvutsrqponmlkjihgfedcba`, the code prints `-1`.

<<<Output>>>
-1
