 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable num\_ball and num\_box are initialized with 5 and 3 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to num\_ball to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable next\_ball.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger next\_ball by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum falls within the range [1, 3]. If it does, it adds the current interger i to variable ret. The condition is met when i is 1,2 and 3.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ret as output, which is 6.
<<<Output>>>
6
