 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers A, B and C as input from the user.
It checks if A is greater than C or if A plus B is less than C. If either of these conditions is true, it prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES".
In this case, A is 3, B is 5 and C is 4.
Since A is not greater than C and A plus B is not less than C, the condition is not met and the code prints "YES".
<<<Output>>>
YES
