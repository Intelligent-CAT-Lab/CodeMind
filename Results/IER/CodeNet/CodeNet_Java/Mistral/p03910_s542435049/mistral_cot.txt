 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 4 according to the input.
The variable total is calculated as (4+1) * 4 / 2 = 10.
Since 10 is less than N, the loop does not break and the variable max is not set.
Therefore, the variable diff is not set and the variable max is not printed.
<<<Output>>>
No output is printed.
