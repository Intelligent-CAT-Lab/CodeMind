 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable a and variable b are initialized with 3 and 5 respectively according to the input.
It enters a class named Solution and it calls the solve() method.
Inside the solve() method, it reads the value of variable a and variable b using the nextInt() method of InputReader class.
Then it calculates the product of a and b and adds 2 times the sum of a and b and prints it as output.
The product of a and b is 15 and 2 times the sum of a and b is 10. So the output is 15+10=25.
<<<Output>>>
25
