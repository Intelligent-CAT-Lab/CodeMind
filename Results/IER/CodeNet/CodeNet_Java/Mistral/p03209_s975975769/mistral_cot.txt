 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and variable x are initialized with 2 and 7 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to n-1 to calculate the value of layer[i] for each i in this range.
The value of layer[i] is calculated by multiplying the value of layer[i-1] by 2 and adding 3.
Then it calls the function pati(n,x) with the values of n and x as arguments.
The function pati(n,x) checks the value of x and returns 1 if n is 0, 0 if x is less than or equal to 1, 0 if x is less than or equal to 1+layer[n-1], 1 if x is equal to layer[n-1]+2, 1+pati(n-1,layer[n-1])+1 if x is less than 2*layer[n-1]+2, and 2*pati(n-1,layer[n-1])+1 if x is greater than 2*layer[n-1]+2.
It returns 1 as the value of x is 7 and it is greater than 2*layer[n-1]+2.
