 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the Scanner class from the java.util package. It then creates a new Scanner object and reads two integers a and b from the user using the nextInt() method.
It then uses an if-else statement to compare the values of a and b. If a is less than b, it prints the value of a for b times. If b is less than a, it prints the value of b for a times. If a is equal to b, it prints the value of a for a times.
