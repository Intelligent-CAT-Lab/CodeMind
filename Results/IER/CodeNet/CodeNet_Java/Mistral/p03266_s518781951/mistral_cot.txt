The variable N and variable K are initialized with 3 and 2 respectively according to the input.
The variable ans is initialized with 0.
It enters a static class TaskC and calls the solve method.
Inside the solve method, it calculates the value of ans by raising N/K to the power of 3.
Then it checks if K is even and N is less than K/2. If it is, it adds the value of Math.pow(N/K, 3) to ans.
Then it checks if K is even and N is greater than or equal to K/2. If it is, it adds the value of Math.pow(N/K+1, 3) to ans.
After the calculation, it prints the value of ans as output, which is 1.
