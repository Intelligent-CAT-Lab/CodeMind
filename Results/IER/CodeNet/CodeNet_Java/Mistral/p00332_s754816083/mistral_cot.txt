The variable e and y are initialized with 0 and 2015 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable index.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current integer y is less than or equal to the next integer in the array f, which is f[index+1]-1. If it is, it prints the corresponding character from the array g and the index of the current integer y in the array f.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable y+f[e-1]-1 as output, which is 2015.
<<<Output>>>
2015
