 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 3 according to the input. And variable count is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it checks if n is even or odd. If n is even, it checks if i + j == n + 1. If it is true, it continues to the next iteration. If n is odd, it checks if i + j == n. If it is true, it continues to the next iteration.
Then it appends the values of i and j to StringBuilder sb and increments the count variable.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable count as output, which is 3.
Then it prints the contents of StringBuilder sb, which is "1 2\n".
<<<Output>>>
3
1 2
