 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable c is initialized with the input string "ASSA". It is then converted to a character array using the `toCharArray()` method.
The `Arrays.sort()` method is used to sort the characters in the array in ascending order.
The first character of the array is compared with the second character, and it is checked if they are equal. The second character is then compared with the third character, and it is checked if they are equal.
It also checks if the first character is not equal to the third character.
Since the first character is 'A' and the third character is 'A', the condition is met and the output is "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
