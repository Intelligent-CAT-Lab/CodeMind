 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized with the input string "bac".
It creates a boolean array abc with three elements, where each element is set to true if the corresponding character in the input string is 'a', 'b' or 'c'.
It then checks if all the elements of the boolean array abc are true by using a for loop and the logical operator &. If any of the elements are false, the variable isOK is set to false.
Finally, it prints the value of variable isOK as output.
<<<Output>>>
No
