 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads an integer input from the user using the Scanner class and stores it in the variable X.
Then it uses a series of if-else statements to check the value of X.
If X is equal to 3, 5 or 7, it prints "YES" to the console.
Otherwise, it prints "NO" to the console.
<<<Output>>>
NO
