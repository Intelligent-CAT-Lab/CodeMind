 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 3 according to the input.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until a valid solution is found.
Inside the while loop, it initializes an empty array ans and a variable used to keep track of the used digits.
It then enters a for loop that iterates from 1 to 29999.
Inside the for loop, it generates a random integer between 1 and 29999 and checks if it is a valid solution by checking if its gcd with 30000 is 1 and if it is not already in the used set.
If it is a valid solution, it adds it to the ans array and breaks out of the for loop.
If it is not a valid solution, it continues to the next iteration of the for loop.
After the for loop finishes, it checks if the ans array is not all 0s. If it is not, it prints the solution and breaks out of the while loop.
If it is all 0s, it continues to the next iteration of the while loop.
