The variable r, d and x are initialized with 2, 10 and 20 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 9 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of x by multiplying r with x and subtracting d.
Then it prints the value of x.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of x as output, which is 10.
