 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized with the input "gpg".
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the string s.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current index i is even or odd.
If i is even, it checks if the current character at index i is 'p'. If it is, it decrements the value of variable ans by 1.
If i is odd, it checks if the current character at index i is 'g'. If it is, it increments the value of variable ans by 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 1.
