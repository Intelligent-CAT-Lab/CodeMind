 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 11 according to the input.
It enters a while loop that continues until the input has been read.
Inside the loop, it checks if N is greater than or equal to 10, 100, 1000, 10000 and 100000.
If N is greater than or equal to 10, it adds 9 to variable ans.
If N is greater than or equal to 100, it adds N - 100 + 1 to variable ans.
If N is greater than or equal to 1000, it adds 900 to variable ans.
If N is greater than or equal to 10000, it adds 90000 to variable ans.
If N is greater than or equal to 100000, it adds 900000 to variable ans.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 900000.
<<<Output>>>
900000
