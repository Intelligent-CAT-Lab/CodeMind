 <<<Analysis>>>
The program reads the input line by line and tokenizes each line into words using the `StringTokenizer` class. It then uses the `nextToken()` method to read the next token from the input stream.
The program then checks if the first token of the input line is "YAKI". If it is, it prints "Yes" to the output stream. Otherwise, it prints "No" to the output stream.
<<<Output>>>
No
