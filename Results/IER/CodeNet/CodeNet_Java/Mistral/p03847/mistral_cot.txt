The variable N is initialized with 3 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable n.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable n by repeatedly subtracting 1 from N and checking if the result is 0. If it is, it assigns 0 to variable n. Otherwise, it assigns 1 to variable n.
Then it creates a 2D array dp of size 61 x 3 and initializes it with 1, 1 and 0 respectively.
It enters another for loop and it iterates from 59 to 0 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable c.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable dp[i][2] by multiplying 3 with dp[i+1][2] and taking the modulo with MOD.
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable c.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable dp[i][c] by adding dp[i+1][1] and taking the modulo with MOD.
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable c.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable dp[i][c] by adding dp[i+1][0] and taking the modulo with MOD.
Finally, it calculates the return value by adding dp[0][0], dp[0][1] and dp[0][2] and taking the modulo with MOD.
