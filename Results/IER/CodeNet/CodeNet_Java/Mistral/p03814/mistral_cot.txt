 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized with the input string "QWERTYASDFZXCV". The length of the string is 10.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 9 to check each character in the string.
It checks if the current character is 'A' and if it is, it assigns the index of the first occurrence of 'A' to variable from.
It checks if the current character is 'Z' and if it is, it assigns the index of the last occurrence of 'Z' to variable to.
It then prints the difference between the two variables, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
