The variable W, variable H and variable c are initialized with 3, 3 and B respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable num.
It checks the condition of the if-else statements to determine what character to append to the StringBuilder sb.
The first if statement checks if i is 0 or i is H - 1 and j is 0 or j is W - 1. If this condition is met, it appends a '+' character to the StringBuilder sb.
The second if statement checks if i is 0 or i is H - 1. If this condition is met, it appends a '-' character to the StringBuilder sb.
The third if statement checks if j is 0 or j is W - 1. If this condition is met, it appends a '|' character to the StringBuilder sb.
The fourth if statement checks if i is H / 2 and j is W / 2. If this condition is met, it appends the character c to the StringBuilder sb.
The fifth if statement checks if i is H / 2 and j is W / 2. If this condition is met, it appends a '.' character to the StringBuilder sb.
After the two loops finish, it print the fianl value of variable sb as output, which is "|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+|+
