 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the java.util.Scanner class to read input from the user.
In the main method, it creates a new Scanner object and passes it to the execute method.
The execute method reads an integer from the user using the Scanner object and stores it in the variable r.
It then calculates the square root of the integer using the Math.sqrt() method and stores the result in the variable r.
Finally, it prints the square of the calculated square root using the System.out.println() method.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code would be 100.
