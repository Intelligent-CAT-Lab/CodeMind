 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 105 according to the input. And variable ans is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 105 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable tmp.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current integer i is odd. If it is, it enters a while loop and it repeatedly divides the current integer tmp by all the integers from 2 to tmp + 1. It keeps track of the number of times each integer divides tmp in an array div.
Then it calculates the product of all the integers from 2 to n + 1, including the integers that divide tmp, by multiplying the number of times each integer divides tmp with 1.
If the product of all the integers from 2 to n + 1 is 8, it increments the variable ans.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 1.
