 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with the input "100". The variable f is initialized with true.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to n.length-1 to check each character of the string n.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character is not equal to '9'. If it is not, it sets the variable f to false and breaks out of the loop.
After the loop finishes, it sets the variable c to '0' if f is true, otherwise it sets it to '1'.
Then it calculates the answer by subtracting the value of the first character of the string n from '0' and then multiplying the length of the string n minus 1 by 9.
The final value of the answer is 99.
<<<Output>>>
99
