 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 11 and K is initialized with 2.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until base is less than or equal to N.
Each iteration of the loop, it calculates the value of base by multiplying K with the current value of base.
It also increments the variable cnt for each iteration.
After the loop finishes, it prints the value of variable cnt which is 5.
<<<Output>>>
5
