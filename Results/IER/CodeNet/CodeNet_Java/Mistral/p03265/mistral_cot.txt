 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four integer inputs from the user, x1, y1, x2 and y2. It then calculates the difference between x2 and x1 to get the value of a and the difference between y2 and y1 to get the value of b.
It then calculates the values of x3, y3, x4 and y4 using the given values of a and b.
It then prints the values of x3, y3, x4 and y4 in the format of `(x3, y3, x4, y4)` using the `String.format()` method.
<<<Output>>>
(0, 0, 0, 1)
