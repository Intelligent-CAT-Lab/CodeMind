 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads an integer n from the standard input stream, which is 2 in this case.
It then creates an ArrayList list of integers from 1 to n, which is [1, 2] in this case.
The while loop iterates until the list is empty.
Inside the loop, it prints the integers in the list in a specific order.
It first prints the first integer in the list, which is 1.
Then it prints the second integer in the list, which is 2.
Since the list is empty after printing the second integer, the loop terminates.
The return value of the code is the output of the program, which is 1 2.
<<<Output>>>
