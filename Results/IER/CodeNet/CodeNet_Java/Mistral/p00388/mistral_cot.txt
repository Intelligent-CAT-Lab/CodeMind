 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable H, variable A and variable B are initialized with 100, 2 and 4 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to 4 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable ans.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current integer i divides the variable H without any remainder. If it does, it increments the value of variable ans. The condition is met when i is 2 and 4.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
