 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable M and variable MOD are initialized with 3, 3 and 1000000007 respectively according to the input.
And variable dp is initialized with a 3D array of size M+1, N+1, N+1.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of dp[i+1][j+1][k] for each j and k in the range [1, N] and [1, N] respectively.
It does this by adding the value of dp[i][j][k] multiplied by (N-j) for j != N, (j-k) for j != k and k for j == k.
It also calculates the value of dp[i+1][j][k] for each j and k in the range [1, N] and [1, N] respectively.
It does this by adding the value of dp[i][j][k] multiplied by (j-k) for j != k.
It also calculates the value of dp[i+1][j][j] for each j in the range [1, N].
It does this by adding the value of dp[i][j][k] multiplied by k for j == k.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable dp[2][3][3] as output, which is 12.
<<<Output>>>
12
