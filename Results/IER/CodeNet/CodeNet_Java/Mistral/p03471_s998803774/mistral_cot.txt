 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and variable y are initialized with 9 and 45000 respectively.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2000 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger i and j by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum equals 45000. If it does, it prints the fianl value of variable i and j and variable n - i - j as output.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable i and j and variable n - i - j as output.
<<<Output>>>
-1 -1 -1
