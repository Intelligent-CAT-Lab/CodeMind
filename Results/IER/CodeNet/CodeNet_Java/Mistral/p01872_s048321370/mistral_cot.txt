 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable str is initialized with "?12345678901". The variable ctr is initialized with the string str.toCharArray(). The variable num is initialized with a new int array of size 12. The variable v is initialized with 0. The variable cnt is initialized with 0. The variable ans is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 11 to check each character in the string.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character is '?'. If it is, it assigns 11 - i to variable v. If it is not, it assigns the ASCII value of the current character minus 48 to variable num[11 - i].
It enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 9 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger i by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a for loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum falls within the range [1, 11]. If it does, it assigns i to variable ans and increments variable cnt.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable cnt.
