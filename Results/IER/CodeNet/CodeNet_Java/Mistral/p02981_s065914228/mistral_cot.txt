 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized with 4, 2 and 9 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to N to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable ans by multiplying variable A with variable N and then taking the minimum of this value and variable B.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 24.
<<<Output>>>
