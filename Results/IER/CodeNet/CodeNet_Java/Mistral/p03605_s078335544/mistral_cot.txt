 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable x is initialized with 29 according to the input.
It enters an if statement that checks if x is between 10 and 99. Since 29 is within this range, it proceeds to the next if statement.
Inside the second if statement, it checks if the string representation of x (s) contains the character "9". Since the string representation of 29 is "29", it does not contain the character "9".
Therefore, the output of the program is "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
