 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable a is initialized with 575 according to the input.
It calculates the value of a100, a10 and a1 by dividing a by 100, 10 and 1 respectively and subtracting the result from a.
Then it calculates the value of rev by multiplying a1 by 100, a10 by 10 and a100 by 1 and adding them together.
It then checks if the value of a is equal to rev. Since a is 575 and rev is 575, the condition is met and the variable ans is set to "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
