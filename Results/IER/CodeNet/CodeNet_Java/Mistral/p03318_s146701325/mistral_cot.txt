 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 10 according to the input. The variable k is initialized with 0 and kk is initialized with 1.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 9 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable k.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger k by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum is 9 and if f(k + kk) is greater than f(k + 10 \* kk). If both conditions are met, it multiplies kk by 10.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable k as output, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
