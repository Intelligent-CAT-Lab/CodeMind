 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and variable m are initialized with 2 and 6 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to 6 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable tm.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the greatest common divisor of variable n and variable tm by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and using Euclidean algorithm.
Then it checks if the calculated variable tm is equal to 1. If it is, it adds the current interger i to variable ans. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,6.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 15.
<<<Output>>>
15
