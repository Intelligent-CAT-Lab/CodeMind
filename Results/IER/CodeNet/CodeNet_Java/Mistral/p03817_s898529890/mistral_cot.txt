 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable x is initialized with 7 according to the input.
It calculates the remainder of x divided by 11 using the modulo operator % and assigns it to variable rest. The remainder is 7.
It calculates the quotient of x divided by 11 using integer division operator / and assigns it to variable result. The quotient is 6.
It multiplies the variable result by 2 using the multiplication operator \* and assigns the result to variable result. The result is 12.
It checks if the remainder rest is greater than 0, it increments the result by 1. The condition is met, so the result is 13.
It checks if the remainder rest is greater than 6, it increments the result by 1. The condition is not met, so the result remains 13.
Finally, it prints the value of variable result as output, which is 13.
<<<Output>>>
13
