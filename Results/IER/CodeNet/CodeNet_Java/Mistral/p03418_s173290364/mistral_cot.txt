 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and k are initialized with 5 and 2 respectively.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to 5 to check each integer b in this range. The value of variable b is also passed to variable q and r.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of ans by adding the product of q and (b - k) and the maximum of 0 and r - k + 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
