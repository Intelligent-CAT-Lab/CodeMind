 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 3 according to the input. And variable total is initialized with 1.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 3 to calculate the value of total.
Inside the for loop, it multiplies the current value of total by i and then takes the modulo with 1000000007.
Then it prints the final value of variable total as output.
<<<Output>>>
