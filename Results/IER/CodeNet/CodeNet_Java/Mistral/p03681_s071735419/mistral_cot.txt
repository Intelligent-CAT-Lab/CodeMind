 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and variable m are initialized with 2 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It enters two for loops and it iterates from 1 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable nk and variable mk.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the product of the current interger nk and mk by multiplying variable nk and variable mk.
Then it calculates the remainder of the product by taking the modulo of the product with 1000000007.
Then it enters an if-else statement to check if n and m are equal, if n and m differ by 1 or if n and m differ by -1.
If n and m are equal, it calculates the answer by multiplying the product of nk and mk by 2 and taking the modulo of the result with 1000000007.
If n and m differ by 1 or if n and m differ by -1, it calculates the answer by multiplying the product of nk and mk and taking the modulo of the result with 1000000007.
After the loops finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 0.
