The variable n and variable m are initialized with 2 and 3 respectively according to the input. And variable mod is initialized with 1000000000 + 7.
The variable ret is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable from and variable to.
From variable is 0 and to variable is 1.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of dp[m][blue] and dp[m][red] by using two nested for loops.
It first calculates the value of dp[to][j][0] and dp[to][j][1] for each j in the range [0, n].
It then calculates the value of dp[to][j][0] and dp[to][j][1] for each j in the range [0, n] and k in the range [0, 2].
It then calculates the value of dp[to][j][1] and dp[to][j - 1][1] for each j in the range [0, n] and k in the range [0, 2].
It then calculates the value of dp[to][j][0] and dp[to][j - 1][0] for each j in the range [0, n] and k in the range [0, 2].
It then calculates the value of dp[to][j][1] and dp[to][j - 1][1] for each j in the range [0, n] and k in the range [0, 2].
It then calculates the value of dp[to][j][0] and dp[to][j - 1][0] for each j in the range [0, n] and k in the range [0, 2].
It then calculates the value of dp[to][j][1] and dp[to][j - 1][1] for each j in the range [0, n] and k in the range [0, 2].
It then calculates the value of dp[to][j][0] and dp[to][j - 1][0] for each j in the range [0, n] and k in the range [0, 2].
It then calculates the value of dp[to][j][1] and dp[to][j - 1][1] for each j in the range [0, n] and k in the range [0, 2].
It then calculates the value of dp[to][j][0] and dp[to][j - 1][0] for each j in the range [0, n] and k in the range [0, 2].
It then calculates the value of dp[to][j][1] and dp[to][j - 1][1] for each j in the range [0, n] and k in the range [0, 2].
It then calculates the value of dp[to][j][0] and dp[to][j - 1][0] for each j in the range [0, n] and k in the range [0, 2].
It then calculates the value of dp[to][j][1] and dp[to][j - 1][1] for each j in the range [0, n] and k in the
