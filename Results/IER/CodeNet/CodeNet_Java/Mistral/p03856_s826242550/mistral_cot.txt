 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable x is initialized with 0.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until the value of variable r is 0.
Inside the while loop, it checks if the value of variable r is greater than or equal to 5 and if it is, it subtracts 5 from r.
It also checks if the value of variable r is greater than or equal to 7 and if it is, it subtracts 7 from r.
It also checks if the value of variable r is greater than or equal to 5 and if it is, it subtracts 5 from r.
It also checks if the value of variable r is greater than or equal to 6 and if it is, it subtracts 6 from r.
If none of the above conditions are met, it prints "NO" and returns.
<<<Output>>>
