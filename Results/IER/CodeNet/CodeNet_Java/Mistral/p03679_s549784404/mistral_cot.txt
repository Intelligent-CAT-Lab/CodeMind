 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable X, variable A and variable B are initialized with 4, 3 and 6 respectively according to the input.
It enters an if-else statement to check the value of variable B in relation to variable A.
If B is less than or equal to A, it prints "delicious".
If B is greater than A, it checks the difference between B and A in relation to variable X.
If the difference is less than or equal to X, it prints "safe".
If the difference is greater than X, it prints "dangerous".
In this case, B is greater than A, so it checks the difference between B and A, which is 3. Since 3 is less than 4, it prints "safe".
<<<Output>>>
safe
