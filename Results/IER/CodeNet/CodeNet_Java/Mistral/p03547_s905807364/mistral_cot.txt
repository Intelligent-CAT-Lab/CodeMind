 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the Scanner class from the java.util package. It creates a new Scanner object named sc and uses it to read input from the user.
It reads the first character from the user input using the next() method of the Scanner class and stores it in the variable A.
It reads the second character from the user input using the next() method of the Scanner class and stores it in the variable B.
It then compares the values of A and B using if-else statements. If A is equal to B, it assigns the value '=' to the variable ans. If A is greater than B, it assigns the value '>' to the variable ans. If A is less than B, it assigns the value '<' to the variable ans.
Finally, it prints the value of the variable ans using the println() method of the System.out class.
