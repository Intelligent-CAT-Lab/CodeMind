The variable S is initialized with the input string "TSTTSS". The variable s is initialized with 0 and count is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 6 to check each character of the string S.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character is 'S'. If it is, it increments the value of variable s by 1.
If the current character is not 'S' and the value of variable s is greater than 0, it decrements the value of variable s by 1 and increments the value of variable count by 2.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable count as output, which is 4.
<<<Output>>>
