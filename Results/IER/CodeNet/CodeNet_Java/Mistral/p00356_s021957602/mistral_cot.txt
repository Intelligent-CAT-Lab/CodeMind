 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable x and variable y are initialized with 4 and 4 respectively according to the input.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until x1 is equal to y1.
Inside the while loop, it checks if x1 is less than y1, if it is, it subtracts x1 from y1. Otherwise, it subtracts y1 from x1.
The loop continues until x1 is equal to y1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of x + y + 1 - x1, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
