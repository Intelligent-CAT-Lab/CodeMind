 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable w, variable h, variable v, variable t, variable x, variable y, variable p, and variable q are initialized with 10, 10, 1, 10, 3, 3, 7, and 7 respectively according to the input. And variable maxW is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 10 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable maxW.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the maximum value of maxW by checking the condition that if the value of maxW is less than or equal to the maximum distance between the point (x,y) and the point (2w-p,q) or (2w+p,q) or (4w-p,q) or (4w+p,q) or (2w-p,l) or (2w+p,l) or (4w-p,l) or (4w+p,l), then it updates the value of maxW.
It also checks if the calculated value of maxW is greater than 0. If it is, it breaks out of the loop.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable maxW as output, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
