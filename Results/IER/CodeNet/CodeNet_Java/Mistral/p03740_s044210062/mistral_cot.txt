 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable x and y are initialized with 2 and 1 respectively according to the input.
It enters a FastScanner class to read the input.
It calls the nextLong() method of the FastScanner class to read the input.
It reads the first integer 2 and the second integer 1.
It then checks if the absolute difference between x and y is greater than or equal to 2.
Since the absolute difference between 2 and 1 is 1, which is less than 2, it prints "Brown" as output.
<<<Output>>>
Brown
