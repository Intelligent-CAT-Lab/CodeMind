 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and a are initialized with 8 and 1 respectively according to the input. And variable eatCount is initialized with 1.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 40 to check each integer eatCount in this range. The value of variable eatCount is also passed to variable count.
Inside the for loop, it calls the solve method of the Solver class and passes eatCount as an argument. The solve method returns the minimum value of n and the calculated value of eatCount * a + (v - 1) * (eatCount + 1 - j) + v * j.
It returns the minimum value of n and the calculated value of eatCount * a + (v - 1) * (eatCount + 1 - j) + v * j.
