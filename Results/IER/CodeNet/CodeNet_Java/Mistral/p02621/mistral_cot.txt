 <<<Analysis>>>
The code prompts the user to enter an integer using the `Scanner` class and stores it in the variable `a`.
Then it calculates the value of `a + (a*a) + (a*a*a)` and prints it to the console.
The value of `a + (a*a) + (a*a*a)` is calculated as follows:
- `a + (a*a)` is equal to `a + a^2`
- `a + (a*a) + (a*a*a)` is equal to `a + a^2 + a^3`
So the final value of `a + (a*a) + (a*a*a)` is `a^3 + 2a^2 + a`.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is the final value of `a + (a*a) + (a*a*a)` which is `a^3 + 2a^2 + a`.
For example, if the user inputs `2`, the return value of the code would be `2^3 + 2(2)^2 + 2(2)` which is `8 + 8 + 4` which is `14`.
Therefore, the return value of the code for input `2` is `14`.
