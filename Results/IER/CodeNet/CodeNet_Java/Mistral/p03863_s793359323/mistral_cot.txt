 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized with the input string "aba". The length of the string is calculated and stored in variable n.
It then checks if the first character of the string is equal to the last character of the string. The condition is met because the first character of the string is 'a' and the last character of the string is also 'a'.
Since the condition is met, it checks if the length of the string is even or odd. The length of the string is 3, which is odd. Therefore, it prints "Second".
<<<Output>>>
Second
