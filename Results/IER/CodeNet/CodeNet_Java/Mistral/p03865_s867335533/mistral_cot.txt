 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized with the input "aba". The length of the string is calculated using the length() method and it is checked if it is even or odd.
It then checks if the first character of the string is equal to the last character of the string. If it is, it prints "Second" otherwise it prints "First".
In this case, the length of the string is 3, which is odd. So it checks if the first character is equal to the last character. Since it is not, it prints "First".
<<<Output>>>
First
