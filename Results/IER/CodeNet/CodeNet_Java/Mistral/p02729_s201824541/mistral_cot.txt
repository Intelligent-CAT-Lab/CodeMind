 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and variable m are initialized with 2 and 1 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to n to calculate the sum of the digits of the current interger n.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger n by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger m by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable total as output, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
