 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable A and variable B are initialized with 12 and 4 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the result by subtracting 2 times the value of variable B from variable A.
result = 12 - (2 * 4) = 12 - 8 = 4
Then it checks if the result is less than or equal to 0. Since the result is 4 which is greater than 0, it does not change the value of result.
Finally, it prints the value of variable result which is 4.
<<<Output>>>
4
