 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 24 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to the square root of 24 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable pMap.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the count of how many times the current interger i divides n without leaving a remainder. If the count is greater than 0, it adds the current interger i and its count to the map pMap.
After the loop finishes, it enters another for loop and it iterates over the values of the map pMap. For each value, it calculates the number of times the current interger i can be subtracted from the current value of pCount without leaving a remainder. If the count is greater than 0, it adds 1 to the variable ans.
After the second loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 4.
<<<Output>>>
4
