 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n, variable a and variable b are initialized with 4, 1 and 3 respectively according to the input.
The variable aa and variable bb are initialized with 1.
It enters two for loops, one for variable a and one for variable b.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable aa and variable bb using the div() method.
Then it calculates the value of (power(2, n)-aa-bb-1+MOD*3)%MOD using the power() method.
The power() method is a recursive method that calculates the value of x raised to the power of y.
The div() method is a recursive method that calculates the value of x divided by y.
After the calculation, it prints the final value of (power(2, n)-aa-bb-1+MOD*3)%MOD as output, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
