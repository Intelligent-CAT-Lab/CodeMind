 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N and variable D are initialized with 6 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the value of ans by dividing N by (D * 2 + 1.0) and then it rounds the result to the nearest integer using the setScale() method of BigDecimal class.
The setScale() method takes two arguments, the number of digits to round to and the rounding mode. In this case, it rounds to zero digits and uses the CEILING rounding mode.
After the calculation, it prints the value of ans as output.
