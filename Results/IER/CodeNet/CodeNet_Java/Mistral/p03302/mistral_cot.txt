 <<<Analysis>>>
The program takes two integer inputs a and b from the user using the Scanner class.
It then checks if the sum of a and b is equal to 15. If it is, it prints "+" to the console.
If the product of a and b is equal to 15, it prints "*" to the console.
If neither of the above conditions are met, it prints "x" to the console.

<<<Output>>>
x
