 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable S is initialized with the input string "RRLRL". The variable N is initialized with the length of the string.
It enters a while loop and it iterates from 0 to 5 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable curIndex.
Inside the while loop, it calculates the number of left and right occurrences of 'L' and 'R' respectively by repeatedly extracting the characters of string S with a while loop.
It then calculates the sum of left and right occurrences of 'L' and 'R' respectively. If the sum is even, it divides the sum by 2 to get the value of left and right. If the sum is odd, it assigns the greater number to the left and the smaller number to the right.
It assigns the value of left to ans[R] and the value of right to ans[R+1].
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans[i] as output, which is [1 2 3 4 5 1].
<<<Output>>>
[1 2 3 4 5 1]
