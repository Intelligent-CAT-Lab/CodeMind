 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first reads the input from the standard input stream using a BufferedReader. It then parses the input into three integers: n, a, and b.
It then initializes a variable sum to 0 and enters a for loop that iterates from 1 to n.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current integer num by repeatedly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum falls within the range [a, b] . If it does, it adds the current interger num to variable answer.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable answer as output.
