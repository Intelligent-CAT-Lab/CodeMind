 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable res[] is initialized with 26 integers, each representing the count of a specific character in the input string.
It enters a while loop that reads the input string line by line using Scanner cin.
Inside the loop, it iterates through each character in the string using a for loop.
For each character, it checks if it falls within the range [65, 90] or [97, 122]. If it does, it increments the corresponding element in the res[] array.
After the loop finishes, it prints out the count of each character in the input string.
For the input "This is a pen.", the character 'T' falls within the range [65, 90] and is mapped to index 20 in the res[] array. The character 'h' falls within the range [65, 90] and is mapped to index 8 in the res[] array. The character 'e' falls within the range [65, 90] and is mapped to index 5 in the res[] array. The character 's' falls within the range [65, 90] and is mapped to index 19 in the res[] array. The character 'i' falls within the range [65, 90] and is mapped to index 9 in the res[] array. The character 'a' falls within the range [65, 90] and is mapped to index 1 in the res[] array. The character 'p' falls within the range [65, 90] and is mapped to index 16 in the res[] array. The character 'n' falls within the range [65, 90] and is mapped to index 14 in the res[] array.
The output of the program would be:
```
A : 1
E : 1
I : 1
N : 1
P : 1
S : 1
T : 1
```
<<<Output>>>
A : 1
E : 1
I : 1
N : 1
P : 1
S : 1
T : 1
