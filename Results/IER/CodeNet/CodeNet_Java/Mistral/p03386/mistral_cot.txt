The variable a, variable b and variable k are initialized with 3, 8 and 2 respectively according to the input. And variable cnt is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 3 to 8 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable cnt.
Inside the for loop, it increments the value of variable cnt and adds it to set.
After the loop finishes, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 8 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable cnt.
Inside the for loop, it increments the value of variable cnt and adds it to set.
After the loop finishes, it prints all the elements of the set.
