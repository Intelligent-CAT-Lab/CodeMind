 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input from the user using the Scanner class. The input is stored in the variable `a`.
The `solve` method is called with the `a` variable as an argument.
Inside the `solve` method, the `replaceAll` method is called on the `a` variable with the regular expression `","` as the first argument and `" "` as the second argument. This replaces all the commas in the input string with spaces.
The modified string is then printed to the console using the `System.out.println` method.
