 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable A and variable B are initialized with 2 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 99999999 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable num by multiplying variable i with 0.08 and 0.10.
Then it checks if the calculated variable num is equal to A and B. If it is, it prints the value of variable i and returns from the function.
After the loop finishes, it print -1 as output, because no integer i in the range [1, 99999999] satisfies the condition.
<<<Output>>>
-1
