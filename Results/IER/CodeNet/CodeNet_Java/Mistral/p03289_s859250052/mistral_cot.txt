 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first reads the input string `a` using the `nextLine()` method of the `FastScanner2` class. It then checks if the first character of the string is 'A'. If it is, it proceeds to the next step. Otherwise, it prints "WA" and returns.

If the first character is 'A', it then checks if any of the characters in the string are 'C'. If any of them are, it increments a counter `c`.

After that, it checks if the counter `c` is greater than 1 or equal to 0. If it is, it prints "WA". Otherwise, it proceeds to the next step.

If the counter `c` is less than or equal to 1, it then checks if any of the characters in the string are not 'A' or 'C'. If any of them are, it prints "WA". Otherwise, it proceeds to the next step.

If none of the above conditions are met, it prints "AC".

<<<Output>>>
AC
