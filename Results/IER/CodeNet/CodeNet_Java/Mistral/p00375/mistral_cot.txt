The variable a is initialized with the input value 68.
It enters the main method and it uses the Scanner class to read the input value from the console.
Then it calculates the value of the expression (a - 30) / 2 and it stores it in the variable.
The expression (a - 30) / 2 is equal to (68 - 30) / 2 = 18 / 2 = 9.
