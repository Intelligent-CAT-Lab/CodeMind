 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized with 5, 14 and 80 respectively according to the input. And variable count is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 5 to 14 to check each integer a in this range.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the remainder of variable c divided by variable a is 0. If it is, it increments the variable count.
The condition is met when a is 5, 8 and 14.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable count as output, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>
