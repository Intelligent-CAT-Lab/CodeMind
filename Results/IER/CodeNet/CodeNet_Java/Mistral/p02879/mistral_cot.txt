 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first creates an instance of the class Main and calls its solve method.
The solve method reads two integers A and B from the standard input using the Scanner class.
It then checks if A and B are less than 9. If either of them is greater than or equal to 9, it prints -1 and returns from the method.
Otherwise, it multiplies A and B and prints the result.
<<<Output>>>
