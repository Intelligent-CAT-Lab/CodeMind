 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable K is initialized with 0 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 0 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger num by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum falls within the range [2, 5]. If it does, it adds the current interger i to variable answer. The condition is met when i is 0.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable answer as output, which is 0.
<<<Output>>>
0
