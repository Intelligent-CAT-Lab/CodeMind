The variable A and variable B are initialized with 30 and 100 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 30 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger num by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum falls within the range [1, 10]. If it does, it adds the current interger i to variable answer. The condition is met when i is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable answer as output, which is 30.
<<<Output>>>
30
