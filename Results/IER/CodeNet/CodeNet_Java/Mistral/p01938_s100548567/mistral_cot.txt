 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable arr is initialized with the input string "AIZU" by calling the `next()` method of the `Scanner` object.
It then iterates through each character in the string using a for loop.
Inside the loop, it compares the current character c with the previous character prev. If the current character c is greater than or equal to the previous character prev, it increments the count variable.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of the count variable, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>
3
