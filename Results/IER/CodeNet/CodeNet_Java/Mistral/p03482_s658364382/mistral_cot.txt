 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with the length of the input string S, which is 3.
The function centerLength(S) is called with the input string S.
The function checks if the length of the string is even or odd. If it is even, it finds the center of the string by taking the average of the first and last character. If it is odd, it finds the center of the string by taking the middle character.
Then it finds the length of the center of the string by iterating from the left and right of the center and checking if the characters are equal to the center character.
The function returns the length of the center of the string.
In the main function, it prints the difference between the length of the input string and the length of the center of the string divided by 2.
