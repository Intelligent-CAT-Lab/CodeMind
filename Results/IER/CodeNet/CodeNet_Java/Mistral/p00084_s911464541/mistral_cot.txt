 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first creates a Scanner object to read input from the console. It then reads a line of input from the console using the `nextLine()` method and stores it in a String array called `arr`. The `split()` method is used to split the input string into an array of strings using the regular expression `[,. ]` as the delimiter.
It then creates a StringBuilder object called `sb` and enters a for loop to iterate over each element in the `arr` array. For each element, it checks if its length is between 2 and 6 (inclusive) using the `if` statement. If the length is within this range, it appends the element to the `sb` object followed by a space.
Finally, it prints the contents of the `sb` object using the `toString()` method and trims any leading or trailing spaces using the `trim()` method.
