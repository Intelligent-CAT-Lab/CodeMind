 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable k is initialized with 3 according to the input.
It enters an if-else statement and checks if k is even or odd.
Since k is odd, the else block is executed and it calculates the value of ((k/2+1)*(k/2)) and prints it.
The value of k/2+1 is 1 and k/2 is 1.5.
So the calculation is (1*1.5) = 1.5.
The output of the program is 1.5.
<<<Output>>>
1.5
