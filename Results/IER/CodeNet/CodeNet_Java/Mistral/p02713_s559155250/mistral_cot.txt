The variable first is initialized with 2 according to the input. And variable sum is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 2 to check each integer a in this range. The value of variable a is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger num by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from 1 to 2 to check each integer b in this range. The value of variable b is also passed to variable num.
Inside the second for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 1 to 2 to check each integer c in this range. The value of variable c is also passed to variable num.
It calls the function gcd(gcd(a,b),c) to calculate the greatest common divisor of a, b and c.
It then adds the result of gcd(gcd(a,b),c) to variable sum.
After the loops finishes, it print the fianl value of variable sum as output, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
