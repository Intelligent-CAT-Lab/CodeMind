The variable W, variable H and variable N are initialized with 4, 4 and 0 respectively according to the input. And variable fld is initialized with a 2D boolean array of size 4x4.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 3 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it creates a 2D array of size 4x4 and assigns it to variable fld. It initializes all elements of the array to false.
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 3 to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable k.
Inside the second for loop, it checks if the current cell (i,j) is not already used by checking the value of variable fld[i][j]. If it is not used, it sets the value of variable fld[i][j] to true.
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 3 to check each integer k in this range. The value of variable k is also passed to variable l.
Inside the third for loop, it checks if the current cell (i,j) is not already used by checking the value of variable fld[i][j]. If it is not used, it sets the value of variable fld[i][j] to true.
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 3 to check each integer l in this range. The value of variable l is also passed to variable m.
Inside the fourth for loop, it checks if the current cell (i,j) is not already used by checking the value of variable fld[i][j]. If it is not used, it sets the value of variable fld[i][j] to true.
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 3 to check each integer m in this range. The value of variable m is also passed to variable n.
Inside the fifth for loop, it checks if the current cell (i,j) is not already used by checking the value of variable fld[i][j]. If it is not used, it sets the value of variable fld[i][j] to true.
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 3 to check each integer n in this range. The value of variable n is also passed to variable o.
Inside the sixth for loop, it checks if the current cell (i,j) is not already used by checking the value of variable fld[i][j]. If it is not used, it sets the value of variable fld[i][j] to true.
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 3 to check each integer o in this range. The value of variable o is also passed to variable p.
Inside the seventh for loop, it checks if the current cell (i,j) is not already used by checking the value of variable fld[i][j]. If it is not used, it sets the value of variable fld[i][j] to true.
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 3 to check each integer p in this range. The value of variable p is also passed to variable q.
Inside the eighth for loop, it checks if the current cell (i,j) is not already used by checking
