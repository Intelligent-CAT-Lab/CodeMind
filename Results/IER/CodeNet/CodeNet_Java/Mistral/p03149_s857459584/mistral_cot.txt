 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n1, variable n2, variable n3 and variable n4 are initialized with 1, 7, 9 and 4 respectively according to the input.
It enters a solve method and it initializes an array cnt with 10 elements. It increments the value of cnt[n1], cnt[n2], cnt[n3] and cnt[n4] by 1.
It then checks if the value of cnt[1] is equal to 1, cnt[9] is equal to 1, cnt[7] is equal to 1 and cnt[4] is equal to 1. If all these conditions are met, it prints "YES" otherwise it prints "NO".
<<<Output>>>
NO
