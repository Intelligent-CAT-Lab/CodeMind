 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable line is initialized with the input "AIZUNYANPEROPERO".
It enters a for loop and it iterates through each character in the input string.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character is 'A' and if it is, it sets the variable a to false.
It also checks if the current character is 'Z' and if it is, it appends "AZ" to the StringBuilder sb and sets the variable a to true.
After the loop finishes, it checks if the length of the StringBuilder sb is 0. If it is, it prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the contents of the StringBuilder sb.
<<<Output>>>
-1
