 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized with 7, 17 and 120 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the product of variable N and variable A by multiplying them and assigns the result to variable pp.
Then it checks if the value of variable pp is greater than variable B. If it is, it prints the value of variable B. Otherwise, it prints the value of variable pp.
Since the value of variable pp is 1190, which is greater than variable B, it prints the value of variable B, which is 120.
<<<Output>>>
120
