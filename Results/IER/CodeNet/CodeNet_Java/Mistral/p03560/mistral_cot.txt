 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable K is initialized with 6 according to the input.
It creates an array dp of size K and fills it with Integer.MAX\_VALUE.
It creates a class Node with two fields to, and cost.
It creates a priority queue que of type Node and sorts it by cost in descending order.
It initializes the first 10 elements of dp with their corresponding values and adds them to the priority queue.
It enters a while loop that continues until the priority queue is empty.
Inside the while loop, it polls the first node from the priority queue and assigns its to and cost values to variables v and c respectively.
It checks if c is greater than dp[v], if it is, it continues to the next iteration of the while loop.
Otherwise, it iterates from 0 to 9 and calculates the next value of v and cost by multiplying v by 10 and adding i.
It checks if dp[nextv] is greater than nextc, if it is, it updates dp[nextv] with nextc and adds a new node with nextv and nextc values to the priority queue.
After the while loop finishes, it prints the value of dp[0] as output, which is 0.
