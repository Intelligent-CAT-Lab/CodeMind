The code prompts the user to enter two integers n and m using the Scanner class. It then calculates the number of combinations of n and m using the formula n*(n-1)/2.
It stores the value of n and m in the variables nComb and mComb respectively.
Finally, it prints the sum of nComb and mComb using the System.out.println() method.
