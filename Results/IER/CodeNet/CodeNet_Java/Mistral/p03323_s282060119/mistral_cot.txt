 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers a and b from the standard input using the Scanner class.
It then checks if both a and b are less than 9 using the logical operator &&.
If both a and b are less than 9, it prints "Yay!" to the console. Otherwise, it prints ":" to the console.
<<<Output>>>
Yay!
