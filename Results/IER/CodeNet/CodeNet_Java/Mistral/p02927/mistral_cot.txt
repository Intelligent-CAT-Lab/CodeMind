The variable M and D are initialized with 15 and 40 respectively.
The variable ans is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to M to check each integer m in this range.
The variable d1 and d2 are initialized with m % 10 and m / 10 respectively.
Inside the for loop, it checks if d1 and d2 are greater than or equal to 2. If they are, it increments the value of ans.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 1.
