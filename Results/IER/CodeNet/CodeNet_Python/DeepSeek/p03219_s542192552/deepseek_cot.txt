### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
X, Y = map(int, input().split())
print(int(X+Y/2))
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `81 58`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs X and Y from the user. The input() function is used to take the inputs from the user. The map() function is used to convert the inputs into integers. The inputs are separated by a space, so the split() function is used to separate the inputs.

The code then calculates the average of X and Y. The average is calculated by adding X and Y together and dividing by 2. The result is then converted to an integer using the int() function and printed out.

The input given is `81 58`.

The code first takes the input `81 58` and splits it into two variables X and Y. X becomes 81 and Y becomes 58.

The code then calculates the average of X and Y. The average is calculated by adding X and Y together and dividing by 2. So, the code calculates `(81 + 58) / 2`.

The result of this calculation is 70.

The result is then converted to an integer using the int() function and printed out.

So, the output of the code would be:

```python
70
```

<<<Output>>>
70
