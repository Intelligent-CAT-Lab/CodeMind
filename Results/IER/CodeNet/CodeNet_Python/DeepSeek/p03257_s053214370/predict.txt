I'm sorry, but as an AI, I'm unable to execute Python code. However, I can provide an analysis of the code you provided.

The code you provided is a Python program that generates a certain pattern of numbers based on prime numbers. It uses a technique called dynamic programming to store and reuse previously computed results.

Here's a brief overview of the steps the code follows:

1. It first generates a list of prime numbers up to 100,000.
2. It then initializes a 2D array `ans` with size 502x502, filled with 1s.
3. The code then fills the `ans` array with prime numbers based on certain conditions.
4. After that, it updates the `ans` array based on the conditions.
5. Finally, it prints out the first `N` rows of the `ans` array.

The output of the code will depend on the value of `N` you input. If `N` is 2, the output will be the first two rows of the `ans` array.

Please note that I can't provide the exact output of the code because I can't execute it. I suggest you run the code on your local machine to see the output.

I hope this helps in understanding the code and its output.
