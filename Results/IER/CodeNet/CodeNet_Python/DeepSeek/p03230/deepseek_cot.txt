### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import sys
read = sys.stdin.read
readline = sys.stdin.readline
readlines = sys.stdin.readlines

def main():
    N = int(readline())

    K = 0
    for i in range(1,10**3):
        if i * (i-1) // 2 == N:
            K = i
            break

    if K == 0:
        print("No")
        exit()
    
    S = [[] for _ in range(K)]

    i = 1
    k = 0
    cnt = 0
    while i <= N:
        S[k].append(i)
        i += 1
        cnt += 1
        if cnt == K - (k+1):
            k += 1
            cnt = 0

    j = 1
    k = 1
    cnt = 0
    col = 0
    while j <= N:
        S[k].append(j)
        j += 1
        k += 1
        cnt += 1
        if cnt == K - (col+1):
            col += 1
            k = col + 1
            cnt = 0

    print("Yes")
    print(K)

    for s in S:
        print(K - 1, *s)

    
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `3`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response:
<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by reading an integer N from the standard input.

The code then calculates the value of K such that K * (K-1) / 2 equals N. This is done in a loop that iterates from 1 to 1000. If a value of K is found that satisfies the condition, it breaks the loop and continues. If no such value is found, the code prints "No" and exits.

If K is found, the code initializes a 2D list S with K empty lists.

The code then enters two while loops. The first loop appends numbers from 1 to N to the first K lists of S. The second loop appends numbers from 1 to N to the remaining lists of S.

Finally, the code prints "Yes", K, and the contents of S.

<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will depend on the input N. If N is 3, the output will be:

Yes
3
2 [1, 2]
2 [3]
2 [4]
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

This output means that it is possible to create a 3-element set S with 2-element subsets [1, 2] and [3] and [4]. The subsets are printed in the order they are created.
