### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}

<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

### Response
The provided Python code is a simple binary to ASCII decoder. It first maps ASCII characters to binary strings and then maps binary strings to ASCII characters. The binary strings are grouped into 6-bit chunks.

The input `?D-C'KOPUA` is first encoded to binary using the `encode` dictionary. The resulting binary string is `111110100110110001101001011110000110101`.

Then, the binary string is decoded to ASCII using the `decode` dictionary. The binary string `101` corresponds to the ASCII character ` ` (space), `000000` corresponds to the ASCII character `'`, `000011` corresponds to the ASCII character `,`, `10010001` corresponds to the ASCII character `-`, `010001` corresponds to the ASCII character `.`, `000001` corresponds to the ASCII character `?`, `100101` corresponds to the ASCII character `A`, `10011010` corresponds to the ASCII character `B`, and so on.

So, the decoded ASCII string is ` D-C'KOPUA`.

So, the output of the code execution given the input `?D-C'KOPUA` is ` D-C'KOPUA`.

Here is the output:

```python
>>> D-C'KOPUA
 D-C'KOPUA
```

This output is the decoded ASCII string.

Please note that the `raw_input()` function is used for Python 2.x, and `input()` for Python 3.x. The Python 2.x `raw_input()` function reads a line from input, converts it to a string, and returns that string. The Python 3.x `input()` function does the same thing, but it also prints a prompt to the screen before reading the input.

Also, the provided code does not handle any exceptions or errors that might occur during the execution. It's always a good practice to handle such cases to make your code more robust.
