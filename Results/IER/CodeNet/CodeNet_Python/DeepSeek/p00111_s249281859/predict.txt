The provided Python code is a simple binary to ASCII decoder. It first maps ASCII characters to binary strings and then maps binary strings to ASCII characters. The binary strings are grouped into 6-bit chunks.

The input `?D-C'KOPUA` is first encoded to binary using the `encode` dictionary. The resulting binary string is `111110100110110001101001011110000110101`.

Then, the binary string is decoded to ASCII using the `decode` dictionary. The binary string `101` corresponds to the ASCII character ` ` (space), `000000` corresponds to the ASCII character `'`, `000011` corresponds to the ASCII character `,`, `10010001` corresponds to the ASCII character `-`, `010001` corresponds to the ASCII character `.`, `000001` corresponds to the ASCII character `?`, `100101` corresponds to the ASCII character `A`, `10011010` corresponds to the ASCII character `B`, and so on.

So, the decoded ASCII string is ` D-C'KOPUA`.

So, the output of the code execution given the input `?D-C'KOPUA` is ` D-C'KOPUA`.

Here is the output:

```python
>>> D-C'KOPUA
 D-C'KOPUA
```

This output is the decoded ASCII string.

Please note that the `raw_input()` function is used for Python 2.x, and `input()` for Python 3.x. The Python 2.x `raw_input()` function reads a line from input, converts it to a string, and returns that string. The Python 3.x `input()` function does the same thing, but it also prints a prompt to the screen before reading the input.

Also, the provided code does not handle any exceptions or errors that might occur during the execution. It's always a good practice to handle such cases to make your code more robust.
