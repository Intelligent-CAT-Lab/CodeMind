### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, M = map(int, input().split())
mod = 998244353

if N > M:
  N, M = M, N

fact = [0] * (M + 1)
powm = [0] * (M + 1)
pown = [0] * (M + 1)
fact[0] = 1
powm[0] = 1
pown[0] = 1
for i in range(1, M + 1):
  fact[i] = fact[i - 1] * i % mod
  powm[i] = powm[i - 1] * (M + 1) % mod
  pown[i] = pown[i - 1] * (N + 1) % mod

def pow(n, m):
  if m == 0:
    return 1
  elif m == 1:
    return n
  elif m % 2 == 0:
    return pow(n, m // 2)**2 % mod
  else:
    return pow(n, m // 2)**2 % mod * n % mod

inv_fact = [0] * (M + 1)
inv_fact[M] = pow(fact[M], mod-2)
for i in reversed(range(0, M)):
  inv_fact[i] = inv_fact[i + 1] * (i + 1) % mod
    
def C(n, r):
  return fact[n] * inv_fact[r] % mod * inv_fact[n - r] % mod
  
ans = 0
for i in range(N+1):
  ans += (-1)**i * C(N, i) * C(M, i) * fact[i] * powm[N - i] * pown[M - i]
  ans = ans % mod

print(ans)

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The given code is a Python program that calculates a specific value based on two input numbers N and M. The program uses a combination of mathematical operations and modular arithmetic to calculate the result.

The program begins by taking two input numbers N and M from the user. It then checks if N is greater than M, and if so, it swaps the values of N and M.

The program then initializes three lists, fact, powm, and pown, with length M+1. These lists will be used to store the factorial, M+1 power, and N+1 power of numbers from 0 to M.

The program then defines a function pow that calculates the power of a number modulo a given modulus.

The program then calculates the inverse of the factorial of numbers from M to 0. These values are stored in the list inv_fact.

The program defines another function C that calculates the combination of two numbers.

The program then calculates the value of ans, which is the sum of a series of terms. Each term is calculated as a combination of N and i, a combination of M and i, a factorial of i, a power of M+1 to N-i, and a power of N+1 to M-i. The sign of each term alternates between positive and negative.

Finally, the program prints the value of ans modulo the given modulus.

Given the input `1 2`, the program will calculate the value of ans modulo 998244353.

<<<Output>>>
The output of the program will depend on the input values N and M. The output is the value of ans modulo 998244353.

Please note that the actual output will depend on the input values N and M. The output is calculated using the mathematical operations and modular arithmetic defined in the code.
