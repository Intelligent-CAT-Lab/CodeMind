### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}

<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def make_divisors(n):
    divisors = []
    for i in range(1, int(n**0.5)+1):
        if n % i == 0:
            divisors.append(i)
            if i != n // i:
                divisors.append(n//i)

    # divisors.sort()
    return divisors

def main():
    N, M = map(int, input().split())
    MN = M/N
    divisor = make_divisors(M)
    max_gcd = 0
    for d in divisor:
        if (d<=MN) and (d>=max_gcd):
            max_gcd = d
    print(max_gcd)
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `3 14`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs N and M from the user. N is the number of elements in the set, and M is the sum of the elements in the set. The goal is to find the maximum number that divides M evenly and is less than or equal to N.

The function `make_divisors(n)` is used to generate all divisors of the number n. It starts from 1 and goes up to the square root of n. If n is divisible by i (i.e., n mod i = 0), then i is a divisor of n. If i is not equal to n divided by i, then n divided by i is also a divisor of n.

The function `main()` is the main function that runs the program. It first calculates MN, which is the average of the elements in the set. Then it calls `make_divisors(M)` to get all divisors of M. It initializes `max_gcd` to 0, which will be used to store the maximum divisor that is less than or equal to MN.

For each divisor d in the list of divisors, it checks if d is less than or equal to MN and greater than `max_gcd`. If both conditions are met, it updates `max_gcd` to d.

Finally, it prints `max_gcd`, which is the maximum divisor that is less than or equal to MN.

Given the input `3 14`, the code will calculate the average of the elements in the set as MN = 14/3 = 4. The divisors of M are 1, 2, 4, 7, 14. Since 4 is the largest divisor that is less than or equal to MN, the output of the code will be 4.

<<<Output>>>
4
