The given Python code is a bit complex and involves multiple steps. It first calculates the number of "Fizz", "Buzz", and "FizzBuzz" numbers within a certain range based on the input number. Then it generates the corresponding string for each number in the range. Finally, it prints the string at the position specified by the input number.

Let's break down the steps:

1. The input number is read and stored in the variable `s`.

2. A dictionary `m` is created to store the cumulative sum of the number of "Fizz", "Buzz", and "FizzBuzz" numbers for each digit position from 1 to 20.

3. The code then enters a loop that calculates the number of "Fizz", "Buzz", and "FizzBuzz" numbers for each digit position from 1 to 20.

4. After the loop, the code checks if `s` is less than the cumulative sum of the number of "Fizz", "Buzz", and "FizzBuzz" numbers for each digit position. If it is, the code breaks the loop and stores the digit position in `index`.

5. The code then enters another loop that generates the corresponding string for each number in the range from 1 to `index`.

6. The code checks if `s` is greater than the number of "Fizz", "Buzz", and "FizzBuzz" numbers for each number in the range. If it is, `s` is reduced by the number of "Fizz", "Buzz", and "FizzBuzz" numbers.

7. If `s` is not greater than the number of "Fizz", "Buzz", and "FizzBuzz" numbers for each number in the range, the code stores the number in `rem` and breaks the loop.

8. The code then generates the string for each number in the range from `rem` to `rem + 100`. If a number is divisible by 3, it is replaced with "Fizz". If a number is divisible by 5, it is replaced with "Buzz". If a number is divisible by both 3 and 5, it is replaced with "FizzBuzz".

9. Finally, the code prints the string at the position specified by `s`.

Given the input `1`, the output of the code would be "12Fizz4BuzzFizz78FizzBuzz11Fizz1314FizzBuzz1617Fizz19BuzzFizz2223FizzBuzz26Fizz2829FizzBuzz3132Fizz34BuzzFizz3740Fizz42BuzzFizz4546Fizz48BuzzFizz52Fizz5455FizzBuzz58Fizz6162Fizz65BuzzFizz6870Fizz72BuzzFizz7576Fizz78BuzzFizz82Fizz8586Fizz89BuzzFizz93Fizz9697Fizz99Buzz".

So, the output of the code execution given the input `1` would be "FizzBuzz".

Here is the output:

```python
FizzBuzz
```

This output is the 1st element of the string generated by the code.
