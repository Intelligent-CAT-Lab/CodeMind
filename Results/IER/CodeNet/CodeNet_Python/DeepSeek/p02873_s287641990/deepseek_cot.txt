### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>

def main():
  from itertools import groupby

  s = list(input())
  f = 0
  ans = 0

  for k,v in groupby(s):
    d = len(tuple(v))
    left = d if k==">" else 0
    right = d if k=="<" else 0
    if f>left:
      ans += d*(d+1)//2 - left
    else:
      ans += -1*f + d*(d+1)//2  
    f = right 

  print(ans) 

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `<>>`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The code is a Python program that calculates the number of valid arrows in a string. The string is input by the user and contains characters '<' and '>'. The program uses the itertools.groupby function to group consecutive characters in the string.

For each group, the code calculates the length of the group (d) and checks if the key of the group is '>' or '<'. If it is '>', the length of the group is assigned to the variable left, otherwise left is 0. If the key is '<', the length of the group is assigned to the variable right, otherwise right is 0.

The code then checks if the variable f is greater than left. If it is, the code calculates the number of valid arrows in the group and adds it to the variable ans. If f is not greater than left, the code calculates the number of valid arrows in the group and subtracts it from the variable ans. The variable f is then updated with the value of right.

Finally, the code prints the variable ans, which represents the total number of valid arrows in the string.

<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will depend on the input string. The output is the total number of valid arrows in the string.
