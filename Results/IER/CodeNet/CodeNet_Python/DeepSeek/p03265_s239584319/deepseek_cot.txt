You are an AI programming assistant, utilizing the Deepseek Coder model, developed by Deepseek Company, and you only answer questions related to computer science. For politically sensitive questions, security and privacy issues, and other non-computer science questions, you will refuse to answer.

### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}

[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import numpy as np
x1,y1,x2,y2=[int(a) for a in input().split()]
p1 = np.array([x1,y1])
p2 = np.array([x2,y2])
v1 = p2-p1
v2 = np.array([-v1[1],v1[0]])
p3 = p2+v2
p4 = p3+(-v1)
print(" ".join([str(v) for v in list(p3)+list(p4)]))
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `0 0 0 1`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The input given is `0 0 0 1`. This input is split into four parts and each part is converted to an integer. The first two parts form the coordinates of the first point `p1` and the last two parts form the coordinates of the second point `p2`.

The vector `v1` is calculated by subtracting `p1` from `p2`. The vector `v2` is calculated by rotating `v1` 90 degrees counterclockwise. This is done by swapping the signs of the x and y coordinates and negating the y coordinate.

The points `p3` and `p4` are calculated by adding `v2` to `p2` and subtracting `v1` from `p3` respectively.

Finally, the coordinates of `p3` and `p4` are joined together and printed.

<<<Output>>>
The output of the code would be `0 1 1 -1`.

This is because `p3` is at the point `(0, 1)` and `p4` is at the point `(1, -1)`.
