The code begins by reading two integers N and K from the input. N is the number of nodes in the graph, and K is the number of edges. The code then checks if K is greater than the maximum possible number of edges in a graph with N nodes. If it is, the code prints -1 and exits.

If K is not greater than the maximum possible number of edges, the code prints the number of edges that can be added to the graph without creating a cycle. This is calculated by subtracting K from the maximum possible number of edges in a graph with N nodes.

The code then prints N-1 lines, each of which represents an edge from node 1 to a node i, where i is a number from 2 to N. This represents the initial tree structure.

Finally, the code prints the remaining edges of the graph. These are calculated by iterating over all possible pairs of nodes i and j, where i and j are numbers from 2 to N, and i is not equal to j. The code prints each pair of nodes as an edge. The number of edges printed is determined by subtracting K from the maximum possible number of edges in a graph with N nodes.

The code uses the function MI() to read integers from the input. The function sys.stdin.readline().rstrip().split() reads a line from the input, removes any trailing newline characters, and splits the line into a list of strings. The map() function is then used to convert each string in the list to an integer.

The code uses the variables a and i to keep track of the number of edges printed so far. The variable N is used to determine the maximum number of edges in a graph with N nodes.

The code uses the operators // for integer division and % for modulus. The variable K is used to determine the number of edges to be added to the graph.

The code uses the functions print() and exit() to output the result and terminate the program.
