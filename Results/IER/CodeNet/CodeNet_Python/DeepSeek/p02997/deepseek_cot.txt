### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import sys
def MI(): return map(int,sys.stdin.readline().rstrip().split())

N,K = MI()

if K > ((N-1)*(N-2))//2:
    print(-1)
    exit()

print(N-1+((N-1)*(N-2))//2-K)

for i in range(2,N+1):
    print(1,i)

a = 0
for i in range(2,N):
    for j in range(i+1,N+1):
        if a < ((N-1)*(N-2))//2-K:
            print(i,j)
            a += 1

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `5 3`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The code begins by reading two integers N and K from the input. N is the number of nodes in the graph, and K is the number of edges. The code then checks if K is greater than the maximum possible number of edges in a graph with N nodes. If it is, the code prints -1 and exits.

If K is not greater than the maximum possible number of edges, the code prints the number of edges that can be added to the graph without creating a cycle. This is calculated by subtracting K from the maximum possible number of edges in a graph with N nodes.

The code then prints N-1 lines, each of which represents an edge from node 1 to a node i, where i is a number from 2 to N. This represents the initial tree structure.

Finally, the code prints the remaining edges of the graph. These are calculated by iterating over all possible pairs of nodes i and j, where i and j are numbers from 2 to N, and i is not equal to j. The code prints each pair of nodes as an edge. The number of edges printed is determined by subtracting K from the maximum possible number of edges in a graph with N nodes.

The code uses the function MI() to read integers from the input. The function sys.stdin.readline().rstrip().split() reads a line from the input, removes any trailing newline characters, and splits the line into a list of strings. The map() function is then used to convert each string in the list to an integer.

The code uses the variables a and i to keep track of the number of edges printed so far. The variable N is used to determine the maximum number of edges in a graph with N nodes.

The code uses the operators // for integer division and % for modulus. The variable K is used to determine the number of edges to be added to the graph.

The code uses the functions print() and exit() to output the result and terminate the program.

The code uses the control flow statements if, for, and while to control the flow of the program. The variables N, K, and a are used to control the flow of the program.
