### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
S = input()

max0 = 0
max1 = 0
amax0 = []
amax1 = []
mi0 = 0
mi1 = 0
h0 = 0
h1 = 0
for i, c in enumerate(S):
    if c=="1":
        h1 += 1
        if h1-mi1 > max1:
            max1 = h1-mi1
            amax1 = [i]
        elif h1-mi1 == max1:
            amax1.append(i)
        h0 -= 1
        if h0 < mi0:
            mi0 = h0
    elif c=="0":
        h1 -= 1
        if h1 < mi1:
            mi1 = h1
        h0 += 1
        if h0-mi0 > max0:
            max0 = h0-mi0
            amax0 = [i]
        elif h0-mi0 == max0:
            amax0.append(i)
    else:
        h1 -= 1
        if h1 < mi1:
            mi1 = h1
        h0 -= 1
        if h0 < mi0:
            mi0 = h0
if max0 < max1:
    if len(set([i%2 for i in amax1]))==1:
        print(max1)
    else:
        print(max1+1)
elif max0 > max1:
    if len(set([i%2 for i in amax0]))==1:
        print(max0)
    else:
        print(max0+1)
else:
    if len(set([i%2 for i in amax1]+[(max0+i)%2 for i in amax0]))==1:
        print(max0)
    else:
        print(max0+1)

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `0??`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The input string `0??` is processed by the code. The code is designed to find the maximum length of consecutive 0s and 1s in the string. It does this by iterating over the string and keeping track of the maximum length of 0s and 1s found so far, as well as the minimum length of 0s and 1s found so far.

The code maintains four variables: `max0`, `max1`, `amax0`, and `amax1`. `max0` and `max1` are used to keep track of the maximum length of 0s and 1s found so far. `amax0` and `amax1` are lists that store the indices of the maximum length 0s and 1s found so far.

The code also maintains four helper variables: `mi0`, `mi1`, `h0`, and `h1`. `mi0` and `mi1` are used to keep track of the minimum length of 0s and 1s found so far. `h0` and `h1` are used to keep track of the current length of 0s and 1s.

The code iterates over the string `S`. For each character `c` in the string, it checks if `c` is "1" or "0". If `c` is "1", it increments `h1` and `h0` by 1. If `c` is "0", it decrements `h1` and `h0` by 1. If `c` is neither "1" nor "0", it does nothing.

After the loop, the code checks if `max0` is less than `max1`. If it is, the code checks if the length of `amax1` is even. If it is, the code prints `max1`. Otherwise, the code prints `max1+1`.

If `max0` is greater than `max1`, the code checks if the length of `amax0` is even. If it is, the code prints `max0`. Otherwise, the code prints `max0+1`.

If `max0` is equal to `max1`, the code checks if the length of `amax1` and `amax0` are both even. If they are, the code prints `max0`. Otherwise, the code prints `max0+1`.

The output of the code will be the maximum length of consecutive 0s and 1s in the string, considering the condition that the length of the consecutive 0s or 1s should be even.

<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will depend on the input string `S`. As the input string `S` is `0??`, the output of the code will be 1.
