### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def solve(l):
    n = 0
    while 2**n <= l:
        n += 1
    E = []
    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):
        x = 2**i
        if i != n-1:
            E.append((i, i+1, 0))
            E.append((i, i+1, x))
        if l - x >= 2**(n-1):
            E.append((i, n-1, l-x))
            l -= x
    print(n, len(E))
    for u, v, x in E:
        print(u+1, v+1, x)

l = int(input())
solve(l)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `4`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The given Python code is a function `solve(l)` that takes an integer `l` as input. The function first calculates the smallest integer `n` such that `2^n` is not greater than `l`. This integer `n` represents the number of bits needed to represent the number `l` in binary format.

The function then creates a list `E` to store the edges of the graph. The graph is a representation of the binary representation of `l`. Each edge in the graph represents a bit in the binary representation of `l`. The first bit is at position `n-1`, the second bit is at position `n-2`, and so on.

The function then iterates over the bits in the binary representation of `l` from right to left. For each bit, it checks if the corresponding bit in the binary representation of `l` is set. If it is set, it adds an edge to the graph from the current bit to the next bit. If the corresponding bit in the binary representation of `l` is not set, it adds an edge to the graph from the current bit to the next bit with weight `2^(n-1)`.

Finally, the function prints the number of bits `n` and the number of edges in the graph. It then prints each edge in the graph. The edges are printed in the format `u v x`, where `u` and `v` are the indices of the two nodes that the edge connects, and `x` is the weight of the edge.

Given the input `4`, the binary representation of `4` is `100`. The number of bits `n` is `3`, and the graph has `2` edges. The edges are `(0, 1, 0)` and `(0, 2, 4)`. The indices of the nodes are 1-based, so the edges are represented as `1 2 4` and `1 3 0`.

<<<Output>>>
3 2
1 2 0
1 3 4
