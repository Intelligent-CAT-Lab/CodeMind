The output of the code will depend on the values of `n`, `k`, and `a`. It will be the sum of all numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) that are divisible by `k` and are at least `a` times the sum of their digits, under modulo `mod`.

Please note that the actual output will depend on the values of `n`, `k`, and `a`. The code does not provide a specific output for the given input `1 1 50`.
