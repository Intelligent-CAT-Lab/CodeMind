### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

    Args: x (int): a number to be resolved

    """
    max_prime, ret = 0, {}
    cnt = 0
    while x % 2 == 0:  # divide x by 2 as much as possible
        x //= 2
        cnt += 1
    if cnt > 0:
        max_prime = 2
        ret[max_prime] = cnt

    cnt = 0
    for i in range(3, int(x ** 0.5) + 1, 2):
        cnt = 0
        while x % i == 0:
            x //= i
            max_prime = i
            cnt += 1
        if cnt > 0:
            ret[max_prime] = cnt

    if x > 2:  # when x is prime greater than 2
        max_prime = x
        ret[max_prime] = 1
    return ret


def main():
    N = int(input())
    facts = prime_factorization(N)
    ans = f"{N}: "
    for prime, cnt in facts.items():
        ans += f"{prime} " * cnt
    print(ans[:-1])

    main()

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `12`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input N and performs prime factorization on it. The prime factorization function `prime_factorization(x: int) -> dict` takes an integer x and returns a dictionary where the keys are prime factors and the values are their corresponding powers.

The main function first takes an integer input N. It then calls the `prime_factorization(N)` function to get the prime factorization of N. The result is stored in the `facts` variable.

The `ans` variable is initialized to a string that includes the original number N and a colon. This string will be used to store the prime factors and their powers.

Then, a for loop is used to iterate over the items in the `facts` dictionary. For each item, the prime factor and its power are added to the `ans` string. The prime factor is added to the string as many times as its power.

Finally, the `ans` string is printed, excluding the last character (which is a space).

The `main` function is called if the script is run directly.

The input to the code is `12`.

The prime factorization of 12 is `2^2 * 3^1`.

So, the output of the code would be `12: 2 2 3`.

<<<Output>>>
12: 2 2 3

Note: The output is based on the analysis provided. The actual output of the code will depend on the Python interpreter used to run the code.
