### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())
Nlist = [k*(k-1)//2 for k in range(10**3)]
if N not in Nlist:
    print('No')
    exit()
print('Yes')
k = Nlist.index(N)
S = [[0]*i for i in range(k)]
S[0] = [i+1 for i in range(k-1)]
for i in range(k-1):
    S[i+1] = [S[j][i] for j in range(i+1)]
    S[i+1] += [S[i][k-2]+j+1 for j in range(k-1-(i-1))]
print(k)
S = [[str(S[i][j]) for j in range(k-1)] for i in range(k)]
for i in range(k):
    print(' '.join([str(k-1)]+S[i]))
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `3`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The first line of the code reads an integer input N.
The second line of the code generates a list Nlist of the first 1000 triangular numbers. A triangular number is a number that can be represented as the sum of the first n natural numbers.
The code checks if N is in the list Nlist. If it is not, the code prints 'No' and exits.
If N is in the list, the code prints 'Yes'.
The code then calculates the index k of N in the list Nlist.
The code then generates a 2D list S of size k x k. The first row of S is filled with numbers from 1 to k-1. The remaining rows of S are filled with numbers that follow the pattern of the previous row.
The code prints the size of S, which is k.
The code then prints each row of S, preceded by the number k-1.
<<<Output>>>
3
2 1 2
1 2 2
1 1 3
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

This output is generated by the given input 3. The size of S is 3, and each row of S is preceded by the number 2. The rows of S are: [1, 2, 2] and [2, 2, 3].
