The variable N is initialized to the input number.
The variable power is initialized to 1, which will be used to accumulate the result.
The code then enters a loop that iterates N times.
In each iteration, it multiplies the current power by (i+1) and takes the modulus of the result with 10**9+7 to prevent overflow. This is a common technique in competitive programming to deal with large numbers.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of power, which is the factorial of N modulo 10**9+7.

The factorial of a number N is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to N. For example, the factorial of 5 is 5*4*3*2*1 = 120.

The modulo operation is used to get the remainder of the division of the factorial by 10**9+7. This is done to keep the number within a manageable range, as the number can become very large very quickly.

The modulo operation is also used to prevent overflow. If the factorial of a number is calculated without the modulo operation, it can result in a very large number that cannot be stored in a variable. The modulo operation restricts the number to a specific range, preventing overflow.

In this case, the modulo operation is used to keep the number within the range of a 9 digit number.
