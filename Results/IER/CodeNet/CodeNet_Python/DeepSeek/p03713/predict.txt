The output of the code will depend on the values of h and w. It will be the minimum area difference that can be obtained by cutting the rectangle into three parts.

For the input `3 5`, the output would be 0, because the height and width are both divisible by 3.

Please note that the actual output will depend on the specific values of h and w.
