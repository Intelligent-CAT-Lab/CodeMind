The output of the code will depend on the input values a, b, c, and d. It will be a number between 0 and mod-1.

For the input `1 1 2 2`, the output will be 4.

This is because there are 4 ways to reach the bottom-right corner of a 2x2 grid from the top-left corner: right-right-down, right-down-right, down-right-right, and down-down-right.

Please note that the actual output will depend on the specific values of a, b, c, and d.
