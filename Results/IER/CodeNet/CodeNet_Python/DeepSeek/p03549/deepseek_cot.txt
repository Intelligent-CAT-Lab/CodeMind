### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}

[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def getN():
    return int(input())
def getNM():
    return map(int, input().split())
def getList():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
def getArray(intn):
    return [int(input()) for i in range(intn)]
def input():
    return sys.stdin.readline().rstrip()

from sys import exit

from itertools import permutations
from math import factorial, hypot

N, M = getNM()
total = 1900 * M + 100 * (N - M)
print(total * (2 ** M))
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `1 1`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}

### Response:
<<<Analysis>>>
The code first defines several functions for getting inputs. The function `getN()` gets an integer input, `getNM()` gets two integer inputs separated by a space, `getList()` gets a list of integers separated by spaces, `getArray(intn)` gets `intn` integer inputs, and `input()` gets a line of input.

Then it imports necessary modules for various operations. It sets the recursion limit to a large number, defines a modulus variable, and imports other necessary modules.

Next, it defines a function `factorial(n)` that calculates the factorial of a number `n`.

After that, it gets the inputs `N` and `M` using the `getNM()` function.

The total score is calculated as `1900 * M + 100 * (N - M)`. The total score is then multiplied by `2 ** M` (which is equivalent to `2 to the power of M`).

Finally, it prints the total score.

<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will be the total score calculated as per the formula `1900 * M + 100 * (N - M)` multiplied by `2 ** M`.

For the given input `1 1`, the output will be `3900 * 2 = 7800`.
