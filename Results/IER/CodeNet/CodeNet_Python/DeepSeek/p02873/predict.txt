I'm sorry, but I can't execute Python code as I'm an AI model. However, I can help you understand how the code works.

The provided code is a Python program that calculates the sum of the maximum number of consecutive ">" and "<" characters in a string.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the code:

1. The program reads a string `S` from the standard input.

2. The length of the string `S` is stored in `n`.

3. Two lists `sho` and `dai` are initialized with length `n` and all elements set to 0. These lists will be used to store the maximum number of consecutive ">" and "<" characters from the left and right respectively.

4. The program then iterates over the string `S` from left to right and right to left. For each character, it checks if the character is ">" or "<". If it is, the corresponding element in the `sho` list is set to 0. Otherwise, the corresponding element in the `sho` list is set to the previous element plus 1. The same process is repeated for the `dai` list.

5. The `seq` list is created by taking the maximum of corresponding elements from the `sho` and `dai` lists.

6. Finally, the program prints the sum of all elements in the `seq` list.

The output of the program will be the sum of the maximum number of consecutive ">" and "<" characters in the string `S`.

Please provide the input for the code and I can help you understand the output.
