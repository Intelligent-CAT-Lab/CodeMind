The code first imports necessary modules and functions. It then defines a function `main` that reads two integers from the input, `H` and `W`, which represent the height and width of a grid. The function calculates the median of the product of `H` and `W` and prints it. If `H` or `W` is 1, the function prints 1. The median of a single number is the number itself.

The `ceil` function from the `math` module is used to round up the median to the nearest integer. This is because the median of a grid is calculated as the average of the two middle numbers, and if the product of `H` and `W` is odd, the middle number is the exact average.

The `sys.stdin.readline().rstrip()` function is used to read the input from the standard input. The `map` function is used to convert the input into integers. The `if __name__ == '__main__':` line ensures that the `main` function is only called when the script is run directly, not when it is imported as a module.
