### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}

The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

S_MAP = lambda: map(str, INPUT().split())

S_LIST = lambda: list(map(str, INPUT().split()))

sys.setrecursionlimit(10 ** 9)
INF = float('inf')
mod = 10 ** 9 + 7


def main():
    H, W = MAP()
    print(ceil(H*W/2) if H != 1 and W != 1 else 1)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `4 5`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The code first imports necessary modules and functions. It then defines a function `main` that reads two integers from the input, `H` and `W`, which represent the height and width of a grid. The function calculates the median of the product of `H` and `W` and prints it. If `H` or `W` is 1, the function prints 1. The median of a single number is the number itself.

The `ceil` function from the `math` module is used to round up the median to the nearest integer. This is because the median of a grid is calculated as the average of the two middle numbers, and if the product of `H` and `W` is odd, the middle number is the exact average.

The `sys.stdin.readline().rstrip()` function is used to read the input from the standard input. The `map` function is used to convert the input into integers. The `if __name__ == '__main__':` line ensures that the `main` function is only called when the script is run directly, not when it is imported as a module.
