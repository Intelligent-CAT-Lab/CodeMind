For the input `5 3 2`, the output would be:

```
3 4 5 1 2
```

This is because the total number of elements is 5, the minimum number of elements in each line is 3, and the maximum number of elements in each line is 2. The code first prints 3 elements, then 2 elements, and then 1 element. The remaining 2 elements are printed in the next line.
