### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
l = int(input())

d = max([d for d in range(30) if 2**d <= l])
n = d+1
m = 2*d
ans = []
for i in range(1, n):
    ans.append((i, i+1, 0))
    ans.append((i, i+1, 2**(i-1)))

while l > 2**d:
    for i in range(n-1, 0, -1):
        if l-2**(i-1) > 2**d-1:
            ans.append((i, n, l-2**(i-1)))
            m += 1
            l -= 2**(i-1)
            break

print(n, m)
for a in ans:
    print(*a)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `4`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The input is a positive integer `l`. The code first calculates the maximum power of 2 that is less than or equal to `l`. This is stored in `d`. The variable `n` is set to `d+1` and `m` is set to `2*d`. `n` and `m` are used to represent the number of nodes and edges in the graph respectively.

The code then creates a list `ans` to store the edges of the graph. For each `i` from 1 to `n-1`, it adds two edges to `ans`: one from node `i` to node `i+1` with weight 0, and one from node `i` to node `i+1` with weight `2^(i-1)`.

The code then enters a loop that continues until `l` is less than or equal to `2^d`. Inside the loop, it finds the maximum `i` such that `l-2^(i-1)` is greater than `2^d-1`. It then adds an edge from node `i` to node `n` with weight `l-2^(i-1)` to `ans`, increments `m` by 1, and updates `l` to `l-2^(i-1)`.

Finally, the code prints `n`, `m`, and each edge in `ans`.

Given the input `4`, the maximum power of 2 that is less than or equal to `4` is `2^2=4`. So `d` is set to `2`, `n` is set to `3`, and `m` is set to `4`.

The edges in the graph are:
- From node 1 to node 2 with weight 0
- From node 1 to node 2 with weight 1
- From node 2 to node 3 with weight 0
- From node 2 to node 3 with weight 2

The code then finds that `4-2^1=2` is greater than `4-2^2+1=-1`, so it does not enter the loop. The final values of `n` and `m` are printed, and the edges in `ans` are printed.
