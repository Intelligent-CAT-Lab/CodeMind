### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
from math import factorial
MAX = 10**9+7
N, M = map(int, input().split())
diff = N-M
if abs(diff)>1:
    print(0)
elif diff == 0:
    print(factorial(N)*factorial(M)*2%MAX)
else:
    print(factorial(N)*factorial(M)%MAX)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `2 2`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes two inputs N and M from the user. It then calculates the absolute difference between N and M. If the absolute difference is greater than 1, it prints 0. If the absolute difference is 0, it calculates the factorial of N and M, multiplies them together, multiplies the result by 2, and then takes the modulus of the result with respect to 10^9+7 (MAX). If the absolute difference is 1, it calculates the factorial of N and M, and then takes the modulus of the result with respect to 10^9+7 (MAX).

The factorial function calculates the product of all positive integers less than or equal to a given number. For example, the factorial of 5 is 5*4*3*2*1 = 120.

The modulus operation finds the remainder of the division of one number by another. For example, the modulus of 12345 by 10 is 5.
