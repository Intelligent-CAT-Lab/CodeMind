The code first takes two inputs N and M from the user. It then calculates the absolute difference between N and M. If the absolute difference is greater than 1, it prints 0. If the absolute difference is 0, it calculates the factorial of N and M, multiplies them together, multiplies the result by 2, and then takes the modulus of the result with respect to 10^9+7 (MAX). If the absolute difference is 1, it calculates the factorial of N and M, and then takes the modulus of the result with respect to 10^9+7 (MAX).

The factorial function calculates the product of all positive integers less than or equal to a given number. For example, the factorial of 5 is 5*4*3*2*1 = 120.

The modulus operation finds the remainder of the division of one number by another. For example, the modulus of 12345 by 10 is 5.
