The output of the code will be the factorial of n, taken modulo 1000000007.

For example, if n is 3, the output will be 6, because the factorial of 3 is 3*2*1 = 6, and 6 modulo 1000000007 is 6.

If n is 4, the output will be 24, because the factorial of 4 is 4*3*2*1 = 24, and 24 modulo 1000000007 is 24.

And so on.
