### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input().split()[0])

def make_divisors(n):
    divisors = []
    for i in range(1, int(n**0.5)+1):
        if n % i == 0:
            divisors.append(i)
            if i != n // i:
                divisors.append(n//i)

    # divisors.sort()
    return divisors

Nod = make_divisors(N-1)
divs = make_divisors(N)

for d in divs:
    c = N
    while True:
        if d == 1:
            break
        if c%d == 1:
            Nod.append(d)
            break
        elif c%d == 0:
            c = c//d;
            continue
        else:
            break

print(len(Nod)-1)

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an input N. The input is a single integer.

The function `make_divisors(n)` is defined to generate all divisors of a number n. It does this by iterating from 1 to the square root of n and checking if n is divisible by the current number i. If it is, i and n//i (the quotient of n divided by i) are appended to the list of divisors.

The code then calculates the divisors of N-1 and N using the `make_divisors(n)` function and stores them in Nod and divs respectively.

The code then iterates over each divisor d in divs. For each divisor, it initializes a variable c to N. It then enters a loop that continues until c is divisible by d. If d is 1, the loop breaks. If c is not divisible by d, c is divided by d and the loop continues. If c is divisible by d, d is appended to Nod and the loop breaks.

Finally, the code prints the length of Nod minus 1. This is the number of distinct divisors of N-1.

The input given is `6`.
