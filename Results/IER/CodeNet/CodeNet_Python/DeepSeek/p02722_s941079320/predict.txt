The code first takes an input N. The input is a single integer.

The function `make_divisors(n)` is defined to generate all divisors of a number n. It does this by iterating from 1 to the square root of n and checking if n is divisible by the current number i. If it is, i and n//i (the quotient of n divided by i) are appended to the list of divisors.

The code then calculates the divisors of N-1 and N using the `make_divisors(n)` function and stores them in Nod and divs respectively.

The code then iterates over each divisor d in divs. For each divisor, it initializes a variable c to N. It then enters a loop that continues until c is divisible by d. If d is 1, the loop breaks. If c is not divisible by d, c is divided by d and the loop continues. If c is divisible by d, d is appended to Nod and the loop breaks.

Finally, the code prints the length of Nod minus 1. This is the number of distinct divisors of N-1.

The input given is `6`.
