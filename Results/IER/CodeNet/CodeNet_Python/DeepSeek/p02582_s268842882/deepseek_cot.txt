### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
S = input()

cur_l, max_l = 0, 0

for s in S:
  if s == 'R':
    cur_l += 1
  else: # s == 'R'
    if cur_l > max_l:
      max_l = cur_l
    cur_l = 0

if cur_l > max_l:
  max_l = cur_l

print(max_l) 


<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `RRS`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The input string `RRS` is given to the program. The program is designed to find the maximum length of consecutive 'R's in the string.

The program initializes two variables, `cur_l` and `max_l`, to 0. `cur_l` is used to keep track of the current length of consecutive 'R's, and `max_l` is used to keep track of the maximum length found so far.

The program then iterates over each character `s` in the string. If `s` is 'R', it increments `cur_l` by 1. If `s` is not 'R' (which means it must be 'L'), it checks if `cur_l` is greater than `max_l`. If it is, it updates `max_l` to be the current value of `cur_l`. Then it resets `cur_l` to 0.

After the loop, the program checks if `cur_l` is greater than `max_l`. If it is, it updates `max_l` to be the current value of `cur_l`.

Finally, the program prints the value of `max_l`, which is the maximum length of consecutive 'R's in the string.

Given the input `RRS`, the program would output `2` because there are two consecutive 'R's in the string.

<<<Output>>>
2
