The output of the code will be 'Yes' if the runner can reach the destination within the given time and 'No' otherwise.

For the given input `1000 15 80`, the code will print 'Yes' because 80 * 15 = 1200, which is greater than 1000. Therefore, the runner can reach the destination within the given time.
