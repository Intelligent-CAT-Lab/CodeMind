### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
W, H, c = input().split()
W = int(W)
H = int(H)
for i in range(H) :
    for j in range(W) :
        if (i == 0 and j == 0) or (i == 0 and j == W-1) or (i == H-1 and j == 0) or (i == H-1 and j == W-1) :
            print('+', end='')
        elif i == 0 or i == H-1 :
            print('-', end='')
        elif j == 0 or j == W-1 :
            print('|', end='')
        elif i == ((H-1)//2) and j == ((W-1)//2) :
            print(c, end='')
        else :
            print('.', end='')
    print()

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `3 3 B`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three inputs: W (width of the rectangle), H (height of the rectangle), and c (character to be printed at the center of the rectangle).

The outermost for loop iterates H times, each time printing a new line. The inner for loop iterates W times, printing a character based on the current position (i, j).

The if-elif-else statements check the current position (i, j) and print the appropriate character:

- If the current position is at the corners (i=0 and j=0, i=0 and j=W-1, i=H-1 and j=0, or i=H-1 and j=W-1), it prints '+'.
- If the current position is at the edges of the rectangle (i=0 or i=H-1, or j=0 or j=W-1), it prints '-' or '|' respectively.
- If the current position is at the center of the rectangle (i=(H-1)//2 and j=(W-1)//2), it prints the character c.
- If none of the above conditions are met, it prints '.'.

Finally, after printing a line, it prints a newline character to move to the next line.

Given the input `3 3 B`, the code will print a 3x3 rectangle with the character 'B' at the center.

<<<Output>>>
```
+++
|B|
+++
```

I hope this helps you understand how the code works and what the output will be.
