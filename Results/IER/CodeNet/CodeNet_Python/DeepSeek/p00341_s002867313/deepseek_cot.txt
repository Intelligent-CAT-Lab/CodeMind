### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
lst = sorted(map(int, input().split()))
if lst[0] == lst[3] and lst[4] == lst[7] and lst[8] == lst[11]:
  print("yes")
else:
  print("no")

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `1 1 3 4 8 9 7 3 4 5 5 5`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an input of 12 integers and sorts them in ascending order. The sorted list is stored in the variable `lst`.

The code then checks if the first element (index 0) of the sorted list is equal to the fourth element (index 3) and the sixth element (index 4) is equal to the tenth element (index 7). 

Finally, the code checks if the ninth element (index 8) is equal to the twelfth element (index 11). 

If all these conditions are met, the code prints "yes". Otherwise, it prints "no".

<<<Output>>>
The input given is `1 1 3 4 5 5 5 7 9 3 4 8`. After sorting, the list becomes `[1, 1, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 7, 8, 9]`. 

The first and fourth elements are both 1, the sixth and tenth elements are both 5, and the ninth and twelfth elements are both 5. 

So, the output of the code would be "yes".
