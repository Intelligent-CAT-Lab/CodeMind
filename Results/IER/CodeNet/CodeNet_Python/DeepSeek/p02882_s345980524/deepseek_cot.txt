### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>

The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import math
a,h,x = [int(j) for j in input().split()]
# y = (h*a - x/a)*(2/a**2)
# y = a**2/(2*h*a-2*x)
y = 2*h/a - 2*x/a**3
z = (h**2)*a/(2*x)
# try:
# print(y)
b = x/(a**2)
if b>h/2:
    print(math.degrees(math.atan(y)))
else:
    print(math.degrees(math.atan(z)))
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `2 2 4`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The given code is a Python program that calculates the angle at which a projectile is thrown. The input to the program is three integers: a, h, and x.

The variable a represents the initial velocity of the projectile. The variable h represents the height of the building. The variable x represents the distance to the building.

The program first calculates the value of y using the formula `2*h/a - 2*x/a^3`. Then it calculates the value of z using the formula `(h^2)*a/(2*x)`.

The program then checks if `x/(a^2)` is greater than `h/2`. If it is, the program prints the arctangent of y in degrees. Otherwise, it prints the arctangent of z in degrees.

The arctangent function in Python returns the result in radians, so the program converts the result to degrees using the `math.degrees()` function.

Given the input `2 2 4`, the program first calculates the values of y and z. Then it checks if `x/(a^2)` is greater than `h/2`. Since `2/2` equals `1` and `4/4` equals `1`, the program calculates the arctangent of y in degrees.

The arctangent of y is calculated as `2*2/(1*2 - 2*4)`, which equals `-2`. Since the result is negative, the program prints `-2` in degrees.

So, the output of the code execution given the input `2 2 4` is `-2`.

<<<Output>>>
-2
