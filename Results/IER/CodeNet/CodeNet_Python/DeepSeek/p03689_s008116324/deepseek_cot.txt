### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
H,W,h,w = map(int,input().split())
if H%h == 0 and W%w == 0:
    print('No')
    exit()
print('Yes')

n = 1000
if W%w:
    m = -((w-1)*n + 1)
    row = [m if i%w==w-1 else n for i in range(W)]
    for i in range(H):
        print(*row)
else:
    m = -((h-1)*n + 1)
    for i in range(H):
        if i%h == h-1:
            print(*([m] * W))
        else:
            print(*([n] * W))
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `3 3 2 2`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes four inputs H, W, h, w from the user. H and W are the height and width of the grid, and h and w are the height and width of the subgrid. The code then checks if H is divisible by h and W is divisible by w. If either of these conditions is true, it prints 'No' and exits the program. Otherwise, it prints 'Yes'.

If the conditions are not met, the code then checks if W is divisible by w. If it is, it creates a row of numbers where each number is either n or m. If W is not divisible by w, it creates a row of numbers where each number is either n or m. The row is then printed H times.

The variable n is initialized to 1000. If W is not divisible by w, m is initialized to -((w-1)*n + 1). If W is divisible by w, m is initialized to -((h-1)*n + 1).

The code then enters a loop that prints the row H times. If the current row number is divisible by h, it prints m. Otherwise, it prints n.

The output of the code will be a grid of numbers. The grid will have H rows and W columns. Each cell in the grid will contain either n or m. If W is not divisible by w, each row will start with m and the rest of the row will contain n. If W is divisible by w, each row will start with n and the rest of the row will contain m. If the current row number is divisible by h, the entire row will contain m. Otherwise, the entire row will contain n.

The output of the code will be a grid of numbers that matches the description above.

<<<Output>>>
Yes
1000 1000 1000
1000 1000 1000
1000 1000 1000
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

Note: The output is a 3x3 grid with all cells containing 1000. This is because the condition for the code to print 'Yes' is not met for the given input (3, 3, 2, 2).
