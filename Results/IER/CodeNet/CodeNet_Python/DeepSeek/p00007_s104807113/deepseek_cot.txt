### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import math

def main():
    n = int(input())
    _debt = 100000
    for i in range(n):
        _debt += math.ceil(_debt*0.05*0.001)*1000
    print(_debt)



if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `5`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable `n` is initialized to the input number. The variable `_debt` is initialized to 100000.

The code then enters a loop that iterates `n` times. In each iteration, it calculates the interest by multiplying the current `_debt` by 5% (0.05) and 0.1% (0.001), and then rounds up to the nearest integer using the `math.ceil()` function. The interest is then multiplied by 1000 and added to `_debt`.

After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of `_debt`, which represents the total amount of money after `n` years.

The input `5` means the code will calculate the interest for 5 years.

The calculation of interest is done in the following steps:
1. Calculate the interest rate: 0.05 * 0.001 = 0.0005
2. Multiply the interest rate by the current debt: 0.0005 * 100000 = 50
3. Round up the result to the nearest integer: 50
4. Multiply the result by 1000: 50 * 1000 = 5000
5. Add the result to the current debt: 5000 + 100000 = 105000

So, the output of the code will be 105000.

<<<Output>>>
105000
