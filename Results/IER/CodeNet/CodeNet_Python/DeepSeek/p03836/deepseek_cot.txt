### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
sx,sy,tx,ty = map(int,input().split())
x = (tx-sx)
y = (ty-sy)

order = "L"

order += "U"*(y+1)
order += "R"*(x+1)
order += "D"

order += "R"
order += "D"*(y+1)
order += "L"*(x+1)
order += "U"

order += "U"*y
order += "R"*x
order += "D"*y
order += "L"*x
print(order)

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `0 0 1 2`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four integer inputs: sx, sy, tx, ty. These inputs represent the starting and ending coordinates of a point in a 2D grid. The point starts at (sx, sy) and moves to (tx, ty).

The code first calculates the differences between the x and y coordinates of the starting and ending points. These differences are stored in variables x and y.

The code then constructs a string variable order that represents the sequence of movements the point will make. The string is initially empty and is built up by appending characters to it.

The code first appends "L" to order, then appends "U" for y+1 times. This represents moving left and up to the starting point.

Next, the code appends "R" for x+1 times to move right from the starting point to the first point of the second line.

Then, the code appends "D" to move down to the second line.

Next, the code appends "R" to move right to the second point of the second line. Then, it appends "D" for y+1 times to move down to the bottom point of the second line.

Finally, the code appends "U" for y times to move up to the starting point. Then, it appends "L" for x times to move left to the starting point.

The code then prints the string order, which represents the sequence of movements the point will make.

Given the input "0 0 1 2", the code will output "LURDRDULULDRULD".

<<<Output>>>
LURDRDULULDRULD
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

I hope this helps you understand how the code works and what the output will be.
