I'm sorry, but as an AI, I'm not able to execute Python code. However, I can provide you with an analysis of the code you provided.

The code you provided is a Python program that checks if a projectile can hit a target (Y, X) with a given velocity (V) in a 2D space. The program uses a function `check(qx,qy)` to check if a projectile can hit the target. This function uses a quadratic equation to calculate the time of flight of the projectile and checks if the projectile hits the target.

The function `calc(vy,t)` calculates the y-coordinate of the projectile at time `t`. The function `cmp(lb,ub,x)` compares a number `x` with a range `[lb, ub]`.

The program then reads the number of obstacles (N), the velocity of the projectile (V), the x-coordinate of the target (X) and the y-coordinate of the target (Y) from the input. It then reads the coordinates of the obstacles and checks if the projectile can hit the target.

The output of the program will be 'Yes' if the projectile can hit the target and 'No' otherwise.

Based on the input you provided (`0 7 3 1`), the program will check if a projectile with velocity 7 can hit a target at coordinates (3, 1) in a 2D space. The output will depend on the obstacles and the projectile's trajectory.

Please note that to get the actual output, you would need to run the code on your local machine or a Python environment.
