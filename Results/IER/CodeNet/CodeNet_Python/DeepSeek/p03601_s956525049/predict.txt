The output of the code would depend on the specific values of the input. Without knowing the exact input, I can't provide the exact output. However, the output will be two integers, `resa` and `resb`, which represent the ratio of `i` to `i + w` where `i` and `i + w` are the maximum possible values of `i` and `i + w` respectively and `w` is the maximum possible value of `j` such that the conditions in the code are met.
