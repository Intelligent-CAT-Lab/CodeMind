### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())


for i in range(50001):
    if N == int(i * 1.08):
        print(i)
        exit(0)
print(':(')
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `432`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input N and checks if there exists an integer i such that N is equal to i*1.08. If such an i exists, it prints i and exits the program. If no such i exists, it prints ":(".

The input given is 432.

The code first converts the input to an integer. Then it enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 50000. For each iteration, it checks if the current number i multiplied by 1.08 is equal to N. If it is, it prints i and exits the program. If no such i is found after the loop finishes, it prints ":(".

The calculation i*1.08 is done to simulate the inflation rate of 8% per year.

The input 432 is converted to an integer and stored in the variable N.

The code then enters the loop. For each iteration, it checks if the current number i multiplied by 1.08 is equal to N. Since 432*1.08 equals 464, the code prints 464 and exits the program.

So, the output of the code would be:

<<<Output>>>
464
