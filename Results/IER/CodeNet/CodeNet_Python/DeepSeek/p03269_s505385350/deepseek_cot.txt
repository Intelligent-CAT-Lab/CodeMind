### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
L=int(input())
s=bin(L)[2:]
l=len(s)-1
ans=[]
for i in range(l):
    ans.append([i+1,i+2,2**(l-i-1)])
    ans.append([i+1,i+2,0])
u=2**(l)
for k in range(1,l+1):
    if s[k]!='0':
        ans.append([1,k+1,u])
        u+=2**(l-k) 
        #print(k+1,l)
print(l+1,len(ans))
for a,b,c in ans:
    print(a,b,c)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `4`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input `L` and converts it to binary representation `s`. The length of `s` is stored in `l`.

The code then initializes an empty list `ans` to store the operations.

The first loop iterates over the binary representation `s`, and for each bit, it appends two operations to `ans`: one where the bit is flipped (set to 1), and one where the bit is set to 0.

The second loop iterates over the binary representation `s`, and for each bit that is set to 1, it appends an operation to `ans` where the bit is flipped.

Finally, the code prints the length of `s` plus 1, and the length of `ans`, followed by each operation in `ans`.

The operations are represented as a tuple of three integers: the index of the first bit, the index of the second bit, and the value to be added to the first bit.

The output of the code will be the length of the binary representation of `L`, the number of operations, and the operations themselves.

<<<Output>>>
The output will depend on the input `L`. For example, if `L` is 4, the binary representation of `L` is '100', and the length of this representation is 3. The output will be:

```
3 12
1 2 4
1 2 0
2 3 4
2 3 0
3 1 4
3 1 0
1 2 4
1 2 0
2 3 4
2 3 0
```

This output means that the first operation flips the first bit and the second bit, the second operation sets the second bit to 0, and so on. The last two operations are repeated for the second bit.

Please note that the actual output will depend on the input `L`.
