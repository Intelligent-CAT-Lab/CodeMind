The output will depend on the input `L`. For example, if `L` is 4, the binary representation of `L` is '100', and the length of this representation is 3. The output will be:

```
3 12
1 2 4
1 2 0
2 3 4
2 3 0
3 1 4
3 1 0
1 2 4
1 2 0
2 3 4
2 3 0
```

This output means that the first operation flips the first bit and the second bit, the second operation sets the second bit to 0, and so on. The last two operations are repeated for the second bit.

Please note that the actual output will depend on the input `L`.
