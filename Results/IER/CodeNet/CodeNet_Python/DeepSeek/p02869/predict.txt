Based on the input `1 1`, the output of the code will be:

```
2 1 3
1 3 2
```

This is because the total number of elements that can be formed with the given N and K is not more than the total number of elements that can be formed with the given N and K+3N. Therefore, the code prints the calculated numbers a, b, and c for each element in the array.
