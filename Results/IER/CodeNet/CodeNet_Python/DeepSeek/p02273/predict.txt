The output of the code will depend on the value of `N`. For `N=1`, the output will be a single line segment from (0,0) to (100,0). For `N=2`, the output will be a Koch curve with four line segments, and so on. The exact output will depend on the specific implementation of the `koch` function and the `rot` method of the `Vector` class.

Please note that the actual output of the code will depend on the specific implementation of the `koch` function and the `rot` method of the `Vector` class. The output format and content will depend on the input values of `N` and the specific implementation of the `koch` function.
