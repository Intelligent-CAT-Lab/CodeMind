### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
code = raw_input()
code = code.replace(",","")
code = code.replace(".","")
code = code.split()
	
list = []
	
for var in code:
	if len(var) >= 3 and len(var) <= 6:
		list.append(var)
			
for var in list:
	print var,
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `Rain, rain, go to Spain.`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The given code takes a string as input, removes all commas and periods, splits the string into a list of words, and then filters out words that are 3 to 6 characters long. The filtered words are then printed out.

Let's consider the input string `Rain, rain, go to Spain.`.

1. The input string is read and stored in the variable `code`.
2. All commas and periods in `code` are replaced with nothing, effectively removing them.
3. The resulting string is then split into a list of words, with each word being a separate element in the list.
4. An empty list `list` is initialized.
5. For each word `var` in the list `code`, if the length of `var` is between 3 and 6 (inclusive), it is added to the list `list`.
6. Finally, for each word `var` in the list `list`, it is printed out.

The output of the code would be the words `Rain`, `rain`, `go`, `to`, `Spain`, as they are the only words in the input string that are 3 to 6 characters long.

<<<Output>>>
Rain rain go to Spain
