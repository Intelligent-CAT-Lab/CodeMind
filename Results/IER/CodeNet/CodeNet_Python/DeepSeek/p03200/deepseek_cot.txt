### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
s = input()

cnt = 0
l = 0

for i in range(len(s)):
    if s[i] == 'W':
        cnt += i-l
        l += 1

print(cnt)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `BBW`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response:
<<<Analysis>>>
The given code takes a string input `s` and counts the number of times 'W' appears in the string. The count starts from 0 and increases by 1 for each 'W' found in the string. The position of 'W' in the string is considered.

The code works as follows:

1. It initializes two variables, `cnt` and `l`, to 0. `cnt` is used to keep track of the total count of 'W's and `l` is used to keep track of the position of the last 'W' found in the string.

2. It then enters a loop that iterates over the length of the string `s`.

3. Inside the loop, it checks if the current character in the string is 'W'. If it is, it adds the difference between the current position `i` and the position of the last 'W' `l` to `cnt` and then increments `l` by 1.

4. After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of `cnt`, which is the total count of 'W's in the string.

Given the input `BBW`, the code will count the number of times 'W' appears in the string. In this case, there is 1 'W' at the third position, so the output will be 1.

<<<Output>>>
1
