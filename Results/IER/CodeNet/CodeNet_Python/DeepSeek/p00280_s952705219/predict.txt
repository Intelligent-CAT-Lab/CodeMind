The output of the code will depend on the input values `j` and `y`. The output will be a list of all possible sequences of "A"s and "B"s that can be generated from `j` "A"s and `y` "B"s, sorted in lexicographical order.

For example, if the input is `2 2`, the output will be:
```
AA
AB
BA
BB
```
This is because there are 4 possible sequences of "A"s and "B"s that can be generated from 2 "A"s and 2 "B"s.

Please note that the actual output will depend on the specific values of `j` and `y`.
