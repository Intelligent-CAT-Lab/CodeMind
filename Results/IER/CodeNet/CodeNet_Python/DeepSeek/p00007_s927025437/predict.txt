The output of the code will be the final rent after 5 years. However, the code is not correctly written as it tries to convert a string to an integer in the loop, which will raise a TypeError. The correct code should be:

```python
import math

n = int(input())
rent = 100000

for i in range(0, n):
  rent = math.ceil(rent*1.05/1000)*1000

print("%d" % rent)
```

This corrected code will correctly calculate the final rent after `n` years.
