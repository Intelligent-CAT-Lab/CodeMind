### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
sknList = [300000, 200000, 100000]

x, y = map(int, input().split())

prize = 0

if x == 1 and y == 1 :
    prize += 400000

if x <= 3 :
    prize += sknList[x - 1]

if y <= 3 :
    prize += sknList[y - 1]

print(prize)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `1 1`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The code first initializes a list `sknList` with three elements, each representing the prize for a specific number of skiers. The list is `[300000, 200000, 100000]`.

The code then takes two integers `x` and `y` as input from the user. These are separated by a space and are converted to integers using the `map` function.

The variable `prize` is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the total prize.

The code then checks if `x` and `y` are both 1. If so, it adds 400000 to the prize.

Next, the code checks if `x` or `y` is less than or equal to 3. If so, it adds the corresponding element from `sknList` to the prize. For example, if `x` is 1, it adds `sknList[0]` (which is 300000) to the prize.

Finally, the code prints the total prize.

Given the input `1 1`, `x` is 1 and `y` is 1. The code adds 400000 to the prize because `x` and `y` are both 1. The code then adds `sknList[0]` (which is 300000) to the prize because `x` is 1. The total prize is 400000 + 300000 = 700000.

<<<Output>>>
700000
