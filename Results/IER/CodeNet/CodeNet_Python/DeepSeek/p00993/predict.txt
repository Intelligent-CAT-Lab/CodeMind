The first code snippet calculates the product of all integers from 1 to 1500 and adds 2 to the result. The `reduce` function is used to apply a function of two arguments cumulatively to the items of iterable, from left to right, so as to reduce the iterable to a single output. The `lambda` function is an anonymous function that is used to create a function on the fly.

The second code snippet takes an input `n` and prints numbers from 1 to `n` each on a new line.

The given input `2` is passed to the second code snippet.

The output of the code would be:
1
2
3
