### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
n = int(input())
c = 0
c += n//25
n %= 25
c += n//10
n %= 10
c += n//5
c += n%5
print(c)

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `100`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response:
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to the input number.
The variable c is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of coins.
The code first calculates the number of 25-cent coins that can be used to pay the remaining amount and adds this number to c. The remaining amount is calculated by n modulo 25.
The code then calculates the number of 10-cent coins that can be used to pay the remaining amount and adds this number to c. The remaining amount is calculated by n modulo 10.
The code then calculates the number of 5-cent coins that can be used to pay the remaining amount and adds this number to c. The remaining amount is calculated by n modulo 5.
Finally, the code adds the remaining amount to c, which is the number of 1-cent coins.
After all these operations, the code prints the final value of c, which is the minimum number of coins needed to pay the given amount.

<<<Output>>>
4
