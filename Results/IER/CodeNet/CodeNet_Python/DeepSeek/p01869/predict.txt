The code you provided is a Python program that calculates the minimum number of perfect squares that sum up to a given number. The input to the program is a single integer n.

Here's how the code works:

1. The function `f` is defined. This function generates all binary numbers that are less than or equal to `n`. It does this by recursively calling itself with different arguments. The base case for the recursion is when `bin` is greater than `n`. If `bin` is not zero, it adds `bin` to the list `a`.

2. The function `g` is defined. This function calculates the minimum number of perfect squares that sum up to `n`. It does this by recursively calling itself with different arguments. The base case for the recursion is when `a[p]` squared is greater than `n`. If `n` is divisible by `a[p]`, it recursively calls itself with `n` divided by `a[p]` and the same `p`. The result is the maximum of the current result and the result of the recursive call.

3. The input number `n` is read from the user. If `n` is odd, the program prints `-1` and exits.

4. The function `f` is called with `a`, `0`, and `n` as arguments. This generates all binary numbers that are less than or equal to `n`.

5. The list `a` is sorted.

6. The function `g` is called with `n` and `0` as arguments. This calculates the minimum number of perfect squares that sum up to `n`.

7. If the result is less than `0`, it is set to `-1`.

8. The result is printed.

Given the input `1`, the output of the program would be `-1` because `1` is an odd number.

Here's the output:

```python
1
-1
```

This output indicates that the input number `1` is an odd number, so the program prints `-1` and exits.
