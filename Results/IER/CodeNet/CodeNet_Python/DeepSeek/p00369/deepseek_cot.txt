### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sub(maxs, mins):
    for i in range(len(maxs)):
        if maxs[i] != mins[i]:
            if i == len(maxs)-1:
                return int(maxs[i]) - int(mins[i])
            if i == len(maxs)-2:
                return int(maxs[i:i+2]) - int(mins[i:i+2])
            return 10
    return 0

def checkEqual(S):
    ans = 8
    for k in range(1, len(S)):
        if len(S)%k != 0: continue
        mins = maxs = S[0:k]
        for s in range(0, len(S), k):
            maxs = max(maxs, S[s:s+k])
            mins = min(mins, S[s:s+k])
        ans = min(ans, sub(maxs, mins))

    return ans

def check12(S):
    maxv = 0
    minv = 10
    p = 0
    while p < len(S):
        v = int(S[p])
        if  S[p] == '1' and p+1 < len(S):
            v = 10 + int(S[p+1])
            p += 1
        maxv = max(maxv, v)
        minv = min(minv, v)
        p += 1
    return maxv - minv

S = input()
print(min(checkEqual(S), check12(S)))

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `11121314`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The given Python code consists of three functions: `sub`, `checkEqual`, and `check12`. The main function takes an input string `S`, and then it calls the `checkEqual` and `check12` functions on `S`, and then it prints the minimum of the results.

The `sub` function takes two strings `maxs` and `mins`, and returns the difference between the maximum and minimum values in these strings.

The `checkEqual` function takes a string `S`, and returns the minimum difference found by dividing `S` into substrings of equal length and comparing the maximum and minimum values of each substring.

The `check12` function takes a string `S`, and returns the difference between the maximum and minimum values in `S`. If `S` contains '1', it interprets the next digit as a part of the number.

The main function reads an input string `S`, and then it calls the `checkEqual` and `check12` functions on `S`, and then it prints the minimum of the results.

Given the input `11121314`, the output of the code will be the minimum of the results returned by the `checkEqual` and `check12` functions.

The `checkEqual` function will divide `11121314` into substrings of equal length and compare the maximum and minimum values of each substring. The `check12` function will compare the maximum and minimum values in `11121314`.

The `checkEqual` function will return 0, because `11121314` can be divided into substrings of equal length (`1112`, `1314`), and the maximum and minimum values of each substring are the same.

The `check12` function will return 10, because the maximum value in `11121314` is 14, and the minimum value is 11. The difference is 10.

So, the output of the code will be 10.

10
