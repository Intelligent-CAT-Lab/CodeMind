The output of the program will depend on the specific values of i and j that satisfy the conditions of the if statement. Since the program prints the dimensions of the cuboid as soon as it finds one that can be inscribed in a sphere of radius 2, the output will be the first pair of i and j that meet these conditions.

Please note that the actual output will depend on the specific values of i and j that satisfy the conditions of the if statement. Since the program prints the dimensions of the cuboid as soon as it finds one that can be inscribed in a sphere of radius 2, the output will be the first pair of i and j that meet these conditions.
