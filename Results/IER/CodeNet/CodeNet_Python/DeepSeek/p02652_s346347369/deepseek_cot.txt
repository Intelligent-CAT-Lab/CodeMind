### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
from itertools import accumulate

S = input()
N = len(S)

A = [0] + list(accumulate(1 if s == "1" else -1 for s in S))

ma = max(A)
cur = A[-1]
C = [ma - cur]
for a in reversed(A):
    cur = max(a, cur)
    C.append(ma - cur)

d, e = 0, 0
D, E = A[:], A[:]
for i, (s, c) in enumerate(zip(S, reversed(C[:-1])), 1):
    if s == '?' and c >= d + 2:
        d += 2
    if s == '?' and c >= e + 1:
        e += 2
    D[i] += d
    E[i] += e

print(min(max(D) - min(D), max(E) - min(E)))
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `0??`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The input string `0??` is given to the code. The code first calculates the prefix sum array `A` for the string `S`. The prefix sum array `A` is a list where the i-th element is the sum of the first i elements of `S`. 

The code then calculates the array `C` which is the difference between the maximum prefix sum and the current prefix sum. The maximum prefix sum is calculated by finding the maximum value in `A` and subtracting the current prefix sum from it.

The code then iterates over the string `S` and the array `C` in reverse order. If the current character in `S` is '?' and the corresponding element in `C` is greater than or equal to `d + 2`, `d` is incremented by 2. If the current character in `S` is '?' and the corresponding element in `C` is greater than or equal to `e + 1`, `e` is incremented by 2. The current prefix sum in `A` is then incremented by `d` or `e` depending on the case.

Finally, the code prints the minimum of the maximum difference between the minimum and maximum values in `D` and `E`.

<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will depend on the input string `S`. In this case, the input string is `0??`. The output will be the minimum of the maximum difference between the minimum and maximum values in `D` and `E`.

Please note that the actual output will depend on the specific values of `d` and `e`, which are determined by the conditions in the code.
