### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
from itertools import product
S = input()

for string in product(["+","-"],repeat = 3):
    string = list(string)
    string.append("")
    sum_ = [a + b for a,b in zip(S,string)]
    if eval("".join(sum_)) == 7:
        print("".join(sum_)+"=7")
        break
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `1222`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The given code is a Python program that takes a string of numbers as input and generates all possible combinations of three symbols (+ or -) to insert between the numbers. It then evaluates the resulting expression and checks if it equals 7. If it does, it prints the expression and stops.

The input string S is taken as a string of numbers. The itertools.product function is used to generate all possible combinations of "+" and "-" symbols, with repetition of 3. This results in a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a possible combination of three symbols.

For each combination, the program creates a new list where each number in S is paired with a symbol from the current combination. The zip function is used to pair the numbers and symbols. The resulting list of strings is then evaluated using the eval function. If the result equals 7, the program prints the resulting expression and stops.

The output of the program will be the first expression that equals 7, or a message indicating that no such expression exists.

Given the input "1222", the program will generate the following expressions:
1+2+2+2
1+2+2-2
1+2-2+2
1+2-2-2
1-2+2+2
1-2+2-2
1-2-2+2
1-2-2-2
2+2+2+1
2+2+2-1
2+2-2+1
2+2-2-1
2-2+2+1
2-2+2-1
2-2-2+1
2-2-2-1

The program will then evaluate each expression and print the first one that equals 7. If no such expression exists, it will print a message indicating that no such expression exists.

The output of the program will depend on the specific input string and the possible combinations of symbols.
