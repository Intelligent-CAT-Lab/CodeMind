### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
#AGC029A https://atcoder.jp/contests/agc029/tasks/agc029_a
import sys
#import collections

#n= int(input())
#s= input()
#tmp = input().split()
#n,m = list(map(lambda a: int(a), tmp))
s= input()

n=len(s)

cnt=0
total=0
for i in range(0,n):
	if(s[i]=="B"):
		cnt+=1
	else:
		total+=cnt
print(total)

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `BBW`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The given code is an implementation of a simple algorithm to solve a problem from the AtCoder Beginner Contest (ABC) 29. The problem is about counting the number of "B"s that appear before each "W" in a string.

The code starts by reading a string `s` from the input. The length of the string `s` is stored in the variable `n`.

The code then initializes two variables, `cnt` and `total`, to 0. `cnt` is used to count the number of "B"s encountered so far, and `total` is used to accumulate the total number of "B"s that appear before each "W".

The code then enters a loop that iterates over each character in the string `s`. If the current character is "B", it increments `cnt`. If the current character is "W", it adds `cnt` to `total`.

After the loop finishes, the code prints the value of `total`, which is the total number of "B"s that appear before each "W".

Given the input `BBW`, the code will output 2, because there are 2 "B"s before the first "W".
<<<Output>>>
2

```python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
#AGC029A https://atcoder.jp/contests/agc029/tasks/agc029_a
import sys
#import collections

#n= int(input())
#s= input()
#tmp = input().split()
#n,m = list(map(lambda a: int(a), tmp))
s= input()

n=len(s)

cnt=0
total=0
for i in range(0,n):
	if(s[i]=="B"):
		cnt+=1
	else:
		total+=cnt
print(total)
```

This code will output 2 for the input `BBW`.
