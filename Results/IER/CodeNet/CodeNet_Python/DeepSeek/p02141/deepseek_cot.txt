### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def inpl(): return list(map(int, input().split()))
W, H, w, h, x, y = inpl()

a = (min(W//2 , x + w//2) + max(-W//2, x-w//2))
b = (min(H//2 , y + h//2) + max(-H//2, y-h//2))
print(b/a)

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `6000 5000 20 10 400 300`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in six parameters: W, H, w, h, x, y.

W and H are the width and height of the screen.
w and h are the width and height of the window.
x and y are the coordinates of the window's top left corner.

The code calculates the ratio of the area of the window to the area of the screen.

The area of the window is w*h.
The area of the screen is W*H.

The code first calculates the maximum and minimum values for the x and y coordinates of the window.

For x, it calculates the maximum value as the minimum of W//2 and x + w//2, and the minimum value as the maximum of -W//2 and x - w//2.
For y, it calculates the maximum value as the minimum of H//2 and y + h//2, and the minimum value as the maximum of -H//2 and y - h//2.

The code then prints the ratio of the area of the window to the area of the screen.

The area of the window is (max(x, W//2) - min(x - w//2, -W//2)) * (max(y, H//2) - min(y - h//2, -H//2)).
The area of the screen is W*H.

So the ratio is (max(x, W//2) - min(x - w//2, -W//2)) / (max(y, H//2) - min(y - h//2, -H//2)) / (W*H).

The code then prints this ratio.

The output of the code will be the ratio of the area of the window to the area of the screen.

<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will be the ratio of the area of the window to the area of the screen.
