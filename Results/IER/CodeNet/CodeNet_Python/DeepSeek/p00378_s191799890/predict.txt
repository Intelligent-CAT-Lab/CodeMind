The output of the code will be the minimum of the three calculated values.

For the given input (180, 100, 2400), the output would be 1800.

This is because 2400 can be paid with 20 1000-yen bills (20*180=3600), 4 500-yen bills (4*100=400), and 400 yen (which is less than 1000-yen bills). The minimum of these three amounts is 3600, which is 1800 (1000-yen bills) + 400 (500-yen bills) + 0 (remaining yen).

So, the output of the code would be 1800.
