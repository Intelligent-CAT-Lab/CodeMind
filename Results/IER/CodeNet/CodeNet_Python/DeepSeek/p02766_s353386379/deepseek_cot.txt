### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def Base_10_to_n(X, n):
    if (int(X/n)):
        return Base_10_to_n(int(X/n), n)+str(X%n)
    return str(X%n)

N,K = input().split()
print(len(Base_10_to_n(int(N), int(K))))
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `11 2`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The given Python code is a function that converts a decimal number to a base n number. The function takes two inputs: the decimal number X and the base n.

The function works by recursively dividing X by n and converting the remainder to a string. The function continues to do this until X is less than n. The length of the resulting string is the length of the base n representation of X.

The inputs to the function are given by the variables N and K. N is the decimal number to be converted and K is the base to which N should be converted.

The function then prints the length of the base n representation of N.

In the given input `11 2`, N is 11 and K is 2.

The function will convert 11 from base 10 to base 2 and print the length of the resulting string, which is 4.

<<<Output>>>
4
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

The Python code to execute this would be:

```python
def Base_10_to_n(X, n):
    if (int(X/n)):
        return Base_10_to_n(int(X/n), n)+str(X%n)
    return str(X%n)

N,K = input().split()
print(len(Base_10_to_n(int(N), int(K))))
```

And the input would be:

```
11 2
```

The output would be:

```
4
```
