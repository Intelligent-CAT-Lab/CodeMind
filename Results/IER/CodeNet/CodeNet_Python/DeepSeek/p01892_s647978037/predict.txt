The output of the code will be the minimum difference between `a` and `b` that can be obtained by multiplying `a` with a number `k` and `b` with a number `l`, where `k` and `l` are between 1 and `n`.

For the input `19 30 3`, the output will be `1` because `1 * 30 - 19 = 1` is the minimum difference.
