The output will depend on the input string. The output will be the size of the encoded string. The size of the encoded string is calculated by multiplying the frequency of each character by the length of its Huffman code.

For the input string `abca`, the output will be the size of the encoded string. The exact size will depend on the frequencies of the characters in the string and the Huffman codes generated by the algorithm.

Please note that the actual output will depend on the specific implementation of the Huffman Coding algorithm and the frequencies of the characters in the input string.
