### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())
for i in range(2000):
    if i*(i-1)//2 == N:
        c = 1
        X = [[] for _ in range(i)]
        for j in range(i):
            for k in range(j+1, i):
                X[j].append(c)
                X[k].append(c)
                c += 1
        print("Yes")
        print(len(X))
        for x in X:
            print(len(x), *x)
        break
else:
    print("No")

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `3`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The input N is taken as 3.
The code then enters a loop that iterates 2000 times.
For each iteration i, it checks if the condition i*(i-1)//2 == N is met. This condition is true when i is 3.
If the condition is met, it creates a list X with i elements, each of which is a list itself.
For each j in the range of i, it appends c to X[j] and X[k] where k is in the range of j+1 to i. It also increments c by 1 after each append operation.
The code then prints "Yes", the length of X, and each element of X.
If the condition is not met for any i, it prints "No".

<<<Output>>>
Yes
3
2 1 1
2 1 1
2 1 1
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

In this case, the code prints "Yes" because the input N is 3 and the condition i*(i-1)//2 == N is met for i=3. The output lists the length of each sublist in X, which is 2, and the elements in each sublist, which are all 1s.

Please note that the code is generating a complete undirected graph with 3 nodes and each node is connected to every other node. The output shows the adjacency list representation of this graph.
