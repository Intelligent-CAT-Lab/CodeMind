### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
n, y = map(int, input().split())

flag = False
for i in range(n + 1):
    for j in range(n + 1 - i):
        res = y - 10000 * i - 5000 * j
        if res // 1000 == n - i - j:
            print(i, j, res // 1000)
            flag = True
            break
    if flag:
        break
else:
    print(-1, -1, -1)

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `9 45000`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n, variable y are initialized to 9 and 45000, respectively.
The flag is initialized to False, which will be used to check if the conditions are met.
The code then enters two nested loops. The outer loop iterates from 0 to n (inclusive), and the inner loop iterates from 0 to n - i (inclusive). This ensures that the number of 10000 yen coins, i, and 5000 yen coins, j, sum up to n.
For each combination of i and j, the code calculates the remaining amount res after subtracting the value of i 10000-yen coins and j 5000-yen coins from y.
The code checks if the remaining amount res is equal to the number of 10000 yen coins left, which is n - i - j. If it is, it prints the number of 10000 yen coins, 5000 yen coins and 1000 yen coins, and sets flag to True. Then it breaks the inner loop.
If the flag is still False after the outer loop finishes, it means no combination of coins meets the condition, so it prints -1, -1, -1.
<<<Output>>>
4 1 0
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

This means there are 4 10000 yen coins, 1 5000 yen coin and 0 1000 yen coins that sum up to 45000 yen.
