The output will depend on the input. If the month and year are both valid, it prints "AMBIGUOUS". If the month is valid but the year is not, it prints "MMYY". If the month and year are both not valid, it prints "NA". If the month is not valid but the year is valid, it prints "YYMM".

For the input `1905`, the month is 19 and the year is 05. Since the year is not valid (05 is not between 1 and 12), the code checks if the month is valid (19 is between 1 and 12). Since it is, the code prints "AMBIGUOUS".
