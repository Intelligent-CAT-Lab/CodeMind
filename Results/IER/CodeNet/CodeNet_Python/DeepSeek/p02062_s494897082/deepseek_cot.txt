### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}

<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import sys
sys.setrecursionlimit(2*10**5)
question = 1
AND = -1
OR = -2
left = -3
right = -4

tr = {'?': 1, '&': -1, '|': -2, '(': -3, ')': -4}

def evalor(L):
    if len(L) == 1:
        return L[0]
    x0, x1 = L[0]
    for i in range(1, len(L)):
        y0, y1 = L[i]
        x0, x1 = x0 + y0, min(x1, x0 + y1)
    return (x0, x1)

def push(f, s):
    if f and f[-1] == (AND, AND):
        f.pop()
        p = f.pop()
        return push(f, andeval(p, s))
    else:
        f.append(s)
        return f

def andeval(p, s):
    x0, x1 = p
    y0, y1 = s
    return (min(x0, x1 + y0), x1 + y1)
    

S = [tr[s] for s in input().strip()]
f = []
for s in S:
    if s == question:
        f = push(f, (s, s))
    elif s == AND or s == left:
        f.append((s, s))
    elif s == right:
        stack = []
        while f[-1] != (left, left):
            sp = f.pop()
            assert sp[0] > 0 and sp[1] > 0
            stack.append(sp)
        assert f.pop() == (left, left)
        push(f, evalor(stack[::-1]))
f = evalor(f)
print(*f)

### Response
The given Python code is a recursive parser for a simple logical expression. It uses a stack-based approach to parse the expression and evaluate it. The expression is represented as a string of characters, where each character represents a logical operator or a question mark.

The code starts by defining a dictionary `tr` that maps each character in the expression to an integer. The integer values are used to represent the logical operators and parentheses in the expression.

The function `evalor` is used to evaluate the expression. It takes a list of tuples as input, where each tuple represents a logical operation. The function returns a tuple that represents the minimum and maximum number of operations that can be performed on the expression.

The function `push` is used to push a new operation onto the stack. If the top of the stack is an AND operation, it pops the top two operations from the stack and pushes the result of the AND operation onto the stack. Otherwise, it simply pushes the new operation onto the stack.

The function `andeval` is used to evaluate an AND operation. It takes two tuples as input, each representing a logical operation, and returns a tuple that represents the result of the AND operation.

The main part of the code reads the expression from the input, converts it to a list of integers using the `tr` dictionary, and then evaluates the expression using the `push` and `andeval` functions. The result is printed as two integers.

Given the input `?&?|?&?|?&?`, the code will evaluate the expression and print the minimum and maximum number of operations that can be performed on the expression.

The output of the code will depend on the specifics of the input and the logic of the expression. The output will be a tuple of two integers, representing the minimum and maximum number of operations that can be performed on the expression.

Please note that the actual output of the code will depend on the specifics of the input and the logic of the expression. The output will be a tuple of two integers, representing the minimum and maximum number of operations that can be performed on the expression.
