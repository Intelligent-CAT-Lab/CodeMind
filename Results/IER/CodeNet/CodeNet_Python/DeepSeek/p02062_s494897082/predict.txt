The given Python code is a recursive parser for a simple logical expression. It uses a stack-based approach to parse the expression and evaluate it. The expression is represented as a string of characters, where each character represents a logical operator or a question mark.

The code starts by defining a dictionary `tr` that maps each character in the expression to an integer. The integer values are used to represent the logical operators and parentheses in the expression.

The function `evalor` is used to evaluate the expression. It takes a list of tuples as input, where each tuple represents a logical operation. The function returns a tuple that represents the minimum and maximum number of operations that can be performed on the expression.

The function `push` is used to push a new operation onto the stack. If the top of the stack is an AND operation, it pops the top two operations from the stack and pushes the result of the AND operation onto the stack. Otherwise, it simply pushes the new operation onto the stack.

The function `andeval` is used to evaluate an AND operation. It takes two tuples as input, each representing a logical operation, and returns a tuple that represents the result of the AND operation.

The main part of the code reads the expression from the input, converts it to a list of integers using the `tr` dictionary, and then evaluates the expression using the `push` and `andeval` functions. The result is printed as two integers.

Given the input `?&?|?&?|?&?`, the code will evaluate the expression and print the minimum and maximum number of operations that can be performed on the expression.

The output of the code will depend on the specifics of the input and the logic of the expression. The output will be a tuple of two integers, representing the minimum and maximum number of operations that can be performed on the expression.

Please note that the actual output of the code will depend on the specifics of the input and the logic of the expression. The output will be a tuple of two integers, representing the minimum and maximum number of operations that can be performed on the expression.
