The code first defines a function `gcd` to calculate the greatest common divisor of two numbers. Then it takes three inputs `H`, `W`, and `T` from the user. `H` and `W` are the height and width of the grid, and `T` is the number of times the grid is to be divided.

The code then calculates the greatest common divisor of `H` and `T`, and the greatest common divisor of `W` and `T`, and stores them in `gh` and `gw` respectively.

The height and width of the grid after division are calculated by dividing `H` and `W` by their respective greatest common divisors.

The code then calculates the result using the formula `(2^h + 2^w + 2^gcd(h, w) - 3)^(gh * gw) % MOD`. The `%` operator is used to get the remainder of the division. The result is then printed.
