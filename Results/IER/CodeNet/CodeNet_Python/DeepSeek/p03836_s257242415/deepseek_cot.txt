### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

def solve(sx, sy, tx, ty):
    first = "U"*(ty-sy)+"R"*(tx-sx)
    second = "D"*(ty-sy)+"L"*(tx-sx)
    third = "L"+"U"*(ty-sy+1)+"R"*(tx-sx+1)+"D"
    forth = "R"+"D"*(ty-sy+1)+"L"*(tx-sx+1)+"U"
    
    print(first+second+third+forth)
    
if __name__ == '__main__': 
    sx, sy, tx, ty = map(int, input().split())
    
    solve(sx, sy, tx, ty)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `0 0 1 2`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The code is a function `solve` that takes four parameters: `sx`, `sy`, `tx`, and `ty`. `sx` and `sy` represent the starting coordinates, and `tx` and `ty` represent the target coordinates. The function is supposed to return a string that represents the sequence of movements from the starting point to the target point.

The function works by first calculating the number of movements in the x and y directions separately. Then, it constructs four strings: `first`, `second`, `third`, and `forth`. These strings represent the movements in the order they are needed to reach the target point from the starting point.

The `first` string represents moving up `ty-sy` times and then moving right `tx-sx` times. The `second` string represents moving down `ty-sy` times and then moving left `tx-sx` times. The `third` string represents moving left once, then moving up `ty-sy+1` times, moving right `tx-sx+1` times, and finally moving down once. The `forth` string represents moving right once, then moving down `ty-sy+1` times, moving left `tx-sx+1` times, and finally moving up once.

Finally, the function prints the concatenation of all four strings.

Given the input `0 0 1 2`, the function calculates that it needs to move right once, then move down `2` times, move left `1` time, and finally move up once to reach the target point. Therefore, the output of the function should be `"RDUL"`.

<<<Output>>>
"RDUL"
