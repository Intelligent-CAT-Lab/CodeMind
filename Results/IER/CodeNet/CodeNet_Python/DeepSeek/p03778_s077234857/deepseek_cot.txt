### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import sys
W,a,b = map(int,input().split())
if W < 0 or W > 100000:
    sys.exit()
if a < 0 or a > 100000:
    sys.exit()
if b < 0 or b > 100000:
    sys.exit()

move = 0
if W + a < b:
    move = b - (W + a)
if W + a > b and W + a < W + b:
    move = 0
if a > b and a < W + b:
    move = 0
if a > W + b and W + a > W + b:
    move = a - (W + b)
print(move)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `3 2 6`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable W, variable a and variable b are initialized to 3, 2 and 6, respectively.
The code then checks if the input values are within the range [0, 100000]. If any of the values are not within this range, the program will terminate.
The code then calculates the total weight of the two boxes (W + a) and compares it to the weight limit of the third box (b). If the total weight of the two boxes is less than the weight limit of the third box, the difference between the weight limit of the third box and the total weight of the two boxes is stored in the variable move.
If the weight of box a is greater than box b and the total weight of the two boxes is less than the weight limit of the third box, the variable move is set to 0.
If the weight of box a is greater than the total weight of the two boxes and the weight of box a is greater than the weight limit of the third box, the difference between the weight of box a and the total weight of the two boxes plus the weight limit of the third box is stored in the variable move.
After all the conditions are checked, the code prints the value of the variable move.
<<<Output>>>
3
