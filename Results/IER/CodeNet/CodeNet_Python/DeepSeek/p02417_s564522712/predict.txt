The output will be a list of characters and their counts in the input string. The counts are case-insensitive, meaning that both uppercase and lowercase letters are counted.

For example, for the character 't', it appears twice in the string, so the output will be:
```
t : 2
```

For the character 'h', it appears once in the string, so the output will be:
```
h : 1
```

And so on for all characters in the string.

The output will be in alphabetical order based on the ASCII value of the characters.
