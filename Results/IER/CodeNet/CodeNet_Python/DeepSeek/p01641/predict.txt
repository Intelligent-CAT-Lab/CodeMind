The output of the code will depend on the input string `s`. For the input `s = 'ABC'`, the output will be a string of operations that correspond to the ASCII values of the characters in the string.

For example, the ASCII values of 'A', 'B', and 'C' are 65, 66, and 67 respectively. So the output of the code will be a string of operations that correspond to these ASCII values.

Please note that the actual output will depend on the specific operations performed by the code and the input string.
