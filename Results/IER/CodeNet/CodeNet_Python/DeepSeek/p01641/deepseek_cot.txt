### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import math

s = raw_input()

memory = [i for i in range(30, 121, 10)]
r = ''
r += ''.join(['+'*i+'>' for i in range(30, 121, 10)])
r += '<' * 10

point = 0
for c in s:
    c = ord(c)
    n = c / 10 - 3
    d = int(math.fabs(point - n))
    if point < n:
        r += '>' * d
    else:
        r += '<' * d
    point = n

    l = int(math.fabs(memory[point] - c))
    if memory[point] < c:
        r += '+' * l
    else:
        r += '-' * l
    memory[point] = c

    r += '.'

print r
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `ABC`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string input `s`, and for each character in the string, it performs a series of operations to generate a string output `r`.

First, it initializes a list `memory` with numbers from 30 to 120 in steps of 10.

Then, it initializes a string `r` with a series of '+' and '>' symbols. The '+' symbols represent the '+' operation, and the '>' symbols represent the '>' operation.

The '+' operation increases the value of the memory cell pointed to by the pointer, and the '>' operation moves the pointer to the right.

The code then iterates over each character in the string `s`. For each character, it calculates the corresponding memory cell by dividing the ASCII value of the character by 10 and subtracting 3. It then calculates the distance to the current memory cell and moves the pointer to that cell.

If the ASCII value of the character is greater than the value of the current memory cell, it performs a '+' operation to increase the value of the memory cell. Otherwise, it performs a '-' operation to decrease the value of the memory cell.

Finally, it adds a '.' to the end of the string `r` to represent the end of a command.

The output of the code will be the string `r`, which represents the series of operations performed by the code.

<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will depend on the input string `s`. For the input `s = 'ABC'`, the output will be a string of operations that correspond to the ASCII values of the characters in the string.

For example, the ASCII values of 'A', 'B', and 'C' are 65, 66, and 67 respectively. So the output of the code will be a string of operations that correspond to these ASCII values.

Please note that the actual output will depend on the specific operations performed by the code and the input string.
