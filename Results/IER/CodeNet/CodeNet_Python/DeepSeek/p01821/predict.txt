The code takes an integer input N and calculates the smallest positive integer k such that N^k is congruent to 1 modulo the Carmichael function of N. The Carmichael function of N is the smallest positive integer m such that a^m is congruent to 1 modulo N for all integers a relatively prime to N.

The code first calculates the Carmichael function of N using the `carmichael` function. Then it calculates the smallest positive integer k such that N^k is congruent to 1 modulo the Carmichael function of N using the `solve` function. If k is -1 or N^k is not congruent to 1 modulo the Carmichael function of N, the code prints -1. Otherwise, the code prints k.

The `carmichael` function calculates the Carmichael function of N by first calculating the least common multiple (LCM) of all pairs of numbers (y-1)*y^(c-1) where y is a divisor of N and c is the number of times y divides N. The `solve` function calculates the smallest positive integer k such that N^k is congruent to 1 modulo c.

The code first calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of all pairs of numbers (y-1)*y^(c-1) where y is a divisor of N and c is the number of times y divides N.
