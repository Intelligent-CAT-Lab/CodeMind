### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>

<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}

[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
mod = 10**9+7
rng = 2000100
fctr = [1]+[0]*(rng-1)
for i in range(1,rng):
  fctr[i] = fctr[i-1]*i%mod
def finv(x):
  return pow(fctr[x],mod-2,mod)
def cmb(n,k):
  if n<0 or k<0:
    return 0
  else:
    return fctr[n]*finv(n-k)*finv(k)%mod

x1,y1,x2,y2 = map(int,input().split())
print((cmb(x2+y2+2,x2+1)-cmb(x2+y1+1,y1)-cmb(x1+y2+1,x1)+cmb(x1+y1,x1))%mod)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `1 1 2 2`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

<<<Output>>>

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The code first calculates the factorial of numbers from 1 to 2000100 and stores them in the list `fctr`. The factorial of a number `n` is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to `n`. The factorial of 0 is defined to be 1. The factorial of a negative number is undefined.

The function `finv(x)` calculates the modular multiplicative inverse of `x`. The modular multiplicative inverse of a number `x` under modulo `m` is a number `y` such that `(x*y) % m = 1`.

The function `cmb(n, k)` calculates the combination of `n` items taken `k` at a time. The combination of `n` items taken `k` at a time is the number of ways to choose `k` items from `n` items without regard to the order of selection.

The code then takes four integers as input `x1, y1, x2, y2`. These represent the number of ways to choose `x1` items from `x2+y2+2` items, `x1` items from `x2+y1+1` items, `x1` items from `x1+y2+1` items, and `x1` items from `x1+y1` items respectively. The code then prints the result of these calculations modulo `10**9+7`.

The result of the code execution for the input `1 1 2 2` is calculated as follows:

1. The number of ways to choose 1 item from 4 items is `cmb(4, 1) = 4`.
2. The number of ways to choose 1 item from 3 items is `cmb(3, 1) = 3`.
3. The number of ways to choose 2 items from 3 items is `cmb(3, 2) = 3`.
4. The number of ways to choose 1 item from 2 items is `cmb(2, 1) = 2`.

The final result is `(4*3*3*2 - 3*2*2 - 3*3*2 + 2*2) % (10**9+7)`.

<<<Output>>>
The output of the code execution for the input `1 1 2 2` is `12`.
