### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
s = input()
def solve(s):
    n = len(s)
    for i in range(1,n):
        if s[i-1] == s[i]:
            print(i,i+1)
            return
    for i in range(2,n):
        if s[i-2] == s[i]:
            print(i-1,i+1)
            return
    print(-1,-1)
    return
solve(s)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `needed`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The given code is a Python function that takes a string as input and tries to find two adjacent characters in the string that are the same. If it finds such a pair, it prints the indices of these characters and returns. If it doesn't find any such pair, it prints (-1, -1) and returns.

The input string is taken as the first line of input.

Let's consider the input string `s = 'needed'`.

The first loop checks for adjacent characters that are the same. In the string `'needed'`, there are no adjacent characters that are the same.

The second loop checks for two characters that are the same, separated by two other characters. In the string `'needed'`, there are no two characters that are the same, separated by two other characters.

So, the function prints (-1, -1) and returns, indicating that there are no adjacent or separated pairs of the same characters in the string.

<<<Output>>>
(-1, -1)
