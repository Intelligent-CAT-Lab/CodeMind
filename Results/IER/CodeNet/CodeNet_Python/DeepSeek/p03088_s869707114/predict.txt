The output of the code will depend on the value of `n`. It is a combinatorial problem and the number of valid combinations grows very quickly as `n` increases. Therefore, the output will be very large and may not fit into a standard integer type.

Please note that the actual output of the code will depend on the input value of `n`. The code is not capable of providing an output for arbitrary `n`.
