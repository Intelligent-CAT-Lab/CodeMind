The output of the code will depend on the prime factors of the numbers from 2 to 9 and the counts of these factors. Since the input is 9, the prime factors of the numbers from 2 to 9 are:

2: 74 times
3: 24 times
5: 14 times
7: 4 times

The code then calculates the number of pairs of numbers that have a certain property based on the counts and prints the final value of ans.

Please note that the actual output of the code will depend on the specific prime factors and counts of the numbers from 2 to 9.
