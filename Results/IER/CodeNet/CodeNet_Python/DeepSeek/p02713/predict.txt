The output of the code will depend on the values of a, b, and c for each combination. However, since K=2, the combinations are (1,1,1), (1,1,2), (1,2,1), (1,2,2), (2,1,1), (2,1,2), (2,2,1), and (2,2,2). The greatest common divisors of these combinations are 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, and 2, respectively. The sum of these values is 15.
So, the output of the code will be 15.
