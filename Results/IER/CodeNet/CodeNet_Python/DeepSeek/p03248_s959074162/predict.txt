The output of the program will depend on the input string S. If S is a palindrome, the program will print the edges of a tree that represents the binary string S. Each line of the output will contain two integers, representing an edge in the tree.

If S is not a palindrome, the program will print -1.

For example, if the input string S is '1111', the program will print the edges of a tree that represents the binary string S. Each line of the output will contain two integers, representing an edge in the tree.

Note: The output format is not specified in the problem statement, so the actual output format may vary.
