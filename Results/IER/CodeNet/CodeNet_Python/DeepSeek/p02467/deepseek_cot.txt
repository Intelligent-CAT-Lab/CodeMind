### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import sys
from math import sqrt

def solve():
    n = int(input())

    print('{}: '.format(n), end='')
    print(*prime_factorization(n))

def prime_factorization(n):
    if n < 2:
        return [n]

    res = []
    lim = int(sqrt(n))

    for p in range(2, lim + 1):
        while n % p == 0:
            res.append(p)
            n //= p

    if n > 1:
        res.append(n)

    return res

if __name__ == '__main__':
    solve()
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `12`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The given code is a Python program that calculates the prime factorization of a given number. The prime factorization of a number is the representation of that number as a product of prime numbers.

The function `prime_factorization(n)` takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list of prime factors of `n`. If `n` is less than 2, it returns `n` itself.

The function `solve()` takes no input and asks the user for a number. It then calls `prime_factorization(n)` with the user's input and prints the result.

When the user inputs `12`, the program will calculate the prime factors of `12`.

The prime factorization of `12` is `2 * 2 * 3`.

So, the output of the program will be `12: 2 2 3`.

<<<Output>>>
12: 2 2 3
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

Note: The output is based on the analysis provided. The actual output of the code execution will depend on the Python interpreter used to run the code.
