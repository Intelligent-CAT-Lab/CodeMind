I'm sorry, but as an AI, I'm not able to execute Python code. However, I can provide you with an analysis of the code you provided.

The code you provided is a Python program that generates a string representation of a number using the "+", "-" and "0" symbols. The number is generated by using a recursive function that iteratively adds, subtracts or leaves a digit at zero.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the code:

1. The program starts by defining some constants and global variables. These include the maximum digit length (SIZE), a list of powers of 3 (POW), and the input number W.

2. The program then calculates the maximum digit length that can be used to represent W using the formula (POW[i]-1)//2 >= W.

3. The program initializes two lists, ans and work, to store the final result and the intermediate result respectively.

4. The recursive function recursive(digit, tmp_sum) is defined. This function takes two arguments: the current digit and the current sum. It uses a recursive approach to generate all possible combinations of "+", "-" and "0" symbols.

5. The function first checks if the current digit is -1. If it is, it checks if the current sum is equal to W. If it is, it copies the current work to the ans list.

6. If the current digit is not -1, the function tries three options: adding 0 to the current sum, adding POW[digit] to the current sum, and subtracting POW[digit] from the current sum.

7. After the recursive function is defined, the program calls it with the maximum digit length and 0 as the initial arguments.

8. Finally, the program prints the result stored in the ans list.

Given the input `25`, the output of the code would be a string representation of the number 25 using the "+", "-" and "0" symbols.

Please note that to execute the code, you would need to run it in a Python environment.
