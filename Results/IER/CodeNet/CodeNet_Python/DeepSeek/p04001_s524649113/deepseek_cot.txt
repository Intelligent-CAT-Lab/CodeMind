### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
class Formula():
    def __init__(self, S):
        self.input = S
        self.sum = 0
        self.input_len = len(S)

        self.input_split_pos = self.input_len - 1
        self.mask = 2**self.input_split_pos - 1

    def calc_sum(self, S: str, split_pos: int) -> int:
        stack = []
        split_pos = [i for i, x in enumerate(
            [int(x) for x in bin(split_pos)[2:].zfill(self.input_split_pos)]) if x == 1]

        start = 0
        if split_pos == []:
            stack.append(int(self.input))
        else:
            for i in split_pos:
                stack.append(int(self.input[start:i + 1]))
                start = i + 1
            stack.append(int(self.input[start:self.input_len]))
        self.sum += sum(stack)
        return self.sum


def main():
    S = input()
    formula = Formula(S)

    bits = 0b0

    while bits <= formula.mask:
        formula.calc_sum(S, bits & formula.mask)
        bits += 1
    print(formula.sum)


main()

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `125`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>

### Response:
<<<Analysis>>>
The input given is `125`. The code is a bit complex, but it's essentially a loop that calculates the sum of all possible sub-strings of the input number.

The `Formula` class is initialized with the input number `S`. The `calc_sum` method calculates the sum of all possible sub-strings of `S`. The `main` function creates an instance of the `Formula` class, and then loops through all possible bit masks of the input number. For each mask, it calculates the sum of all possible sub-strings of `S` using the `calc_sum` method. The sum of all these sums is then printed.

The bit mask is a binary number that determines which parts of the input number to include in the sum. For example, if the input number is `125`, and the bit mask is `011`, the sum includes the sub-strings `1`, `2`, and `5`.

The `calc_sum` method works by splitting the input number into sub-strings at each bit position where the mask bit is `1`. It then converts each sub-string to an integer and adds them together.

The loop continues until all possible bit masks have been used.

The output of the code will be the sum of all possible sub-strings of the input number.

<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will be the sum of all possible sub-strings of the input number `125`.

Please note that the output of the code will be different based on the input. The code is designed to calculate the sum of all possible sub-strings of the input number, which can be quite large for large input numbers.
