The output will be a list of all possible subsets of a set of size 4. Each subset is represented as a string of space-separated integers, where each integer is an element of the subset. The subsets are enumerated starting from 0.

For example, the output for the input `4` might look like this:

```
0: 0
1: 1
2: 0 1
3: 2
4: 0 2
5: 1 2
6: 0 1 2
7: 3
8: 0 3
9: 1 3
10: 0 1 3
11: 2 3
12: 0 2 3
13: 1 2 3
14: 0 1 2 3
```

This means that there are 15 subsets in total, and each subset is represented as a string of space-separated integers.
