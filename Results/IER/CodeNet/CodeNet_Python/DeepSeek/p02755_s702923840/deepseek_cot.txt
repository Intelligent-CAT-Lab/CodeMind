### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
a, b = map(int, input().split())
x = [0]*10
for i in range(10):
    x[i] = b*10 + i
#print(x)

for i in range(10):
    if a == int(x[i]*0.08):
        print(x[i])
        break
else:
    print(-1)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `2 2`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The given code takes two inputs a and b. The first input a is the amount of money that the person has, and the second input b is the number of digits in the number that the person wants to buy.

The first part of the code initializes an array x with 10 zeros. Then, it fills the array x with numbers that have b digits and are multiples of 10. The numbers are calculated as b*10 + i, where i is a number from 0 to 9.

The second part of the code iterates over the array x and checks if the 8% of the number in the array is equal to the input a. If it is, it prints the number and breaks the loop. If no number in the array satisfies the condition, it prints -1.

Given the input `2 2`, the code will calculate the numbers that have 2 digits and are multiples of 10. Then it will check if the 8% of the number is equal to 2. If it is, it will print the number and break the loop. If no number satisfies the condition, it will print -1.

<<<Output>>>
20
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

Note: The output is 20 because 20 is the first number in the range of numbers that have 2 digits and are multiples of 10. The 8% of 20 is 2, which is equal to the input 2.
