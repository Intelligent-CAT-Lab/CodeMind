### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
a, b = map(int, input().split())

tower_dis = b - a
b_height = tower_dis * (tower_dis + 1) // 2
ans = b_height - b

print(ans)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `8 13`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response:
<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, a and b, where a is the lower limit and b is the upper limit of a range. The code calculates the difference between b and a, which is stored in the variable tower_dis. This difference represents the distance between the two towers.

The code then calculates the height of the second tower (b_height) using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. The formula for the sum of an arithmetic series is n*(n+1)/2, where n is the number of terms. In this case, n is tower_dis. The code multiplies tower_dis by tower_dis + 1 and divides by 2 to get the sum of the first tower_dis numbers.

The code then subtracts b from b_height to get the height of the first tower. This is stored in the variable ans.

Finally, the code prints the value of ans, which is the height of the first tower.

Given the input `8 13`, the code calculates that the distance between the two towers is 13 - 8 = 5. It then calculates the height of the second tower as 5*(5+1)/2 = 15. The height of the first tower is then 15 - 13 = 2.

So, the output of the code would be 2.

<<<Output>>>
2
