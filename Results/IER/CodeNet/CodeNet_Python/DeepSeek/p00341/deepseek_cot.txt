### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
a=[0]*100
b=list(map(int,input().split()))
for i in range(12):
    a[b[i]-1]+=1
c=0
for i in range(100):
    if a[i] and a[i]%4==0: c+=a[i]//4
print('yes' if c==3 else 'no')
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `1 1 3 4 8 9 7 3 4 5 5 5`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The code first initializes an array `a` of size 100 with all elements set to 0. Then it reads an input of 12 integers from the user and stores them in the list `b`.

For each integer `i` in `b`, it increments the corresponding index in `a` by 1. For example, if `b[i]` is 3, it means that the 3rd element in `a` should be incremented by 1.

After that, it counts the number of times when the count of a number in `a` is a multiple of 4. If the count is 3, it prints 'yes', otherwise it prints 'no'.

The input `1 1 3 4 8 9 7 3 4 5 5 5` corresponds to the numbers 1, 1, 3, 4, 8, 9, 7, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5.

The counts of these numbers in `a` are as follows:
- The count of 1 is 2.
- The count of 3 is 2.
- The count of 4 is 2.
- The count of 5 is 3.

Since the count of 1, 3, and 4 is 2 and the count of 5 is 3, the output of the code should be 'no'.

<<<Output>>>
'no'

I hope this helps in understanding the code execution.
