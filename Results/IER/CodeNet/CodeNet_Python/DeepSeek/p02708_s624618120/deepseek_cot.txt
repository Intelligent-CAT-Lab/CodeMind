### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def coun(n,r):
    return n*r+1+r-r**2

def sigma(func,frm,too):
    result=0
    for i in range(frm,too+2):
        #print(i)
        result=result+func(too,i)
        #print(result)
    print(result%mod)

n,k=list(map(int,input().split()))
mod=10**9+7

sigma(coun,k,n)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `3 2`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The given Python code consists of two functions: `coun` and `sigma`.

The `coun` function takes two arguments, `n` and `r`, and returns the result of the expression `n*r+1+r-r**2`.

The `sigma` function takes three arguments: a function `func`, an integer `frm`, and an integer `too`. It calculates the sum of `func(too, i)` for `i` in the range from `frm` to `too` (inclusive). The result is then printed modulo `mod` (which is `10**9+7`).

The main part of the code reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, and then calls the `sigma` function with `coun` as the function argument and `k` and `n` as the range arguments.

Given the input `3 2`, the `n` is 3 and `k` is 2. The `sigma` function will sum the results of the `coun` function for `i` in the range from `k` to `n` (inclusive). The `coun` function will be called with `too` as 3 and `i` as 2, 3, and 4 (inclusive). The result of the `coun` function will be calculated for these values of `i` and added to the sum in the `sigma` function. The final result will be printed modulo `10**9+7`.

The `coun` function is defined as `n*r+1+r-r**2`, where `n` and `r` are the arguments. For `n` = 3 and `r` = 2, the result of the `coun` function will be `3*2+1+2-2**2 = 7`. For `n` = 3 and `r` = 3, the result of the `coun` function will be `3*3+1+3-3**2 = 13`. For `n` = 3 and `r` = 4, the result of the `coun` function will be `3*4+1+4-4**2 = 25`. The sum of these results is `7 + 13 + 25 = 45`. The final result will be `45 % (10**9+7) = 45`.

So, the output of the code execution for the input `3 2` is `45`.

<<<Output>>>
45
