The output will be a sequence of integers. The first two integers will be the number of nodes n and edges m. The remaining integers will be the edges of the tree.

For example, if the input is 4, the output will be:

```
3 5
1 2 0
1 2 1
2 3 2
2 3 3
```

This means that the tree has 3 nodes and 5 edges. The edges of the tree are (1, 2, 0), (1, 2, 1), (2, 3, 2), and (2, 3, 3).
