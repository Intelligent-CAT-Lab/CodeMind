### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import sys
from math import log2, floor

L = int(sys.stdin.readline().rstrip())

def main():
    n = floor(log2(L)) + 1
    m = 2 * (n - 1)
    edges = []
    for i in range(1, n):
        edges.append((i, i+1, 0))
        edges.append((i, i+1, 2**(i-1)))
    
    cur = 2 ** (n - 1)
    q = L - cur
    for i in range(1, n):
        q, r = divmod(q, 2)
        if not r:
            continue
        else:
            edges.append((i, n, cur))
            cur += 2 ** (i - 1)
            m += 1
    
    yield (n, m)
    for e in edges:
        yield e

if __name__ == '__main__':
    ans = main()
    for i in ans:
        print(*i, sep=' ')
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `4`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The input is an integer L. The code first calculates the number of nodes n and edges m for the tree. The number of nodes is calculated as the floor of the base-2 logarithm of L plus 1. The number of edges is calculated as twice the number of nodes minus 1.

The code then generates the edges of the tree. For each level i from 1 to n-1, it adds two edges: one from i to i+1 with weight 0 and one from i to i+1 with weight 2^(i-1).

After that, the code calculates the remaining quantity L - cur, where cur is the current quantity of the tree. If the remaining quantity is greater than 0, it adds an edge from the last level to the root of the tree with weight cur. The current quantity cur is then increased by 2^(i-1) and the number of edges m is increased by 1.

Finally, the code yields the number of nodes n and edges m and the edges of the tree.

The output of the code is the number of nodes n and edges m, followed by the edges of the tree.

<<<Output>>>
The output will be a sequence of integers. The first two integers will be the number of nodes n and edges m. The remaining integers will be the edges of the tree.

For example, if the input is 4, the output will be:

```
3 5
1 2 0
1 2 1
2 3 2
2 3 3
```

This means that the tree has 3 nodes and 5 edges. The edges of the tree are (1, 2, 0), (1, 2, 1), (2, 3, 2), and (2, 3, 3).
