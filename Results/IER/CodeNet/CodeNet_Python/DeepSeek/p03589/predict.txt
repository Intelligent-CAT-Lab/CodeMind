The output of the code will depend on the specific values of h, n, and w that satisfy both conditions. Since the input is 2, the program will find the first pair of h, n, and w that satisfy both conditions and print them.

Please note that the actual output will depend on the specific values of h, n, and w that satisfy both conditions. The values of h, n, and w that satisfy both conditions will be the smallest possible values.
