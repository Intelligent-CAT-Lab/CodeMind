I'm sorry, but as an AI, I'm not able to execute Python code. However, I can explain how the code works based on the provided input and output examples.

The provided code is a Python implementation of a specific algorithm. It takes an input `N`, and generates a sequence of numbers based on the algorithm. The output of the code is the length of the generated sequence and the sequence itself.

The algorithm works by first calculating the factorial of numbers up to 100. Then it uses these factorials to calculate combinations (C(a, b)) and sum of combinations (sC(a, b)). The algorithm then uses these combinations to generate the sequence.

The input `N` is used to determine the length of the sequence and the values in the sequence. The sequence is generated by iterating over the possible lengths of the sequence (from 1 to N), and for each length, it calculates the number of ways to choose elements from the sequence. The algorithm then adds the chosen elements to the sequence and continues with the remaining elements.

The output of the code will depend on the input `N`. The length of the sequence will be `N`, and the values in the sequence will be numbers from 1 to `N`.

I hope this helps in understanding how the code works and how it would generate the output for a given input.

Please note that to execute the code, you would need a Python environment and the ability to run Python code.
