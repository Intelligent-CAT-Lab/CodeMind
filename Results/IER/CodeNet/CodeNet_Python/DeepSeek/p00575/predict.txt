The output of the code will depend on the values of `A`, `B`, and `C`. However, given the input `3 0 10`, the output would be `3`.

This is because `A` is `3`, `B` is `0`, and `C` is `10`. The code calculates that it would take `3` weeks to earn `10` coins, which is the minimum number of weeks needed.
