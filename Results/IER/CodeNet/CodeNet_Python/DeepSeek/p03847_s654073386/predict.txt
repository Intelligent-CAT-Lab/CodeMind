The output of the code will depend on the input n. For n=3, the binary representation is '11'. The last digit is '1' so f[1] is set to 2 and g[1] is set to 6. The second last digit is '1' so f[2] is set to 2+6=8 and g[2] is set to 2*3+6=18. Since the length of nstr is 2, the code prints f[2] which is 8.

So, the output of the code for n=3 is 8.
