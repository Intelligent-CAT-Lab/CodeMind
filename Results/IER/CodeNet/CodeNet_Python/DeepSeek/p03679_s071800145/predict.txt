The output of the program will depend on the values of x, a, and b. If b is less than or equal to a, the output will be "delicious". If b is greater than a and the difference between b and a is less than or equal to x, the output will be "safe". If the difference between b and a is greater than x, the output will be "dangerous".

For the given input `4 3 6`, the output will be "dangerous" because 6 is greater than 3 and the difference between 6 and 3 is greater than 4.
