### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
n=int(input())
p=0
t=True
while p<26:
    r=n-(7*p)
    if r>=0 and r%4 ==0:
        t=False
        print("Yes")
        break
    p+=1
if t:
    print("No")

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `11`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable `n` is initialized to the input number.
The variable `p` is initialized to 0 and `t` is initialized to True. These variables will be used to control the while loop and determine the output.
The while loop runs until `p` is less than 26. In each iteration, it calculates the value of `r` by subtracting 7 times `p` from `n`.
If `r` is greater than or equal to 0 and `r` is divisible by 4 (i.e., `r % 4` equals 0), it sets `t` to False and prints "Yes". It then breaks the loop.
If the while loop completes without finding a suitable `r`, it prints "No".
The final output is determined by the value of `t`. If `t` is still True after the loop, it prints "No". Otherwise, it prints "Yes".

Given the input `11`, the code will check if there exists a non-negative integer `r` such that `n - 7 * p = r` and `r` is divisible by 4. For each value of `p` from 0 to 25, it will calculate `r` and check if it meets the conditions. If it finds such a `r`, it will print "Yes" and break the loop. If it doesn't find such a `r` for all `p`, it will print "No".

For `n = 11`, the possible values of `r` are `11 - 7 * p` for `p = 0, 1, 2, ..., 25`. Among these, `r = 4 * p` for `p = 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 22, 23, 25`. So, the output of the code will be "Yes".

<<<Output>>>
Yes
