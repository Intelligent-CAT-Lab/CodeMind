The output will depend on the number of steps taken to reach the point (0, 0). Since the point is at the origin, the number of steps will be 0. Therefore, the color of the grid cell that contains the point (0, 0) will be color[0%3], which is color[0], which is 1. So the output of the code will be 1.
