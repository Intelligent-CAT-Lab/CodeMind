### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The provided Python code is an implementation of the Suffix Array construction algorithm. The input string is read from the standard input, and the Suffix Array and the Longest Common Prefix (LCP) array are computed. The output of the program is the sum of the lengths of all suffixes in the input string, minus the sum of the LCPs.

The Suffix Array is an array of all the suffixes of the input string, sorted in lexicographic order. The i-th element of the Suffix Array is the starting position of the i-th smallest suffix in the string.

The LCP array is an array of the lengths of the longest common prefixes of the consecutive suffixes in the Suffix Array. The i-th element of the LCP array is the length of the longest common prefix of the i-th and (i+1)-th suffixes in the Suffix Array.

The output of the program is the sum of the lengths of all suffixes in the input string, minus the sum of the LCPs. This is because the LCPs represent the overlapping parts of the suffixes, and they are counted twice in the sum of the suffix lengths. By subtracting the sum of the LCPs from the sum of the suffix lengths, we get the total number of distinct substrings in the string.

Given the input string `abcbcba`, the program will compute the Suffix Array and LCP array, and then print the sum of the lengths of all suffixes in the string, minus the sum of the LCPs.

<<<Output>>>
The output will depend on the input string `abcbcba`. However, the output will be the total number of distinct substrings in the string `abcbcba`.

Note: The actual output will depend on the input string and the output of the Suffix Array and LCP array. The Suffix Array and LCP array are not directly visible in the output, but they are computed and used to compute the final output.
