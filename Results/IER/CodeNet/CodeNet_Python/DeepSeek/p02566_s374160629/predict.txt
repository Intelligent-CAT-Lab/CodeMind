The output will depend on the input string `abcbcba`. However, the output will be the total number of distinct substrings in the string `abcbcba`.

Note: The actual output will depend on the input string and the output of the Suffix Array and LCP array. The Suffix Array and LCP array are not directly visible in the output, but they are computed and used to compute the final output.
