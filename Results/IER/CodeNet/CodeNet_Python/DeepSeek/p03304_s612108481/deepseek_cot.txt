### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import sys, re
from collections import deque, defaultdict, Counter
from math import ceil, sqrt, hypot, factorial, pi, sin, cos, radians
from itertools import permutations, combinations, product
from operator import itemgetter, mul
from copy import deepcopy
from string import ascii_lowercase, ascii_uppercase, digits

def input(): return sys.stdin.readline().strip()
def INT(): return int(input())
def MAP(): return map(int, input().split())
def LIST(): return list(map(int, input().split()))
sys.setrecursionlimit(10 ** 9)
INF = float('inf')
MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7

n, m, d= MAP()

if d != 0:
	print(2*(n-d)*(m-1)/n**2)
else:
	print((m-1)/n)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `2 3 1`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response:
<<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports necessary modules and functions. It then defines a function `input` to read input from the standard input. The function `INT`, `MAP`, and `LIST` are used to read integers, integer lists, and integer maps respectively. The `sys.setrecursionlimit`, `INF`, and `MOD` are constants used in the code.

The main part of the code reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `d` from the input. If `d` is not 0, it calculates the probability of a successful hit as `2*(n-d)*(m-1)/n**2` and prints the result. If `d` is 0, it calculates the probability of a successful hit as `(m-1)/n` and prints the result.

Given the input `2 3 1`, `n` is 2, `m` is 3, and `d` is 1. Since `d` is not 0, the code calculates the probability as `2*(2-1)*(3-1)/2**2`, which equals 1.0.

<<<Output>>>
1.0
