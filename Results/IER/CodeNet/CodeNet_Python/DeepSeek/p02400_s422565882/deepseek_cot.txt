### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import math

r = float(raw_input())

menseki = r ** 2 * math.pi
shuu = 2 * r * math.pi

print("{:.6f} {:.6f}".format(menseki, shuu))
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `2`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes a float input `r` which represents the radius of a circle.
The code then calculates the area of the circle by squaring the radius and multiplying it by pi (3.141592653589793). The result is stored in the variable `menseki`.
The code also calculates the circumference of the circle by multiplying the radius by 2 and pi. The result is stored in the variable `shuu`.
Finally, the code prints the area and circumference of the circle with 6 decimal places.

The input `2` is the radius of the circle.

The area of the circle is calculated by squaring the radius and multiplying it by pi. So, `menseki` would be `2*2*3.141592653589793 = 12.566370614359172`.

The circumference of the circle is calculated by multiplying the radius by 2 and pi. So, `shuu` would be `2*3.141592653589793 = 6.283185307179586`.

So, the output of the code would be:
```
12.566371 6.283185
```

<<<Output>>>
12.566371 6.283185
