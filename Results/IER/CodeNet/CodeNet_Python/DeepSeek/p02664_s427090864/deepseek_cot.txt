### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import sys
import math
from bisect import bisect_right as br
from bisect import bisect_left as bl
sys.setrecursionlimit(2147483647)
from heapq import heappush, heappop,heappushpop
from collections import defaultdict
from itertools import accumulate
from collections import Counter
from collections import deque
from operator import itemgetter
from itertools import permutations
mod = 10**9 + 7
inf = float('inf')
def I(): return int(sys.stdin.readline())
def LI(): return list(map(int,sys.stdin.readline().split()))

t = input()
n = len(t)
ans = []
for i in range(n):
    if t[i] == '?':
        ans.append('D')
    else:
        ans.append(t[i])
print(''.join(ans))
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `PD?D??P`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response:
<<<Analysis>>>
The given code is a Python program that takes a string input `t` and replaces all '?' characters with 'D'. The output string is then printed.

The code works by iterating over each character in the input string `t`. If the character is '?', it is replaced with 'D' and added to the list `ans`. If the character is not '?', it is directly added to the list `ans`.

After all characters in `t` have been processed, the list `ans` is joined into a string with no spaces and printed.

Given the input `PD?D??P`, the output of the code would be `PDTDDPP`.

<<<Output>>>
`PDTDDPP`
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

```python
t = "PD?D??P"
ans = []
for i in t:
    if i == '?':
        ans.append('D')
    else:
        ans.append(i)
print(''.join(ans))
```

This will output: `PDTDDPP`

This code replaces all '?' characters with 'D' and leaves all other characters unchanged, resulting in the string `PDTDDPP`.
