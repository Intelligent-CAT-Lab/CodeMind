The output of the code will depend on the specific values of `h`, `w`, `a`, and `b`. However, it will be a number between 0 and `10^9+7` (inclusive) that represents the number of ways to place the strips in the grid.

Please note that the actual output will depend on the specific values of `h`, `w`, `a`, and `b`. The code is designed to calculate the number of ways to place the strips in the grid, but it does not print the grid itself.
