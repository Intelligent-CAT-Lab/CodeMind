The output of the code will depend on the input values. However, since the input values are given, we can calculate the output.

The output of the code will be the number of ways to choose `n` elements from a set of `2n` elements such that exactly `a` elements are chosen from the first set and exactly `b` elements are chosen from the second set, and the probability that all elements are chosen from the first set is `c/100`. The output is calculated modulo `10^9 + 7` to prevent overflow.

Please note that this is a theoretical analysis and the actual output of the code will depend on the input values.
