### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b=map(int,input().split())
d=".#"*(a-1)
s=".#"*(b-1)
print(100,100)
for i in range(100):
    if i<50:
        if i%2==0:
            if len(d)>0:
                if len(d)>99:
                    print(d[:100])
                    d=d[100:]
                else:
                    print(d+"#"*(100-len(d)))
                    d=""
            else:
                print("#"*100)
        else:
            print("#"*100)
    else:
        if i%2==1:
            if len(s)>0:
                if len(s)>99:
                    print(s[:100])
                    s=s[100:]
                else:
                    print(s+"."*(100-len(s)))
                    s=""
            else:
                print("."*100)
        else:
            print("."*100)

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The given code is a Python program that generates a grid of characters. The input to the program is two integers a and b. The grid will have a height of 100 and width of 100. The characters in the grid are determined by the values of a and b.

The program starts by initializing two strings d and s with a number of "#" and "." characters respectively. The number of "#" and "." characters in d and s are determined by the values of a and b, respectively.

The program then enters a loop that iterates 100 times. For each iteration, it checks the current iteration number i. If i is less than 50, it checks if i is even. If i is even, it prints a line of characters from d or "#" if d is empty. If i is odd, it prints a line of "#" characters.

If i is greater than or equal to 50, it checks if i is odd. If i is odd, it prints a line of characters from s or "." if s is empty. If i is even, it prints a line of "." characters.

The program continues to print lines of characters until it has printed 100 lines. After printing 100 lines, it prints the dimensions of the grid (100, 100) and starts over from the beginning of the loop.

The output of the program is a series of 100x100 grids, each grid being determined by the values of a and b.

The input to the program is `2 3`. The values of a and b are 2 and 3 respectively. So, d and s will have 198 and 298 "#" and "." characters respectively.

The output of the program will be a series of 100x100 grids, each grid being a checkerboard pattern with alternating "#" and "." characters. The checkerboard pattern will have a size of 100x100 and will have 2 alternating rows of "#" and "." characters.

The first grid will have 2 "#" and 3 "." characters in the first row, and the second grid will have 3 "#" and 2 "." characters in the first row. The rest of the grid will be filled with "#" and "." characters alternatingly.

The program will print the dimensions of the grid (100, 100) and start over from the beginning of the loop.

So, the output of the program will be a series of 100x100 grids, each grid being a checkerboard pattern with alternating "#" and "." characters.
