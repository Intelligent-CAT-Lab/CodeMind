### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
s = input()
t = ''
k = 0
prev = ''
for i in range(len(s)):
  t += s[i]
  if prev != t:
    k += 1
    prev = t
    t = ''
print(k)

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `aabbaa`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The given code takes a string input `s` and initializes an empty string `t`, an integer `k` to 0, and a string `prev` to an empty string. The code then enters a loop that iterates over the length of the input string `s`.

In each iteration, the code adds the current character `s[i]` to the string `t`. Then it checks if `t` is different from `prev`. If `t` is different from `prev`, it increments `k` by 1, updates `prev` to `t`, and resets `t` to an empty string.

After the loop finishes, the code prints the value of `k`, which represents the number of distinct substrings in the input string `s`.

The input string `s` is `aabbaa`.

The code will first add the first character `a` to `t`, which becomes `a`. Then it checks if `t` is different from `prev`. Since `prev` is an empty string, `t` is different from `prev`, so `k` is incremented by 1, `prev` is updated to `a`, and `t` is reset to an empty string.

Next, the code adds the second character `a` to `t`, which becomes `aa`. It checks if `t` is different from `prev`. Since `t` is the same as `prev`, `t` is not different from `prev`, so `k` is not incremented and `t` remains `aa`.

The code then adds the third character `b` to `t`, which becomes `aab`. It checks if `t` is different from `prev`. Since `t` is the same as `prev`, `t` is not different from `prev`, so `k` is not incremented and `t` remains `aab`.

The code then adds the fourth character `b` to `t`, which becomes `aabb`. It checks if `t` is different from `prev`. Since `t` is the same as `prev`, `t` is not different from `prev`, so `k` is not incremented and `t` remains `aabb`.

The code then adds the fifth character `a` to `t`, which becomes `aabba`. It checks if `t` is different from `prev`. Since `t` is the same as `prev`, `t` is not different from `prev`, so `k` is not incremented and `t` remains `aabba`.

Finally, the code adds the sixth character `a` to `t`, which becomes `aabbaa`. It checks if `t` is different from `prev`. Since `t` is the same as `prev`, `t` is not different from `prev`, so `k` is not incremented and `t` remains `aabbaa`.

After the loop finishes, the code prints the value of `k`, which is 3.

So, the output of the code execution given the input `aabbaa` is 3.

<<<Output>>>
3
