### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import sys

def solve():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    S = input().strip("\n")
    turn = 0
    current = S[0]
    for i in range(1, len(S)):
        if S[i] != current:
            turn += 1
            current = S[i]
    print(turn)

    return 0

if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve()
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `BBBWW`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input from the standard input, which represents the initial arrangement of the stones. The string consists of 'B's (representing black stones) and 'W's (representing white stones). The code then counts the number of turns it takes to make the stones alternating, starting from the left.

In the given input `BBBWW`, the first stone is black, and the code initializes `turn` to 0 and `current` to 'B'. It then iterates over the string from the second character (index 1), comparing each character to the previous one. If the current character is different from the previous one, it increments `turn` and updates `current` to the new character.

After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of `turn`, which represents the minimum number of turns needed to make the stones alternating.

In the given input `BBBWW`, the stones are already alternating, so the code prints 0.

<<<Output>>>
0
