### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
n = int(input())
m = 0
tmp = 0
while m < n:
    tmp += 1
    m += tmp
for i in range(1,tmp+1):
    if m-n != i:
        print(i)

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `4`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The first line of the code reads an integer input n and initializes three variables: m (set to 0), tmp (set to 0), and i (set to 0).

The code then enters a while loop that continues until m is greater than or equal to n. Inside the while loop, tmp is incremented by 1 and m is increased by tmp.

After the while loop, a for loop is initiated that iterates from 1 to tmp (inclusive). If the difference between m and n is not equal to i, the code prints the value of i.

The code continues to execute until all values of i from 1 to tmp have been printed.

The output of the code will be the numbers that are not part of the sequence of numbers that add up to m and are less than or equal to n.

In the given example, n is 4. The while loop will run until m is greater than or equal to 4. After the while loop, the for loop will iterate from 1 to 4 (inclusive). Since the condition m-n != i is not met for any i in this range, no numbers will be printed.

Therefore, the output of the code will be an empty line.
