The output of the code will depend on the input values of `a` and `b`. The output will be two integers `x` and `y`, which are the coefficients of BÃ©zout's identity.

For example, if the input is `4 12`, the output could be `2 1`. This means that `2 * 4 + 1 * 12 = 16 + 12 = 28`, which is the greatest common divisor of 4 and 12. The coefficients `2` and `1` are such that `4 * 2 + 12 * 1 = 8 + 12 = 20`, which is also the greatest common divisor of 4 and 12.

Please note that the actual output will depend on the input values of `a` and `b`.
