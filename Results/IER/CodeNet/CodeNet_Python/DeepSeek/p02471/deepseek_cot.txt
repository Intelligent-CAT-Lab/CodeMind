### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
from __future__ import print_function


def rec(a, b):
    """a * x + b * y = gcd(a, b) ??¨??????????????? (x, y, gcd) ?????????"""
    assert a >= b
    q, r = divmod(a, b)
    if r == 0:
        return 0, 1, b
    x, y, gcd = rec(b, r)
    # a = b * q + r
    # b * x + r * y = gcd
    # a * y + b * (x - q * y) = gcd
    return y, x - q * y, gcd


a, b = [int(_) for _ in raw_input().split()]

if a < b:
    y0, x0, gcd = rec(b, a)
else:
    x0, y0, gcd = rec(a, b)

# -a/gcd * (x - x0) = b/gcd * (y - y0)
# x = x0 + (b/gcd) * k, y = y0 + (-a/gcd) * k
dx = b // gcd
dy = -a // gcd
if dx < 0:
    dx = -dx
    dy = -dy
x = x0
y = y0
mag = abs(x) + abs(y)

while True:
    x1 = x + dx
    y1 = y + dy
    mag1 = abs(x1) + abs(y1)
    if mag1 >= mag:
        break
    mag = mag1
    x = x1
    y = y1

while True:
    x1 = x - dx
    y1 = y - dy
    mag1 = abs(x1) + abs(y1)
    if mag1 > mag:
        break
    mag = mag1
    x = x1
    y = y1

print(x, y)

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The code is implementing the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which is used to find the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two numbers and also to find the coefficients of Bézout's identity, which are used to express the gcd as a linear combination of the two input numbers.

The input numbers are `a` and `b`. The function `rec(a, b)` is a recursive function that implements the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. It returns three values: `x` and `y`, which are the coefficients of Bézout's identity, and `gcd`, which is the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b`.

The input numbers `a` and `b` are read from the standard input. If `a` is less than `b`, the function `rec(b, a)` is called. Otherwise, the function `rec(a, b)` is called.

The code then calculates the values of `dx` and `dy`, which are the increments in `x` and `y` respectively. `dx` is the increment in `x` and `dy` is the increment in `y`.

The code then enters a loop that continues until the magnitude of `x` and `y` is greater than or equal to the magnitude of the previous step. The magnitude of a point `(x, y)` is calculated as `abs(x) + abs(y)`.

The code then enters another loop that continues until the magnitude of `x` and `y` is greater than the magnitude of the previous step.

Finally, the code prints the values of `x` and `y`.

<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will depend on the input values of `a` and `b`. The output will be two integers `x` and `y`, which are the coefficients of Bézout's identity.

For example, if the input is `4 12`, the output could be `2 1`. This means that `2 * 4 + 1 * 12 = 16 + 12 = 28`, which is the greatest common divisor of 4 and 12. The coefficients `2` and `1` are such that `4 * 2 + 12 * 1 = 8 + 12 = 20`, which is also the greatest common divisor of 4 and 12.

Please note that the actual output will depend on the input values of `a` and `b`.
