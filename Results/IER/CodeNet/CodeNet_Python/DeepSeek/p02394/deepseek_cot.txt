### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
i = list(map(int, input().split()))

if i[2] + i[4] <= i[0]:
    if i[2] - i[4] >= 0:
        if i[3] + i[4] <= i[1]:
            if i[3] - i[4] >= 0:
                print("Yes")
            else:
                print("No")
        else:
            print("No")
    else:
        print("No")
else:
    print("No")

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `5 4 2 2 1`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input of 5 integers. The first integer i[0] is the total number of candies. The next four integers i[1] to i[4] represent the number of candies Alice, Bob, Charlie, and David have.

The code checks if the sum of the candies Alice and Bob have (i[2] + i[4]) is less than or equal to the total number of candies (i[0]). If this condition is met, it then checks if the difference between the candies Alice and Bob have (i[2] - i[4]) is greater than or equal to 0. If this condition is also met, it then checks if the sum of the candies Charlie and David have (i[3] + i[4]) is less than or equal to the total number of candies (i[1]). If this condition is met, it then checks if the difference between the candies Charlie and David have (i[3] - i[4]) is greater than or equal to 0. If all these conditions are met, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".

Given the input `5 4 2 2 1`, the code checks if the sum of the candies Alice and Bob have (2 + 1 = 3) is less than or equal to the total number of candies (5). This is true, so it then checks if the difference between the candies Alice and Bob have (2 - 1 = 1) is greater than or equal to 0. This is also true, so it then checks if the sum of the candies Charlie and David have (2 + 1 = 3) is less than or equal to the total number of candies (4). This is also true, so it then checks if the difference between the candies Charlie and David have (2 - 1 = 1) is greater than or equal to 0. This is also true, so the code prints "Yes".

<<<Output>>>
Yes
