The output will depend on the values of `a` and `b`. If `a` is less than or equal to 0 and `b` is greater than or equal to 0, the output will be 'Zero'. If `b` is less than 0 and the number of negative integers between `a` and `b` (inclusive) is odd, the output will be 'Negative'. If `b` is less than 0 and the number of negative integers between `a` and `b` (inclusive) is even, the output will be 'Positive'. If `a` is greater than 0, the output will be 'Positive'.

For the input `1 3`, the output will be 'Positive' because `a` is greater than 0.
