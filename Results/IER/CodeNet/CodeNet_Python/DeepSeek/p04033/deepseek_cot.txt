### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}

<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
# B 
si = lambda: input()
ni = lambda: int(input())
nm = lambda: map(int, input().split())
nl = lambda: list(map(int, input().split()))
a,b=nm()

if a<=0<=b:
    print('Zero')
elif b<0:
    if (b-a+1)%2==1:
        print('Negative')
    elif (b-a+1)%2==0:
        print('Positive')
elif 0<a:
    print('Positive')
    

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `1 3`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The code first defines several lambda functions for input. The lambda functions `si`, `ni`, `nm`, and `nl` are used to get input in different formats. `si` gets a string input, `ni` gets an integer input, `nm` gets multiple integer inputs separated by space and returns a map object, and `nl` gets multiple integer inputs separated by space and returns a list.

Then it gets two integer inputs from the user using the `nm` lambda function and assigns them to `a` and `b` respectively.

Next, it checks the conditions and prints the corresponding output based on the values of `a` and `b`.

If `a` is less than or equal to 0 and `b` is greater than or equal to 0, it prints 'Zero'.

If `b` is less than 0, it checks if the number of negative integers between `a` and `b` (inclusive) is odd. If it is, it prints 'Negative'. If it's even, it prints 'Positive'.

If `a` is greater than 0, it prints 'Positive'.

<<<Output>>>
The output will depend on the values of `a` and `b`. If `a` is less than or equal to 0 and `b` is greater than or equal to 0, the output will be 'Zero'. If `b` is less than 0 and the number of negative integers between `a` and `b` (inclusive) is odd, the output will be 'Negative'. If `b` is less than 0 and the number of negative integers between `a` and `b` (inclusive) is even, the output will be 'Positive'. If `a` is greater than 0, the output will be 'Positive'.

For the input `1 3`, the output will be 'Positive' because `a` is greater than 0.
