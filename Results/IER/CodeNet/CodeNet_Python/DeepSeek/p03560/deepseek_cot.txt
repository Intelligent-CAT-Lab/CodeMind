### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import heapq

K = int(input())

edge = [[] for i in range(K)]  # (node, cost) list list

for i in range(1, K):
    edge[i].append(( (i+1)%K, 1) )
    edge[i].append( ((i*10)%K, 0) )

# fro から to への最短距離(v は頂点数)
def dijkstra(fro, to, v):
    MAX = int(1e9)

    dist = [MAX]*v   # fro からの距離を格納する
    check = [False]*v  # すでにその頂点からを調べたかのフラグ

    dist[fro] = 0
    pq = [(0, fro)]    # (-cost, node)


    # 頂点は v 個あるので、v 周する
    for i in range(v):
        # 調べ済みでない頂点のうち、最も近い頂点を now に入れる
        nowNode = -1        # このターンにフォーカスするノード

        while True:
            nowNode = heapq.heappop(pq)[1]  # 最小コストから貪欲に取っていく
            if not check[nowNode]:    # まだチェックされていないノードだったら決定
                check[nowNode] = True
                break

        # その頂点からたどり着ける頂点の情報を更新する
        for (nextNode, cost) in edge[nowNode]:
            nextDist = dist[nowNode] + cost
            if nextDist < dist[nextNode]:  # 既存の通路より近いなら更新
                dist[nextNode] = nextDist
                heapq.heappush(pq, (dist[nextNode], nextNode))

    return dist[to]

print(dijkstra(1, 0, K) + 1)

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The given Python code is a solution to a problem related to graph theory and shortest path algorithms. The code creates a directed graph where each node i is connected to nodes (i+1)%K and (i*10)%K with costs 1 and 0 respectively. The graph has K nodes, where K is the input number. The code then uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from node 1 to node 0 in the graph.

The input number K is used to create the graph. The graph has K nodes, where each node i is connected to nodes (i+1)%K and (i*10)%K with costs 1 and 0 respectively. This means that node i is connected to node (i+1)%K with cost 1, and node i is connected to node (i*10)%K with cost 0.

After creating the graph, the code uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from node 1 to node 0 in the graph. The shortest path is the path with the smallest total cost. The total cost of a path is the sum of the costs of the edges in the path.

The output of the code is the shortest path cost from node 1 to node 0 in the graph plus 1.

In the given example, the input is 6. The graph has 6 nodes, and the code uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from node 1 to node 0. The shortest path cost is 2, so the output of the code is 2+1=3.

So, the output of the code execution given the input 6 is 3.

<<<Output>>>
3

Note: The output of the code execution may vary depending on the specific implementation of the Dijkstra's algorithm used in the code.
