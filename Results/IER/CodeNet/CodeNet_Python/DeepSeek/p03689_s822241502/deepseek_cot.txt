### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
H, W, a, b = map(int, input().split())

if H%a or W%b:
    print('Yes')
    k = (H//a) * (W//b)
    x = k+2
    ansss = [[0]*(W) for _ in range(H)]
    for i in range(H//a):
        for j in range(W//b):
            ansss[(i+1)*a-1][(j+1)*b-1] = -x
    for i in range(-(-H//a)):
        for j in range(-(-W//b)):
            ansss[i*a][j*b] = x-1
    print('\n'.join([' '.join(map(str, anss)) for anss in ansss]))
else:
    print('No')

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `3 3 2 2`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The input given is `3 3 2 2`. The variables `H`, `W`, `a`, and `b` are initialized to 3, 3, 2, and 2, respectively.

The code first checks if `H` or `W` is divisible by `a` or `b` respectively. If either of these conditions is true, it prints 'Yes'. If not, it prints 'No'.

If 'Yes' is printed, it calculates `k` as the number of blocks that can be formed by cutting the grid into `a` by `b` blocks. `x` is calculated as `k+2`.

Then, it creates a 2D list `ansss` of size `H` by `W`, filled with zeros. For each block, it sets the value at the bottom-right corner of the block to `-x`. It also sets the value at the top-left corner of each block to `x-1`.

Finally, it prints the 2D list `ansss` in a grid format.

<<<Output>>>
```
Yes
-2 0 0 
0 -2 0 
0 0 -2
```
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

This output is based on the input `3 3 2 2`. The grid is divided into 4 blocks of size 2x2. The bottom-right corner of each block is marked with `-2`, and the top-left corner of each block is marked with `1`. The remaining cells are marked with `0`.
