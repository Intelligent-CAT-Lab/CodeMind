### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
n,m,k=map(int,input().split())
ans=0
def cmb(n, r, mod):
    if ( r<0 or r>n ):
        return 0
    r = min(r, n-r)
    return g1[n] * g2[r] * g2[n-r] % mod

mod = 998244353 #出力の制限
N = 2*10**5
g1 = [1, 1] # 元テーブル
g2 = [1, 1] #逆元テーブル
inverse = [0, 1] #逆元テーブル計算用テーブル

for i in range( 2, N + 1 ):
    g1.append( ( g1[-1] * i ) % mod )
    inverse.append( ( -inverse[mod % i] * (mod//i) ) % mod )
    g2.append( (g2[-1] * inverse[-1]) % mod )


  
kk=n-k
#print(kk)
color=m*(m-1)**(kk-1)%mod
#print(color)
while kk<=n:
  now=color
  color=color*(m-1)%mod
  now=now*(cmb((n-1),(n-kk),mod))%mod
  kk+=1
  ans+=now
  ans=ans%mod
  #print(kk)
  #print(now)
  #print("color",color,"com",com)
print(ans)

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The given Python code is a solution to a problem related to combinatorics and modular arithmetic. The input to the code is three integers n, m, and k. The code calculates the number of ways to choose k elements from a set of n elements, where each element can be one of m different colors. The result is given modulo 998244353 to prevent overflow.

The code first initializes some variables and sets up two lookup tables (g1 and g2) for modular multiplicative inverses. These tables are used to calculate the binomial coefficients (nCr) modulo 998244353.

The main part of the code calculates the number of ways to choose k elements from a set of n elements, where each element can be one of m different colors. This is done by iteratively multiplying the number of ways to choose k elements from the remaining n elements by the number of ways to choose one of m colors, and then taking the result modulo 998244353.

The result is stored in the variable ans, which is printed at the end of the code.

Given the input `3 2 1`, the code calculates the number of ways to choose 1 element from a set of 3 elements, where each element can be one of 2 different colors.

The output of the code will be the number of ways to choose 1 element from a set of 3 elements, where each element can be one of 2 different colors, modulo 998244353.

<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will be the number of ways to choose 1 element from a set of 3 elements, where each element can be one of 2 different colors, modulo 998244353.

Please note that the actual output of the code will depend on the specific values of n, m, and k. The output is calculated based on the given input and the logic of the code.
