### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
n,m,k = map(int, input().split())
t = [0 for i in range(n*m+1)]
for i in range(n+1):
    a = i * m
    b = n - i - i
    for j in range(m):
        t[a] = 1
        a += b
if t[k] == 0:
    print('No')
else:
    print('Yes')

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `2 2 2`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes three inputs n, m, and k from the user. n and m represent the dimensions of a grid, and k is the position in the grid. The variable t is initialized as a list of zeros with length n*m+1.

The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n. For each iteration, it calculates two values: a is the current row number multiplied by m, and b is the difference between n and the current row number.

In the next loop, it iterates from 0 to m. For each iteration, it sets the value of t at index a to 1, and then increments a by b.

After the loops, it checks if the value of t at index k is 0. If it is, it prints 'No'. Otherwise, it prints 'Yes'.

The code is checking if the kth position in the grid is accessible. If the kth position is 1, it means the kth position is accessible, and the code prints 'Yes'. If the kth position is 0, it means the kth position is not accessible, and the code prints 'No'.

Given the input `2 2 2`, the output of the code would be 'Yes' because the 2nd position in the grid is accessible.

<<<Output>>>
Yes
