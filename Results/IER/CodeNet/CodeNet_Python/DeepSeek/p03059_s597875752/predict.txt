The output of the code will be 15. 

In the given input 3 5 7, Alice gets 3 fruits per day, Bob gets 5 fruits per day, and there are 7 days. 

So, the total number of fruits that Alice and Bob get in 7 days is 3*7 (Alice's fruits) + 5*7 (Bob's fruits) = 21 + 35 = 56 fruits. 

But since Alice and Bob get fruits in full days, they get 7*3 = 21 fruits in the first 7 days and 5*1 = 5 fruits in the remaining 1 day. 

So, the total number of fruits that Alice and Bob get in 7 days is 21 + 5 = 26 fruits. 

But the problem statement says that the total number of fruits is 56, which is not correct. 

I apologize for the confusion. The correct total number of fruits that Alice and Bob get in 7 days is 56 fruits. 

So, the output of the code should be 56.
