### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
s=input()+'R' #以下ではRが出てきたときに値を更新しているので最後にRを付け加える
l=len(s)
ans=[0]*(l-1) #すべてのマスの答えを0で初期化
rcnt=0
lcnt=0
rpos=0
lpos=0
flag=0
for i in range(l):
 if s[i]=='R':
   if flag==1: #文字列がLRとなっているとき、直前のRLについて答えを求める
     if rcnt%2==0: #Rの個数が偶数のとき
       ans[rpos]+=rcnt//2
       ans[lpos]+=rcnt//2
     else: #Rの個数が奇数のとき
       ans[rpos]+=rcnt//2+1
       ans[lpos]+=rcnt//2
     if lcnt%2==0: #Lの個数が偶数のとき
       ans[rpos]+=lcnt//2
       ans[lpos]+=lcnt//2
     else: #Lの個数が奇数のとき
       ans[rpos]+=lcnt//2
       ans[lpos]+=lcnt//2+1
     rcnt=0
     lcnt=0
   flag=0
   rcnt+=1 #Rの個数を求める
   rpos=i #右端のRの位置を求める
 elif s[i]=='L':
   if flag==0:
     lpos=i #左端のLの位置を求める
   lcnt+=1 #Lの個数を求める
   flag=1
print(*ans)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `RRLRL`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The given code is a Python program that processes a string of characters. The string is composed of 'R' and 'L' characters. The program calculates the number of 'R' and 'L' characters in each segment of the string and assigns the count to the corresponding positions in an array.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the code:

1. The input string is read and appended with 'R' at the end. This is done to handle the case where the string ends with 'R' or 'L'.
2. The length of the string is calculated and stored in the variable `l`.
3. An array `ans` is initialized with zeros of length `l-1`. This array will store the count of 'R' and 'L' characters in each segment of the string.
4. Variables `rcnt`, `lcnt`, `rpos`, `lpos`, and `flag` are initialized. `rcnt` and `lcnt` are used to count the number of 'R' and 'L' characters in the current segment. `rpos` and `lpos` are used to store the position of the last 'R' and 'L' character in the current segment. `flag` is used to determine whether the current segment is 'R' or 'L'.
5. A for loop is used to iterate over each character in the string.
6. If the current character is 'R', the code checks if the previous segment was 'R' or 'L'. If it was 'R', it calculates the count of 'R' and 'L' characters in the previous segment and assigns them to the corresponding positions in the `ans` array. It then resets the count of 'R' and 'L' characters and updates the position of the last 'R' character.
7. If the current character is 'L', the code checks if the previous segment was 'R' or 'L'. If it was 'L', it calculates the count of 'R' and 'L' characters in the previous segment and assigns them to the corresponding positions in the `ans` array. It then resets the count of 'R' and 'L' characters and updates the position of the last 'L' character.
8. Finally, the `ans` array is printed.

Given the input `RRLRL`, the output of the code would be `2 1 1 1 2`. This is because there are 2 'R' characters in the first segment, 1 'L' character in the second segment, 1 'R' character in the third segment, 1 'L' character in the fourth segment, and 2 'R' characters in the last segment.

<<<Output>>>
2 1 1 1 2

I hope this helps in understanding the code execution.
