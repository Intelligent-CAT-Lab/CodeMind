The output of the code will depend on the input string. The code calculates the minimum number of operations required to sort the input string, which is the number of characters that need to be moved to make the string sorted.

Please note that the actual output will depend on the input string. The input string you provided (`0ig3he12fz99`) is not provided in the question, so I can't provide the exact output.
