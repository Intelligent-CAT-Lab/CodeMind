### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

84

# 入力

# pfacから次数がn以上の素数の数を返す
def p_deg_le(pfac, n):
    ret = 0
    for p_deg in pfac:
        if p_deg[1] >= n: ret += 1
        else: break
    return ret


# 100までの素数
P = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97]

# N!を素因数分解
pfac = {} # N!の素因数分解
for i in range(1, N + 1):
    for p in P:
        while i % p == 0:
            if p in pfac:   pfac[p] += 1
            else:           pfac[p] = 1
            i //= p

# 次数の多い素数が前にくるようソート
pfac = sorted(pfac.items(), reverse = True, key = lambda x : x[1])

fact = 1
for p_deg in pfac:
    fact *= p_deg[0] ** p_deg[1]


# 約数が75 = 3 * 5 * 5個あるN!の約数は以下のいずれかの形のq
# q = p1^74, q = p1^24 * p2^2, q = p1^14 * p2^4,
# q = p1^4 * p2^4 * p3^2
p_deg = {}
for deg in (2, 4, 14, 24, 74):
    p_deg[deg] = p_deg_le(pfac, deg)

# q = p1^4 * p2^4 * p3^2
ans = (p_deg[4] * (p_deg[4] - 1) // 2) * (p_deg[2] - 2)
# q = p1^14 * p2^4
ans += p_deg[14] * (p_deg[4] - 1)
# q = p1^24 * p2^2
ans += p_deg[24] * (p_deg[2] - 1)
# q = p1^74
ans += p_deg[74]

print(ans)

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The given Python code is used to calculate the number of divisors of a factorial of a number N that have a certain prime factor. The prime factor is 75, which is 3 * 5 * 5. The code first calculates the prime factorization of N factorial, then it sorts the prime factors by their degree in descending order. After that, it calculates the factorial of the prime factors.

The code then calculates the number of prime factors with a certain degree (2, 4, 14, 24, 74) and uses these numbers to calculate the number of divisors of N factorial that have a certain prime factor.

The calculation of the number of divisors is done in the following way:
- q = p1^4 * p2^4 * p3^2: This is done by calculating the number of combinations of 4 prime factors from the list of prime factors with degree 4, and then multiplying this by the number of prime factors with degree 2 minus 2.
- q = p1^14 * p2^4: This is done by calculating the number of combinations of 14 prime factors from the list of prime factors with degree 14, and then multiplying this by the number of prime factors with degree 4 minus 1.
- q = p1^24 * p2^2: This is done by calculating the number of combinations of 24 prime factors from the list of prime factors with degree 24, and then multiplying this by the number of prime factors with degree 2 minus 1.
- q = p1^74: This is done by calculating the number of combinations of 74 prime factors from the list of prime factors with degree 74.

Finally, the code prints the sum of all these numbers, which is the number of divisors of N factorial that have a prime factor of 75.

The input to the code is a single integer N. The code calculates the number of divisors of N factorial that have a prime factor of 75.

The output of the code will be the number of divisors of N factorial that have a prime factor of 75.

<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will be the number of divisors of N factorial that have a prime factor of 75.
