The output of the code for the input `3 1 5` would be `5`.

Explanation:
a = 3, b = 1, x = 5
Since x >= a, k = (x-b) // (a-b) = 4
So, the result is (x + b*k) = (5 + 1*4) = 9
But since the result is larger than 1e9+7, the result is reduced by taking modulo with 1e9+7, so the final result is 9 % (1e9+7) = 9.
