### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import sys
def input(): return sys.stdin.readline().strip()
def mapint(): return map(int, input().split())
sys.setrecursionlimit(10**9)

N, M = mapint()
from bisect import bisect_left
def make_divisors(n):
    lower_divisors , upper_divisors = [], []
    i = 1
    while i*i <= n:
        if n % i == 0:
            lower_divisors.append(i)
            if i != n // i:
                upper_divisors.append(n//i)
        i += 1
    return lower_divisors + upper_divisors[::-1]

div = [1]+make_divisors(M)
div.sort()
g = div[bisect_left(div, N)]
print(M//g)

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `3 14`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs N and M. N is the number of divisors we are looking for, and M is the upper limit of the numbers we are considering.

The function make_divisors(n) generates all divisors of a number n. It does this by iterating from 1 to the square root of n and checking if n is divisible by the current number. If it is, it adds the current number and its corresponding quotient to the lower_divisors list and the upper_divisors list.

The function then returns the concatenation of lower_divisors and upper_divisors in reverse order.

The bisect_left function from the bisect module is used to find the index of the smallest number in div that is not less than N.

Finally, the code prints the integer division of M by the greatest number in div that is less than or equal to N.

The output of the code is the number of divisors of M that are less than or equal to N.

In the given input `3 14`, N is 3 and M is 14. The code will find the greatest number in the list of divisors of 14 that is less than or equal to 3 and print the result.

<<<Output>>>
7
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

Note: The output 7 is the number of divisors of 14 that are less than or equal to 3. The divisors of 14 are 1, 2, 7, 14 and 49. The numbers 1, 2 and 7 are less than or equal to 3.
