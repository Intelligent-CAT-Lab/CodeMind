You are an AI programming assistant, utilizing the Deepseek Coder model, developed by Deepseek Company, and you only answer questions related to computer science. For politically sensitive questions, security and privacy issues, and other non-computer science questions, you will refuse to answer.

### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}

<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
A, B = map(int, input().split())
L = [["."] * 99 + ["#"] if i%2 == 0 else ["."] + ["#"] * 99 for i in range(100)]
for i in range(B-1):
    L[1 + i%50 * 2][2 + i//50 * 2] = "."
for i in range(A-1):
    L[-2 - i%50 * 2][-3 - i//50 * 2] = "#"
print("100 100")
for s in L:
    print("".join(s))

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `2 3`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The given Python code first takes two integers A and B as input. 

Then, it creates a 2D list L of size 100x100. The list is filled with "#" and "." characters. The "#" character represents a wall and the "." character represents a path. The pattern of "#" and "." characters is alternating in each row.

Next, it iterates from 0 to B-1 and for each iteration, it changes the character at a specific position in the list L to ".". The position is determined by the formula `2 + i//50 * 2` for the row index and `1 + i%50 * 2` for the column index.

After that, it iterates from 0 to A-1 and for each iteration, it changes the character at a specific position in the list L to "#". The position is determined by the formula `-3 - i//50 * 2` for the row index and `-2 - i%50 * 2` for the column index.

Finally, it prints the size of the list (100 100) and the list L.

<<<Output>>>
The output will be a 100x100 grid where the grid is filled with "#" and "." characters. The "#" character represents a wall and the "." character represents a path. The pattern of "#" and "." characters is alternating in each row. The code then changes a certain number of characters in the grid to "#" and "." characters based on the input A and B. The output will be a 100x100 grid where the grid is filled with "#" and "." characters. The "#" character represents a wall and the "." character represents a path. The pattern of "#" and "." characters is alternating in each row. The code then changes a certain number of characters in the grid to "#" and "." characters based on the input A and B.
