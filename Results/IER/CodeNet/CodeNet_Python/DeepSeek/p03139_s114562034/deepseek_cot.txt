### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
# coding: utf-8
# Your code here!

n, a, b = map(int,input().split())

ma = min(a,b)
mi = (a+b)-n

if mi < 0:
    mi = 0

print(ma,mi)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `10 3 5`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The input given is `10 3 5`.

The first number `10` is assigned to the variable `n`, which represents the total number of elements.
The second number `3` is assigned to the variable `a`, which represents the lower limit of the sum of digits.
The third number `5` is assigned to the variable `b`, which represents the upper limit of the sum of digits.

The code then calculates the minimum of `a` and `b` and assigns it to the variable `ma`. This represents the lower limit of the sum of digits that can be achieved.

The code then calculates the maximum of `a` and `b` and subtracts it from the sum of `a` and `b`. This represents the upper limit of the sum of digits that can be achieved.

If the calculated upper limit `mi` is less than 0, it is set to 0. This means that the upper limit cannot be less than 0.

Finally, the code prints the calculated lower limit `ma` and upper limit `mi`.

<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will be `3 7`.

This means that the lower limit of the sum of digits that can be achieved is 3 (which is the minimum of `a` and `b`), and the upper limit of the sum of digits that can be achieved is 7 (which is the sum of `a` and `b` minus `n`).
