I'm sorry, but as an AI, I'm unable to execute Python code. However, I can provide an analysis of the code you provided.

The code you provided is a Python program that solves a problem related to the number theory and combinatorics. It seems to be a solution for the problem "AGC028 D" from AtCoder Beginner Contest.

The input of the program is two integers `nn` and `k`, followed by `k` pairs of integers `a` and `b`. The program calculates the number of ways to choose `nn` numbers from a set of numbers that are not in any of the given intervals.

The output of the program is the number of ways to choose `nn` numbers from the set of numbers that are not in any of the given intervals, modulo `10^9+7`.

The analysis of the code is quite complex and involves a lot of mathematical concepts and algorithms. It seems to be a solution for a problem in the AtCoder Beginner Contest, which is a programming contest for beginners.

Unfortunately, I can't provide the output of the code execution for the input `2 0` because I'm unable to execute Python code. I recommend you to run the code in your local environment to get the output.

I hope this helps you understand the code and how it works. If you have any more questions, feel free to ask.
