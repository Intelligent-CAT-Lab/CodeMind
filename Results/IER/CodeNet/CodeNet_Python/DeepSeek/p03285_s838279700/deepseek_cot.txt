### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
n = int(input())
cnt = 0
for k in range(n):
    for j in range(n):
        if 4*k+7*j == n:
            cnt += 1
if n < 4 or cnt == 0:
    print("No")
else:
    print("Yes")
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `11`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable `n` is initialized to the input number.
The variable `cnt` is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of pairs (k, j) that satisfy the condition 4*k + 7*j = n.
The code then enters two nested loops. The outer loop iterates from 0 to n-1, and the inner loop also iterates from 0 to n-1. For each pair (k, j), if 4*k + 7*j equals to n, the counter `cnt` is incremented by 1.
After the two loops finish, the code checks if n is less than 4 or if `cnt` is 0. If either of these conditions is true, the code prints "No". Otherwise, it prints "Yes".

For the input `11`, the code will check all possible pairs (k, j) where k and j are integers from 0 to 10. It will find that there is no pair (k, j) that satisfies the condition 4*k + 7*j = 11. Therefore, the output of the code will be "No".

<<<Output>>>
No
