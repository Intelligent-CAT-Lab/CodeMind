### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
num = int(input())
check_list = [0] * num * num

def make_bridge(island1, island2):
    if(island1 < island2):
        check_list[(island1-1)*num + (island2-1)]=1;
    else:
        check_list[(island2-1)*num + (island1-1)]=1;

if num%2==0:
    sum_pair = num+1
else:
    sum_pair = num

for i in range(num):
    for j in range(i):
        if (i+1 + j+1 != sum_pair):
            check_list[j*num + i]=1;

bridge_num=0;

for i in range(num*num):
    if(check_list[i]==1):
        bridge_num+=1;

print(bridge_num);

for i in range(num*num):
    if(check_list[i]==1):
        left = i // num
        right = i % num
        print(str(left+1)+" "+str(right+1));

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `3`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The input number is 3.

The first part of the code initializes a 3x3 matrix (a list in Python) with all elements set to 0. The size of the matrix is determined by the input number.

The function `make_bridge(island1, island2)` is defined to create a bridge between two islands. The bridge is represented by setting the corresponding element in the matrix to 1. The function checks if `island1` is less than `island2` and sets the corresponding element in the matrix accordingly.

The next part of the code checks if the input number is even. If it is, it sets `sum_pair` to `num+1`. If it's not, it sets `sum_pair` to `num`.

Then, a nested loop is used to iterate over the matrix. If the sum of the indices (i+1 and j+1) is not equal to `sum_pair`, the corresponding element in the matrix is set to 1.

The next part of the code counts the number of bridges in the matrix and prints it.

Finally, another loop is used to print the pairs of islands that are connected by each bridge. The indices of the matrix are converted back to the corresponding pairs of islands.

<<<Output>>>
The output will be:

12
1 2
1 3
2 1
2 3
3 1
3 2
1 2
1 3
2 1
2 3
3 1
3 2

This output represents the connections between the 3 islands. Each line represents a bridge connecting two islands. The first number is the number of the first island, and the second number is the number of the second island.
