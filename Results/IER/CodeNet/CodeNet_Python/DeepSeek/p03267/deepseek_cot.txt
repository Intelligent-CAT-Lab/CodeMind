### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
# coding: utf-8
import sys

sr = lambda: sys.stdin.readline().rstrip()
ir = lambda: int(sr())
lr = lambda: list(map(int, sr().split()))

L = ir()
edges = []
length = L.bit_length()
for i in range(1, length):
    edges.append((i, i+1, 2**(i-1)))
    edges.append((i, i+1, 0))

# 2**(length-1)-1までの数は完了
# Lに近い切れ端から処理していく
for i in range(length-1):
    if L >> i & 1:
        L -= 2 ** i
        edges.append((i+1, length, L))

print(length, len(edges))
for x in edges:
    print(*x)

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `4`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response:
<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by reading an integer input `L` from the standard input. The integer `L` is used to determine the number of nodes and edges in the graph.

The code then creates a list `edges` to store the edges of the graph. The edges are represented as tuples of three elements: the indices of the two nodes connected by the edge, and the weight of the edge.

The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to the bit length of `L`. For each iteration, it adds two edges to the `edges` list. The first edge connects node `i` to node `i+1` with weight `2**(i-1)`. The second edge connects node `i` to node `i+1` with weight 0.

After the loop, the code checks each bit of `L` from the least significant bit to the most significant bit. If the bit is set, it subtracts `2**i` from `L` and adds an edge to the `edges` list connecting node `i+1` to the last node with weight `L`.

Finally, the code prints the number of nodes and edges in the graph, and then prints each edge in the `edges` list.

The output of the code will depend on the value of `L`. For example, if `L` is 4, the output will be:

```
3 5
1 2 2
1 2 0
2 3 1
2 3 0
3 3 2
```

This means there are 3 nodes and 5 edges in the graph. The edges are represented as tuples of three elements: the indices of the two nodes connected by the edge, and the weight of the edge.

<<<Output>>>
3 5
1 2 2
1 2 0
2 3 1
2 3 0
3 3 2
