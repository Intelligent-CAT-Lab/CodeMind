The output of the code will be the factorial of the larger number between n and m, multiplied by 2 if n and m are equal, or 1 if n and m are not equal. The result is taken modulo 10^9 + 7 to prevent it from being too large to be handled by most computers.

For the input `2 2`, the output would be `4` because 2*2 = 4.
