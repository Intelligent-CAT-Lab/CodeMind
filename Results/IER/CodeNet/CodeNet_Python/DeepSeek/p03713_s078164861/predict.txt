The given code is a Python program that calculates the minimum difference between the maximum and minimum areas of three rectangles in a grid. The grid is a 2D plane with H rows and W columns. The three rectangles are:

1. The first rectangle is the largest rectangle that can be formed by dividing the grid into two equal parts vertically.
2. The second rectangle is the largest rectangle that can be formed by dividing the remaining part of the grid into two equal parts horizontally.
3. The third rectangle is the remaining part of the grid.

The program first calculates the area of each rectangle for different heights of the first rectangle and updates the minimum difference between the maximum and minimum areas. It then does the same for the rotated grid.

The input to the program is two integers H and W, the number of rows and columns in the grid.

The output of the program is the minimum difference between the maximum and minimum areas of the three rectangles.

The code uses the `sys.stdin.readline().strip()` function to read the input, which is a more efficient way to read input in Python compared to `input()`. The `INT()`, `MAP()`, and `LIST()` functions are helper functions that read an integer, a space-separated list of integers, and a space-separated list of integers, respectively.

The `min` and `max` functions are used to find the minimum and maximum areas, and the difference between these two values is the minimum difference. The `range` function is used to iterate over different heights for the first rectangle.

The `//` operator is used for integer division, which discards the remainder and only keeps the quotient. The `%` operator is used for modulus, which gives the remainder of the division.

The `print` function is used to output the minimum difference.

The code also uses the `sys.setrecursionlimit` function to set the maximum recursion depth, which is used to prevent a stack overflow error. The `INF` constant is used to represent infinity.

The `min` and `max` functions are used to find the minimum and maximum areas, and the difference between these two values is the minimum difference.
