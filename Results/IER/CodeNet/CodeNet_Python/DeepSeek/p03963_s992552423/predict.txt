For the input `2 2`, the output would be `2`.

This is because there are 2 people and 2 colors available. The first person can choose from 2 colors (color1 and color2), and for the second person, he/she can choose from 1 color (color1 or color2, but not both, because color1 and color2 are the same). So, there are 2*1=2 ways to choose the colors for the 2 people.
