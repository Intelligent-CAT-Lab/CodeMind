### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
n,m,k=map(int,input().split())
ans="No"
for i in range(n//2+1):
  for j in range(m):
    o=i*j+(m-j)*(n-i)
    x=n*m-o
    if o==k or x==k:
      ans="Yes"
print(ans)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `2 2 2`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The given code takes three inputs n, m, and k. It initializes a variable ans to "No". Then it enters two nested loops, each loop iterating from 0 to n//2 and m respectively. For each pair of i and j, it calculates two values o and x. The value o is calculated by multiplying i and j, and then adding the remaining cells in the grid after removing the cells covered by i and j. The value x is calculated by subtracting o from the total number of cells in the grid. If either o or x equals k, it sets ans to "Yes". Finally, it prints the value of ans.

Given the input `2 2 2`, the total number of cells in the grid is 4. For each pair of i and j, the value o is calculated as follows:
- For i=0 and j=0, o=0.
- For i=0 and j=1, o=1.
- For i=0 and j=2, o=2.
- For i=1 and j=0, o=1.
- For i=1 and j=1, o=1.
- For i=1 and j=2, o=2.
The value x is calculated as 4-o for each pair of i and j.

The code checks if either o or x equals k (which is 2 in this case). If it does, it sets ans to "Yes". If no pair of i and j satisfies this condition, ans remains "No".

So, the output of the code would be "Yes" if there exists a pair of i and j that satisfies the conditions, and "No" otherwise.

<<<Output>>>
"Yes"
