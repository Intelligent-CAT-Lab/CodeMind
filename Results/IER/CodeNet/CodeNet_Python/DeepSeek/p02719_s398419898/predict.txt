The variable n, variable k are initialized to 7 and 4, respectively.
The modulus operator % is used to find the remainder of the division of n by k. This remainder is stored in the variable a.
The code then prints the minimum of n, a, and the absolute difference between a and k.
The minimum of n, a, and the absolute difference between a and k is the smallest number that is less than or equal to n and greater than or equal to 0.
This is because the modulus operation always returns a non-negative result and the absolute difference between a and k is always non-negative.
The minimum of these three numbers is the smallest number that is less than or equal to n and greater than or equal to 0.
This is because the modulus operation always returns a non-negative result and the absolute difference between a and k is always non-negative.
