### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
l = str(input());
s = l.split(',');
a = ''.join(s);
b = a.split('.');
c = ''.join(b);
d = c.split(' ');
L = [];
for i in range(0,len(d)):
    if len(d[i]) >= 3 and len(d[i]) <= 6:
        L.append(d[i]);
        
print(' '.join(L));

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `Rain, rain, go to Spain.`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The given code takes a string as input, splits it into a list of words, then filters out the words that have a length between 3 and 6. The filtered words are then joined back into a string and printed.

Let's consider the input string `Rain, rain, go to Spain.`.

1. The input string is read and stored in the variable `l`.
2. The string `l` is split into a list of words using the `split()` function. The result is stored in the variable `s`.
3. The list `s` is joined back into a string using the `join()` function. The result is stored in the variable `a`.
4. The string `a` is split into a list of characters using the `split()` function. The result is stored in the variable `b`.
5. The list `b` is joined back into a string using the `join()` function. The result is stored in the variable `c`.
6. The string `c` is split into a list of words using the `split()` function. The result is stored in the variable `d`.
7. An empty list `L` is initialized.
8. A loop is run over the list `d`. If the length of a word in `d` is between 3 and 6 (inclusive), it is added to the list `L`.
9. The list `L` is joined back into a string using the `join()` function. The result is printed.

The output of the code would be `rain, go to Spain`.

This is because the words `Rain`, `rain`, `go`, `to`, `Spain` are all 5 characters long, so they are added to the output. The words `,`, `.` are not added because they are not between 3 and 6 characters long.

<<<Output>>>
`rain, go to Spain`
