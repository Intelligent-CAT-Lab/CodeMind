The output will depend on the values of dx and dy. They are calculated as follows:

dx = min(4-0, 0-0) = 4
dy = min(4-0, 0-0) = 4

Then, the number of ways to choose dx+dy points from dx+dy points is calculated as follows:

comb(4+4, 4) = factorial(8) // factorial(8-4) // factorial(4) = 8*7*6*5*4*3*2*1 // 4*3*2*1 // 4*3*2*1 = 8*7*6*5 = 336

So the output would be 336 % 100000007 = 336.
