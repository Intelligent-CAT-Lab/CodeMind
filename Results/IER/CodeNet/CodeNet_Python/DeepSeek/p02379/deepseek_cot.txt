### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import math
x1, y1, x2, y2 = map(lambda x: float(x), input().split(" "))
print("{:f}".format(math.sqrt((x1 - x2) ** 2 + (y1 - y2) ** 2)))


<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `0 0 1 1`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four inputs x1, y1, x2, y2 which represent the coordinates of two points in a 2D plane. The distance between these two points is calculated using the Euclidean distance formula.

The Euclidean distance formula is: sqrt((x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2)

The input is given as four floating point numbers separated by spaces. The input() function is used to take the input from the user. The split() function is used to split the input string into a list of strings. The map() function is used to apply the lambda function to each element of the list, converting them to float.

The distance is calculated by subtracting the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of the two points and squaring the results. The sum of these squared differences is then calculated and the square root of this sum is taken to give the Euclidean distance.

The print statement formats the output to a float number with 6 decimal places.

<<<Output>>>
The output of the code execution with the input `0 0 1 1` would be `1.414214`.

This is because the distance between the points (0,0) and (1,1) in a 2D plane is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = 1.414214.
