### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
n, m = map(int, input().split())
ans1 = 1
ans2 = 1
mod = 10**9 + 7

if abs(n-m) >= 2:
    print(0)
    exit()


for i in range(1, n+1):
    ans1 *= i
    ans1 %= mod
for j in range(1, m+1):
    ans2 *= j
    ans2 %= mod

if abs(m-n) == 1:
    print(ans1 * ans2 % mod)
else:
    print(2 * ans1 * ans2 % mod)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `2 2`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n, m are initialized to the input values.
ans1 and ans2 are initialized to 1, which will be used to accumulate the product of numbers.
mod is initialized to 10**9 + 7, which is used to prevent overflow and to meet the problem's requirement.

The code then checks if the absolute difference between n and m is greater than or equal to 2. If it is, the code prints 0 and exits. This is because the number of ways to choose 2 elements from a set of n elements, where the difference between the 2 elements is greater than 1, is 0.

If the absolute difference between n and m is less than 2, the code enters two loops. The first loop multiplies ans1 by each number from 1 to n (inclusive), and the second loop multiplies ans2 by each number from 1 to m (inclusive). The modulo operation is used to keep the numbers within the range [0, mod-1].

If the absolute difference between m and n is 1, the code prints the product of ans1 and ans2 modulo mod. This is because the number of ways to choose 2 elements from a set of n elements, where the difference between the 2 elements is 1, is 2.

If the absolute difference between m and n is not 1, the code prints twice the product of ans1 and ans2 modulo mod. This is because the number of ways to choose 2 elements from a set of n elements, where the difference between the 2 elements is greater than 1, is 2n.

<<<Output>>>
The output of the code execution given the input `2 2` is 4.
