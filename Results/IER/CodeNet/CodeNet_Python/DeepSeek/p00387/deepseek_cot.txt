### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
l=input().split()
A=int(l[0])
B=int(l[1])
kimawasi=B//A
if B%A>0:
    kimawasi=kimawasi+1
print(kimawasi)

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `3 5`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs A and B, where A is the number of people in the group and B is the total number of apples. It calculates how many apples each person gets and how many apples are left over.

The number of apples each person gets is calculated by dividing B by A. The result is stored in the variable kimawasi.

If there are any apples left over (i.e., if B is not a multiple of A), 1 is added to kimawasi. This is because each person gets at least one apple and there are B%A apples left over.

Finally, the code prints the value of kimawasi, which is the number of apples each person gets and the number of apples left over.

<<<Output>>>
For the input `3 5`, the output would be `2`. This is because there are 3 people and 5 apples. Each person gets 5//3 = 2 apples and there are 5%3 = 2 apples left over.
