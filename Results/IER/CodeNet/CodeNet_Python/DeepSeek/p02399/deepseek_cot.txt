### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
a, b = map(int, raw_input().split())
 
print "%d %d %f" % (a / b, a % b, float(a)/ b)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `3 2`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, a and b, separated by a space. The first line of the code uses the `map` function to convert the input into two integers. The `raw_input().split()` function splits the input into two parts at each space. The `map` function then converts each part into an integer. The variables a and b are then assigned these values.

The second line of the code uses the `%` operator to calculate the division and modulus of a and b. The `/` operator calculates the integer division of a by b, which is the largest integer less than or equal to the exact division. The `%` operator calculates the remainder of the division of a by b.

The third line of the code uses the `float` function to convert a to a floating point number, then divides it by b. The result is printed as a floating point number.

The `print` function uses the `%` operator to format the output. The `%d` and `%f` are format specifiers for integers and floating point numbers, respectively. The variables are substituted into the string in the order they appear in the format specifiers.

The output of the code is the integer division of a by b, the remainder of the division of a by b, and the exact division of a by b, all as floating point numbers.

<<<Output>>>
1 1 1.500000
