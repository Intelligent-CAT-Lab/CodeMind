### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
n, x = (int(x) for x in input().split())
if x == 1 or x == 2 * n - 1:
    print("No")
    exit()

if n == 2:
    print("Yes")
    print(1)
    print(2)
    print(3)
    exit()

if x == 2:
    y = [3, 2, 1, 4]
else:
    y = [x - 1, x, x + 1, x - 2]

ANS = []
i = 1
while i < 2 * n:
    if len(ANS) == 2 * n - 1:
        break
    if i in y:
        i += 4
    if len(ANS) == n - 3:
        ANS += y
        if len(ANS) == 2 * n - 1:
            break
    ANS.append(i)
    i += 1

print("Yes")
for ans in ANS:
    print(ans)

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `4 4`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes two inputs n and x from the user. It then checks if x is either 1 or 2n-1. If it is, it prints "No" and exits the program.

If n is 2, it prints "Yes", then prints the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4.

If x is 2, it sets y to [3, 2, 1, 4]. If x is not 2, it sets y to [x-1, x, x+1, x-2].

The code then enters a while loop that continues until the length of ANS is 2n-1. Inside the loop, it checks if i is in y. If it is, it adds 4 to i. If the length of ANS is n-3, it adds y to ANS and checks if the length of ANS is 2n-1.

If none of these conditions are met, it adds i to ANS and adds 1 to i.

Finally, it prints "Yes" and then prints each number in ANS on a new line.

Given the input `4 4`, the output of the code would be:

```
Yes
1
4
2
5
3
6
7
8
```

This is because x is 4, so y is [3, 4, 5, 2]. The code then enters the while loop and adds the numbers 1, 4, 2, 5, 3, 6, 7, 8 to ANS.

<<<Output>>>
```
Yes
1
4
2
5
3
6
7
8
```
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

I hope this helps you understand how the code works and what the output will be. If you have any other questions, feel free to ask.
