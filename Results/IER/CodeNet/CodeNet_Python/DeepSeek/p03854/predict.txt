The code takes a string S as input. If the length of S is less than 5, it prints 'NO' and exits. Otherwise, it enters a loop that continues until it has checked all possible substrings of S.

The loop checks if the current substring is 'dream', 'erase', 'eraser', or 'dreamer'. If it is, it increments the index i by the length of the substring. If the current substring is 'dream' or 'erase', it further checks if the next substring is 'erd', 'ere', 'era', or 'd'. If it is, it increments the index i by the length of the next substring. If the current substring is 'erase', it further checks if the next substring is 'e' or 'd'. If it is, it increments the index i by the length of the next substring.

If the current substring is not 'dream', 'erase', 'eraser', or 'dreamer', or if the next substring is not 'erd', 'ere', 'era', 'e', or 'd', the code prints 'NO' and exits.

If the code has checked all possible substrings of S and has not printed 'YES', it prints 'NO' and exits.

The code checks substrings of S starting from the beginning, so it checks the longest substrings first.

The code uses a while loop with an exit condition to avoid unnecessary checks.

The code uses string slicing to get substrings of S.

The code uses the len() function to get the length of S and the substrings.
