### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
n=int(input())
m=(1<<32)-1

print("{:032b}".format(n))
print("{:032b}".format(~n&m))
print("{:032b}".format(n<<1&m))
print("{:032b}".format(n>>1))

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `8`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The first line of the code reads an integer input from the user and stores it in the variable `n`.

The second line initializes the variable `m` to be a 32-bit mask, which is a number with all bits set to 1. This is done by shifting the number 1 to the left by 32 places, and subtracting 1.

The next four lines print the binary representation of `n`, `~n & m`, `n << 1 & m`, and `n >> 1` respectively.

`~n & m` is the binary complement of `n` and `m`, which is the result of performing a bitwise AND operation between the binary complement of `n` and `m`.

`n << 1 & m` is `n` shifted left by 1 bit, and the result is then bitwise ANDed with `m`.

`n >> 1` is `n` shifted right by 1 bit.

The `format` function is used to format the binary representation of the numbers. The `{:032b}` format specifier is used to format the number in binary, padding it with zeros to a width of 32 characters.

Given the input `8`, the output of the code would be:

```
00000000000000000000000000001000
111111111111111111111111111101111
111111111111111111111111111100000
00000000000000000000000000010000
```

This is because `8` in binary is `1000`, its binary complement is `-9` (which is `111111111111111111111111111101111` in binary), shifting left by 1 bit gives `20` (`10100`), and shifting right by 1 bit gives `4` (`100`).
<<<Output>>>
```
00000000000000000000000000001000
111111111111111111111111111101111
111111111111111111111111111100000
00000000000000000000000000010000
```
