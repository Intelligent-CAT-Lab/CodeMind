For the input `4 10`, the code will print `2`.

This is because A is 4 and B is 10. The number of operations required to complete all elements in the set is 2. This is because each operation requires 2 elements from the set, and there are 10 elements in the set. So, the number of operations is B divided by A-1, which is 10 divided by 3, which is 2 and 1.
