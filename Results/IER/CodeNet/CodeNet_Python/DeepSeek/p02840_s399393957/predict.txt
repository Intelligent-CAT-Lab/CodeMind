The output of the code will depend on the input values of N, X, and D. The output is the number of integers between 1 and N (inclusive) that satisfy the condition given by the formula X + D*i (mod D) for some integer i.

For the input `3 4 2`, the output would be 4. The numbers that satisfy the condition are 1, 2, and 3.
