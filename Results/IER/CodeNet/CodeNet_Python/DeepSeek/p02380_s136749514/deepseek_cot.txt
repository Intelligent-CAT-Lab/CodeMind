You are an AI programming assistant, utilizing the Deepseek Coder model, developed by Deepseek Company, and you only answer questions related to computer science. For politically sensitive questions, security and privacy issues, and other non-computer science questions, you will refuse to answer.

### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
from enum import Enum
import sys
import math
 
BIG_NUM = 2000000000
MOD = 1000000007
EPS = 0.000000001
 
A,B,DEGREE = map(int,input().split())
 
rad = math.radians(DEGREE)
 
S = A*B*math.sin(rad)/2.0
C = math.sqrt(A*A+B*B-2*A*B*math.cos(rad))
h = 2*S/A
 
print("%.10f %.10f %.10f"%(S,A+B+C,h))

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `4 3 90`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}

### Response:
<<<Analysis>>>
The given code calculates the area of a trapezoid and the perimeter of a triangle, given the lengths of the two bases, the height of the trapezoid, and the angle between the bases.

The inputs are read from the standard input, which is expected to be three space-separated values: the lengths of the two bases A and B, and the angle DEGREE between the bases.

The area of a trapezoid is calculated using the formula `(A + B) * h / 2`, where `h` is the height of the trapezoid. The height is calculated as `2 * Area of the trapezoid / Base`.

The perimeter of the triangle is calculated using the formula `sqrt((A + B + C) * (-A + B + C) * (A - B + C) * (A + B - C))`, where `C` is the length of the third side of the triangle.

The code first converts the angle from degrees to radians using the `math.radians` function. Then it calculates the area of the trapezoid and the height using the formulas above. Finally, it calculates the perimeter of the triangle and prints the area of the trapezoid, the perimeter of the triangle, and the height of the trapezoid.

The output is printed with 10 decimal places using the `"%.10f"` format specifier.

Given the input `4 3 90`, the code first converts the angle from degrees to radians, which is `1.5707963267948966`. Then it calculates the area of the trapezoid and the height, which are `6.0000000000` and `3.0000000000`, respectively. Finally, it calculates the perimeter of the triangle, which is `12.0000000000`. So, the output of the code would be `6.0000000000 12.0000000000 3.0000000000`.

<<<Output>>>
6.0000000000 12.0000000000 3.0000000000
