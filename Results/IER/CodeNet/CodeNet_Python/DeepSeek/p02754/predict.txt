The output of the code execution for the input `8 3 4` would be `8`.

This is because:
- The sum of a and b is `7`.
- The integer division of n by the sum of a and b is `1`, so k is `1`.
- The remainder of the division of n by the sum of a and b is `1`, so p is `1`.
- The minimum of p and a is `1`, so `1*3` is added to the result, which gives `3`.
- The result of k*a is `1*3`, which is `3`.
- So, the final result is `3+1`, which is `4`.

However, the problem statement says that the output should be `8`. This discrepancy is likely due to a mistake in the problem statement. The correct output should be `4`, not `8`.

So, the corrected output of the code execution for the input `8 3 4` would be `4`.
