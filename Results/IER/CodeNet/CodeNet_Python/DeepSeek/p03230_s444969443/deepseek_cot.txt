### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def main():
	n = int(input())
	l = []
	i = 1
	while n > 0:
		n -= i
		t = i * (i - 1) // 2
		l += [list(range(t + 1, t + i + 1))]
		i += 1
	if n < 0:
		print("No")
		exit()
	print("Yes")
	i -= 1
	ans = [i + 1] + [i] + [l[j][-1] for j in range(i)]
	for j in range(i):
		ans += [i] + l[j] + [l[k][j] for k in range(j + 1, i)]
	print(" ".join(map(str, ans)))
	
if __name__=="__main__":
	main()

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `3`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response:
<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by taking an integer input `n`. This integer represents the number of rows in the output triangle. The code then initializes an empty list `l` and a variable `i` to 1.

The code then enters a while loop that continues until `n` is less than or equal to 0. Inside the loop, `n` is reduced by `i` and a value `t` is calculated as `i * (i - 1) // 2`. This value represents the starting point of each row in the triangle.

The code then appends a list of integers from `t + 1` to `t + i` to the list `l`. This list represents a row in the triangle.

If `n` becomes less than 0 during the loop, the code prints "No" and exits.

If the loop completes without `n` becoming less than 0, the code prints "Yes". It then calculates the final output list `ans`. The first element of `ans` is `i + 1`, followed by `i` repeated `i` times. Then, for each `j` from 0 to `i - 1`, it appends `i`, the `j`th row of `l`, and the `k`th row of `l` for `k` from `j + 1` to `i - 1`.

Finally, it prints `ans` as a space-separated string.

Given the input `3`, the output of the code would be:

"Yes"
"3 2 1 2 3 3 4 4 5 5 6"

This is because the input `3` represents a triangle with 3 rows. The first row has 1 element, the second row has 2 elements, and the third row has 3 elements. The elements of each row are the numbers from 1 to the number of elements in the row.

So the output is "Yes" followed by the elements of the triangle, each row separated by a space.

<<<Output>>>
"Yes"
"3 2 1 2 3 3 4 4 5 5 6"
