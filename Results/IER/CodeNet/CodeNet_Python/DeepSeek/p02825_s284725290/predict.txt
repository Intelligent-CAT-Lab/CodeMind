The code is generating a grid of characters based on the input number `n`. If `n` is 2, it prints -1 because there is no pattern for `n` = 2. If `n` is 3, it prints a 3x3 grid with the pattern `a3`. If `n` is an even number greater than 3, it generates a grid with the pattern `a21` and `a22`. If `n` is a multiple of 4 plus 1, it generates a grid with the pattern `a5`. If `n` is a multiple of 4 plus 3, it generates a grid with the pattern `a7`.

Given the input `6`, `n` is not 2, 3, or a multiple of 4 plus 1 or 3. So, `n` is a multiple of 4 plus 3. The code generates a 6x6 grid with the pattern `a7` and prints it.

Here is the output:

```
c c d d . .
. f f . . g e
. . h h . g i
j . . . k i
j l . . k .
m l . . n n .
```

This output represents a 6x6 grid where each character represents a different type of cell. The characters `c`, `d`, `f`, `h`, `j`, `l`, `m`, `n`, `o`, `p`, `q`, `r`, `s`, `t`, `u`, `v`, `w`, `x`, and `y` are used to represent different types of cells. The `.` character represents an empty cell.

Please note that the actual output may vary depending on the specific values of the patterns `a3`, `a21`, `a22`, `a5`, and `a7`.
