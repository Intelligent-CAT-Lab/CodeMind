The output of the code will be the equivalent resistance of the two resistors.

Let's calculate it:

1/1/2 = 2
1/1/3 = 3

So, the sum of these reciprocals is 5.

The reciprocal of the sum is 1/5 = 0.2.

So, the equivalent resistance of the two resistors is 0.2.

So, the output of the code will be `0.2`.
