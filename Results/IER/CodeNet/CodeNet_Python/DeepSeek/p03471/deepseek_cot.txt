### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
n,y=map(int,input().split())
for i in range(n+1):
    for j in range(n-i+1):
        if (y-(i*10000+j*5000))/1000==(n-i-j):
            print(str(i)+' '+str(j)+' '+str(n-i-j))
            exit()
print('-1 -1 -1')
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `9 45000`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The given code is a Python program that calculates the number of 10,000 yen bills and 5,000 yen bills needed to make up a certain amount of yen. The input to the program is the total amount of yen (y) and the number of 10,000 yen bills available (n).

The program starts by reading the input from the user. The input is a space-separated string, which is split into two parts: n and y. These are converted to integers and stored in the variables n and y, respectively.

The program then enters two nested loops. The outer loop iterates over the range of available 10,000 yen bills (from 0 to n). The inner loop iterates over the range of available 5,000 yen bills (from 0 to n-i).

For each combination of 10,000 yen bills and 5,000 yen bills, the program checks if the remaining amount after subtracting the total amount of 10,000 yen bills and 5,000 yen bills from the total amount of yen is equal to the number of 1,000 yen bills needed to make up the remaining amount.

If a match is found, the program prints the number of 10,000 yen bills, 5,000 yen bills, and 1,000 yen bills, and then exits the program.

If no match is found after checking all combinations, the program prints '-1 -1 -1' to indicate that no solution was found.

Given the input '9 45000', the program will check all combinations of 10,000 yen bills and 5,000 yen bills from 0 to 9. It will find that 4 10,000 yen bills, 0 5,000 yen bills, and 4 1,000 yen bills will make up 45,000 yen. So, the output of the program will be '4 0 4'.

<<<Output>>>
4 0 4
