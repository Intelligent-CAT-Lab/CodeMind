### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
L = int(input())

xs = []

for m in range(21):
    if (2 << m) > L:
        break
    xs.append((m+1, m+2, 0))
    xs.append((m+1, m+2, 1 << m))

b = 1 << m
x = L - b

for i in range(m - 1, -1, -1):
    c = 1 << i
    if x >= c:
        xs.append((i+1, m+1, b))
        x -= c
        b += c

print(m + 1, len(xs))

for x in xs:
    print(*x)

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `4`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The given code is a Python program that generates a sequence of tuples based on the input number L. The input number L is a power of 2. The program first initializes an empty list xs and a variable m to 21. It then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 20. For each iteration, it checks if 2 raised to the power of m is greater than L. If it is, it breaks the loop. Otherwise, it appends two tuples to the list xs. The first tuple contains three elements: the current value of m+1, m+2, and 0. The second tuple contains three elements: the current value of m+1, m+2, and 2 raised to the power of m. After the loop, it calculates the value of b as 2 raised to the power of m, the value of x as L minus b, and the value of m as the current value of m. It then enters another loop that iterates from m-1 to 0. For each iteration, it checks if x is greater than or equal to 2 raised to the power of i. If it is, it appends a tuple to the list xs, and updates x and b accordingly. Finally, it prints the value of m+1 and the length of the list xs. It also prints each tuple in the list xs.

Given the input `4`, the value of L is 4, which is 2 raised to the power of 2. The program first initializes m to 21 and xs to an empty list. It then enters the first loop, which iterates from 0 to 20. For each iteration, it checks if 2 raised to the power of m is greater than 4. Since 2 raised to the power of 2 is 4, it breaks the loop. After the loop, it calculates b as 2 raised to the power of 2, x as 4 minus b, and m as 2. It then enters the second loop, which iterates from 1 to 0. Since x is 0 at this point, the loop does not execute. Finally, it prints the value of m+1 (which is 3), the length of the list xs (which is 4), and each tuple in the list xs.

The output of the code would be:
```
3 4
1 2 0
1 2 1
2 3 2
3 1 3
```
This output indicates that the input number is 4, which is 2 raised to the power of 2. The program generates a sequence of 4 tuples. The first two tuples have the first two elements as 1 and 2, and the third element as 0. The next two tuples have the first two elements as 2 and 3, and the third element as 2 raised to the power of 1 and 2 raised to the power of 2 respectively.
<<<Output>>>
3 4
1 2 0
1 2 1
2 3 2
3 1 3

I hope this helps you understand how the code works and what the output will be for the given input.
