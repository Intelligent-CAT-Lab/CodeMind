### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
n = input()
op_cnt = len(n) - 1
for i in range(2 ** op_cnt):
  op = ['-'] * op_cnt#['-', '-', '-']
  for j in range(op_cnt):
    if ((i >> j) & 1):
      op[-1-j] = '+'
  formula = ''
  for p_n, p_o in zip(n, op + ['']):#(1,+),(2,+),(3,+),(4,'')
    formula += (p_n + p_o)
  if eval(formula) == 7:#'1+2+3+4'
    print(formula + '=7')
    break
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `1222`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The input is a string of numbers `1222`. The code first calculates the number of operations by subtracting 1 from the length of the input string. This is because for each digit in the input, there are two operations (either addition or subtraction) that can be performed on it.

The code then enters a loop that iterates over all possible combinations of operations. The number of iterations is 2 raised to the power of the number of operations. This is because for each digit, there are two possibilities (either add or subtract).

In each iteration, the code generates a list of operations. If the jth bit in the binary representation of the current iteration number is set, the jth operation is addition. Otherwise, it is subtraction.

The code then generates a formula by concatenating each digit from the input with its corresponding operation. If the result of evaluating this formula is 7, the code prints the formula and breaks the loop.

The output of the code will be a formula that adds up to 7, or an empty string if no such formula exists.

<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will depend on the input. For the input `1222`, the output will be `1+2+2-2+2=7`.
