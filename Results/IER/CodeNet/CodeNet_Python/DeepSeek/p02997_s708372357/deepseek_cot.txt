### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
#131_E
n,k=map(int,input().split())
edges=[[1,i] for i in range(2,n+1)]
cnt=(n-1)*(n-2)//2
ans=n-1
if cnt<k:
    print(-1)
else:
    for i in range(2,n):
        for j in range(i+1,n+1):
            if cnt>k:
                cnt-=1
                ans+=1
                edges.append([i,j])
            else:
                break
    print(ans)
    for edge in edges:
        print(*edge)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `5 3`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable `n` and `k` are initialized to the input values. `n` is the number of nodes in the graph, and `k` is the number of edges.

The variable `edges` is initialized to a list of edges connecting the first node to all other nodes. This is done by using a list comprehension, which creates a list of pairs `(1, i)` for `i` in the range from 2 to `n`.

The variable `cnt` is initialized to the number of possible edges that can be added to the graph. This is calculated by taking `(n-1)*(n-2)//2`, which represents the number of ways to choose 2 nodes out of `n-1` nodes.

The variable `ans` is initialized to `n-1`, which represents the number of edges initially added to the graph.

The code then checks if `cnt` is less than `k`. If it is, it prints `-1` and terminates.

If `cnt` is not less than `k`, the code enters a nested loop that iterates over all pairs of nodes `i` and `j`. For each pair, it checks if `cnt` is greater than `k`. If it is, it decrements `cnt`, increments `ans`, and adds the pair to `edges`. If `cnt` is not greater than `k`, it breaks the loop.

Finally, it prints the value of `ans` and all edges in `edges`.

<<<Output>>>
5 3
1
1 2
1 3
1 4
1 5
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

Note: The output is not correct as the number of edges and the edges themselves are not calculated correctly. The number of edges should be 3 and the edges should be `(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4)`.
