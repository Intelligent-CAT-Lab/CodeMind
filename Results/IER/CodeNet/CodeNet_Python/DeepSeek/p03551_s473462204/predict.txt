The output of the code will be the final score calculated based on the inputs provided by the user.

For the input `1 1`, the output would be `3800`.

This is because `n` is 1 and `m` is 1, so `submit` is `1*1900+(1-1)*100 = 1900`.

Then, `2**1 = 2`, so the final score is `1900*2 = 3800`.

So, the output of the code for the input `1 1` is `3800`.
