### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
n,m=map(int,input().split())
submit=m*1900+(n-m)*100
print(submit*2**m)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `1 1`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes two inputs from the user, separated by a space. The first input is stored in the variable `n` and the second input is stored in the variable `m`.

The variable `submit` is calculated by multiplying `m` by 1900 and adding `n-m` multiplied by 100. This calculation is based on the problem statement, which suggests that the total score is the sum of the scores of the `m` top-ranked participants multiplied by 1900, plus the sum of the scores of the remaining participants multiplied by 100.

Finally, the code calculates the final score by multiplying `submit` by 2 raised to the power of `m`. This calculation is based on the problem statement, which suggests that the final score is half the total score.

<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will be the final score calculated based on the inputs provided by the user.

For the input `1 1`, the output would be `3800`.

This is because `n` is 1 and `m` is 1, so `submit` is `1*1900+(1-1)*100 = 1900`.

Then, `2**1 = 2`, so the final score is `1900*2 = 3800`.

So, the output of the code for the input `1 1` is `3800`.
