Given the input 'gpg', the output of the code will be 1. The player wins the first round because the player has 1 point and the goblin has 0 points. The goblin loses the second round because the player has 2 points and the goblin has 1 point. The player wins the third round because the player has 3 points and the goblin has 1 point. So, the difference between the number of wins and losses is 2 - 1 = 1.
