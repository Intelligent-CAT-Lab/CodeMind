### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
n = input()

a = int(n[0])
b = int(n[1])
c = int(n[2])
d = int(n[3])

if (a+b+c+d) == 7:
    print(a, "+" ,b, "+" ,c, "+", d, "=7", sep="")
elif (a+b+c-d) == 7:
    print(a, "+" ,b, "+" ,c, "-", d, "=7", sep="")
elif (a+b-c+d) == 7:
    print(a, "+" ,b, "-" ,c, "+", d, "=7", sep="")
elif (a+b-c-d) == 7:
    print(a, "+" ,b, "-" ,c, "-", d, "=7", sep="")
elif (a-b+c+d) == 7:
    print(a, "-" ,b, "+" ,c, "+", d, "=7", sep="")
elif (a-b+c-d) == 7:
    print(a, "-" ,b, "+" ,c, "-", d, "=7", sep="")
elif (a-b-c+d) == 7:
    print(a, "-" ,b, "-" ,c, "+", d, "=7", sep="")
elif (a-b-c-d) == 7:
    print(a, "-" ,b, "-" ,c, "-", d, "=7", sep="")
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `1222`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The input is a 4-digit number. The first step is to separate the 4 digits from the input. We can do this by converting the input into an integer and then using integer division and modulus operations to separate the digits.

The code then checks for different combinations of addition and subtraction operations on the 4 digits. If any of the combinations equals 7, it prints the equation that equals 7.

For example, if the input is 1222, the digits are 1, 2, 2, 2. The code checks if 1+2+2+2 equals 7, if 1+2+2-2 equals 7, if 1+2-2+2 equals 7, and so on. If any of these conditions is met, it prints the corresponding equation.

If no conditions are met, it prints "No solution found".

<<<Output>>>
1+2+2-2=7
