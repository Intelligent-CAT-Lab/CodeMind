The output of the code will depend on the specific values of `a` and `b`. If `a` and `b` are the same, the output will be an empty string, as the root node is already at the target values. If `a` is greater than `b`, the output will be a string of 'A's followed by 'B's. If `b` is greater than `a`, the output will be a string of 'B's followed by 'A's.

For the input `2 2`, the output will be an empty string, as the root node is already at the target values.
