The variable K is initialized to the input integer.

If K is divisible by 7 (K % 7 == 0), then L is set to 9 times K divided by 7. Otherwise, L is set to 9 times K.

The variable ans is initialized to -1, which will be used to store the number of iterations until the remainder of n divided by L is 1.

The variable n is initialized to 10.

The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to L. For each iteration, it calculates the remainder of n divided by L and stores it in surplus. If surplus is 1, it sets ans to the current iteration number and breaks the loop. Otherwise, it sets n to 10 times surplus and continues the loop.

After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans.

The loop continues until the remainder of n divided by L is 1, which means that the number n is a multiple of L plus 1.

The number of iterations in the loop is the smallest number of times that n is a multiple of L plus 1.

If K is divisible by 7, then L is 9 times K divided by 7. Otherwise, L is 9 times K.
