For the input `2 2`, the output would be `2`.

Explanation: There are 2 colors (K) and we need to distribute them to 2 people (N). So, the possible ways are either both people get color 1 and the other gets color 2 or both people get color 2 and the other gets color 1. So, the total number of ways is 2.
