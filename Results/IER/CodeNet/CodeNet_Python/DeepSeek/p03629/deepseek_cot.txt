### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>

<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

### Response
The given Python code is a solution for a problem on AtCoder, a platform for competitive programming. The problem is to find the shortest string that can be obtained by removing some characters from the given string while maintaining the relative order of characters.

The code works by iterating over the string from left to right, and for each character, it checks if the current character is the same as the next character in the string. If it is, it removes the current character and continues with the next character. If it's not, it keeps the current character and continues with the next character.

The input string is `atcoderregularcontest`. The code will output the shortest string that can be obtained by removing some characters from this string while maintaining the relative order of characters.

The analysis of the code is as follows:

1. The function `read_str` reads a string from the input.
2. The function `solve_case` is the main function that solves the problem. It first converts the input string to a list of integers, where each integer represents the index of the corresponding character in the alphabet.
3. The function `make_list` creates a list of a given shape and fills it with a given value.
4. The function `next_char_pos` calculates the position of the next occurrence of each character in the string.
5. The function `non_subseq_len` calculates the length of the shortest "non subsequence" in the string.
6. The function `main` calls `solve_case` and writes the result to the output.

The output of the code will be the shortest string that can be obtained by removing some characters from the input string while maintaining the relative order of characters.

Please note that the actual output of the code will depend on the input string.
