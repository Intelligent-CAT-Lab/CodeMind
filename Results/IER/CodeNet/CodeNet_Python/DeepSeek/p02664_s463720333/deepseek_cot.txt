### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import sys

sys.setrecursionlimit(10 ** 7)
f_inf = float('inf')
mod = 10 ** 9 + 7


def resolve():
    t = input()
    res = t.replace("?", "D")
    print(res)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    resolve()

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `PD?D??P`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The given Python code is a simple string replacement program. It takes an input string `t` and replaces all occurrences of the character `"?"` with the character `"D"`. The output string is then printed.

The input string `PD?D??P` is given.

The code starts by setting the recursion limit to 10^7, which is a large number that ensures that the recursion won't cause a stack overflow error. This is not necessary for this specific code, but it's a good practice to set a high recursion limit for programs that use recursion.

The `f_inf` variable is set to infinity, which is used as a placeholder for infinity in calculations.

The `mod` variable is set to 10^9 + 7, which is a common modulo value used in competitive programming.

The `resolve` function is defined. This function takes no arguments and returns nothing. Inside this function, the input string `t` is read. The `replace` method is then used to replace all occurrences of `"?"` in `t` with `"D"`. The result is stored in the variable `res`. Finally, `res` is printed.

If the script is run as the main program (not imported as a module), the `resolve` function is called.

<<<Output>>>
The output of the code would be: `PD?D??P` with all `?` replaced by `D`, so the output would be `PD?D??P`.
