The code first takes two inputs N and K from the user. N is the number of nodes in the graph, and K is the number of edges. The code then calculates the maximum number of edges that can be formed in a graph with N nodes. If K is greater than this maximum number, the code prints -1 and exits.

If K is less than or equal to the maximum number of edges, the code then generates the edges of the graph. The edges are stored in the list edge. The edges are represented as tuples of two integers. The first integer is the source node of the edge, and the second integer is the destination node of the edge.

The code then prints the number of edges in the graph, which is the length of the list edge. Then, for each edge in the list, it prints the source node and the destination node of the edge.

The maximum number of edges in a graph with N nodes is given by the formula (N-1)*(N-2)//2. This formula is derived from the fact that in a graph, each node can be connected to (N-1) other nodes, and the number of edges is the number of pairs of these nodes.

The code then generates the edges of the graph by creating a list of tuples representing the edges. The tuples are created by taking all pairs of nodes that are not connected. The number of edges generated is K.

The code then prints the number of edges in the graph, which is the length of the list edge. Then, for each edge in the list, it prints the source node and the destination node of the edge.
