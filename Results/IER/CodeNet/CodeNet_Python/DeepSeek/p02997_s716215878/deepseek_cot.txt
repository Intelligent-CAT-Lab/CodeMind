You are an AI programming assistant, utilizing the Deepseek Coder model, developed by Deepseek Company, and you only answer questions related to computer science. For politically sensitive questions, security and privacy issues, and other non-computer science questions, you will refuse to answer.

### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
#maspyさんの神解答
import itertools
N,K = map(int,input().split())
x = (N-1)*(N-2)//2
if x < K:
    print(-1)
    exit()

edge = [(1,n) for n in range(2,N+1)]
edge += list(itertools.combinations(range(2,N+1),2))[:x-K]

print(len(edge))
for x,y in edge:
    print(x,y)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `5 3`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes two inputs N and K from the user. N is the number of nodes in the graph, and K is the number of edges. The code then calculates the maximum number of edges that can be formed in a graph with N nodes. If K is greater than this maximum number, the code prints -1 and exits.

If K is less than or equal to the maximum number of edges, the code then generates the edges of the graph. The edges are stored in the list edge. The edges are represented as tuples of two integers. The first integer is the source node of the edge, and the second integer is the destination node of the edge.

The code then prints the number of edges in the graph, which is the length of the list edge. Then, for each edge in the list, it prints the source node and the destination node of the edge.

The maximum number of edges in a graph with N nodes is given by the formula (N-1)*(N-2)//2. This formula is derived from the fact that in a graph, each node can be connected to (N-1) other nodes, and the number of edges is the number of pairs of these nodes.

The code then generates the edges of the graph by creating a list of tuples representing the edges. The tuples are created by taking all pairs of nodes that are not connected. The number of edges generated is K.

The code then prints the number of edges in the graph, which is the length of the list edge. Then, for each edge in the list, it prints the source node and the destination node of the edge.
