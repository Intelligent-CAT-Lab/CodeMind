### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

x, y = map(int, input().split())

result = 0

if x == 1:
    result += 300000
elif x == 2:
    result += 200000
elif x == 3:
    result += 100000

if y == 1:
    result += 300000
elif y == 2:
    result += 200000
elif y == 3:
    result += 100000
    
if x == 1 and y == 1:
    result += 400000
    
print(result)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `1 1`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes two integers as input, separated by a space. These integers are stored in the variables x and y.

The variable result is initialized to 0. This variable will be used to accumulate the total prize money.

The code then checks the value of x. If x is 1, the code adds 300000 to the result. If x is 2, the code adds 200000 to the result. If x is 3, the code adds 100000 to the result.

The code then checks the value of y. If y is 1, the code adds 300000 to the result. If y is 2, the code adds 200000 to the result. If y is 3, the code adds 100000 to the result.

If x and y are both 1, the code adds an additional 400000 to the result.

Finally, the code prints the value of result, which is the total prize money.

<<<Output>>>
If the input is `1 1`, the output will be `800000`. This is because the code adds 300000 (from x and y both being 1) to the result, and then adds an additional 400000 (since x and y are both 1). So the total prize money is 800000.
