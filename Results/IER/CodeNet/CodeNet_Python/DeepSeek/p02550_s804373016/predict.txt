The input given is `6 2 1001`. The first number `6` is the number of elements in the sequence, `2` is the initial value of the sequence, and `1001` is the modulo value.

The code first initializes a list with the initial value `X`. Then it enters a loop that runs `N-1` times. In each iteration, it calculates the square of `X` modulo `M` and stores the result back into `X`. It then checks if `X` is already in the list. If it is, it breaks the loop. Otherwise, it appends `X` to the list.

After the loop, if the length of the list is equal to `N`, it simply prints the sum of all elements in the list. Otherwise, it calculates the length of the loop and the remaining elements to be added, and adds these to the sum of the list. The result is then printed.

The calculation of the length of the loop and the remaining elements to be added is based on the fact that the sequence repeats after a certain point. The length of the loop is the number of elements in the sequence before the repetition, and the remaining elements to be added is the number of elements in the sequence after the repetition.

The calculation of the sum of the list is done using the `sum` function, which calculates the sum of all elements in the list. The `index` function is used to find the index of the first occurrence of `X` in the list.

The `%` operator is used for the modulo operation, which calculates the remainder of the division of the two operands.

The `//` operator is used for the integer division operation, which calculates the quotient of the division of the two operands.

The `**` operator is used for the exponentiation operation, which raises the first operand to the power of the second operand.

The `in` operator is used to check if a value is in a list.

The `append` method is used to add an element to the end of a list.

The `len` function is used to get the length of a list.

The `print` function is used to output the result.
