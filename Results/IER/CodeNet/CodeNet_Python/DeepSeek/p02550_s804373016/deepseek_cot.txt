### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
N,X,M = map(int,input().split())

List = [X]

for i in range(N-1):
    X = X**2 % M
    if X in List:
        #配列の何番目か
        num = i + 1
        #同じ数字
        key = List.index(X)
        break
    List.append(X)

ans = sum(List)
if len(List) == N:
    print(ans)

else:
    loop = (N - len(List)) // (num - key)
    add = (N - len(List)) % (num - key)

    ans += (N - len(List)) // (num - key) * sum(List[key:num])
    ans += sum(List[key:key+((N - len(List)) % (num - key))])

    print(ans)

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `6 2 1001`?

Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The input given is `6 2 1001`. The first number `6` is the number of elements in the sequence, `2` is the initial value of the sequence, and `1001` is the modulo value.

The code first initializes a list with the initial value `X`. Then it enters a loop that runs `N-1` times. In each iteration, it calculates the square of `X` modulo `M` and stores the result back into `X`. It then checks if `X` is already in the list. If it is, it breaks the loop. Otherwise, it appends `X` to the list.

After the loop, if the length of the list is equal to `N`, it simply prints the sum of all elements in the list. Otherwise, it calculates the length of the loop and the remaining elements to be added, and adds these to the sum of the list. The result is then printed.

The calculation of the length of the loop and the remaining elements to be added is based on the fact that the sequence repeats after a certain point. The length of the loop is the number of elements in the sequence before the repetition, and the remaining elements to be added is the number of elements in the sequence after the repetition.

The calculation of the sum of the list is done using the `sum` function, which calculates the sum of all elements in the list. The `index` function is used to find the index of the first occurrence of `X` in the list.

The `%` operator is used for the modulo operation, which calculates the remainder of the division of the two operands.

The `//` operator is used for the integer division operation, which calculates the quotient of the division of the two operands.

The `**` operator is used for the exponentiation operation, which raises the first operand to the power of the second operand.

The `in` operator is used to check if a value is in a list.

The `append` method is used to add an element to the end of a list.

The `len` function is used to get the length of a list.

The `print` function is used to output the result.

The `sum` function is used to calculate the sum of a list.

The `index` method is used to get the index of a value in a list.

The `range` function is used to generate a sequence of numbers.

The `for` loop is used to iterate over a sequence of numbers.

The `if` statement is used to conditionally execute code.

The `break` statement is used to exit a loop prematurely.

The `else` clause is used to execute code when a loop finishes normally.

The `:` operator is used to slice a list.

The `+=` operator is used to add a value to a variable and assign the result back to the variable.
