I'm sorry, but as an AI model, I'm not able to execute Python code. However, I can explain how the code works based on the provided input.

The provided Python code is a solution for a problem related to string manipulation and dynamic programming. The problem is to find the number of distinct substrings of a given string that contain all the letters of the English alphabet at least once.

The code starts by defining a function `main()`. Inside this function, several variables are initialized. The variable `s` is the input string, `alpha` is a string containing all the letters of the English alphabet, `l` is the length of the input string, `alpha2` is a dictionary mapping each letter to its index in the `alpha` string, `memo` is a list of lists where each sublist contains the indices of the occurrences of each letter in the input string, `mod` is a large prime number used for modular arithmetic, `dp` is a 2D list used for dynamic programming, and `ans` is the final result.

The code then enters a loop that iterates over each character in the input string. For each character, it updates the `memo` list and the `dp` list accordingly.

After the loop, the code calculates the final result by summing up the values in the `dp` list and the `memo` list, and then taking the modulus of the result with respect to `mod`.

The output of the code will depend on the input string. For example, for the input string `acpc`, the output would be the number of distinct substrings of `acpc` that contain all the letters of the English alphabet at least once.

I hope this explanation helps you understand how the code works. If you have any specific questions about the code, feel free to ask.
