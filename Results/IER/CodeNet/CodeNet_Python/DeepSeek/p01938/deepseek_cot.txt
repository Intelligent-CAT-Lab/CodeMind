### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
S = input()

alpha = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"
Now = 0
ans = 0
for s in S:
    Next = alpha.find(s)
    # print(s, Now, Next)

    if(Now < Next):
        pass
    else:
        ans += 1
    Now = Next
print(ans)

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `AIZU`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The given code is used to count the number of times the alphabet sequence is not in ascending order. The input string S is taken as input.

The variable alpha is a string containing all the uppercase alphabets. Now and ans are initialized to 0. Now is used to store the position of the previous character in the string S and ans is used to store the count of the number of times the alphabet sequence is not in ascending order.

The code then enters a loop that iterates over each character s in the string S. The position of the current character in the string alpha is stored in the variable Next.

If Now is less than Next, it means that the alphabet sequence is in ascending order. If Now is not less than Next, it means that the alphabet sequence is not in ascending order, so ans is incremented by 1.

Finally, the code prints the value of ans, which is the count of the number of times the alphabet sequence is not in ascending order.

The input string S is "AIZU". The code will count the number of times the alphabet sequence is not in ascending order in the string S.

<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will be 0 because the string "AIZU" is in ascending order.
