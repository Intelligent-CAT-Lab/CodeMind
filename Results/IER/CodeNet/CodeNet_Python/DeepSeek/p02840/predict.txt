I'm sorry, but as an AI, I'm not able to execute Python code. However, I can provide you with an analysis of the code you provided.

The code you provided is a Python program that calculates the sum of numbers in a given range (N) that satisfy a certain condition based on the sum of their digits. The condition is that the sum of the digits of the number is between A and B (inclusive).

The input to the program is three integers: N, A, and B. The program initializes a variable sum_1 to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.

The program then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive). For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order. If sum_order is within the range [A, B], the program adds the current number i to sum_1.

After the loop finishes, the program prints the final value of sum_1, which is the sum of all numbers in the range that meet the condition.

For the input `20 2 5`, the output would be 84, as the numbers that meet the condition are 2, 3, 4, 5, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 20.

I hope this helps in understanding the code and its output. If you have any further questions, feel free to ask.
