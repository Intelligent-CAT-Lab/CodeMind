### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
x = int(input())
if int(x**0.2)==int(x)**0.2:
  print(int(x**0.2),0)
  exit()
for i in range(1,10**5):
  b = i
  c = -i
  x1 = x + b**5
  x2 = x + c**5
  if x1>=0 and int(x1**0.2)**5==x1:
    print(int(x1**0.2),b)
    exit()
  if x2>=0 and int(x2**0.2)**5==x2:
    print(int(x2**0.2),c)
    exit()
  if x2<0:
    for j in range(1,10**3):
      v = -j
      if v**5==x2:
        print(v,c)
        exit()
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `33`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an input x. It then checks if the square root of x to the power of 0.2 is an integer. If it is, it prints the square root of x and 0. If not, it enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 100000. For each iteration, it calculates two values x1 and x2 by adding i to the power of 5 to x and stores them in x1 and x2 respectively. It then checks if x1 is a non-negative number and if the square root of x1 to the power of 0.2 is an integer. If both conditions are met, it prints the square root of x1 and i. If not, it checks if x2 is a non-negative number and if the square root of x2 to the power of 0.2 is an integer. If both conditions are met, it prints the square root of x2 and the negative of i. If x2 is still not a non-negative number, it enters another loop that iterates from 1 to 1000. It checks if the negative of j to the power of 5 is equal to x2. If it is, it prints the negative of j and the negative of i.

Given the input 33, the code first checks if the square root of 33 to the power of 0.2 is an integer. Since 33 is not a perfect square, it enters the loop. For i in the range from 1 to 100000, it calculates x1 and x2. For each i, it checks if x1 is a non-negative number and if the square root of x1 to the power of 0.2 is an integer. If it is, it prints the square root of x1 and i and exits the program. If x1 does not meet the conditions, it checks if x2 is a non-negative number and if the square root of x2 to the power of 0.2 is an integer. If it is, it prints the square root of x2 and the negative of i and exits the program. If x2 does not meet the conditions, it checks if the negative of j to the power of 5 is equal to x2. If it is, it prints the negative of j and the negative of i and exits the program.

The output of the code given the input 33 would be (3, 1), because 33 + 1**5 = 34, and 34**0.2 = 3, which is an integer.

<<<Output>>>
(3, 1)
