The given Python code is a polynomial equation solver. It takes a string input representing a polynomial equation, and then it finds the roots of the equation.

Here's how the code works:

1. The input string is first parsed to extract the coefficients of the polynomial equation. The coefficients are stored in the list `P`.

2. The `f(P, x)` function calculates the value of the polynomial equation for a given `x`.

3. The `f(P, x)` function is then called for a range of `x` values (from -2000 to 2000) to find the roots of the equation. If the result of `f(P, x)` is 0, then `x` is a root of the equation.

4. The roots are stored in the list `R`.

5. Finally, the roots are printed in a specific format. Each root is printed as `(x+d)` or `(x-d)`, where `d` is the root value.

Given the input `x^2+3x+2`, the output of the code would be `(x+2)`.

This is because the equation `x^2+3x+2=0` has a root `x=-3`.

So, the output of the code would be `(x-3)`.

Here is the output:

```python
(x-3)
```

This output means that the root of the equation `x^2+3x+2=0` is `x=-3`.
