### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b = map(int,input().split())
MASK = (1 << 32)-1
print("{:032b}".format(a & b))
print("{:032b}".format(a | b))
print("{:032b}".format(a ^ b))

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `8 10`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The given code is performing bitwise operations on two integers, a and b. The input is taken from the user where a and b are separated by a space.

The first operation is a bitwise AND operation. The bitwise AND operation is performed on the binary representations of a and b. The result is a binary number where each bit is set if the corresponding bit in a and b is set.

The second operation is a bitwise OR operation. The bitwise OR operation is performed on the binary representations of a and b. The result is a binary number where each bit is set if the corresponding bit in a or b is set.

The third operation is a bitwise XOR operation. The bitwise XOR operation is performed on the binary representations of a and b. The result is a binary number where each bit is set if the corresponding bit in a and b is different.

The MASK is used to limit the output to 32 bits. This is done by shifting the bits of 1 to the left by 32 places and subtracting 1. This results in a number where all bits are set except the least significant bit.

The output of the code is the binary representation of the results of the bitwise AND, OR, and XOR operations.

The input given is `8 10`. The binary representation of 8 is `1000` and the binary representation of 10 is `1010`.

The bitwise AND operation will result in `1000` because only the last two bits of 8 and 10 are set.

The bitwise OR operation will result in `1010` because at least one bit of 8 or 10 is set.

The bitwise XOR operation will result in `0010` because exactly one bit of 8 and 10 is set.

The output of the code will be:
```
00000000000000000000000000001000
00000000000000000000000000001010
00000000000000000000000000000010
```

<<<Output>>>
```
00000000000000000000000000001000
00000000000000000000000000001010
00000000000000000000000000000010
```
