### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>

<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
n = str(input().rstrip())

def solve1(n):
    ans = 0

    a = list(map(int, list(n)))
    a = a[::-1]
    a.append(0)
    for i in range(len(a) - 1):
        c = a[i]
        if c < 5:
            ans += c
        else:
            if c == 5 and a[i+1] < 5:
                ans += 5
            else:
                a[i+1] += 1
                ans += 10 - c
    ans += n_list[-1]

    print(ans)

def solve2(n):
    INF = 10**9
    n = n[::-1]
    n += '0'
    n_len = len(n)
    dp = [[INF for _ in range(2)] for _ in range(n_len+1)]
    dp[0][0] = 0

    for i in range(n_len):
        for j in range(2):
            x = int(n[i])
            x += j
            if x < 10:
                dp[i+1][0] = min(dp[i+1][0], dp[i][j]+x)
            if x > 0:
                dp[i+1][1] = min(dp[i+1][1], dp[i][j]+(10-x))

    print(dp[n_len][0])
solve2(n)

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `36`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The given code is a Python program that takes an integer as input and calculates the minimum possible sum of digits of the integer. The program has two functions, solve1 and solve2.

The solve1 function calculates the minimum possible sum of digits by iterating through the digits of the number from right to left. If the digit is less than 5, it is added to the sum. If the digit is 5 or more, 5 is added to the sum and the next digit is incremented by 1.

The solve2 function uses dynamic programming to calculate the minimum possible sum of digits. It creates a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the minimum possible sum of the first i digits where the last digit is j. The function then iterates through the digits of the number from right to left, updating the dp array accordingly. Finally, it prints the minimum possible sum of the digits.

Given the input `36`, the program will call the solve2 function and print the minimum possible sum of the digits of 36.

<<<Output>>>
The output will be the minimum possible sum of the digits of 36.

Please note that the actual output will depend on the specific implementation of the solve2 function.
