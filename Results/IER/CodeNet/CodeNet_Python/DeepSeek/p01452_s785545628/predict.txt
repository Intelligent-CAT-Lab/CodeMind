The output of the code will be the number of ways to choose 6 objects from a set of 10 objects (6+4+2*0=10) where 6 objects are chosen at a time, modulo 10^9+7.

This is a complex problem that involves a lot of mathematical calculations and number theory. The code uses factorials and combinations to solve the problem. The output will be a number that represents the number of ways to choose 6 objects from a set of 10 objects where 6 objects are chosen at a time, modulo 10^9+7.

Please note that the actual output of the code will depend on the specific values of N, M, and K. The output is just a theoretical example based on the input given.
