The variable K, variable A and variable B are initialized to 4000, 2000 and 500, respectively.

The code then checks if K is less than or equal to A. If it is, it prints 1. This is because it is impossible to reach the target K with only A-sized steps.

If K is not less than or equal to A, it then checks if A is less than or equal to B. If it is, it prints -1. This is because it is impossible to reach the target K with A-sized steps and B-sized leaps.

If K is neither less than or equal to A nor A is less than or equal to B, it calculates the number of leaps needed to reach the target K. This is done by subtracting B from K, subtracting 1, and dividing the result by the difference between A and B. The result is then rounded up to the nearest integer. This number is then doubled and 1 is subtracted to get the number of steps. The result is then printed.

This calculation is done because each leap requires two steps: one step of size A and one step of size B. The number of leaps is the number of times that can be done to reach the target K.

The calculation is done by subtracting B from K, subtracting 1, and dividing the result by the difference between A and B. The result is then rounded up to the nearest integer. This number is then doubled and 1 is subtracted to get the number of steps. The result is then printed.

This calculation is done because each leap requires two steps: one step of size A and one step of size B. The number of leaps is the number of times that can be done to reach the target K.
