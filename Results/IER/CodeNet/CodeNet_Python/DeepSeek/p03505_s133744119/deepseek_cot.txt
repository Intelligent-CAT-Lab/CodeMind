### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
# coding:utf-8

K, A, B = map(int, raw_input().split())
if K <=A:
    print 1

elif A <= B:
    print -1
else:
    x = (K-B-1)/(A-B)+1
    print 2*x-1
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `4000 2000 500`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable K, variable A and variable B are initialized to 4000, 2000 and 500, respectively.

The code then checks if K is less than or equal to A. If it is, it prints 1. This is because it is impossible to reach the target K with only A-sized steps.

If K is not less than or equal to A, it then checks if A is less than or equal to B. If it is, it prints -1. This is because it is impossible to reach the target K with A-sized steps and B-sized leaps.

If K is neither less than or equal to A nor A is less than or equal to B, it calculates the number of leaps needed to reach the target K. This is done by subtracting B from K, subtracting 1, and dividing the result by the difference between A and B. The result is then rounded up to the nearest integer. This number is then doubled and 1 is subtracted to get the number of steps. The result is then printed.

This calculation is done because each leap requires two steps: one step of size A and one step of size B. The number of leaps is the number of times that can be done to reach the target K.
