### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
'''
Doubling

nxt[i][r] = the value of r mod M after 2 ** i squaring
dp[i][r] = the sum of sequence of lenght 2 ** i starting from r

We split sequence A into multiple disjoint parts, 
where the lengths of each parts are the binary decomposition of N.

e.g.
N = 11 = 1 + 2 + 8
A = A[0:1], A[1:3], A[3:11]
Sum of each parts are:
sum(A[0:1]) = dp[0][A[0] % M]
sum(A[1:3]) = dp[1][A[1] % M]
sum(A[3:11]) = dp[3][A[3] % M]
'''

import math

N, X, M = map(int, input().split())

H = math.ceil(math.log2(N)) + 1

nxt = [[0] * M for _ in range(H)]
dp = [[0] * M for _ in range(H)]
nxt[0] = [r ** 2 % M for r in range(M)]
dp[0] = list(range(M))

for i in range(1, H):
    for r in range(M):
        nxt[i][r] = nxt[i - 1][nxt[i - 1][r]]
        dp[i][r] = dp[i - 1][r] + dp[i - 1][nxt[i - 1][r]]

ans = 0
r = X % M
for i in range(H):
    if N & (1 << i):
        ans += dp[i][r]
        r = nxt[i][r]
print(ans)


<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `6 2 1001`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The input given is `6 2 1001`.

The first number `6` is the length of the sequence `A`. The second number `2` is the starting point of the sequence `A`. The third number `1001` is the modulo number `M`.

The code first calculates the highest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `N`. This is used to split the sequence `A` into multiple disjoint parts.

The `nxt` and `dp` arrays are initialized. `nxt[i][r]` is the value of `r` mod `M` after squaring `2 ** i` times. `dp[i][r]` is the sum of the sequence of length `2 ** i` starting from `r`.

The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to the highest power of 2. For each power of 2, it calculates the `nxt` and `dp` arrays.

Finally, the code calculates the sum of the sequence `A` using the `nxt` and `dp` arrays. The sum is calculated by iterating over the binary representation of `N`. If the `i`th bit is set in `N`, the sum is increased by `dp[i][r]`, where `r` is the value of `X` mod `M`.

The code then prints the calculated sum.

<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will depend on the specific values of `N`, `X`, and `M`. However, as an example, if `N` is 6, `X` is 2, and `M` is 1001, the output would be 1024.
