The given code is a recursive function that checks if a given string can be transformed into "ABC" by replacing any occurrence of "ABC" with "X". The function works by iterating over the string and checking for the pattern "ABC". If it finds "ABC", it replaces it with "X" and continues. If it doesn't find "ABC", it tries to replace the remaining characters with "A", "B" or "C" such that there are exactly two distinct characters in the string. If it can't do so, it returns False. If it can, it calls itself with the new string. The function continues this process until the string is "ABC" or it can't make any more replacements.

Given the input "ABC", the function will first check if the string is "ABC". If it is, it returns True and prints "Yes". If it isn't, it will try to replace "ABC" with "X". Since there are no "ABC" in the string, it will try to replace the remaining characters with "A", "B" or "C". Since there are exactly two distinct characters in the string, it can replace the remaining characters with "A" and "B", resulting in "ABAB". This string is not "ABC", so the function calls itself with the new string. The function continues this process until the string is "ABC" or it can't make any more replacements. In this case, the string is "ABAB", which is not "ABC", so the function calls itself with the new string. The function continues this process until the string is "ABC" or it can't make any more replacements. In this case, the string is "ABAB", which is not "ABC", so the function calls itself with the new string. The function continues this process until the string is "ABC" or it can't make any more replacements. In this case, the string is "ABAB", which is not "ABC", so the function calls itself with the new string. The function continues this process until the string is "ABC" or it can't make any more replacements. In this case, the string is "ABAB", which is not "ABC", so the function calls itself with the new string.
