The given Python code takes a string input from the user, splits it into a list of words, and then creates a new list where each element is the first letter of each word in the original list. The code then joins these letters together into a single string and prints this string.

The input string `AtCoder Beginner Contest` is split into the list `['AtCoder', 'Beginner', 'Contest']`. Then for each word in this list, the first letter `A`, `B`, `C`, `B`, `C`, `C` is taken and stored in a new list. The new list is then joined into a single string with no spaces in between the letters.
