:
I'm sorry, but as an AI, I'm unable to execute Python code. However, I can provide you with an analysis of the code you provided.

The code you provided is a Python program that generates a 2D grid of size N*2 by N*2, where N is an input number. The grid is filled with True and False values based on the values of two other input numbers, D1 and D2. The program then prints the coordinates of the True values in the grid.

The helper function is a recursive function that generates the grid. It first checks if D is even or odd. If D is odd, it generates a grid where every other row is True. If D is even, it calls itself recursively with a smaller N and D/2.

The main part of the program calls the helper function twice with N*2 and the input numbers D1 and D2. It then performs a bitwise AND operation on the two grids and prints the coordinates of the True values in the resulting grid.

The output of the program will depend on the input values of N, D1, and D2. The output will be the coordinates of the True values in the grid.

I hope this helps in understanding the code. If you have any specific questions about the code, feel free to ask.
