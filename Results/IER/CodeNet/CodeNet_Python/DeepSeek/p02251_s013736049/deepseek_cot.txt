### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
n = int(input())
coin = [25,10,5,1]
sum_s = 0
for i in coin:
    sent = n // i
    n %= i
    sum_s += sent
print(sum_s)

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `100`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable `n` is initialized to the input number.
The list `coin` contains the values of coins that can be used to make change. The coins are ordered from highest to lowest value.
The variable `sum_s` is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the total number of coins used.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each coin value in the `coin` list.
For each coin value `i` in the list, the code calculates the number of `i` coins that can be used to make change from `n` and stores it in `sent`. This is done by performing integer division of `n` by `i`. The remainder of this division operation is then calculated using the modulus operator `%` and stored in `n`.
The number of `i` coins used is then added to `sum_s`.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of `sum_s`, which is the total number of coins used to make change for the input number.

For the input `100`, the code will output `4` because 100 can be made with 4 coins (25 cents, 25 cents, 10 cents, 10 cents).

<<<Output>>>
4
