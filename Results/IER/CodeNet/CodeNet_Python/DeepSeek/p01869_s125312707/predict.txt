The code you provided is a Python program that calculates the minimum number of prime factors of a number. It uses recursion and binary search to find the answer.

The input to the program is a single integer n. The program first checks if n is odd. If it is, it prints -1 and exits. This is because an even number cannot be expressed as the sum of two primes.

Next, the function f is called with parameters a, 0, and n. This function generates all binary numbers that do not contain more than one 2 and one 8. The generated numbers are stored in the list a.

The function g is then called with parameters n and 0. This function calculates the minimum number of prime factors of n. It uses recursion and binary search to find the answer.

Finally, the program prints the result of function g. If the result is less than 0, it is replaced by -1.

Given the input `1`, the program will print `-1` because 1 is not an even number.

Here is the output:

```python
n=1
if n&1:print(-1);exit()
f(a,0,n)
a=sorted(a)+[10**20]
b=g(n,0)
if b<0:b=-1
print(b)
```

Output:

```
-1
```

This output is based on the analysis of the code and the input you provided.
