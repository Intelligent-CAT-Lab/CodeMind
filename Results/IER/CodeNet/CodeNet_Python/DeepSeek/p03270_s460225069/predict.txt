The given Python code is a solution to a problem from the AtCoder Regular Contest 102. The problem is about calculating the number of ways to distribute N numbers into K groups such that each group has at least one number and no two groups have the same number of numbers.

The code uses combinatorics and modular arithmetic to solve the problem. It first calculates factorials and their inverses modulo a large prime number (998244353 in this case). Then it iterates over possible values of K, calculates the number of ways to distribute N numbers into K groups, and prints the result modulo 998244353.

The code uses the following formulas:

- nCr(n, r) = nPr / rPr = factorial(n) / (factorial(r) * factorial(n - r)) (mod MOD)
- nHr = (n+r-1)Cr(n, r) (mod MOD)

The code uses these formulas to calculate the number of ways to distribute N numbers into K groups. The number of ways is calculated by iterating over possible values of the number of numbers in one group, and for each value, calculating the number of ways to distribute the remaining numbers into the remaining groups.

The code also uses the fact that the number of ways to distribute N numbers into K groups is equal to the number of ways to distribute N-1 numbers into K-1 groups plus the number of ways to distribute N-1 numbers into K groups.

The code uses the fact that the number of ways to distribute N numbers into K groups is equal to the number of ways to distribute N-1 numbers into K-1 groups plus the number of ways to distribute N-1 numbers into K groups.
