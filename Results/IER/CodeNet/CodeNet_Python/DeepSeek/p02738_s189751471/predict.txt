I'm sorry, but as an AI, I'm not able to execute Python code. However, I can provide you with an analysis of the code you provided.

The code you provided is a Python program that calculates a specific value using combinatorics and modular arithmetic. It uses the `functools.lru_cache` decorator to cache the results of the `mod_inv` function, which calculates the modular multiplicative inverse of a number.

The `gen_Y` and `gen_X` functions are generators that calculate the values of Y and X respectively. The `acc_mulmod` function is a generator that calculates the accumulated multiplication of a sequence of numbers modulo M.

The final line of the code calculates the sum of all the values calculated by the `gen_Y` and `gen_X` functions, and prints the result modulo M.

Given the input `1 998244353`, the program will calculate the value of the expression and print the result modulo 998244353.

I'm unable to provide the output of the code execution as I'm not able to execute Python code.

Please note that the execution of this code may require a Python environment and the input provided should be in the correct format as specified in the code.
