### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
n = int(input())
mask = (1<<32)-1
print('{:032b}'.format(n))
print('{:032b}'.format(~n & mask))
print('{:032b}'.format((n<<1)& mask))
print('{:032b}'.format((n>>1)& mask))

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `8`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input `n` and performs bitwise operations on it. The `mask` is a 32-bit number with all bits set to 1.

The first line of the code prints the binary representation of `n`. The `{:032b}` is a format specifier for binary numbers.

The second line of the code prints the binary representation of the bitwise NOT (~) of `n`. The bitwise NOT operator flips all the bits of the number. The `&` operator is used to apply the mask to the result of the bitwise NOT operation. This is done to ensure that the result is a 32-bit number.

The third line of the code prints the binary representation of `n` shifted left by 1 bit. The `<<` operator is used for left shift operation. The `&` operator is used to apply the mask to the result of the left shift operation. This is done to ensure that the result is a 32-bit number.

The fourth line of the code prints the binary representation of `n` shifted right by 1 bit. The `>>` operator is used for right shift operation. The `&` operator is used to apply the mask to the result of the right shift operation. This is done to ensure that the result is a 32-bit number.

The output of the code would be:
```
00000000000000000000000000001000
111111111111111111111111111101111
00000000000000000000000000010000
00000000000000000000000000001000
```
This is the binary representation of the input number 8, its bitwise NOT, left shift by 1 bit, and right shift by 1 bit respectively.
<<<Output>>>
00000000000000000000000000001000
111111111111111111111111111101111
00000000000000000000000000010000
00000000000000000000000000001000
