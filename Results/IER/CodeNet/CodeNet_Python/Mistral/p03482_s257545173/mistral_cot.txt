 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an input string S, which is `010`.
It then calculates the length of the string N, which is 3.
The variable ans is initialized to N, which is 3.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to N - 1 (inclusive), meaning it will compare each pair of adjacent characters in the string.
For each pair of adjacent characters, it checks if they are equal. If they are not, it updates the value of ans to be the minimum of the two possible values: i + 1 and N - i - 1.
In this case, the pair of adjacent characters are 0 and 1, which are not equal. Therefore, ans is updated to be the minimum of 1 and 2, which is 1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 1.
