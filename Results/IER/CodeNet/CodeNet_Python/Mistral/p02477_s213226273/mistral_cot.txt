 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the necessary modules: sys,collections and bisect.
The recursion limit is set to 100000 to prevent stack overflow.
The function l() takes an input string and returns a list of integers by mapping each element to an integer using the map() function.
The function m() takes an input string and returns a list of integers by mapping each element to an integer using the map() function.
The function onem() takes an input string and returns an integer by converting it to an integer using the int() function.
The function s() takes a list of integers and returns a list of lists, where each inner list contains the count of consecutive elements in the original list.
The function jo() takes a list of integers and returns a string by joining the elements with spaces using the join() function.
The function max2() takes a list of integers and returns the maximum element in the list.
The code then reads two integers n and m from the input using the m() function.
Finally, the code prints the product of n and m, which is 64.
<<<Output>>>
64
