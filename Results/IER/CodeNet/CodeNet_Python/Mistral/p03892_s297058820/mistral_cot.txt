 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes four integers as input, a, b, c, and d. These are stored in the variables a, b, c, and d, respectively.
The code then calculates the absolute difference between c and a, and stores it in x. It also calculates the absolute difference between d and b, and stores it in y.
The code then checks if either x or y is equal to 0. If either of them is, it prints 0 and exits the program using the sys.exit() function.
If neither x nor y is equal to 0, the code calls the gcd() function, which takes two arguments, a and b. The function returns the greatest common divisor of a and b.
The code then divides both x and y by the greatest common divisor returned by gcd().
Finally, the code multiplies the sum of x and y, divided by the greatest common divisor, by the greatest common divisor, and prints the result.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is 10.
