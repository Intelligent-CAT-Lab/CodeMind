 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes two integers as input, A and B, which are 2 and 2 respectively.
The variable f is initialized to False and ans is initialized to 0.
The code then calculates the values of n and m using the formula A * 100 // 8 and (A + 1) * 100 // 8 respectively.
n is 250 and m is 266.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from n to m (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 250 to 266.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i * 8 // 100 == A and i // 10 == B.
The condition is met when i is 256.
The code sets f to True and assigns 256 to ans.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 256.
<<<Output>>>
256
