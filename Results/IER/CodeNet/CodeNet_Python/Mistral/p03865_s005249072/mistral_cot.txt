 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a line of input from the standard input (sys.stdin) and stores it in the variable s. The line is then stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace using the strip() method.
The length of the string s is then calculated and stored in the variable n.
The code then checks if the first and last characters of the string s are the same. If they are, the move variable is set to 1, otherwise it is set to 0.
The move variable is then updated using the modulo operator (%), which returns the remainder of the division of n by move. If move is 1, the remainder will be 0, and if move is 0, the remainder will be 1.
Finally, the code checks the value of move and prints either "First" or "Second" accordingly.
<<<Output>>>
First

The return value of the code is the string "First".
