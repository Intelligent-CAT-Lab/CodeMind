<<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the decimal module, which allows for decimal arithmetic.
It then reads an integer input N from the user.
The code then calculates the result by multiplying N by the decimal value of (N-1)/2.
The result is then converted back to an integer and printed to the console.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code would be 16.
