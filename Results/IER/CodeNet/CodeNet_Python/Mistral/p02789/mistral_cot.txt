 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user, which is a string of two integers separated by a space. The input is split using the `split()` method, which returns a list of the input string's elements.
The list comprehension `[int(i) for i in input().split()]` is used to convert the input string's elements to integers and store them in a list named `a`.
The code then checks if the first element of the list `a[0]` is equal to the second element of the list `a[1]`. If it is, it prints 'Yes', otherwise it prints 'No'.
<<<Output>>>
No
