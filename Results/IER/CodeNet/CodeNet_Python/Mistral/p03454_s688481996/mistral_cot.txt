 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer `s` as input and returns the number of ways to write `s` as a sum of powers of 2.
The code first checks if `s` is 1, in which case it returns 1.
If `s` is not 1, the code initializes a variable `count` to 0 and a variable `sum` to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to the square root of `s`.
For each number `i` in this range, the code calculates the sum of powers of 2 up to `i` and stores it in `sum`.
The code then checks if `sum` is equal to `s`. If it is, the code increments `count` by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code returns `count`.
