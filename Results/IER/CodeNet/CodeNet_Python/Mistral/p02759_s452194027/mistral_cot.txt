 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input from the user using the `input()` function and stores it in the variable `n`.
Then it calculates the value of `(n+1)//2` using integer division (// operator) and prints it.
The integer division operator // returns the floor division of the left operand by the right operand.
So, `(5+1)//2` is equal to `6//2` which is equal to `3`.
