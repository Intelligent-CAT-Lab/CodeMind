 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input x and performs several bitwise operations on it.
The first operation is to print the binary representation of x using the format string '{:032b}'. This ensures that the binary representation is padded with leading zeros to make it 32 bits long.
The second operation is to print the binary representation of x with all the bits flipped using the format string '{:032b}'. This is done by translating the string '01' to '10' using the `str.maketrans()` function and then applying it to the binary representation of x using the `translate()` method.
The third operation is to print the left-shifted binary representation of x by 1 using the format string '{:032b}'[-32:]. This is done by shifting the binary representation of x to the left by 1 using the bitwise left-shift operator `<<` and then taking the last 32 bits of the result using slicing.
The fourth operation is to print the right-shifted binary representation of x by 1 using the format string '{:032b}'. This is done by shifting the binary representation of x to the right by 1 using the bitwise right-shift operator `>>` and then taking the last 32 bits of the result using slicing.
