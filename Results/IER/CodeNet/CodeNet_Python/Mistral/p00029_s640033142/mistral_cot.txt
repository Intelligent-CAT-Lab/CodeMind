 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an input from the user using the `input()` function and stores it in the variable `x`.
The `x.split()` method is then used to split the input string into a list of individual words, which are stored in the variable `A`.
The code then initializes two empty lists, `S` and `L`, which will be used to store the count of each word and its length, respectively.
A for loop is used to iterate over each word in the list `A`. For each word, the `count()` method is used to count the number of occurrences of that word in the list `A`, and the length of the word is calculated using the `len()` function. These values are then appended to the lists `S` and `L`, respectively.
The `max()` function is then used to find the maximum value in both lists `S` and `L`. The index of the maximum value in list `S` is stored in the variable `Y`, and the index of the maximum value in list `L` is stored in the variable `y`.
Finally, the code prints the word at index `Y` from list `A` and the word at index `y` from list `A`.
