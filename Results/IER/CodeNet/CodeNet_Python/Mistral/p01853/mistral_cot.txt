 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, n and m. In this case, n is 3 and m is 100.
The variable points is initialized as a list of n elements, all set to "0".
The code then enters a loop that iterates from (n//2+1) to n. In this case, the loop will iterate from 2 to 3.
For each iteration, the code sets the value of points[i] to the string representation of m, which is "100".
After the loop finishes, the code uses the join() method to concatenate all the elements of the points list with a space in between, and prints the result.
The final output will be "0 100 100 100".
<<<Output>>>
0 100 100 100
