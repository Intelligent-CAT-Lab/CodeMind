<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input from the user using the `input()` function and stores it in a variable called `x`.
The `int()` function is then called on `x` to convert it from a string to an integer.
The `**` operator is used to raise the integer to the power of itself, which is equivalent to squaring the number.
The result is then printed to the console using the `print()` function.
