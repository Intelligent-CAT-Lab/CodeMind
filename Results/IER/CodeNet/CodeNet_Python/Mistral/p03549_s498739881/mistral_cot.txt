 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes two integers N and M as input, which are 1 and 1 respectively.
It then calculates the value of t as 1900*M + 100*(N-M), which is 1900*1 + 100*(1-1) = 1900 + 0 = 1900.
It then calculates the value of p as 2**M, which is 2**1 = 2.
Finally, it multiplies t and p and prints the result, which is 1900*2 = 3800.
<<<Output>>>
3800
