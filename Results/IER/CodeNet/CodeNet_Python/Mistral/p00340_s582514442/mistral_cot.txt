 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four integer inputs separated by spaces and stores them in the variables e1, e2, e3 and e4.
The code then checks if any of the following conditions are met:

* e1 is equal to e2 and e3 is equal to e4
* e1 is equal to e3 and e2 is equal to e4
* e1 is equal to e4 and e2 is equal to e3
* e1 is equal to e2, e2 is equal to e3 and e3 is equal to e4

If any of these conditions are met, the code prints "yes". Otherwise, it prints "no".

<<<Output>>>
yes
