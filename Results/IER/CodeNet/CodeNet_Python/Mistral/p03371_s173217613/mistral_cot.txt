 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes five integers as input: A, B, C, X, and Y. In this case, A = 1500, B = 2000, C = 1600, X = 3, and Y = 2.
The variable ans is initialized to 10**9+7, which is a very large number.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 10^5 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 100000.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the value of ans using the formula: ans = 2*C*i + max(0,Y-i)*B + max(0,X-i)*A.
The condition is met when i is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100.
The condition is met when i is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 4
