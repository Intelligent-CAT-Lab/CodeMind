 <<<Analysis>>>
The variables A, B, C, X, and Y are initialized to 1500, 2000, 1600, 3, and 2, respectively.
The code then calculates three different values, v1, v2, and v3, based on the input values.
v1 is calculated by multiplying A and X and adding B and Y.
v2 is calculated by multiplying C by 2 times Y and adding 2 times X minus Y.
v3 is calculated by multiplying C by 2 times the maximum of X and Y.
Finally, the code prints the minimum of the three values.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is 2000.
