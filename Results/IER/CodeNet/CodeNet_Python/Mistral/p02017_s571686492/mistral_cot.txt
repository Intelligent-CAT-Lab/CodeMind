 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four integer inputs, H, W, x, and y, separated by spaces.
H and W represent the dimensions of a rectangle, and x and y represent the coordinates of a point inside the rectangle.
The code checks if the rectangle is odd-shaped by checking if H*W is odd.
It also checks if the point (x,y) is odd by checking if (x+y) is odd.
If both conditions are met, the code prints "No". Otherwise, it prints "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
