<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input n from the user.
It then checks if n is divisible by 1000 using the modulo operator (%). If n is not divisible by 1000, it means that n is less than 1000, so the code returns 0.
If n is divisible by 1000, it means that n is greater than or equal to 1000, so the code returns 1000 - n%1000.
In this case, n is 1900, which is greater than or equal to 1000, so the code returns 1000 - 1900%1000 = 1000 - 0 = 1000.
<<<Output>>>
1000
