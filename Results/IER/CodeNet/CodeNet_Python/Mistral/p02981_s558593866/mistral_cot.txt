 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input, n, a and b.
It uses the `map()` function to convert the input string into integers.
The `min()` function is then called with two arguments, a*n and b.
The function returns the minimum of the two arguments.
In this case, a*n is 24 and b is 9, so the minimum is 9.
<<<Output>>>
9
