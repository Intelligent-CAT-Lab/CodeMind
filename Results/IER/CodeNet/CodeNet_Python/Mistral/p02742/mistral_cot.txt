The code takes two integers as input, H and W.
It calculates the area of the rectangle by multiplying H and W and dividing by 2.
If H and W are not equal to 1, it rounds up the result to the nearest integer.
If H and W are equal to 1, it returns 1.
The return value of the function is the calculated area.
