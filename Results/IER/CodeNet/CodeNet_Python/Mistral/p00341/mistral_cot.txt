 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first initializes an array a of size 100 with all elements set to 0.
Then it reads a list of integers from the user, which are stored in the variable b.
The code then iterates through the list b and updates the corresponding element in the array a by incrementing its value by 1.
After that, it iterates through the array a and counts the number of elements that are divisible by 4 and have a value of 4. This count is stored in the variable c.
Finally, the code checks if c is equal to 3, which means that there are exactly 3 elements in the array a that meet the condition. If this is the case, it prints 'yes', otherwise it prints 'no'.
<<<Output>>>
yes
