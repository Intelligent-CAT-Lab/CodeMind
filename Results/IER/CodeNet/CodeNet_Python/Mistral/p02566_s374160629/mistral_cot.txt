 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized to 10, which is the length of the input string "abcbcba".
The variable SA and LCP are initialized to empty lists, which will be used to store the suffix array and the longest common prefix array, respectively.
The code then calls the SuffixArray function, passing the input string "abcbcba" as an argument.
The SuffixArray function returns two lists: SA and LCP.
The code then calculates the length of the longest common prefix array LCP by multiplying the length of the input string by the length of the suffix array minus the sum of the LCP values.
The length of the suffix array is calculated by multiplying the length of the input string by 2, since the suffix array includes a suffix of the input string.
The length of the LCP array is calculated by iterating over the suffix array and counting the number of occurrences of each character in the input string.
The final output is the length of the longest common prefix array LCP, which is 3 in this case.
