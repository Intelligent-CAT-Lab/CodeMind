 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input, H, A and B. In this case, H is 100, A is 2 and B is 4.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from A to B+1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 2 to 5.
For each number i in this range, it checks if H is divisible by i. If it is, it increments the variable ans by 1. The condition is met when i is 2, 4.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
