 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the math module.
It then prompts the user to enter a value for x, which is 6 in this case.
The variable k is initialized to 0 and t is initialized to 0.
The code then checks if the square root of 8x+1 is equal to its floor value. In this case, it is not, so the code proceeds to the else block.
In the else block, the code calculates the value of x as (-1 + math.sqrt(1 + 8x))//2. This is equivalent to (-1 + math.sqrt(1 + 64))//2 = 3.5.
The code then prints the value of int(x) + 1, which is 4.
<<<Output>>>
4
