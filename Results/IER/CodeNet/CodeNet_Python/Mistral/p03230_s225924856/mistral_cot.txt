The variable N is initialized to 3.
The function solve(N) is called with N as the argument.
The function solve(N) first checks if N is equal to 1. If it is, it prints "Yes" and returns.
If N is not equal to 1, it initializes a variable K to -1.
It then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 3.
For each number k in this range, it checks if (k \* (k - 1)) / 2 is equal to N. If it is, it sets K to k.
Since N is 3, the condition is not met for any k in the range [1, 3].
Therefore, K remains -1.
The function then initializes an empty list ans, which will be used to store the solution.
It then initializes a variable num to 1.
It enters another loop that iterates from 0 to K (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 2.
For each number i in this range, it appends num to ans[i].
It then increments num by 1.
Since K is -1, the loop only iterates once.
The function then prints "Yes" and the value of K, which is -1.
It then prints the length of each list in ans, which is 0.
Therefore, the return value of the code is an empty list.
