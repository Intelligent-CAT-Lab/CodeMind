 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input k from the user using the `input()` function and stores it in the variable k.
Then it calculates k1 by dividing k by 2 and storing the result in the variable k1 using the integer division operator `//`.
Then it calculates k2 by subtracting k1 from k and storing the result in the variable k2.
Finally, it multiplies k1 and k2 and prints the result.
