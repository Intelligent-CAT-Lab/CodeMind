 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input: a, b, and k. In this case, a = 2, b = 3, and k = 3.
The first if statement checks if a is less than or equal to k. Since a is 2 and k is 3, the condition is not met.
The second if statement is executed, which subtracts a from k and assigns the result to k. In this case, k is now 0.
The code then prints the value of a - k, which is 1, and the value of max(b - k, 0), which is 3.
The final output is 1 3.
