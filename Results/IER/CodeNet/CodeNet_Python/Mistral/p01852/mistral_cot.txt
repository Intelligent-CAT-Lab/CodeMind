 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input from the user using the `input()` function and stores it in the variable `n`.
If `n` is not equal to 0, the length of the binary representation of `n` is calculated using the `len()` function and the `bin()` function. The `bin()` function converts an integer to its binary representation as a string. The length of the string is then subtracted by 2 to get the length of the binary representation without the leading 0b.
If `n` is equal to 0, the function returns 0.
<<<Output>>>
