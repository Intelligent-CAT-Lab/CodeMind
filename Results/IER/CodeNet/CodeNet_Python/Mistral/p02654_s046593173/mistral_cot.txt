 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and variable a are initialized to 3 and 1, respectively.
The function solve is called with these values as arguments.
The function solve takes two arguments, n and a, and returns an integer value.
The function solve first calculates the factorials and finvs using the prepare function.
It then calculates the invs using the factorials and finvs.
The function solve then uses the invs, n and a to calculate the answer using a series of calculations.
The final answer is returned by the function solve.
