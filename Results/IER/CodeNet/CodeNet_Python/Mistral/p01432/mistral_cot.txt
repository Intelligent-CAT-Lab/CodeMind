The variable S, variable N, and variable K are initialized to 6, 6, and 1, respectively.
The variable S is set to its absolute value, which is 6.
The variable N is set to 6.
The variable K is set to 1.
The variable M is calculated as N*K, which is 6*1 = 6.
The variable dp is initialized as a list of length M+1, with all elements set to 0.
The variable dp[0] is set to 1.
The variable t is set to 1.
The variable i is set to M*K, which is 6*1 = 6.
The variable dp[i] is calculated as the sum of dp[i-k] for k in range(1, N+1) if i >= k. This is equivalent to the sum of dp[i-k] for k in range(1, 6) if i >= k. This is calculated as follows:
dp[i] = sum(dp[i-k] for k in range(1, 6) if i >= k)
