<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers N and K as input. N is the number of elements in a list and K is the number of elements to be removed from the list.
The code then uses a list comprehension to convert the input string into a list of integers.
The list comprehension converts the input string into a list of integers by iterating over each element in the input string, converting it to an integer using the `int()` function, and storing it in a new list.
The code then calculates the difference between N and K, which is the number of elements remaining in the list after removing K elements.
Finally, the code prints the result.
<<<Output>>>
1

The return value of the code based on the input `3 2` is 1.
