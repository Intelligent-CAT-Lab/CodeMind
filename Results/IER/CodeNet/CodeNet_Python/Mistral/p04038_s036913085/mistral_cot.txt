 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and k are initialized to 2 and 2, respectively.
The function solve is called with these values.
The function solve first checks if n or k is 1, in which case it returns 1.
If n or k is not 1, it calculates the product of n and k, which is 4.
It then generates a list of factorials using the fac\_gen function, starting from k-2 and ending at m-1.
The first element of this list is 1, which is used as the initial value for the variable v.
The function then uses a loop to iterate over the range from i=2 to n+1.
For each i, it calculates the value of ci, which is (i-1)*(k-1).
It then uses another loop to iterate over the range from j=i-1 to i.
For each j, it calculates the value of v by adding the product of dp[j] and comb[j] modulo MOD.
Finally, it updates the value of dp[i] to be the value of v.
After the loops finish, the function returns the product of dp[n] and fac(n) modulo MOD.
