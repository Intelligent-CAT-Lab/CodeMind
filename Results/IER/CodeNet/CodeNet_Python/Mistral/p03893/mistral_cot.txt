 <<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes two lists g and h of length 50 with None values.
The code then sets the value of h[1] to 3 and the value of g[1] to 6.
The code then reads an integer X from the user.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to X+1.
For each i in this range, it sets the value of h[i] to the value of g[i-1] + 1.
Then it sets the value of g[i] to 2*h[i].
Finally, the code prints the value of g[X].
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is 10.
