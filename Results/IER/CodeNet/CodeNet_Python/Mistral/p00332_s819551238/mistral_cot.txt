 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes two inputs, E and Y, and converts them to integers using the map() function.
The code then checks the value of E using an if-elif-else statement.
If E is 0, the code checks the value of Y using another if-elif-else statement.
If Y is between 1868 and 1911, the code prints 'M' followed by Y-1867.
If Y is between 1912 and 1925, the code prints 'T' followed by Y-1911.
If Y is between 1926 and 1988, the code prints 'S' followed by Y-1925.
If Y is greater than 1988, the code prints 'H' followed by Y-1988.
If E is not 0, the code prints the value of Y plus the corresponding value of E.
If E is 1, the code prints Y+1867.
If E is 2, the code prints Y+1911.
If E is 3, the code prints Y+1925.
If E is not 1, 2 or 3, the code prints Y+1988.
