 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user, which is a string of numbers separated by spaces. It then uses the `map()` function to convert the input string into a list of integers.
The `set()` function is then used to remove any duplicate values from the list.
Finally, the `len()` function is used to count the number of elements in the resulting set.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is 3, as there are 3 unique numbers in the input: 3, 1 and 4.
