 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes two integers as input, A and B, and stores them in the variables A and B.
It then creates a list with three elements: A+B, 2*A-1 and 2*B-1.
The list is then passed to the `max()` function, which returns the maximum value in the list.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code would be 11, which is the maximum value in the list [7, 5, 11].
