 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes a list of integers as input, separated by spaces. The input is `3 7`.
The first element of the list is assigned to the variable `n[0]`, which is 3.
The second element of the list is assigned to the variable `n[1]`, which is 7.
The variable `s1` is calculated as `x - k + 1`, where `x` is 7 and `k` is 3. So `s1` is 4.
The variable `s2` is calculated as `x + k - 1`, where `x` is 7 and `k` is 3. So `s2` is 10.
The variable `a1` is a list of integers from `s1` to `s2 + 1`, which is from 4 to 11.
The code then uses the `map()` function to convert the list of integers in `a1` to a list of strings, and the `join()` function to concatenate the strings into a single string, separated by spaces.
The final output is the string `4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11`.
