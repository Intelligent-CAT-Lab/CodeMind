 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three input values, a, b and k, which are 8, 12 and 2 respectively.
The code initializes an empty list called ans.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to the minimum of a and b (inclusive), which is 12 in this case.
For each value val in this range, it checks if both a and b are divisible by val. If they are, it appends val to the ans list.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the last element of the ans list, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
