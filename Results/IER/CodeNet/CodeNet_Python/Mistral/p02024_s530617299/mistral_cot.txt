 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four integer inputs, h, w, x, and y, and stores them in variables.
The code then checks if h*w%2==1 and (x+y)%2==1.
If both conditions are true, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".
The condition h*w%2==1 is true when h and w are odd numbers.
The condition (x+y)%2==1 is true when x and y are odd numbers.
So, for the input 4 5 2 3, h*w%2==1 and (x+y)%2==1 are both true, so the code prints "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
