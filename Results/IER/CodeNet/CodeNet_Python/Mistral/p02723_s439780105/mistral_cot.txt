 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an input string `s` using the `input()` function.
It then checks if the second and third characters of the string are equal and if the fourth and fifth characters are also equal.
If both conditions are true, it sets the variable `ans` to 'Yes', otherwise it sets `ans` to 'No'.
<<<Output>>>
No
