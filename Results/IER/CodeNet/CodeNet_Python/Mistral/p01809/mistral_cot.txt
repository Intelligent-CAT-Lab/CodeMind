 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers from the standard input using the `LI()` function, which returns a list of integers.
The two integers are then passed to the `fractions.gcd()` function, which returns the greatest common divisor of the two numbers.
The remainder of the division of the second number by the greatest common divisor is stored in the variable `t`.
The variable `k` is initialized to 1.
If the remainder of the division of the second number by the greatest common divisor is even, the value of `k` is multiplied by 2 and the remainder is divided by 2 repeatedly until it is odd.
The variable `i` is then initialized to 3 and incremented by 2 in each iteration of the loop.
For each value of `i`, the remainder of the division of the second number by `i` is checked. If it is not zero, the loop continues to the next iteration. If it is zero, the value of `k` is multiplied by `i` and the remainder is divided by `i` repeatedly until it is not zero.
The final value of `k` is then multiplied by the greatest common divisor and added to the variable `rr`.
The loop continues until the remainder of the division of the second number by the greatest common divisor is not zero.
After the loop finishes, the variable `rr` contains the final result, which is printed using the `print()` function.
