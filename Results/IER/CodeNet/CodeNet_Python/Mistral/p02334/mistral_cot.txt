 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers N and K as input, where N is the number of elements in the array and K is the number of elements to be removed.
The variable MOD is initialized to 10**9 + 7, which is used as the modulus for the multiplication operations.
The code then initializes two variables p and q to 1.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to N-1.
For each i in this range, it calculates the value of p and q using the formula:
p = p * (N+K-1-i) % MOD
q = q * (i+1) % MOD
After the loop finishes, the code calculates the final value of p * q modulo MOD and prints it.
<<<Output>>>
10

Therefore, the return value of the code based on the input `5 3` is 10.
