 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string input from the user and iterates over its characters using the `groupby()` function from the `itertools` module.
For each group of characters, it calculates the length of the group and assigns it to the variable `d`.
It also assigns the value of `left` and `right` based on the current group's operator (`>` or `<`).
If the current group's operator is `>`, it adds the value of `d*(d+1)//2 - left` to the `ans` variable.
If the current group's operator is `<`, it adds the value of `-1*f + d*(d+1)//2` to the `ans` variable.
The variable `f` is updated to the value of the next group's operator.
After the loop finishes, the final value of `ans` is printed.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is the final value of `ans`, which is 10.
