<<<Analysis>>>
The code first defines a function called `main()`. This function takes an integer input `N` from the user.
The function then divides `N` by 3 and prints the result using the `print()` function.
The `if __name__ == '__main__':` block is used to call the `main()` function when the script is run directly.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is the result of dividing the input `8` by 3, which is 2.6666666666666668.
However, since the `print()` function is used to print the result, it does not return a value.
Therefore, the return value of the code is `None`.
