 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string as input and initializes a dictionary `d` with a single key-value pair `(0, 0)`.
It then iterates over each character in the input string, converting each character to its corresponding ASCII value and subtracting the ASCII value of 'a' to get a number between 0 and 25.
For each number, it performs a bitwise XOR operation with the current value of `t`, shifting the bits to the left by the position of the current number.
The resulting value of `t` is then used as a key in the dictionary `d`, and its value is updated to be the minimum of its current value and the minimum value of `d[t^(1<<j)]` for all `j` such that `t^(1<<j)` is a key in `d`.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the value of `d[t]` if it exists, or 1 if it doesn't.
