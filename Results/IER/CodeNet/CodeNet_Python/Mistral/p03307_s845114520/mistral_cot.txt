<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input from the user using the `input()` function and stores it in the variable `N`.
The code then checks if `N` is even by using the modulo operator `%` to check if the remainder of dividing `N` by 2 is 0.
If `N` is even, the code simply prints `N`.
If `N` is odd, the code prints `2*N`.
In this case, since `N` is 3, the code will print `2*3` which is 6.
<<<Output>>>
6
