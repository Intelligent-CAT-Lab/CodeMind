 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes four integers as input, a, b, c, and d.
It then defines three functions: A\_win(), B\_win(), and Draw().
The code then checks if c or d is -1. If either of them is -1, it proceeds to check if a is less than b. If it is, it calls the A\_win() function. If a is greater than b, it calls the B\_win() function. If neither of these conditions is met, it calls the Draw() function.
If neither c nor d is -1, it proceeds to check if c is greater than d. If it is, it calls the A\_win() function. If c is less than d, it calls the B\_win() function. If neither of these conditions is met, it calls the Draw() function.
If c is equal to d, it calls the Draw() function.
