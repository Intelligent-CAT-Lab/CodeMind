 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string input S and initializes a variable Sum to 0.
It then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 2^(len(S)-1)-1.
For each value of ii in this range, it creates an empty list temp_list and initializes a variable temp_s to the input string S.
It then enters another loop that iterates from 0 to len(S)-2.
For each value of jj in this range, it extracts the bit at position jj from ii and checks if it is 1.
If it is, it extracts the first i digits of temp_s and appends them to temp_list. It then updates temp_s to exclude the first i digits.
If it is not, it increments the value of itr.
After the inner loop finishes, it adds the sum of the integers in temp_list and the last digit of temp_s to Sum.
Finally, it adds the length of S to Sum.
The condition is met when ii is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128,
