 <<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by importing the math module.
It then prompts the user to enter a number using the input() function and stores it in the variable x.
The variable y is initialized to 100.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the number of iterations.
The code enters a while loop that continues until y is less than x.
Inside the loop, it increments ans by 1 and then multiplies y by 1.01 to increase its value.
The loop continues until y is less than x, which means that the loop will run 3 times (since y will be 100, 101 and 102.01 after each iteration).
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 3.
