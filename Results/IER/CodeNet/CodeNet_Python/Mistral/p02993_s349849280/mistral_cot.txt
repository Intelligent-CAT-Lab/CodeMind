<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string input `s` and checks if it contains any repeated characters. It does this by iterating over the string from index `i=0` to `i=len(s)-1`, and for each index `i`, it checks if the character at index `i` is equal to the character at index `i+1`. If it is, it sets the `is_good` variable to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
If the loop completes without finding any repeated characters, the `is_good` variable will still be `True`.
Finally, the code prints the string "Good" if `is_good` is `True`, or "Bad" otherwise.
<<<Output>>>
Good
