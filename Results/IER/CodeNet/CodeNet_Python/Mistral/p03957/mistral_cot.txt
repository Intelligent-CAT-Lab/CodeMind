 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string input from the user and initializes two variables: ss and p.
ss is an empty string that will be used to store the substring of the input that starts with "C" and ends with "F".
p is an integer that is initially set to 0. It will be used to keep track of the current state of the substring.
The code then enters a loop that iterates through each character in the input string s.
For each character, it checks if p is equal to 0 and if the character is "C". If both conditions are true, it sets p to 1 and continues to the next character.
If p is equal to 1 and the character is "F", it sets p to 2 and continues to the next character.
After the loop finishes, the code checks the value of p. If it is equal to 2, it means that the substring "C" and "F" was found in the input string. The code then prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
