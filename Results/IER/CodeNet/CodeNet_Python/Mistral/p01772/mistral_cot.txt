 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string s and initializes an empty string ans. It also initializes a flag variable to False.
The code then iterates through each character c in s.
If c is "A" and flag is False, it sets flag to True.
If c is "Z" and flag is True, it appends "AZ" to ans and sets flag to False.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if ans is empty. If it is, it prints -1. Otherwise, it prints ans.
<<<Output>>>
-1
