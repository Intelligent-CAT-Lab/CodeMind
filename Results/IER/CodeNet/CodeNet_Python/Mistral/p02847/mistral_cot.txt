 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module, which provides access to some system-specific information and functions.
It then reads a line of input from the standard input (stdin) and removes any trailing whitespace using the rstrip() method.
The input is stored in the variable a.
The code then defines a dictionary week, which maps each day of the week to its corresponding integer index in the range [0, 6].
The code then uses the get() method of the week dictionary to retrieve the integer index for the day represented by the input a. If the day is not found in the dictionary, the get() method returns None, which is converted to 0 using the int() function.
Finally, the code subtracts the integer index of the day from 7 to get the day of the week as an integer value.
<<<Output>>>
4
The return value of the code is 4, which represents Saturday.
