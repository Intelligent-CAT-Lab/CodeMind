 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first initializes the COMB\_MOD class with a maximum number of 2*10^5 and a modulus of 10^9+7.
It then calculates the values of the fac, finv and inv arrays using the _maesyori method.
The input is then read from the user and stored in the variables h, w, a and b.
The variable ans is initialized to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from h-a to 0 (inclusive), meaning it will consider all possible values of h-a.
For each value of h-a, it calculates the sum of all possible combinations of b-1+i and h-1-i+w-1-b, and stores it in ans.
The condition is met when h-a is 0, b-1+i is 0, h-1-i+w-1-b is 0, and b-1+i is less than or equal to w-1-b.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 1.
