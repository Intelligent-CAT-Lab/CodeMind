 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string as input and iterates through its characters from left to right.
It keeps track of two pointers, l and r, which represent the left and right ends of the current substring.
The code checks if the current character is "x" or if it is equal to the character at the right pointer.
If the current character is "x", the code checks if it is the first "x" in the substring. If it is, the code moves the left pointer to the right and the right pointer to the left. If it is not the first "x", the code moves the left pointer to the right and increments the answer.
If the current character is not "x" and is equal to the character at the right pointer, the code moves the left pointer to the right and the right pointer to the left.
If the current character is not "x" and is not equal to the character at the right pointer, the code prints -1 and exits the function.
The function returns the answer after the loop finishes.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code for the input "xabxa" is 2.
