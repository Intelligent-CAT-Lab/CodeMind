 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four integer inputs, h, w, a, and b, and uses them to generate two strings, r1 and r2.
r1 is created by repeating the string "0" a number of times equal to a, and then repeating the string "1" a number of times equal to w - a.
r2 is created by repeating the string "1" a number of times equal to a, and then repeating the string "0" a number of times equal to w - a.
The code then enters two loops. The first loop prints r1 b times. The second loop prints r2 h - b times.
Since the input is `3 3 1 1`, the values of h, w, a, and b are 3, 3, 1, and 1, respectively.
The first loop will print r1 3 times, which is "000" and "011".
The second loop will print r2 2 times, which is "111" and "100".
The final output of the code will be:
```
000
011
111
100
```
<<<Output>>>
```
000
011
111
100
```
