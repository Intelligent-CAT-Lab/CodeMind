 <<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by reading input from the user using the raw\_input() function and storing it in the variable s.
The variable p is set to "ABC".
The variable used is a set that will be used to keep track of the characters that have already been used.
The code enters a while loop that continues until s is equal to p.
Inside the loop, the code initializes a variable idx to 0 and a list c with three elements, each representing the count of a specific character in s.
The code then enters another while loop that continues until idx is equal to the length of s.
Inside this loop, the code checks if the substring s[idx:idx+3] is equal to p. If it is, the code increments the count of the corresponding character in c and moves to the next index. If it is not, the code increments the count of the character at the index of s[idx] in p and moves to the next index.
After the inner loop finishes, the code checks if the sum of the elements in c is equal to 1 or if the sum of the elements in c is equal to the length of s. If either of these conditions is true, the code prints "No" and exits the program.
If the sum of the elements in c is not equal to 1 and the sum of the elements in c is not equal to the length of s, the code replaces the first occurrence of "ABC" in s with the character at the index of the character with the highest count in c.
Finally, the code prints "Yes".
