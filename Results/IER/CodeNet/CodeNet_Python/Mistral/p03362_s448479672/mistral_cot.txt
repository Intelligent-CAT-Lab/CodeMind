 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first initializes some variables:

* M: 55555
* m: the square root of M rounded up to the nearest integer, which is 233
* S: a list of length M+1, all initialized to 0

The code then enters a nested loop that iterates from 2 to m+1, and for each number i in this range, it iterates from i*2 to M+1 (inclusive) in increments of i. For each number j in this range, it sets S[j] to 1 if j is divisible by i.

The code then reads an input N from the user, and initializes a counter cnt to 0.

The code enters another loop that iterates from 2 to M+1. For each number i in this range, it checks if S[i] is 0 and if i is odd (i.e., i%5==1). If both conditions are met, it prints i and increments cnt.

The code then checks if cnt is equal to N. If it is, it quits the loop.

If the input N is 5, the code will print 1 and 3, and quit the loop since cnt is equal to 2.
