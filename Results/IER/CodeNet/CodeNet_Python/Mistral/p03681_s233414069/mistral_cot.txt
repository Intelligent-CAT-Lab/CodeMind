 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the math module.
Then it reads two integers n and m from the input, which are 2 and 2 respectively.
The variable mod is set to 10**9 + 7, which is used as the modulus for the final result.
The code then checks if n is equal to m. Since n and m are both 2, the condition is met and the code proceeds to the next block of code.
In this block of code, it calculates 2! * 2! = 4, which is the result of multiplying the factorial of n and m.
Since n and m are equal, the result is 4 % mod = 4 % (10**9 + 7) = 4, which is the final output.
<<<Output>>>
4
