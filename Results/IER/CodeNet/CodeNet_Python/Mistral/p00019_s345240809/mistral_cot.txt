 <<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called factorial that takes an integer n as input.
The function checks if n is equal to 1, in which case it returns 1.
Otherwise, it multiplies n by the result of calling the factorial function with n-1 as input.
The code then prompts the user to enter a number, which is stored in the variable n.
Finally, the code calls the factorial function with the value of n, which is 5 in this case, and prints the result.
