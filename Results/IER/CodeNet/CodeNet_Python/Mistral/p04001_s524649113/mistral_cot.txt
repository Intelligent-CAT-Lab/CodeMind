 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first initializes a class `Formula` with an input string `S`. It also initializes the sum of the digits of the input string to 0 and the length of the input string.
The code then calculates the position of the last 1-bit in the binary representation of the input string length. This position is used to split the input string into two parts.
The code then defines a method `calc_sum` that takes two arguments: the input string `S` and the position of the last 1-bit in the binary representation of the input string length.
The method uses a stack to store the digits of the input string that are split by the last 1-bit. It calculates the sum of the digits on the stack and adds it to the sum of the digits of the input string.
The method is called in the `main` function, which takes an input string `S` and creates an instance of the `Formula` class with the input string.
The `main` function then uses a loop to iterate over all possible values of the last 1-bit in the binary representation of the input string length. For each value, it calls the `calc_sum` method with the input string and the position of the last 1-bit.
Finally, the `main` function prints the sum of the digits of the input string.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code would be 125.
