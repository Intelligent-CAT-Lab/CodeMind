<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string `s` using the `input()` function.
The `print()` function is then used to print the string `s` with every second character removed.
The `[::2]` slice notation is used to achieve this. It starts at the beginning of the string (index 0), ends at the end of the string (index -1), and takes every second element (index 2).
The resulting string is then printed to the console.
