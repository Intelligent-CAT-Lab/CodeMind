 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four integer inputs, t1, t2, r1, and r2, and assigns them to the variables t1, t2, r1, and r2, respectively.
The code then checks if either r1 or r2 is equal to -1. If either of them is, it proceeds to the next block of code.
If neither r1 nor r2 is equal to -1, it compares r1 and r2 to determine which player won. If r1 is greater than r2, it prints "Alice". If r1 is less than r2, it prints "Bob". If r1 is equal to r2, it prints "Draw".
If either r1 or r2 is equal to -1, it proceeds to the next block of code.
In this block of code, it compares t1 and t2 to determine which player won. If t1 is less than t2, it prints "Alice". If t1 is greater than t2, it prints "Bob". If t1 is equal to t2, it prints "Draw".
