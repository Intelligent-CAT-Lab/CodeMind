The return value of the code for the input `8 1` would be 10.

This is because the sum of x and y is 9, and the smallest possible value of K that satisfies the conditions n^x(n+1)^y >= N and n^x(n+1)^y < N is K=2.
For K=2, n=2, x=1 and y=1, and the cost of the solution is 2*1 + 2*1 + 2*1 = 6.
Since A=1, the cost of the solution is 1*1 + 1*1 + 2*1 = 4, which is less than the minimum cost of 10 among all possible values of K.
Therefore, the return value of the code for the input `8 1` is 10.
