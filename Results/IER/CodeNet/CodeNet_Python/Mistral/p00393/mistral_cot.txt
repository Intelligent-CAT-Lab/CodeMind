 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable MOD is initialized to 1000000007.
The code then reads two integers N and M from the input, which are 4 and 3 respectively.
The code initializes two arrays, pow and dp, of size N+1 and M+1, respectively.
The variable pow is used to store the power of 2 up to N, while dp is used to store the sum of powers of 2 up to M.
The code then initializes the first element of pow to 1 and the first element of dp to 1.
The code then iterates from 1 to N and calculates the power of 2 up to N by multiplying the previous power by 2 and taking the modulo with MOD.
The code then iterates from 1 to M and calculates the sum of powers of 2 up to M by storing the current power in dp.
The code then subtracts 1 from dp[M] to account for the fact that the sum of powers of 2 up to M does not include the power of 2 at index M.
The code then iterates from M+1 to N and calculates the sum of powers of 2 up to N by adding the current power in dp to the sum of powers of 2 up to M - 1 (which is stored in dp[i - 1 - M]).
Finally, the code calculates the difference between the power of 2 at index N and the sum of powers of 2 up to N, takes the modulo with MOD and prints the result.
