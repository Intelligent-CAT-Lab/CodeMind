 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module, which provides access to some system-specific information and functions.
The read function is used to read data from the standard input (sys.stdin) and store it in a buffer.
The readline function is used to read a line from the standard input (sys.stdin) and store it in a buffer.
The readlines function is used to read all the lines from the standard input (sys.stdin) and store them in a list.
The code then reads the input line using readline() and stores it in the variables w, h, x, and y using the map() function and the split() method.
The variable ans is calculated by multiplying w and h and dividing by 2.
The code then checks if x and y are equal to w/2 and h/2, respectively. If they are, it prints ans and '1', otherwise it prints ans and '0'.
<<<Output>>>
0 0
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
The input `2 3 1 2` does not meet the condition specified in the code, so the output is 0 0.
