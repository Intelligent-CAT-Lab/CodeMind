 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input from the user and stores it in the variable X.
Then it enters a loop that iterates from 1 to X (inclusive).
For each number i in this range, it checks if i*(i+1)//2 >= X. This means that the square of i plus one must be greater than or equal to twice X.
If the condition is met, it prints the current number i and breaks out of the loop.
For the input 6, the loop will iterate from 1 to 6 (inclusive).
The condition i*(i+1)//2 >= X is met for i=2, 3 and 6.
So the loop will print 2, 3 and 6 and break out of the loop.
