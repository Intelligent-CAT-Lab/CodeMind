 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, n and m.
It then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n+1.
For each iteration, it calculates the value of f using the formula 2 * i + 4 * (n - i).
The loop continues until the value of f is equal to m.
If the value of f is equal to m, the code prints "Yes" and breaks out of the loop.
If the value of f is not equal to m after the loop finishes, the code prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
