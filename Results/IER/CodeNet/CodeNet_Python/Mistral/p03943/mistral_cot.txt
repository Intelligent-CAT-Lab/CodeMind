 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input, a, b and c, which are 10, 30 and 20 respectively.
The variable ans is initialized to "No".
The code then checks if a + b == c, which is True. Since a + b == c, the variable ans is set to "Yes".
The code then checks if a + c == b, which is True. Since a + c == b, the variable ans is set to "Yes".
The code then checks if b + c == a, which is True. Since b + c == a, the variable ans is set to "Yes".
Since all three conditions are met, the final value of ans is "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
