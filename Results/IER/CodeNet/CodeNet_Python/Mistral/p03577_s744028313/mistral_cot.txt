<<<Analysis>>>
The code uses the `input()` function to read a line of input from the user. The input is stored in the variable `input()`.
The `[:-8]` slice notation is used to extract a substring from the input variable. The `[:-8]` means to extract all characters from the beginning of the string up to the 7th character (exclusive).
The `print()` function is then used to print the extracted substring.
