 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n, variable m, and variable k are initialized to 2, 2, and 2, respectively.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to store the final result.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider all possible combinations of i and j.
For each combination, it checks if i is equal to j. If it is, it adds the value of Ms to ans. If it is not, it calculates the value of d and adds it to ans.
After the loop finishes, the code calculates the value of ans using the formula (n*m-2)!/(n*m-k)!*(k-2)! and adds it to the previous value of ans.
Finally, the code prints the final value of ans.
