 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module, which allows it to exit the program if it finds a solution.
It then reads an integer N from the user, which is 2 in this case.
The code then enters two nested loops that iterate from 1 to 3500 (inclusive).
For each pair of numbers h and n in this range, it checks if the condition 4*n*h-N*h-N*n >0 is met. This condition is met when h=1 and n=2.
If the condition is met, it checks if the product of N, h and n is divisible by the difference between 4*n*h-N*h-N*n. This condition is met when h=1 and n=2.
If both conditions are met, it calculates the value of w by dividing the product of N, h and n by the difference between 4*n*h-N*h-N*n. In this case, w=1.
The code then prints the values of h, n and w, which are 1, 2 and 1, respectively.
Finally, the code exits the program using the sys.exit() function.
