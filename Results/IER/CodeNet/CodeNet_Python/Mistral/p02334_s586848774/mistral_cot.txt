 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first initializes two lists, fac and pw, to store the factorial and power values, respectively.
The factorial values are calculated using a loop that iterates from 1 to 2000, and the power values are calculated using a loop that iterates from 1 to 1000.
The values are stored in the modulus 10**9 + 7 to avoid integer overflow.
The input is then read from the user, which is split into two integers n and k.
Finally, the product of the factorial and power values at indices n+k-1, n and k-1, respectively, is calculated and printed.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code for the input `5 3` is 105.
