 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first reads the input using the `LI()` function, which returns a list of integers separated by spaces. The input is `1000 900 850`, so the list returned by `LI()` is `[1000, 900, 850]`.
The code then uses the `max()` function to find the maximum value in the list, which is `900`.
The code then uses the `index()` function to find the index of the maximum value in the list, which is `1`.
Finally, the code uses the `s[a.index(max(a))]` expression to print the character at index 1 of the string `s`, which is `B`.
<<<Output>>>
B
