 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an input string S using the `input()` function.
It then checks if the first and second characters of S are equal and the third and fourth characters are also equal.
If this condition is met, it prints "Yes".
If the first and third characters of S are equal and the second and fourth characters are also equal, it prints "Yes".
If the first and fourth characters of S are equal and the second and third characters are also equal, it prints "Yes".
If none of these conditions are met, it prints "No".
For the input `ASSA`, the first and second characters are equal (both are 'A'), the third and fourth characters are also equal (both are 'S'), and the first and third characters are not equal (A and S are not equal).
Therefore, the code will print "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
