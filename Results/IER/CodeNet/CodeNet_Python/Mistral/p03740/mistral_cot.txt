 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, x and y, separated by a space.
It uses the `map()` function to convert the input string into two integers.
The `abs()` function is used to calculate the absolute difference between x and y.
The `if` statement checks if the absolute difference is less than or equal to 1.
If it is, the code prints "Brown", otherwise it prints "Alice".
<<<Output>>>
Alice
