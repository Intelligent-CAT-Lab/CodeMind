 <<<Analysis>>>
The code imports the math module, which provides mathematical functions.
The input is split into four variables: x1, y1, x2 and y2, which are assigned the values 0, 0, 1 and 1, respectively.
The function hypot() from the math module is called with the arguments (x2-x1, y2-y1), which is (1, 1).
The function returns the distance between the two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) in the Cartesian plane.
The return value of the function is 1.7320508075599253.
<<<Output>>>
