 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input N, which is 3 in this case.
It then enters a loop that iterates from 2000 to 1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 2000 to 1.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i*(i-1)//2 == N, which is 3*(3-1)//2 = 3 in this case.
Since the condition is met, the code sets c to 1 and creates a list X of length i.
It then enters two nested loops that iterate from j to i-1 and from j+1 to i, respectively.
For each pair (j, k), it appends c to the list X[j] and X[k].
After the loops finish, the code prints "Yes" and the length of X, which is 3.
It then prints the length of each list in X, which is 1, 1 and 1.
Finally, the code breaks out of the loop.
