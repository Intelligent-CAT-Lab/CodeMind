 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys and numpy modules.
It then reads a single integer n from the standard input (sys.stdin) and stores it in the variable n.
The code then calculates the square root of n using numpy's sqrt function and stores the result in the variable a.
Finally, the code prints the square of a, which is a*a.
<<<Output>>>
