 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes four integers as input, which are then converted to a list and stored in the variables A, B, H, and M.
The variable l is calculated by multiplying H by 360/12 and M by 30/60, and adding the two results.
The variable s is calculated by multiplying M by 360/60.
The variable ang is calculated by taking the absolute value of the difference between l and s.
The variable c is calculated using the formula c = A**2 + B**2 - 2*B*A*math.cos(math.radians(ang)).
Finally, the code takes the square root of c using the math.sqrt() function and prints the result.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is 10.0.
