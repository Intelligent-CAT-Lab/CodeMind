 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input, m, f and b.
It first checks if m+f is less than b. If it is, it prints "NA".
If m is greater than or equal to b, it prints "0".
If neither of the above conditions is met, it prints the difference between b and m.
In this case, m is 1000, f is 3000 and b is 3000.
Since m+f is 4000, which is greater than b, the code prints "0".
<<<Output>>>
