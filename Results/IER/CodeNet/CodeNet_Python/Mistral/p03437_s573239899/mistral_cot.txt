 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input as a string, which is then split using the split() method to create a list of strings.
The list comprehension [int(x) for x in input().split()] is used to convert each string in the list to an integer.
The resulting list is assigned to the variable x.
The variable y is assigned the value 6.
The code then checks if x is divisible by y using the modulo operator (%).
Since 8 is divisible by 6, the condition is met and the code prints -1.
<<<Output>>>
-1
