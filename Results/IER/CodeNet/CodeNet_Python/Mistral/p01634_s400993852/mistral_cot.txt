 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the `re` module, which is used for regular expressions.
The user is prompted to enter a password, which is stored in the variable `lst`.
The code then checks if the length of the password is at least 6 characters. If it is, it proceeds to check if the password contains at least one digit, one uppercase letter and one lowercase letter.
The `re.findall()` function is used to find all occurrences of a pattern in a string. In this case, the patterns are "[0-9]", "[A-Z]", and "[a-z]".
If all three patterns are found in the password, the code prints "VALID". Otherwise, it prints "INVALID".
If the length of the password is less than 6 characters, the code prints "INVALID".
<<<Output>>>
INVALID
