 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input n, which is 3 in this case.
The variable l is initialized as an empty list.
The variable i is initialized to 1.
The while loop runs until n is greater than 0.
Inside the loop, n is subtracted by i, and t is calculated as i*(i-1)/2.
Then, a list of integers from t+1 to t+i is created and added to l.
After the loop finishes, the condition n < 0 is checked. Since it is not true, the code prints "Yes".
Then, the variable ans is initialized as [i+1] + [i] + [l[j][-1] for j in range(i)].
The for loop iterates i times and adds i to ans, then adds l[j][-1] for j in range(i) to ans.
Finally, the for loop iterates i times again and adds i to ans, then adds l[j] for j in range(j+1, i) and l[k][j] for k in range(j+1, i) to ans.
The final value of ans is [4, 3, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,
