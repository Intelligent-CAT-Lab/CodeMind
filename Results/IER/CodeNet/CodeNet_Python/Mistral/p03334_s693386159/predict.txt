The return value of the code would be a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the row and column indices of a True element in the grid.
For the input `2 1 2`, the output would be:
```
(0, 0)
(0, 1)
(1, 0)
(1, 1)
```
This means that the True elements in the grid are located at the top-left, top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right corners.
