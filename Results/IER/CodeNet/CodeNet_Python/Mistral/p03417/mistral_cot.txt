 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers N and M as input.
It first checks if the maximum of N and M is equal to 1. If it is, it prints 1.
If the minimum of N and M is equal to 1, it calculates the product of N and M minus 2 and prints it.
If neither of the above conditions are met, it calculates the product of N minus 2 and M minus 2 and prints it.
In this case, N and M are both equal to 2, so the maximum and minimum are both 2.
Since neither of the conditions are met, the code proceeds to the else block and calculates (2-2)*(2-2) = 0.
<<<Output>>>
