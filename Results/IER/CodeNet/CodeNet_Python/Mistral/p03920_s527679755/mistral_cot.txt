 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first defines three functions: getN(), getNM() and getList().
getN() returns an integer by reading input from the user.
getNM() returns a tuple of two integers by reading input from the user and splitting it by spaces.
getList() returns a list of integers by reading input from the user and splitting it by spaces.
The code then initializes N to the value returned by getN().
It then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 10^4 (inclusive).
For each number i in this range, it calculates the upper bound of the sum of numbers less than or equal to i.
It then initializes tar to an empty list and calculates the difference between the upper bound and N.
It then enters another loop that iterates from 1 to M (inclusive).
For each number j in this range, it checks if j is not equal to the difference between the upper bound and N.
If it is not, it appends j to tar.
After the loops finish, the code prints the sum of tar, M, upper and diff.
It then checks if 1628 is in tar.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is not a single value, it is a combination of multiple values printed to the console.
The output of the code is:
```

Therefore, the return value of the code is a combination of multiple values printed to the console.
