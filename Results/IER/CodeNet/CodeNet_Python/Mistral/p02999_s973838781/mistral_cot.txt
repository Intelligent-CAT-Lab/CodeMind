<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs, X and A, and converts them to integers using the `map()` function.
The `input()` function reads a line from the console and returns it as a string. The `split()` method is then called on this string to split it into a list of words, which are then converted to integers using the `map()` function.
The code then checks if X is less than A. If it is, it prints 0. Otherwise, it prints 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
