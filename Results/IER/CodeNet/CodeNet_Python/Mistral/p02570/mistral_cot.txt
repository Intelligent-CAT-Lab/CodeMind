 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input as a string, which is then split using the split() method to create a list of integers. The list is stored in the variable data.
The code then checks if the first element of the list divided by the second element of the list is less than or equal to the third element of the list.
If this condition is true, the code prints 'Yes', otherwise it prints 'No'.
In this case, the input is `1000 15 80`, which means data[0] = 1000, data[1] = 15 and data[2] = 80.
Since 1000/15 is greater than 80, the condition is not met and the code prints 'No'.
<<<Output>>>
No
