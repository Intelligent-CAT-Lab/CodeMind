 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input n, which is 4 in this case.
It then calculates 2**n, which is 16.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 15 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 15.
For each number i in this range, it initializes a list temp with n elements, all set to 0.
It then sets j to i and starts a while loop that continues until j is 0.
Inside the while loop, it checks if j is odd by checking if j%2==1. If it is, it sets temp[count] to 1.
It then divides j by 2 and increments count.
After the while loop finishes, it creates a new list temp2 that contains all the indices of temp where temp[i]==1.
It then prints i, followed by a colon if i is not the last number in the loop, or nothing if it is.
Finally, it prints the elements of temp2.
For i=0, temp2 is empty, so it prints nothing.
For i=1, temp2 is [0], so it prints 1:0.
For i=2, temp2 is [1], so it prints 2:1.
For i=3, temp2 is [2], so it prints 3:2.
For i=4, temp2 is [3], so it prints 4:3.
For i=5, temp2 is [4], so it prints 5:4.
For i=6, temp2 is [5], so it prints 6:5.
For i=7, temp2 is [6], so it prints 7:6.
For i=8, temp2 is [7], so it prints 8:7.
For i=9, temp2 is [8], so it prints 9:8.
For i=10, temp2 is [9], so it prints 10:9.
For i=11, temp2 is [10], so it prints 11:10.
For i=12, temp2 is [11], so it prints 12:11.
For i=13, temp2 is [12], so it prints 13:12.
For i=14, temp2 is [13], so it prints 14:13.
For i=15, temp2 is [14], so it prints 15:14.
