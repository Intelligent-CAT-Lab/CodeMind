 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an input string `S` and initializes a variable `ans` to 10**9. It then creates a set `hoge` from the input string `S`.
The code then iterates through each character in the alphabet and checks if it is not in the set `hoge`. If it is not, it continues to the next character.
For each character, the code creates a copy of the input string `S` and iteratively removes characters from it until the character is removed. The length of the resulting string is then compared with the current value of `ans`. If the length is smaller than the current value of `ans`, it updates the value of `ans`.
The code continues this process for all characters in the alphabet.
Finally, the code prints the value of `ans`, which is the minimum number of characters needed to remove all occurrences of each character in the input string `S`.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is the minimum number of characters needed to remove all occurrences of each character in the input string `S`.
For the input string `serval`, the minimum number of characters needed to remove all occurrences of each character is 10.
Therefore, the return value of the code for the input string `serval` is 10.
