 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a line of input from sys.stdin, which is assumed to be a string of digits.
The input is split into a list of digits using the split() method.
The digits are then sorted using the sorted() function.
The sorted digits are then compared to the list '1479' using the == operator.
If the sorted digits are equal to the list '1479', the code prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
<<<Output>>>
NO
