 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module and sets the input function to read from standard input.
It then defines a lambda function mii that takes an input string and returns a list of integers by splitting the string and converting each element to an integer.
The code then defines a function get that takes an integer n as input and returns a list of edges for a line graph that satisfies the condition n=2k+1 (except n=1).
The function first calculates the power of 2 that is closest to n and makes a line graph by adding edges between adjacent vertices.
It then checks if n is a power of 2 and adds an edge between n and n-1 if it is.
Finally, it checks if n is divisible by 4 and adds an edge between n and n+1 if it is.
The code then reads an integer n from standard input and calls the get function with n as input.
If the function returns a list of edges, it prints "Yes" and the list of edges.
Otherwise, it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
