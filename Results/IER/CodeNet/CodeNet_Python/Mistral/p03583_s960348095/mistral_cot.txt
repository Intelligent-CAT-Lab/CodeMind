 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports several modules, including `math`, `sys`, `random`, `itertools`, and `bisect`. It also sets the recursion limit to 10^5.
The `solve()` function is defined, which takes an integer `N` as input and iterates through all possible pairs of integers `h` and `w` such that `h * w` is divisible by `N`. For each pair, it calculates the value of `n` using the formula `n = N * h * w / (4 * h * w - N * w - N * h)`. If `n` is an integer greater than 0, it prints the pair `(h, w)` and returns.
The `main()` function is defined, which simply calls the `solve()` function.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is the pair `(2, 2)`, since `2 * 2 = 4` and `4 - 2 - 2 = 0`.
Therefore, the output of the code would be:
```
2 2
```
