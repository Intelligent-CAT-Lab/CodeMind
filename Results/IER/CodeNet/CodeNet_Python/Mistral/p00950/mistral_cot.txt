 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the itertools module and defines a base string of characters that can be used to represent the input string.
The input string is read from the user and its length is stored in the variable l.
A mapping is created to store the count of each character in the input string.
The variable cnt is used to keep track of the number of characters in the input string.
The code then enters a loop that iterates through all possible permutations of the base string.
For each permutation, the solve function is called with the get function as its argument.
The solve function takes in a read function that returns the next character in the input string.
The solve function uses a series of helper functions to parse the input string and evaluate its expression.
The number function returns the value of the current number being parsed.
The factor function returns the value of the current factor being parsed.
The term function returns the value of the current term being parsed.
The expr function returns the value of the current expression being parsed.
The solve function checks if the sum of the equals signs in the input string is equal to 1.
If it is, it evaluates the expression and returns 1 if the result is equal to the result of the expression.
If not, it returns 0.
The get function returns the next character in the input string based on the current permutation of the base string.
The code then adds up the results of all the solve function calls for all the permutations and prints the final result.
