 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input n using the `input()` function and stores it in the variable `n`.
The code then checks if n is equal to 3, 4 or 5 using a series of if-else statements.
If n is 3, the code prints the tuple (22, 3, 5) and exits the program using the `exit()` function.
If n is 4, the code prints the tuple (2, 3, 4, 9) and exits the program using the `exit()` function.
If n is 5, the code prints the tuple (2, 3, 4, 6, 9) and exits the program using the `exit()` function.
If n is not equal to 3, 4 or 5, the code calculates the values of a and b using integer division and modulo operations, respectively.
The code then initializes an empty list `ans` to store the final output.
The code then enters a for loop that iterates a number of times equal to the value of a.
For each iteration of the loop, the code appends four elements to the `ans` list using the formula 6*i+2, 6*i+3, 6*i+4 and 6*i+6.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if a is even or odd using the modulo operator (%).
If a is even, the code checks the value of b using another series of if-else statements.
If b is 1, the code appends the value 6*a+6 to the `ans` list.
If b is 2, the code appends the values 6*a+2 and 6*a+4 to the `ans` list.
If b is 3, the code appends the values 6*a+2, 6*a+4 and 6*a+6 to the `ans` list.
If a is odd, the code checks the value of b using another series of if-else statements.
If b is 0, the code removes the last element of the `ans` list using the `del` keyword.
If b is 1, the code appends the value 6*a+3 to the `ans` list.
If b is 2, the code appends the values 6*a+3 and 6*a+6 to the `ans` list.
If b is 3, the code appends the values 6*a+2, 6*a+3 and 6*a+4 to the `ans` list.
Finally, the code prints the elements of the `ans` list using the `print()` function and the `*` operator to unpack the list into individual arguments.
