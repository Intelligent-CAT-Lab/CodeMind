 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first initializes two lists: ref and aizu. ref is initialized with the string "AADINNUY" and aizu is initialized with the string "AIZUNYAN".
The code then prompts the user to enter a string using the raw\_input() function. The input string is stored in the variable inp.
The code then checks if the length of the input string is less than 8. If it is, the input string is printed.
If the length of the input string is greater than or equal to 8, the code initializes an empty string ans and a variable i to 0.
The code then enters a while loop that iterates until i is less than the length of the input string.
Inside the loop, the code checks if the substring inp[i:i+8] is equal to ref. If it is, the code appends aizu to ans and increments i by 8.
If the substring inp[i:i+8] is not equal to ref, the code appends inp[i] to ans and increments i by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans.
<<<Output>>>
AIZUNYAN
