 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes two inputs separated by a space, which are then split using the `split()` method and stored in the variables `a` and `b`.
The `int()` function is then used to convert the string inputs to integers.
The code then checks if both `a` and `b` are between 0 and 9 (inclusive) using an `if` statement.
If both conditions are met, the code multiplies `a` and `b` and prints the result.
If either of the conditions is not met, the code prints `-1`.
<<<Output>>>
