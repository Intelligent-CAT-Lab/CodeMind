 <<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by entering an infinite loop using a while 1: statement.
Within the loop, it reads an integer n from the user using input() and stores it in the variable n.
It then reads n strings from the user using input() and stores them in the list S.
The code then initializes a list dup to all zeros and iterates through each element in S.
For each element, it checks if it appears in any other element in S and if so, it sets the corresponding element in dup to 1.
It then removes all elements from S that have a corresponding 1 in dup.
The code then initializes a 2D list P to all zeros and iterates through each element in S.
For each element, it iterates through all other elements in S and checks if the current element appears in the current position of the other element.
If it does, it sets the corresponding element in P to the length of the other element minus the position of the current element in the other element.
The code then calculates the value of ALL, which is 2^n - 1, and initializes a variable up to 300.
It then initializes a dictionary memo to store the results of previous function calls.
The function dfs is defined to recursively calculate the minimum number of operations required to transform the current state of S into a state where all elements are distinct.
The function takes two arguments: state, which is a binary representation of the current state of S, and i, which is the index of the current element in S.
The function first checks if the current state and index have already been calculated before and returns the stored result if they have.
If not, it initializes a variable res to the maximum possible value and iterates through all other elements in S.
For each other element, it checks if the current element appears in the current position of the other element.
If it does, it recursively calls dfs with the updated state and index and adds the length of the other element minus the position of the current element in the other element to res.
The function then stores the result in memo and returns it.
The code then prints the minimum number of operations required to transform the current state of S into a state where all elements are distinct.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code would be 10.
