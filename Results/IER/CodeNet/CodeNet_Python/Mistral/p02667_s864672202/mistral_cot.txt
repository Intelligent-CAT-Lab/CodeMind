 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first reads the input string `1101` using the `SI()` function.
It then calculates the length of the string `n` and divides it by 2 to get `n2`.
The variable `ans` is then calculated as `n2*(n2+1)+n%2*(n2+1)`.
The variable `rem` is initialized to 0.
The code then iterates over the characters in the input string using a for loop.
For each character `c`, if it is equal to `1`, the code continues to the next iteration.
Otherwise, it subtracts `(rem+1)//2` from `ans` and updates the value of `rem`.
If `rem` is even and the current index `i` is even, it subtracts 1 from `ans`.
If the difference between `i` and `rem` is even, it adds 1 to `rem`.
Finally, the code prints the value of `ans`.
