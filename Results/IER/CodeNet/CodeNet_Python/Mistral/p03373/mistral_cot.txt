 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads five integers from standard input, which are stored in the variables a, b, c, x, and y.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to store the final answer.
The code then checks if 2 \* c is less than or equal to a + b. If it is, it means that c is a factor of both a and b, and it proceeds to calculate the answer using the formula:
ans += min(x, y) \* 2 \* c
It then subtracts the minimum of x and y from both x and y, and checks if x is not zero and 2 \* c is less than or equal to a. If it is, it adds 2 \* c \* x to ans. If x is not zero but y is, it adds b \* y to ans. If y is not zero and 2 \* c is less than or equal to b, it adds 2 \* c \* y to ans. If neither of these conditions is met, it means that c is not a factor of both a and b, and it proceeds to calculate the answer using the formula:
ans = x \* a + y \* b
Finally, the code writes the value of ans to standard output.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code based on the input `1500 2000 1600 3 2` is 10800.
