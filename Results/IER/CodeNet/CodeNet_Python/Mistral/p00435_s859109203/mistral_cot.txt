 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an input string S, which is "MRL".
It then initializes an empty list A.
The code then iterates over each character in the input string S using a for loop.
For each character, it converts it to its ASCII value using the ord() function and subtracts 65 and 3 to get a number in the range [0, 22].
It then takes the remainder of this number when divided by 26, which gives a number in the range [0, 25].
It adds 65 to this number to get a number in the range [65, 90], which corresponds to the ASCII value of an uppercase letter.
It then appends this letter to the list A.
After the loop finishes, the code iterates over the list A and prints each letter.
<<<Output>>>
MRL
