 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input N, which is 2 in this case.
The function `solve` is then called with N as its argument.
The function `solve` uses two nested loops to iterate over all possible pairs of integers (i,j) that satisfy the conditions of the problem.
For each pair (i,j), it checks if the difference between 4*i*j and N*(i+j) is positive and if the remainder when 4*i*j is divided by N*i*j is 0.
If both conditions are met, it returns the pair (i,j) and the ratio of N*i*j to 4*i*j-N*(i+j).
After the loops finish, the function returns the values of h, n, and w, which are 1 and 2, respectively.
<<<Output>>>
(1, 2, 2)
