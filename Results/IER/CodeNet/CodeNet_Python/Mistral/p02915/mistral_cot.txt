<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads input from the standard input (sys.stdin) and stores it in the variable n.
The input is split into a list of strings using the split() method, and the first element of the list is selected using the index 0.
The first element is then converted to an integer using the int() function.
The code then raises the integer to the power of 3 using the ** operator and prints the result.
<<<Output>>>
8
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
The return value of the code is 8, which is the result of 2 raised to the power of 3.
