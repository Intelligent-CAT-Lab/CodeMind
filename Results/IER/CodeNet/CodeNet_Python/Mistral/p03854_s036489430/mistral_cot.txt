 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `examC` takes no input and returns a string.
The function first initializes a string `St` using the `S()` function, which reads a line from standard input and strips any leading/trailing whitespace.
It then initializes a list `t` containing the strings "dream", "dreamer", "erase", and "eraser".
The function then initializes two variables `i` and `cur`. `i` is set to the length of `St` minus 1, and `cur` is set to an empty string.
The function enters a while loop that iterates from `i` down to 0. For each iteration, it concatenates the current character of `St` with `cur`, and then decrements `i`.
After the loop finishes, the function checks if `cur` is in the list `t`. If it is, it sets `cur` to an empty string.
If `cur` is still not empty after the loop finishes, the function sets `ans` to "NO". Otherwise, it sets `ans` to "YES".
Finally, the function prints the value of `ans`.

<<<Output>>>
NO

Therefore, the return value of the code `erasedream` would be "NO".
