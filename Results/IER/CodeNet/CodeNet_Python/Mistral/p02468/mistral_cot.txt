<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers m and n as input, which are separated by a space.
The variable mod is initialized to 10**9+7, which is used as the modulus for the exponentiation operation.
The code then uses the built-in function `pow()` to raise m to the power of n modulo mod.
The return value of the function is the result of this exponentiation operation.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code for the input `2 3` is 8.
