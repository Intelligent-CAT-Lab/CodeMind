 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string input and iterates through each character in the string.
It keeps track of the number of consecutive "R" characters (rc) and the number of consecutive "L" characters (lc) and the position of the last "R" character (p).
It also keeps track of the state of the algorithm, which is either 1 (R) or 0 (L).
It also keeps track of an array ans, which will store the final answer.
For each character in the string, it checks the state and the character.
If the state is 1 (R) and the character is "R", it increments rc. If the character is "L" and the state is 1 (R), it increments rc and updates the ans array.
If the state is 0 (L) and the character is "L", it increments lc. If the character is "R" and the state is 0 (L), it updates the ans array.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final ans array.
