The return value of the code is not applicable, as the code does not return a value. Instead, it prints the length of L and the number of edges, followed by each edge in the list of edges.
For the input 4, the output would be:
```
4 2
(1, 2, 2)
(2, 3, 0)
```
This means that the length of L is 4 and there are 2 edges in the list of edges. The first edge is from node 1 to node 2 with weight 2, and the second edge is from node 2 to node 3 with weight 0.
