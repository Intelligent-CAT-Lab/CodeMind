 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module and defines three lambda functions: sr, ir, and lr.
The sr function reads a line from the standard input and removes the newline character.
The ir function reads a line from the standard input and converts it to an integer.
The lr function reads a line from the standard input, splits it into a list of integers, and converts each integer to an integer.
The code then reads a single integer from the standard input using the ir function and stores it in the variable L.
The code then creates a list of edges by iterating over the range of 1 to length-1 (where length is the number of bits in L). For each edge, it appends two tuples: (i, i+1, 2**(i-1)) and (i, i+1, 0).
The first tuple represents the edge from node i to node i+1 with weight 2**(i-1), and the second tuple represents the edge from node i to node i+1 with weight 0.
The code then iterates over the range of length-1 to 0 (inclusive) and for each i in this range, it checks if the (i+1)th bit of L is set to 1. If it is, it updates L by subtracting 2**i and appending a new edge from node i+1 to node length with weight L.
Finally, the code prints the length of L and the number of edges, followed by each edge in the list of edges.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is not applicable, as the code does not return a value. Instead, it prints the length of L and the number of edges, followed by each edge in the list of edges.
For the input 4, the output would be:
```
4 2
(1, 2, 2)
(2, 3, 0)
```
This means that the length of L is 4 and there are 2 edges in the list of edges. The first edge is from node 1 to node 2 with weight 2, and the second edge is from node 2 to node 3 with weight 0.
