 <<<Analysis>>>
The input `000` is a string with three zeros.
The function `f` takes a string as input and returns an integer.
The function first checks if the string contains any operators `'('`, `')'`, `'+'`, `'-'`, `'*'` or `'/'`. If it does, it returns -1.
If the string does not contain any operators, it checks if the string contains any multiplication or division operations.
If it does, it converts the string to binary and returns the result.
If the string does not contain any multiplication or division operations, it checks if the string contains any addition or subtraction operations.
If it does, it converts the string to binary and returns the result.
If the string does not contain any addition or subtraction operations, it returns the string itself.

In this case, the input `000` does not contain any operators, multiplication or division operations, addition or subtraction operations, or any other special characters. Therefore, the function returns the string itself, which is `000`.
