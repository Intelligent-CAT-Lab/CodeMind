 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input, a, b and c.
It uses the `map()` function to convert the input string into integers.
The `input().split()` method splits the input string into a list of integers.
The `map()` function then converts the list of integers into a tuple (a, b, c).
The code then uses the `any()` function to check if at least one element in the range 1 to b (inclusive) satisfies the condition that a * i % b == c.
The condition is met when i is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20.
If at least one element satisfies the condition, the code prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".
<<<Output>>>
YES
