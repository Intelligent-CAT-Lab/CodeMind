 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes two integers as input, a and b, using the `input().split()` method. The input is split by spaces and the resulting list is converted to integers using the `map()` function.
The code then checks if a and b are between 1 and 9 (inclusive) using an if-else statement. If both numbers are within the range, the code multiplies them and prints the result. If either number is outside the range, the code prints -1.
<<<Output>>>
-1
