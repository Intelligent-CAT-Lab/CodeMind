 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first defines a function `main()` which takes no arguments.
Within the function, it reads an input value `N` from the user.
It then converts the input value `N` to a list of characters and assigns the characters to variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`.
The code then checks if `a` is equal to `b` and `b` is equal to `c`, or if `b` is equal to `c` and `c` is equal to `d`.
If either of these conditions is true, the code prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
