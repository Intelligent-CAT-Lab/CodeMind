 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, a and b.
It first checks if a is greater than or equal to b. If it is, it prints 1.
If not, it checks if b is divisible by a. If it is, it prints the quotient of b divided by a. If not, it prints the quotient of b divided by a plus 1.
In this case, a is 3 and b is 5. Since a is not greater than or equal to b, the code proceeds to the next condition.
Since b is not divisible by a, the code prints the quotient of b divided by a plus 1, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
