The variable n is initialized to 11.
The function make\_divisors(n) is called with n as the argument.
The function make\_divisors(n) returns a list of divisors of n.
The variable ans is initialized to n-1 if n is odd, otherwise 2*n-1.
The function crt(r, m) is called with r=[0, y-1] and m=[x, y] as the arguments.
The function crt(r, m) returns a tuple of two values: rem and mod.
The variable rem is the remainder of the division of ans by mod.
The variable mod is the divisor of ans by rem.
The variable ans is updated to the minimum of ans and rem.
The final value of ans is printed.
