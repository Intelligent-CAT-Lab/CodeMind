 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input from the standard input, which is `RRRRLLLLRRRR`.
It then initializes an empty list `rr` to store the results of the function `f` applied to each input string.
The function `f` takes a string `n` as input and returns an integer.
The function `f` iterates over each character in the string `n`.
If the character is 'R', it increments a variable `t` by 1 and checks if `t` is equal to 4. If it is, it increments a variable `r` by 1 and resets `t` to 0.
If the character is not 'R', it decrements `t` by 1 and checks if `t` is equal to -4. If it is, it resets `t` to 0.
The function returns the value of `r`.
The code then enters a loop that reads the input string from the standard input until it reaches the end of the input.
For each input string, it calls the function `f` and appends the result to the list `rr`.
Finally, the code prints the list `rr` joined by newline characters.
