 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four integers as input, a, b, c and k.
It initializes a variable ans to 0, which will be used to store the final answer.
The code then checks the value of k and compares it with a and a+b.
If k is less than or equal to a, ans is set to k.
If k is less than or equal to a+b, ans is set to a.
If k is greater than both a and a+b, ans is set to a - (k - (a+b)).
In this case, k is 3, which is less than a (2) and a+b (3), so ans is set to 3 - (3 - (2+3)) = 3.
