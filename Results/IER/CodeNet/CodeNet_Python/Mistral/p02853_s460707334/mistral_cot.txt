 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes two integer inputs, x and y, separated by a space.
It then initializes a variable result to 0, which will be used to accumulate the final result.
The code then checks the values of x and y using a series of if-elif statements.
If x is 1, result is increased by 300000. If x is 2, result is increased by 200000. If x is 3, result is increased by 100000.
Similarly, if y is 1, result is increased by 300000. If y is 2, result is increased by 200000. If y is 3, result is increased by 100000.
If both x and y are 1, result is increased by 400000.
Finally, the code prints the value of result.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code based on the input `1 1` would be 700000.
