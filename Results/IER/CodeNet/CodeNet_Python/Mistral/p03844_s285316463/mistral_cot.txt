<<<Analysis>>>
The code first prompts the user to enter an expression using the `input()` function. The user enters the expression `1 + 2`.
The `eval()` function is then called on the input, which evaluates the expression and returns the result.
The `eval()` function is a built-in Python function that evaluates a string as an expression. It can be used to evaluate any valid Python expression, including arithmetic expressions, string concatenations, and function calls.
