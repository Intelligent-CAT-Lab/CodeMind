 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three input arguments, n, a and b, which are 4, 4 and 6 respectively.
The function checks if b - a < 0 or n == 1 and b - a > 0. In this case, b - a is 2 and n is 1, so the condition is not met.
The function then checks if n is equal to 1, which is not the case here.
Finally, the function calculates the return value using the formula (n-2)*(b-a)+1, which is (4-2)*(6-4)+1 = 11.
<<<Output>>>
11
