 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user using the `input()` function and stores it in the variable `a`. The `input()` function reads a line of text from the user and returns it as a string.
The `upper()` method is then called on the string `a` to convert it to uppercase.
Finally, the `print()` function is used to print the value of `a`.
