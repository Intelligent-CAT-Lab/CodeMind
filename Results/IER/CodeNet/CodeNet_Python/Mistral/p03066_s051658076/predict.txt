The variable N, variable X are initialized to 3, 3, respectively.
The variable P is initialized to 998244353.
The variable A is a 2D list that stores the number of permutations of 1's and 2's whose length is i and whose sum is j.
The variable B is a list that stores the number of permutations of 1's and 2's with length i none of whose consecutive subsequences is equal to X.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 3.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the number of permutations of 1's and 2's whose length is i and whose sum is j and stores it in A[i][j].
The code then enters another loop that iterates from 1 to 2*i (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 6.
For each number j in this range, it calculates the number of permutations of 1's and 2's whose length is i+1 and whose sum is j+1 and stores it in A[i+1][j+1].
It also calculates the number of permutations of 1's and 2's whose length is i+1 and whose sum is j+2 and stores it in A[i+1][j+2].
The code then checks if A[i+1][j+1] or A[i+1][j+2] is greater than or equal to P, and if it is, it subtracts P from it.
After the loops finish, the code enters another loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 3.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the number of permutations of 1's and 2's with length i none of whose consecutive subsequences is equal to X and stores it in B[i].
After the loop finishes, the code enters another loop that iterates from 1 to 2*i (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 6.
For each number j in this range, it calculates the number of permutations of 1's and 2's whose length is i+1 and whose sum is j and stores it in A[i+1][j].
