<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input, N, A and B. In this case, N is 10, A is 3 and B is 5.
The code then uses the built-in min() function to find the smaller of the two numbers A and B, which is 3.
It also uses the built-in max() function to find the larger of the three numbers A+B-N, 0 and 3, which is 3.
Finally, the code prints the minimum and maximum values found.
<<<Output>>>
3 3
