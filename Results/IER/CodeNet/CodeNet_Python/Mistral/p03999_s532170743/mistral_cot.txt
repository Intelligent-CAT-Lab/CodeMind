 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string S, which is "125".
The variable I\_MAX is set to the length of S, which is 3.
The variable values is an empty list that will store the results of the recursive calls.
The function calc takes three arguments: val, add, and i.
It checks if i is equal to I\_MAX. If it is, it adds add to val and appends the result to the values list.
Otherwise, it calls itself twice with different values of add and i.
The function solve calls calc with initial values of 0, int(S[0]), and 1.
It then prints the sum of the values list.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is 125.
