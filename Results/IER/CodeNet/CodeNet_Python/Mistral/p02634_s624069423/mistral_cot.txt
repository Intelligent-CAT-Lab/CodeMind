 <<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes four variables a, b, c, and d with the values 1, 1, 2, and 2, respectively.
It then initializes a 2D array dp with dimensions (c, d) and fills it with zeros.
The code then sets dp[a-1][b-1] to 1, which represents the case where a=c=d=2.
The code then checks if a=c and b=d. If this is the case, it prints 1 and exits the program.
If a=c, it prints (a**(d-b))%mod, which is (2**(2-1))%mod = 1.
If b=d, it prints (b**(c-a))%mod, which is (2**(2-2))%mod = 1.
If neither of these conditions is met, the code enters a nested loop that iterates over all possible values of y and x within the range a-1 to c-1 and b-1 to d-1, respectively.
For each pair (y, x), it calculates the value of dp[y][x] using the recurrence relation dp[y][x]=dp[y][x-1]*y +dp[y-1][x]*x - dp[y-1][x-1]*x*y.
It then sets dp[y][x] to dp[y][x]%mod to ensure that the final result is within the range [0, 998244353].
Finally, the code prints the value of dp[-1][-1]%mod, which is the final result of the calculation.
