 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string input from the user using the `input()` function and stores it in the variable `s`.
The variable `ans` is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of pairs of characters that are not equal in the input string.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to the length of the input string `s` divided by 2 (inclusive), meaning it will consider pairs of characters from the first to the second last character.
For each pair of characters, it checks if they are not equal. If they are not, it increments the value of `ans` by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of `ans`, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
