 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input, a, b and c, and stores them in the variables a, b and c, respectively.
The code then uses the abs() function to calculate the absolute value of the differences between a and b, and between b and c.
The code then compares these two absolute values using the less than operator (<).
If the absolute value of the difference between a and b is less than the absolute value of the difference between b and c, the code prints 'A'. Otherwise, it prints 'B'.
In this case, the absolute value of the difference between a and b is 5, and the absolute value of the difference between b and c is 5. Since 5 is less than 5, the code prints 'A'.
<<<Output>>>
A
