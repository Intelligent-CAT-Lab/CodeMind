 <<<Analysis>>>
The code imports the math module, which provides access to mathematical functions.
The variables n, x, and t are initialized to 20, 12, and 6, respectively.
The code uses the map() function to convert the input string into integers.
The variable n is divided by x, and the result is rounded up to the nearest integer using the ceil() function from the math module.
The result is then multiplied by t.
The final result is printed to the console.
<<<Output>>>
120
