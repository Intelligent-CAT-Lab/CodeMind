 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes two integers as input, a and b, and stores them in the variables a and b, respectively.
It then initializes an array x of length 10 with all elements set to 0.
The code then iterates through the range 0 to 9, and for each i, it sets x[i] to b*10 + i.
The code then iterates through the range 0 to 9 again, and for each i, it checks if a is equal to 0.08 times x[i]. If it is, it prints x[i] and breaks out of the loop. If it is not, it prints -1.
<<<Output>>>
-1
