 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input n and initializes a variable ans to 0.
It then enters a loop that iterates through a list of values [25, 10, 5, 1].
For each value x in this list, it calculates the remainder of n divided by x and adds the quotient to ans.
It then updates n by dividing it by x and taking the remainder.
The loop continues until n is equal to 1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans.
<<<Output>>>
10

The return value of the code based on this analysis is 10.
