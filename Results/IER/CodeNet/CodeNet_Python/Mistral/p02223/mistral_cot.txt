 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an input n, which is 2 in this case.
The code then checks the value of n using an if-elif-else statement.
Since n is equal to 2, the code executes the first block of code, which prints "1\n0\n11".
The return value of the code is the output of the program, which is "1\n0\n11".
