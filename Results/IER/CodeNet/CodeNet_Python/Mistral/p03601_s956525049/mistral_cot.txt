 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module and sets the input variable to sys.stdin.readline.
It then reads the input from the user and stores it in a list of integers.
The variables A, B, C, D, E and F are then initialized with the values from the input list.
The code then initializes two arrays, wdp and sdp, with 0 values for all elements.
The variable resa and resb are initialized to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to F (inclusive), meaning it will consider all possible values of w.
For each value of w, it checks if it is within the range [A, B], which is [1, 2] in this case. If it is, it adds w to the wdp array.
It then enters another loop that iterates from 0 to F (inclusive), meaning it will consider all possible values of s.
For each value of s, it checks if it is within the range [C, D], which is [10, 20] in this case. If it is, it adds s to the sdp array.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to F (inclusive), meaning it will consider all possible values of i.
For each value of i, it checks if sdp[i] is equal to 0. If it is, it continues to the next iteration.
It then enters another loop that iterates from 1 to F (inclusive), meaning it will consider all possible values of j.
For each value of j, it checks if i + j is less than or equal to F. If it is, it checks if wdp[j] is equal to 0. If it is, it continues to the next iteration.
It then checks if i is less than or equal to j multiplied by E divided by 100. If it is, it sets w to j and breaks out of the inner loop.
If w is not set, it continues to the next iteration.
The code then checks if resb divided by resa is less than i divided by i + w. If it is, it sets resb to i and resa to i + w.
Finally, the code prints the values of resa and resb.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is 20.0, which is the value of resa divided by resb.
