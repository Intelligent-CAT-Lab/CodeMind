 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string input from the user, which is "AIZU".
It then initializes two variables, alpha and Now, to "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ" and 0, respectively.
The variable ans is also initialized to 0, which will be used to keep track of the number of times the condition is met.
The code then enters a loop that iterates through each character in the input string S.
For each character, it finds the index of that character in the alpha string using the find() method.
It then checks if the current value of Now is less than the next value of Next. If it is, it does nothing. Otherwise, it increments the value of ans by 1.
Finally, it updates the value of Now to be the same as Next.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 2.
