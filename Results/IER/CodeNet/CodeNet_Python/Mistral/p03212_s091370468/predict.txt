The return value of the code for the input "575" would be 1.

The function checks if "575" is greater than N, which is 0, so it continues to the next step.
It checks if "575" is equal to "753", which it is not, so it sets `flag` to 0 and breaks out of the loop.
Then it loops through each character in "753" and checks if "575" contains that character. It does not, so it sets `flag` to 0 and breaks out of the loop.
Since `flag` is 0 after the loop, the function does not increment `cnt`.
Then it loops through each character in "753" and calls the `dfs()` function with "575 + i" as input. It adds the result of this call to `cnt`.
The first call to `dfs()` with "575 + 7" returns 0, the second call to `dfs()` with "575 + 5" returns 0, and the third call to `dfs()` with "575 + 3" returns 1.
So the final value of `cnt` is 1.
Therefore, the return value of the code for the input "575" would be 1.
