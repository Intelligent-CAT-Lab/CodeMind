 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes two integers as input, separated by a space. The input is split using the `split()` method and the resulting list is converted to integers using a list comprehension. The resulting list is assigned to the variables `a` and `b`.
The code then checks the values of `a` and `b` using a series of `if` and `elif` statements.
If `a` is greater than 0, the code prints "Positive".
If `a` is less than 0 and `b` is greater than 0, the code prints "Zero".
If the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even, the code prints "Negative".
If none of the above conditions are met, the code prints "Positive".
<<<Output>>>
Negative
