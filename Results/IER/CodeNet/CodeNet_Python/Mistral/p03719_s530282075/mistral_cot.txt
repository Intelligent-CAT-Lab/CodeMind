 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input, a, b and c, and stores them in the variables a, b and c, respectively.
The code then checks if c is greater than or equal to a and less than or equal to b.
If the condition is true, it prints 'Yes', otherwise it prints 'No'.
In this case, c is 2, which is less than a (3) and greater than b (1), so the condition is not met and the code prints 'No'.
<<<Output>>>
No
