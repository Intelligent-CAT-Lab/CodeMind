 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes a string input from the user using the `input()` function and stores it in the variable `s`.
It then calculates the length of the string using the `len()` function and stores it in the variable `n`.
The code then enters two loops. The first loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = n-2`, meaning it will compare every pair of adjacent characters in the string.
For each pair of adjacent characters, it checks if they are equal. If they are, it prints the indices of the characters and exits the loop using the `exit()` function.
The second loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = n-3`, meaning it will compare every pair of characters that are three positions apart in the string.
For each pair of characters that are three positions apart, it checks if they are equal. If they are, it prints the indices of the characters and exits the loop using the `exit()` function.
If none of the conditions are met, the code prints `-1, -1` as the output.
<<<Output>>>
-1 -1
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

Note: The return value of the code is not applicable as it does not return any value. It simply prints the output to the console.
