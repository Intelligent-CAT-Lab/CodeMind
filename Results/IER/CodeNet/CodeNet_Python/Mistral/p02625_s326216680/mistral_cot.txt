 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first defines two functions: `factorials_with_inv` and `solve`.
The `factorials_with_inv` function takes two arguments, k and mod, and returns two lists: fac and inv. The function calculates the factorials of numbers from 0 to k and their modular inverses.
The `solve` function takes two arguments, N and M, and uses the factorials and inverses returned by `factorials_with_inv` to calculate the number of permutations of M elements that are distinct from N elements.
The `naive` function is a brute-force approach that generates all permutations of M elements and checks if they are distinct from N elements.
The code then reads two integers N and M from the input and calls the `solve` function with these values.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is 1.
This is because there is only one permutation of 2 elements that is distinct from itself, which is (1,2).
Therefore, the return value of the code is 1.
