The variable N, variable V, variable X, and variable Y are initialized to 0, 7, 3, and 1, respectively.
The variable L, variable B, variable R, and variable T are initialized as empty lists.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider all the points.
For each point i in this range, it checks if X is greater than or equal to L[i] and if R[i] is equal to X. If both conditions are met, it checks if Y is less than or equal to T[i] and if B[i] is less than or equal to Y. If both conditions are met, it checks if the condition of the function check is met. If the condition is met, it sets ok to True.
The code then enters another loop that iterates from 0 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider all the points.
For each point i in this range, it checks if L[i] is equal to 0 and if T[i] is not equal to 0. If both conditions are met, it continues to the next point. Otherwise, it checks if the condition of the function check is met. If the condition is met, it sets ok to True.

Finally, the code checks if ok is True and prints "Yes" if it is, otherwise it prints "No".
