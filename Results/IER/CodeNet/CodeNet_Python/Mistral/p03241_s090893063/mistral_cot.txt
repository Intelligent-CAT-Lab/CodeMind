 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module, which provides access to some system-specific information and functions.
It then sets the recursion limit to the maximum of 1000 or 10**9, which is 1000 in this case.
The input function is defined as a lambda function that reads a line from the standard input, removes the newline character and returns the result.
The code then reads the input as two integers n and m, separated by a space.
It initializes the variable ans to -1, which will be used to store the maximum value found.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to m (inclusive).
For each number i in this range, it checks if i*i is greater than m+10, which is not the case in this input.
If it is not, it checks if m is divisible by i. If it is, it checks if m divided by i is greater than or equal to n. If it is, it updates the value of ans to the maximum of its current value and i. If i is greater than or equal to n, it updates the value of ans to the maximum of its current value and m divided by i.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 14.
<<<Output>>>
14
