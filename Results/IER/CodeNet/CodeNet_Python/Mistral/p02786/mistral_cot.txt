 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `atack` takes an integer `tairyoku` as input and returns an integer.
The function uses recursion to calculate the value of `tairyoku`.
If `tairyoku` is equal to 1, the function returns 1.
Otherwise, the function calculates the value of `tairyoku` by dividing it by 2 and calling the `atack` function recursively with the result of the division. The result is then multiplied by 2 and added to 1.
The function is then called with the input `H`, which is the value of `tairyoku`.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code would be 13.
