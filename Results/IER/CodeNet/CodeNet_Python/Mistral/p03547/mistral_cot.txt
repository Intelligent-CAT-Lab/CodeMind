 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first initializes six variables A, B, C, D, E and F with values 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15, respectively.
Then it reads two integers N and M from the user, which are separated by a space.
The code then compares N and M and prints a symbol ">" if N is greater than M, "=" if N is equal to M, and "<" if N is less than M.
