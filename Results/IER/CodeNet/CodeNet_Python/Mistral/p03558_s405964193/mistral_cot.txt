The variable K is initialized to 6.
The function small\_multiple is called with K as its argument.
The function small\_multiple creates a graph with K vertices, where each vertex is represented by an integer from 0 to K-1.
The graph is represented as a list of lists, where each inner list represents the neighbors of a vertex and the number of edges between them.
The function small\_multiple then calls the function bfs01 with the initial vertex 1, the destination vertex 0, the number of vertices K, and the graph created above.
The function bfs01 uses a queue to perform a breadth-first search on the graph, starting from the initial vertex 1.
It initializes a queue, a queue counter, and a list of distances from the initial vertex to all other vertices.
It adds the initial vertex 1 to the queue and sets its distance to 0.
It then enters a loop that continues until the queue is empty.
Inside the loop, it dequeues the next vertex from the queue and updates the distances of its neighbors.
If the distance of a neighbor is less than its current distance, it updates the distance of the neighbor and adds it to the queue.
If the edge between the current vertex and its neighbor is a multiple of 10, it adds the neighbor to the queue.
After the loop finishes, the function bfs01 returns the distance of the destination vertex 0 from the initial vertex 1.
The function small\_multiple then adds 1 to the result returned by bfs01 and prints it.
