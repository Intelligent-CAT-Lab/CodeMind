 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input from the user using the `input()` function and stores it in the variable `t`.
Then it multiplies the input by 2 and stores the result back in the variable `t`.
The code then uses the arithmetic operators `//` and `%` to perform integer division and modulo operation respectively.
The `//` operator performs integer division, which returns the floor of the division result. In this case, it returns the quotient of `t` divided by 60, which is 0.
The `%` operator returns the remainder of the division result. In this case, it returns the remainder of `t` divided by 60, which is 0.
<<<Output>>>
0 0
