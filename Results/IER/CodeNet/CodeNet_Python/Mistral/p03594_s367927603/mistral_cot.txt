 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input: H, W, and d. In this case, H = 2, W = 2, and d = 1.
The code then checks if d is odd or even. Since d is 1, it is odd.
If d is odd, the code prints a row of alternating "R" and "Y" characters. Since H = 2 and W = 2, the code prints two rows of alternating characters.
If d is even, the code uses a nested loop to iterate over each row and column of the grid. For each row and column, the code checks if the sum of the row and column is less than or equal to d/2, greater than or equal to d/2 but less than d, or greater than or equal to d. If the sum is less than or equal to d/2, the code prints "R". If the sum is greater than or equal to d but less than d, the code prints "Y". If the sum is greater than or equal to d, the code prints "G". If the sum is not equal to any of these conditions, the code prints "B".
Since H = 2 and W = 2, the code iterates over two rows and two columns. For the first row and first column, the sum is 1, which is less than or equal to d/2, so the code prints "R". For the first row and second column, the sum is 3, which is greater than or equal to d but less than d, so the code prints "Y". For the second row and first column, the sum is 3, which is greater than or equal to d but less than d, so the code prints "Y". For the second row and second column, the sum is 5, which is greater than or equal to d, so the code prints "G".
