 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first prompts the user to enter a number using the `input()` function and stores it in the variable `x`.
The variable `x` is then multiplied by itself three times using the `*` operator, resulting in the value `x*x*x`.
The final value of `x*x*x` is then printed to the console using the `print()` function.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code would be the result of multiplying the input number `2` by itself three times, which is 8.
Therefore, the return value of the code would be 8.
