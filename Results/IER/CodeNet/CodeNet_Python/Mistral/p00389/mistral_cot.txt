 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs, N and K, which are 4 and 2 respectively.
The variables t, n and a are initialized to 1.
The while loop runs indefinitely until the condition N < a is met.
Inside the loop, the value of n is calculated using the formula (K+a-1)//K.
The value of a is then updated by adding n to it.
The value of t is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop.
The loop continues until N < a, which is not met in this case, so the loop runs indefinitely.
The final value of t is 1, which is printed as the output.
