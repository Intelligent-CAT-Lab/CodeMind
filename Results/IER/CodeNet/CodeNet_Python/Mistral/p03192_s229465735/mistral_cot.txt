 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string `n` and uses the `count()` method to count the number of occurrences of the character "2" in the string `n`.
The `count()` method returns the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the specified substring in the string.
In this case, the input string is `1222`, which contains 4 occurrences of the character "2".
<<<Output>>>
