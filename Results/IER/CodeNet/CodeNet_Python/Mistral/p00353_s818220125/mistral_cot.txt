 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input, a, b and c.
It then checks if c is less than or equal to a. If it is, it prints "0".
If c is less than or equal to a+b, it prints c-a.
If neither of the above conditions are met, it prints "NA".
In this case, a=1000, b=3000 and c=3000.
Since c is equal to a+b, the code prints c-a, which is 3000-1000=2000.
<<<Output>>>
2000
