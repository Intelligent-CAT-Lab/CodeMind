 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first initializes a variable `mod` to 10**9 + 7, which is used as the modulus for the modular exponentiation operations.
The function `modpow` takes two arguments, `x` and `n`, and returns the result of raising `x` to the power of `n` modulo `mod`.
The variable `N` is read from the input and stored in an integer.
The variable `ans` is initialized to the result of the modular exponentiation of 10 to the power of N, minus 2 times the modular exponentiation of 9 to the power of N, plus the modular exponentiation of 8 to the power of N.
The final value of `ans` is calculated by taking the result of the modular exponentiation operations and taking the remainder when dividing by `mod`.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code would be 10, since 10**2 - 2*9**2 + 8**2 = 10.
