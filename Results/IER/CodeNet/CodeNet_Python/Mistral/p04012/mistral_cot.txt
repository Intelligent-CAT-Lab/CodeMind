 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first initializes the string Alfa to "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz".
It then prompts the user to input a string using the input() function and stores it in the variable w.
The code then iterates over each character in Alfa using a for loop.
For each character, it checks if the character appears an odd number of times in the input string w using the count() method.
If the character appears an odd number of times, the code prints "No" and exits the loop using the exit() function.
If the character appears an even number of times, the code continues to the next character.
After the loop finishes, the code prints "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
