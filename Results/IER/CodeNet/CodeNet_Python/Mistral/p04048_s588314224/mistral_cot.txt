 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs, n and x, which are 5 and 2 respectively.
The code then assigns the minimum of x and n-x to x, which is 2.
n is then assigned the value of n-x, which is 3.
The while loop starts and enters the loop body.
new\_x is calculated as n%x, which is 1.
new\_n is calculated as n//x, which is 1.
Since new\_x is not equal to 0, the loop continues.
ans is updated with x*new\_n*3, which is 6.
n is assigned the value of x, which is 2.
x is assigned the value of new\_x, which is 1.
The loop continues until new\_x is 0.
When new\_x is 0, the loop exits and the final value of ans is printed, which is 18.
<<<Output>>>
18
