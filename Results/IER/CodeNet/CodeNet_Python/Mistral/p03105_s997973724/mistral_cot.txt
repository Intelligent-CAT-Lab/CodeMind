 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input, A, B and C.
It then checks if B divided by A is greater than or equal to C. If it is, it prints C. Otherwise, it prints B divided by A.
In this case, A is 2, B is 11 and C is 4.
Since 11 divided by 2 is not greater than or equal to 4, the code prints 11 divided by 2, which is 5.5.
<<<Output>>>
5.5
