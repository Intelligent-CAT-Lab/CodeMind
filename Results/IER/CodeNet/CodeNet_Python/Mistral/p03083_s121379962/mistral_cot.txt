 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first initializes some variables and arrays.
U is set to 2*10**5, which is 20000000.
MOD is set to 10**9+7, which is 1000000007.
fact is an array of size U+1, initialized to 1 for all elements except the first element, which is set to 1.
fact\_inv is an array of size U+1, initialized to 1 for all elements except the first element, which is set to 1.
two is an array of size U+1, initialized to 1 for all elements except the first element, which is set to 1.
two\_inv is an array of size U+1, initialized to 1 for all elements except the first element, which is set to 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to U (inclusive), calculating the values of fact, two, fact\_inv and two\_inv for each number.
After the loop finishes, the code enters another loop that iterates from U to 1 (inclusive), updating the values of fact\_inv and two\_inv for each number.
The code then defines a function comb(n, k) that calculates the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, modulo MOD.
The code then reads two integers B and W from the input, and initializes two variables p and q to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to B+W (inclusive), calculating the value of ans using the formula 1 - p + q, and then multiplying it by two\_inv[1] and taking the result modulo MOD.
The code then updates the values of p and q using the formula p += comb(i-1, B-1) \* two\_inv[i] % MOD and q += comb(i-1, W-1) \* two\_inv[i] % MOD, respectively.
Finally, the code prints the value of ans.
