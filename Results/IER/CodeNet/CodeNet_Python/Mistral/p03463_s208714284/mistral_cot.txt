<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three input values, N, A, and B, and assigns them to the variables of the same name.
The code then uses an if-else statement to check if the difference between B and A is even or odd. If it is even, the code prints "Borys", otherwise it prints "Alice".
In this case, the difference between B and A is 2, which is an even number. Therefore, the code will print "Borys".
<<<Output>>>
Borys
