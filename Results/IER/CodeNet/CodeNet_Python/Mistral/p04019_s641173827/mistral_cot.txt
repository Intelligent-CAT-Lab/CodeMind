 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first reads a string input from the user and stores it in the variable S.
It then converts the string to a list and removes any duplicate elements using the set() function and converting it back to a list.
The code then initializes four variables n, w, s, and e to 0, which will be used to keep track of the number of occurrences of the letters N, W, S, and E in the string.
The code then iterates through each character in the string S and checks if it is one of the four letters N, W, S, or E. If it is, it increments the corresponding variable.
The code then creates a list called judge, which contains the values of the four variables.
The code then checks if the list judge is equal to any of the three possible combinations [(1,0,1,0), (0,1,0,1), (1,1,1,1)]. If it is, the code prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
