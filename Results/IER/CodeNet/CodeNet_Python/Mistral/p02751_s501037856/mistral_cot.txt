 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the necessary modules: sys, numpy.
It then reads the input from sys.stdin.buffer.read and splits it into two integers N and M using map(int, input().split()).
The function solve(N,M) is then called with these two arguments.
The function solve(N,M) first checks if N is greater than M. If it is, it calls itself recursively with the arguments M and N, and transposes the result.
If N is not greater than M, it initializes an array H of size (2^N) x (2^N) with all elements set to 0.
It then iterates over each row of H and performs a bitwise XOR operation on the elements in the row.
The function returns the result of this operation, which is a row of 2^N-1 bits.
Finally, the code iterates over each row of the result and prints each element as a string.
