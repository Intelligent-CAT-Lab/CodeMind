 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers N and M as input. N represents the number of streets and M represents the number of moves.
The code initializes a 2D array dp with N rows and N columns, where dp[i][j] represents the number of ways to reach street i from street j.
The code then iterates M times, each time updating the dp array using the following rules:

* If i != 0 and j != N-1, the number of ways to reach street i from street j is the sum of the number of ways to reach street i-1 from street j and the number of ways to reach street i from street j+1.
* If j > 0, the number of ways to reach street i from street j is the sum of the number of ways to reach street i from street j-1 and the number of ways to reach street i from street j.
* If j == 0, the number of ways to reach street i from street j is the number of ways to reach street i from street j-1.

After the loop finishes, the code prints the number of ways to reach street 0 from street 0, which is dp[0][0].

<<<Output>>>
dp[0][0] % mod

For the input `3 3`, the output would be:
```
dp[0][0] % mod
```
Since mod is 10^9+7, the output would be:
```
1000000007
```
Therefore, the return value of the code for the input `3 3` would be `1000000007`.
