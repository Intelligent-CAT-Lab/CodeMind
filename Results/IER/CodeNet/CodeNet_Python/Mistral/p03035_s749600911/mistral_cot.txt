 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes two integers as input, A and B, separated by a space. In this case, A is 30 and B is 100.
The code then checks if A is greater than or equal to 13. Since A is 30, which is less than 13, the code moves to the next condition.
The code then checks if A is greater than or equal to 6. Since A is 30, which is less than 6, the code moves to the next condition.
The code then prints 0, since none of the conditions were met.
<<<Output>>>
0
