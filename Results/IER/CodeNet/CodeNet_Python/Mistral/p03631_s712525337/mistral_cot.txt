<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes a string input from the user using the `input()` function and stores it in the variable `s`.
Then it checks if the string is equal to its reverse by slicing it with `[::-1]` and comparing it with the original string using the `==` operator.
If the string is equal to its reverse, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
