 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, n and k. In this case, n is 4 and k is 2.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the number of pairs that meet the condition.
The code enters a while loop that will continue until s+d > n.
Inside the loop, it checks if s/d <= k and s <= d*k. If both conditions are met, it means that the pair (s,d) is a valid pair, so it increments ans and continues to the next iteration.
The loop continues until s+d > n, which means that the maximum possible value of s+d is 4+2=6, which is less than n=4.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 1.
