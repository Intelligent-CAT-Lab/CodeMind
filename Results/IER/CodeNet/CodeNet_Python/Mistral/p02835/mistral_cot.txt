<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input, a, b and c, and stores them in the variables a, b and c, respectively.
The code then checks if the sum of a, b and c is less than 22. If it is, it prints "win", otherwise it prints "bust".
In this case, the sum of 5, 7 and 9 is 21, which is less than 22, so the code prints "win".
<<<Output>>>
win
