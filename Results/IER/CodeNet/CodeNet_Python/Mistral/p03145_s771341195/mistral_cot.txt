 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes three integers as input, a, b and c, and stores them in the variables a, b and c, respectively.
Then it creates a list with the values of a, b and c and stores it in the variable list.
The code then sorts the list in ascending order using the sort() method.
Finally, it calculates the product of the first two elements of the sorted list, divides it by 2 and prints the result.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is 10.
