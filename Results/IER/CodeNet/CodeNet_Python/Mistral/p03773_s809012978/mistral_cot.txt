<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes two integers as input, A and B, separated by a space.
It then calculates the sum of A and B and takes the remainder of this sum divided by 24.
The remainder is calculated using the modulo operator (%).
The modulo operator returns the remainder of the division of the left operand by the right operand.
In this case, the left operand is the sum of A and B, and the right operand is 24.
The remainder is then printed to the console.
<<<Output>>>
12
