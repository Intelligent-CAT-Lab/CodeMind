 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes two integers as input, x and y, and stores them in the variables x and y, respectively.
Then it checks if x is greater than y, if so, it swaps the values of x and y.
Then it enters a while loop that continues until x is divisible by y.
Inside the loop, it swaps the values of x and y again.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the value of y.
