The code takes two integers as input, X and Y, and initializes a variable `seki` to X.
It then enters a while loop that continues as long as `seki` is less than or equal to Y.
Inside the loop, `seki` is multiplied by 2 and the value of `ans` is incremented by 1.
The loop continues until `seki` is greater than Y, which means that `seki` has been multiplied by 2 `(2^1)` times, `2^2` times, `2^3` times, `2^4` times, `2^5` times, `2^6` times, `2^7` times, `2^8` times, `2^9` times, `2^10` times, `2^11` times, `2^12` times, `2^13` times, `2^14` times, `2^15` times, `2^16` times, `2^17` times, `2^18` times, `2^19` times, `2^20` times, `2^21` times, `2^22` times, `2^23` times, `2^24` times, `2^25` times, `2^26` times, `2^27` times, `2^28` times, `2^29` times, `2^30` times, `2^31` times, `2^32` times, `2^33` times, `2^34` times, `2^35` times, `2^36` times, `2^37` times, `2^38` times, `2^39` times, `2^40` times, `2^41` times, `2^42` times, `2^43` times, `2^44` times, `2^45` times, `2^46` times, `2^47` times, `2^48` times, `2^49` times, `2^50` times, `2^51` times, `2^52` times, `2^53` times, `2^54` times, `2^55` times, `2^56` times, `2^57` times, `2^58` times, `2^59` times, `2^60` times, `2^61` times, `2^62` times, `2^63` times, `2^64` times, `2^65` times, `2^66` times, `2^67` times, `2^68` times, `2^69` times, `2^70` times, `2^71` times, `2^72` times, `2^73` times, `2^74` times, `2^75` times, `2^76` times, `2^77` times, `2^78` times, `2^79` times, `2^80` times, `2^81` times, `2^82` times, `2^83` times
