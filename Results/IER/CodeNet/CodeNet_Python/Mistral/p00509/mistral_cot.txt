 <<<Analysis>>>
The function f() takes two inputs, n and c, which are 1 and 0 respectively.
The variable s is initialized to '9' multiplied by n, which is '9' in this case.
The function then enters a loop that iterates through the string '9731'.
For each character in the string, it checks if n-1 is true. If it is, it enters another loop that iterates from the largest power of 10 to 1, decrementing by 1 each time.
For each value of m, it concatenates it with the character and the value of c, and then calculates the sum of the digits of the resulting string.
If the sum is odd, it concatenates the character, the value of c, and the reversed string, and then calls the function p() to check if the resulting number is prime. If it is, it returns that number.
If the sum is even, it concatenates the character, the value of c, and the original string, and then calls the function p() to check if the resulting number is prime. If it is, it returns that number.
If neither of these conditions is met, it returns 0.
