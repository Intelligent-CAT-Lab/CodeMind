 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module, which provides access to some system-specific information and functions.
It then sets the recursion limit to 10^5, which means that the maximum depth of the recursion stack is 10^5.
The main function is defined, which takes two inputs a and b, and adds them together to get x.
The judge function is defined, which takes an integer i and checks if i^2 is equal to x. If it is, it returns True, otherwise it returns False.
The main function then calls the judge function and prints "Yes" if it returns True, otherwise it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
