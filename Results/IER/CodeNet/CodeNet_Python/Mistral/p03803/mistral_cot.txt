 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes two integers as input, separated by a space. The input is split using the `split()` method and the resulting list is converted to a list of integers using a list comprehension. The resulting list is stored in the variable `a`.
The code then takes a list of integers as input, which is stored in the variable `j`.
The code then compares the index of `a` and `b` in the list `j`. If the index of `a` is greater than the index of `b`, it prints "Alice". If the index of `a` is less than the index of `b`, it prints "Bob". If the index of `a` is equal to the index of `b`, it prints "Draw".
<<<Output>>>
Alice
