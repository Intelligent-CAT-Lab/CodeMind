The variable S is initialized to "0101 1".
The variable K is initialized to 0.
The variable mod is initialized to 998244353.
The variable a is initialized as an empty list.
The variable val is initialized to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates through each character in the string S.
If the character is "0", it appends the current value of val to the list a and resets val to 0.
If the character is not "0", it increments val by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if val is not 0 and appends it to the list a.
The variable m is initialized to the length of the list a.
The variable K is updated to be the minimum of the sum of the elements in a and 300.
The code then initializes a 2D array dp with dimensions (K+1) x (K+1).
The code initializes the first row and column of dp to 1.
The code then initializes two lists b and c with the same elements as the list a.
The code updates the list b by adding the current element to the previous element.
The code updates the list c by adding the current element to the next element.
The code then initializes a nested loop that iterates through the remaining elements in the list a.
For each element, it initializes a new 2D array ndp with dimensions (K+1) x (K+1).
The code then initializes a nested loop that iterates through the range of values from 0 to min(b[i],K) + 1.
For each value, it initializes a nested loop that iterates through the range of values from min(K,k+c[i]) + 1 to K.
For each combination of values, it calculates the maximum of k-j and -a[i], and uses this value to determine the sum of dp[j+l][k] and dp[j][k+l] that will be added to ndp[j][k].
The code then updates dp to be ndp.
Finally, the code prints the value at dp[0][0], which is 1.
