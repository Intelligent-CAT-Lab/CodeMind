 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string input `s` and iterates through each character in the string.
If the character is "B", the variable `cnt` is incremented.
Otherwise, the variable `total` is incremented by the value of `cnt`.
After the loop finishes, the variable `total` is printed.
For the input "BBW", the character "B" appears twice, so `cnt` is incremented twice.
After the loop finishes, `total` is 2 + 2 = 4.
The final value of `total` is printed, which is 4.
<<<Output>>>
4
