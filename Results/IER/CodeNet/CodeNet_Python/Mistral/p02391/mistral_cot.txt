 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, a and b, separated by a space.
The input is split using the `split()` method, which splits the input string into a list of substrings based on a specified delimiter (in this case, a space).
The resulting list contains two integers, which are assigned to the variables a and b.
The code then uses an if-elif-else statement to compare the values of a and b.
If a is less than b, it prints 'a < b'.
If a is greater than b, it prints 'a > b'.
If a is equal to b, it prints 'a == b'.
<<<Output>>>
a < b
