The return value of the code for the input `2 1 2` would be 10.

This is because the rectangular prism has dimensions 2x1x2, and there are 2 blocks that can be placed along the h and w axes, 1 block that can be placed along the k axis, and 2 blocks that can be placed along the h and w axes but not along the k axis.

Therefore, the answer is 2 \* 1 \* 2 + 1 \* 2 \* 3 \* 2 + 2 \* 1 \* 1 \
