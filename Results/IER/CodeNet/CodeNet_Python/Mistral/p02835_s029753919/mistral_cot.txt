 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input, A, B and C, and stores them in the variables A, B and C, respectively.
The code then checks if the sum of A, B and C is greater than 21. If it is, it prints "bust". Otherwise, it prints "win".
In this case, the sum of A, B and C is 21, so the code prints "win".
<<<Output>>>
win
