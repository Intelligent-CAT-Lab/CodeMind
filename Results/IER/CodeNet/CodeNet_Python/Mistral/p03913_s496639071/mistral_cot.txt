 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs, N and A, which are 8 and 1 respectively.
The variable ans is initialized to infinity, which will be used to store the minimum value found.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 40 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 40.
For each number i in this range, it calculates x using the formula x = int(math.pow(N, 1/(i+1))) and k using the formula k = 0.
It then enters a while loop that continues until x**(i+1-k) * (x+1)**k >= N.
Inside this loop, it calculates y using the formula y = x * (i+1-k) + (x+1) * k + A * i.
After the loop finishes, it compares y with ans and updates ans if y is smaller.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 1.
