<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes two integers as input, a and b, using the `input().split()` method.
The `map(int, input().split())` method converts the input string into two integers.
The variable `MASK` is defined as `(1 << 32) - 1`, which is a constant value that represents the largest unsigned integer.
The code then uses bitwise operators to perform operations on the two input integers.
The first operation is `a & b`, which performs a bitwise AND operation between the two input integers. This operation returns a new integer that has only the bits that are set in both input integers.
The second operation is `a | b`, which performs a bitwise OR operation between the two input integers. This operation returns a new integer that has all the bits that are set in either input integer.
The third operation is `a ^ b`, which performs a bitwise XOR operation between the two input integers. This operation returns a new integer that has all the bits that are set in either input integer, but not both.
The code then uses the `format()` method to print the result of each operation in binary format, with a width of 32 bits.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code would be:
```
00000000000000000000000000000000
00000000000000000000000000000000
00000000000000000000000000000000
```
This is because the bitwise AND operation returns 0, the bitwise OR operation returns 15, and the bitwise XOR operation returns 14.
