The return value of the code is the value of `X` that was found to be prime. Since the loop keeps incrementing `X` until it finds a prime number, the return value will be the smallest prime number greater than or equal to the input value. In this case, the input value is not provided, so the return value will be the smallest prime number greater than or equal to 0, which is 2.
Therefore, the return value of the code is 2.
