 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first defines a function `isPrime` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns `True` if `n` is prime, and `False` otherwise.
The function uses a while loop to check if `n` is divisible by any number `div` from 2 to the square root of `n`. If `n` is divisible by any of these numbers, the function returns `False`, indicating that `n` is not prime. If the loop completes without finding any divisors, the function returns `True`, indicating that `n` is prime.
The code then prompts the user to enter an integer `X` and enters a while loop that continues until `isPrime(X)` returns `True`. This means that the loop will keep incrementing `X` until it finds a prime number.
Finally, the code prints the value of `X` that was found to be prime.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is the value of `X` that was found to be prime. Since the loop keeps incrementing `X` until it finds a prime number, the return value will be the smallest prime number greater than or equal to the input value. In this case, the input value is not provided, so the return value will be the smallest prime number greater than or equal to 0, which is 2.
Therefore, the return value of the code is 2.
