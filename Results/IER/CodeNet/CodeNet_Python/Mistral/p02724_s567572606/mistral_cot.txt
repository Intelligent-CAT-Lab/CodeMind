 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first initializes two variables, s and p, to 0.
It then enters a while loop that continues until X is less than 500.
Inside the loop, X is subtracted by 500 and s is incremented by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code enters another while loop that continues until X is less than 5.
Inside this loop, X is subtracted by 5 and p is incremented by 1.
Finally, the code multiplies s and p by 1000 and 5, respectively, and adds the result together.
The final value of the expression is 1024.
<<<Output>>>
1024
