 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input n, which is 2 in this case.
The variable ans is initialized to 1, which will be used to store the final result.
The variable sub is initialized to 1, which will be used to store the result of the first multiplication.
The variable sub2 is initialized to 1, which will be used to store the result of the second multiplication.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 1.
For each number i in this range, it multiplies ans by 10, sub by 9 and sub2 by 8.
The code then subtracts 2*sub-sub2 from ans.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 1.
