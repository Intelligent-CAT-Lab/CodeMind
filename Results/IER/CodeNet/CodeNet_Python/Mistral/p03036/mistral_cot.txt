 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input, r, d and x, and assigns them to the variables r, d and x, respectively.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 10 (inclusive), meaning it will perform 10 iterations.
For each iteration, it calculates the value of x using the formula x = r*x-d.
The formula multiplies the current value of x by r and subtracts d. This is repeated for each iteration.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of x.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is 100.
