The function `d_XorSum` takes an integer `N` as input and returns the number of pairs of integers `a` and `b` such that `a + b <= N` and `a xor b <= N` (with `a >= b`).
The function uses dynamic programming to solve this problem. It first initializes a memo dictionary with the values `{0: 1, 1: 2}`. This represents the fact that there is only one pair of integers that satisfy the conditions when `N = 0` and `N = 1`.
The function then defines a recursive helper function `f` that takes an integer `k` as input and returns the number of pairs of integers `a` and `b` such that `a + b <= k` and `a xor b <= k`.
The function first checks if the value of `k` is already in the memo dictionary. If it is, it returns the corresponding value. Otherwise, it calculates the number of pairs of integers that satisfy the conditions by recursively calling `f` with `k // 2`, `(k - 1) // 2`, and `(k - 2) // 2`. It then adds up the results and takes the modulo with `MOD = 10**9 + 7` to ensure that the answer is within the range of a 64-bit integer.
Finally, the function returns the value of `f(N)`, which is the number of pairs of integers that satisfy the conditions for the given value of `N`.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code for `N = 3` would be 0. This is because there are no pairs of integers `a` and `b` such that `a + b <= 3` and `a xor b <= 3`.
Therefore, the return value of the code for `N = 3` would be 0.
