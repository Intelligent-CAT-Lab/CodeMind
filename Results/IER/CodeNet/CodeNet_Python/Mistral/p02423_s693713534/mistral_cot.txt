 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first initializes two variables: n and m.
n is assigned the value of the input, which is 8.
m is assigned the value of (1<<32)-1, which is 4294967295.
The code then uses bitwise operations to perform the following operations:
- `{:032b}`.format(n) prints the binary representation of n, which is 1000.
- `{:032b}`.format(~n&m) prints the binary representation of the bitwise NOT of n, ANDed with m. This operation effectively removes all the bits in n that are not set in m. The result is 1111.
- `{:032b}`.format(n<<1&m) prints the binary representation of n shifted left by 1 bit, ANDed with m. This operation effectively sets the most significant bit of the result to 1, and all other bits to 0. The result is 1000.
- `{:032b}`.format(n>>1) prints the binary representation of n shifted right by 1 bit. This operation effectively removes the most significant bit of the result, and sets all other bits to the corresponding bits in the original number. The result is 0010.
