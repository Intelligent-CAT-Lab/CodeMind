 <<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by importing the deque module from the collections module.
It then reads an integer K from the user and initializes a deque with the numbers 1 to 9.
The code then enters a loop that iterates K times.
For each iteration, it removes the first element of the deque (a) and checks if it is not divisible by 10. If it is not, it appends the number (a*10+a%10-1) to the deque.
It then appends the number (a*10+a%10) to the deque.
If a is not equal to 9, it appends the number (a*10+a%10+1) to the deque.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the value of a.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is 15.
