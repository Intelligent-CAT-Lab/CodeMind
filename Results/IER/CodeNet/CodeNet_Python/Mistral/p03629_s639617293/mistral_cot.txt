 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first initializes the input string A and its length N. It also initializes the ASCII value of 'a' to 97.
It then creates a 2D array edge of size (N+1) x 26, which will be used to store the edges of the graph.
The code then iterates through the input string A from right to left, and for each character, it updates the edge array to reflect the new edge.
The edge array is initialized with all values set to N+1, except for the first row, which is set to 0.
For each character in A, the code finds the index of the character in the alphabet and subtracts the ASCII value of 'a' to get the index of the corresponding edge.
It then updates the edge array with the new edge value.
The code then initializes a DP array recon of size (N+2) x 1, which will be used to store the previous node and character in the path.
It also initializes a deque q to store the nodes to be processed.
The code then processes the graph using a DFS algorithm.
It starts at the root node 0 and adds it to the queue.
It then pops the first node from the queue and checks if it is the end node N+1.
If it is, it breaks out of the loop.
Otherwise, it iterates through all the edges of the current node and checks if the corresponding node has already been processed.
If it has not, it updates the DP array with the new edge value and adds the corresponding node to the queue.
After the DFS is complete, the code reconstructs the path by starting at the end node N+1 and working backwards through the DP array.
It appends each character in the path to a list ans and returns the reversed string.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is the reversed string "tacoderregularcontest".
