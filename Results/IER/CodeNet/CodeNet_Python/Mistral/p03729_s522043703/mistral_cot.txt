 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three input values, A, B and C, separated by spaces.
It then checks if the last character of A is equal to the first character of B, and if the last character of B is equal to the first character of C.
If both conditions are true, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'.
<<<Output>>>
NO
