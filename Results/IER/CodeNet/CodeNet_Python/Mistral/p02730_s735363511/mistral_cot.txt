 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an input string `s` and stores it in the variable `s`. The length of the string is calculated and stored in the variable `n`.
The code then reverses the string and stores it in the variable `r_s`.
The code then checks if the original string `s` is equal to the reversed string `r_s`. If they are not equal, the code prints "No" and exits using the `sys.exit()` function.
The code then calculates the middle half of the string and stores it in the variable `top`. The middle half is obtained by taking the first half of the string and removing the last character.
The code then reverses the middle half of the string and stores it in the variable `r_top`.
The code then calculates the last half of the string and stores it in the variable `last`. The last half is obtained by taking the last half of the string and removing the first character.
The code then reverses the last half of the string and stores it in the variable `r_last`.
The code then checks if the reversed middle half `r_top` is equal to the middle half `top`. If they are not equal, the code prints "No" and exits using the `sys.exit()` function.
The code then checks if the reversed last half `r_last` is equal to the last half `last`. If they are not equal, the code prints "No" and exits using the `sys.exit()` function.
The code then prints "Yes" to indicate that the input string satisfies the conditions.
