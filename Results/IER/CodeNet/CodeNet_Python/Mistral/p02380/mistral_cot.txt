 <<<Analysis>>>
The code imports the math module, which provides mathematical functions.
The variables a, b, and c are initialized to 4, 3, and 90, respectively.
The first print statement calculates the product of a and b multiplied by half of the sine of c in radians, which is 0.5*a*b*math.sin(math.radians(c)).
The second print statement calculates the square root of the sum of the squares of a and b minus twice their product multiplied by the cosine of c in radians, which is (a+b+(a**2+b**2-2*a*b*math.cos(math.radians(c)))**0.5.
The third print statement calculates the product of b and the sine of c in radians, which is b*math.sin(math.radians(c)).
<<<Output>>>
0.5*a*b*math.sin(math.radians(c))
(a+b+(a**2+b**2-2*a*b*math.cos(math.radians(c)))**0.5
b*math.sin(math.radians(c))
