 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs, m and d, which are 15 and 40, respectively.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the number of pairs (m, d) that meet the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 22 to d (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 22 to 40.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the remainder of i divided by 10 (d0) and the quotient of i divided by 10 (d1).
The code checks if d0 is 1 or 0, and if so, it skips the current number i using the continue statement.
If m is greater than or equal to d0 * d1, it increments the value of ans by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 2.
