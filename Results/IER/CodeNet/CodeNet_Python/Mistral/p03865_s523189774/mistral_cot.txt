 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an input string `s` using the `input()` function.
It then calculates the length of the string using the `len()` function and stores it in the variable `n`.
The code then checks if the first and last characters of the string are equal. If they are, it increments the value of `n` by 1.
Finally, the code checks if `n` is even or odd using the modulo operator `%`. If `n` is even, it prints "First", otherwise it prints "Second".
For the input `aba`, the first and last characters are both "a", so `n` is incremented by 1, making it 2. Since 2 is even, the code prints "First".
