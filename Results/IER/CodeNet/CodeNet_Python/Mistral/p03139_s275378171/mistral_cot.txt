 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input, n, a and b. In this case, n is 10, a is 3 and b is 5.
The code first calculates the maximum value between a and b, which is 5.
Then it calculates the minimum value between 0 and a+b-n, which is 0.
The code then prints the maximum and minimum values.
<<<Output>>>
