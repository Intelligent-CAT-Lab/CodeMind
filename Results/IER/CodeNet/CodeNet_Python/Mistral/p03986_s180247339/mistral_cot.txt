 <<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by importing the deque module from the collections module.
It then reads input from the user and stores it in the variable x.
The length of x is stored in the variable n.
The code then initializes an empty deque called st.

The code then iterates through each character in x using a for loop.
If the current character is "S", it is added to the deque st.
If the current character is not "S", the code checks if the deque st is empty. If it is, it adds "T" to the deque. If it is not empty, it pops the last element from the deque and checks if it is "T". If it is, it adds "T" to the deque twice. If it is not, it continues to the next iteration.

After the loop finishes, the code prints the length of the deque st.
<<<Output>>>
5

The return value of the code is 5, which is the length of the deque st after the input "TSTTSS" is processed.
