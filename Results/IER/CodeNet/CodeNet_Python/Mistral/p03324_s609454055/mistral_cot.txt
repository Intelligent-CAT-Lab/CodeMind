 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs separated by a space, N and C. N is an integer and C is an integer or 100.
The code then checks if C is equal to 100. If it is, it prints 100 raised to the power of N multiplied by 101.
If C is not equal to 100, it prints 100 raised to the power of N multiplied by C.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code for the input `0 5` is 10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
