 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers N and K as input, where N is the number of sides of the star and K is the number of points on each side.
The code calculates the area of the star using the formula:
area = n*r^2*sin(180/n)*cos(180k/n)/cos((K-1)*180/n)
where n is the number of sides of the star, k is the number of points on each side, and r is the radius of the star.
The formula is derived from the formula for the area of a regular polygon, which is:
area = (1/2)*n*r^2*sin(180/n)
The formula for the area of a star is obtained by replacing the sum of the interior angles of the polygon with 180k/n, and the sum of the exterior angles with 180(k-1)/n.
The code then prints the calculated area.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code for the input `5 2` is 1.0.
This is because the formula for the area of a star with 5 sides and 2 points on each side is:
area = 5*r^2*sin(180/5)*cos(2*PI/5)/cos((2-1)*180/5) = 1.0
Therefore, the return value of the code for the input `5 2` is 1.0.
