 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes three input values separated by "/" and stores them in the variables A, B and C.
The input values are then converted to integers using the `int()` function.
The code then checks if the value of A is less than or equal to 2018. Since it is not, the code moves to the next condition.
The code then checks if the value of A is equal to 2019 and the value of B is less than or equal to 4 and the value of C is less than or equal to 30. Since all of these conditions are true, the code prints "Heisei".
Since none of the conditions are met, the code prints "TBD".
<<<Output>>>
TBD
