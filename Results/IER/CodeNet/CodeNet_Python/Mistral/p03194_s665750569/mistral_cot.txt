 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the math module.
The main function is defined, which takes two integer inputs N and P.
The variable rt is calculated by taking the square root of P and rounding down to the nearest integer.
The variable cnt is initialized as an empty dictionary.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to rt (inclusive). For each number i in this range, it checks if P is divisible by i. If it is, it increments the count of i in the cnt dictionary.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if P is not equal to 1. If it is not, it increments the count of P in the cnt dictionary.
The variable ans is initialized to 1.
The code then enters another loop that iterates over the keys in the cnt dictionary. For each key c in the cnt dictionary, it multiplies ans by c raised to the power of cnt[c] divided by N.
Finally, the code prints the value of ans.

<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code for the input `3 24` is 108.
