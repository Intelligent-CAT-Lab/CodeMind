<<<Analysis>>>
The code first uses the `map()` function to convert the input string into a list of integers. The `raw_input()` function is used to read input from the user, and the `split()` method is used to split the input string into a list of individual elements. The `map()` function is then used to convert each element of the list to an integer.
The resulting list is then passed to the `sorted()` function, which sorts the list in ascending order.
The `reversed()` function is then used to reverse the order of the sorted list.
Finally, the `for` loop iterates over the reversed and sorted list, printing each element on a new line.
