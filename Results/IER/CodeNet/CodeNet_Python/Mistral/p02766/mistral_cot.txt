 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers n and k as input, which are 11 and 2 respectively.
The variable i is initialized to 0.
The code enters a while loop that continues until n divided by k raised to the power of i is equal to 0.
Inside the loop, i is incremented by 1.
The loop continues until i is equal to 3, which is the smallest integer such that n divided by k raised to the power of i is equal to 0.
The code then prints the value of i, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>
3
