 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input n from the user.
It then converts n to a string and converts the string back to a list using the list() function.
The variable num is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of digits of n.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each digit in the list_N.
For each digit, it converts the digit back to an integer using the int() function and adds it to num.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if n is divisible by num using the modulo operator (%).
If n is divisible by num, the variable ans is set to "Yes", otherwise it is set to "No".
Finally, the code prints the value of ans.
<<<Output>>>
No
