 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input n, which is 2 in this case.
It then creates a list nl by converting the integers 1 to n (inclusive) to strings and storing them in a list.
The function perm is defined to recursively generate all permutations of the list nl.
The function first checks if the length of nl is 0, in which case it returns an empty list.
If the length of nl is 1, it returns a list containing the single element nl.
If the length of nl is greater than 1, it initializes an empty list l.
It then iterates over each element m in nl.
For each m, it creates a new list rest by removing m from nl and appending the remaining elements.
It then recursively calls perm on rest and appends the result to l.
Finally, it returns l.
The code then calls perm on nl and iterates over the resulting list of permutations.
For each permutation, it prints the elements separated by spaces.
