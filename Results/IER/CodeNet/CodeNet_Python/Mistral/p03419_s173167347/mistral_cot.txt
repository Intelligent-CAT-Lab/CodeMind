 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers n and m as input.
The first condition checks if both n and m are equal to 1. If this is the case, the code prints 1.
The second condition checks if either n or m is equal to 1. If this is the case, the code prints the maximum of n and m minus 2.
The third condition checks if both n and m are greater than 1. If this is the case, the code prints the product of n and m minus 2.
In this case, n and m are both equal to 2, so the first condition is not met.
The second condition is not met either, as neither n nor m is equal to 1.
The third condition is met, so the code prints (2-2)*(2-2), which is 0.
