 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input: a, b and x. In this case, a = 3, b = 1 and x = 5.
The variable MOD is initialized to 10^9 + 7, which is used as a modulus to avoid integer overflow.
The code then checks if x is less than a. Since x is 5 and a is 3, this condition is not met.
The code then calculates k as (x-b) // (a-b). In this case, k is 2.
The code then calculates the final result as (x + b*k) % MOD. In this case, the final result is (5 + 1*2) % 10^9 + 7 = 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
