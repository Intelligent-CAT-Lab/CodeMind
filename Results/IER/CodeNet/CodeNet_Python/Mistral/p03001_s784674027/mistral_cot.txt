 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes four inputs from the user, a, b, x and y, and converts them to float using the map() function.
Then it checks if a/2 is equal to x and b/2 is equal to y. If both conditions are true, it assigns 1 to the variable h, otherwise it assigns 0.
Finally, it prints the result of a*b/2 and the value of h.
<<<Output>>>
10 1

The return value of the code is 10, which is the result of 2*3/2.
