 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n, variable a and variable b are initialized to 4, 1 and 3, respectively.
The variable mod is initialized to 1000000007.
The function mod\_cmb is called twice, once with the arguments n, a and mod, and once with the arguments n, b and mod.
The function mod\_cmb calculates the number of combinations of k items taken r at a time, modulo p.
The function main calculates the answer by raising 2 to the power of n, subtracting the number of combinations of a items taken n at a time and the number of combinations of b items taken n at a time, and then taking the result modulo p.
The final answer is the result of (ans-tmp\_a-tmp\_b)%mod, which is (4-1-3)%1000000007 = 1.
