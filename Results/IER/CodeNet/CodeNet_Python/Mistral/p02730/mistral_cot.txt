 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an input string `s` using the `input()` function.
It then calculates the length of the string `s` and divides it by 2 to get the middle index `div`.
The code then extracts the first `div` characters of the string `s` and stores it in the variable `pre`.
It also extracts the characters from the index `div+1` to the end of the string `s` and stores it in the variable `suf`.
The code then checks if the original string `s` is equal to its reverse, and if the first `div` characters of the string `s` are also equal to their reverse, and if the characters from the index `div+1` to the end of the string `s` are also equal to their reverse.
If all three conditions are met, the code prints `Yes`, otherwise it prints `No`.
<<<Output>>>
No
