 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first defines a function f(n,deno) that takes two arguments n and deno.
The function checks if n is equal to -1, in which case it returns 0. Otherwise, it returns the result of n divided by deno rounded down (// operator) plus 1.
The code then reads three integers a, b and x from the user, which are 4, 8 and 2, respectively.
The code calls the function f(b,x) and f(a-1, x) and subtracts the result of the second function from the first one.
The result of f(b,x) is 4 and the result of f(a-1, x) is 2.
Therefore, the final result of the code is 4 - 2 = 2.
