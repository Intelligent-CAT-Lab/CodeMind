 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input: a, b and k. In this case, a = 5, b = 4 and k = 2.
The code then enters a loop that iterates k times.
For each iteration, if i is even, it checks if a is odd. If it is, it subtracts 1 from a and divides it by 2. Then it adds the result to b.
If i is odd, it checks if b is odd. If it is, it subtracts 1 from b and divides it by 2. Then it adds the result to a.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final values of a and b.
