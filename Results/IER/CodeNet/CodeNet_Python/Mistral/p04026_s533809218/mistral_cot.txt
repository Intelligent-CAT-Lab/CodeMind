 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports several modules, including `sys`, `bisect`, `math`, `itertools`, `string`, `queue`, `copy`, `numpy`, `scipy`, `collections`, `heapq`, and `defaultdict`.
It then defines several helper functions, including `inp`, `inpm`, `inpl`, `inpls`, `inplm`, `inplL`, `inplT`, `inpll`, and `inplls`. These functions are used to read input from the user and convert it into the appropriate data type.
The code then defines a function `graph`, which takes a list of integers as input and returns the number of edges and the adjacency list of the graph.
The main function `main` takes a list of integers as input and performs the following steps:
1. It checks if the length of the list is 2 and if the first two elements are equal. If so, it prints 1 and 2.
2. If the length of the list is 2 and the first two elements are not equal, it prints -1 and -1.
3. It creates a dictionary `dic` and initializes it with the frequency of each element in the list.
4. It checks if any element in the dictionary has a frequency of at least 2. If so, it prints 1 and 3.
5. It iterates over all pairs of elements in the list that are separated by 3. For each pair, it checks if the frequency of the first element is less than 2 and the frequency of the second element is greater than or equal to 2. If so, it prints the indices of the two elements.
6. If none of the above conditions are met, it prints -1 and -1.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is -1 and -1, since the input list does not meet any of the conditions specified in the `main` function.
