 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input n using the `input()` function and stores it in the variable n.
If n is equal to 1, the code prints "Hello World" and then exits using the `exit()` function.
Otherwise, the code takes two integer inputs a and b using the `input()` function and stores them in the variables a and b.
Finally, the code prints the sum of a and b using the `print()` function.
<<<Output>>>
Hello World
<END-OF-RESPONSE>
Note that the return value of the code is not explicitly defined, as the code does not return anything. Instead, it prints output to the console.
