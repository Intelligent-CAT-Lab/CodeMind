 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes three integers as input, which are 2, 1, and 3.
The function `doit` takes three arguments: `a`, `b`, and `mask`.
The function `doit` uses a bitwise XOR operation to compare the values of `a` and `b`. It then uses a bitwise AND operation to check if the current bit in the `mask` is set to 0. If it is, it checks if the current bit in the XOR of `a` and `b` is set to 1. If it is, it sets the `differ` variable to the current bit.
The function then uses another bitwise XOR operation to compare the values of `a` and `b` again. It then uses a bitwise AND operation to check if the current bit in the `mask` is set to 0. If it is, it checks if the current bit in the XOR of `a` and `b` is set to 0. If it is, it sets the `same` variable to the current bit.
If the `same` variable is not set, the function returns an empty list. Otherwise, it calls itself recursively with the new values of `a`, `b`, and `mask`, and concatenates the results of the two recursive calls.
The code then checks if the XOR of `a` and `b` has an odd number of 1's. If it does, it prints "YES" and calls the `doit` function with the initial values of `a`, `b`, and `mask`. If it doesn't, it prints "NO".
