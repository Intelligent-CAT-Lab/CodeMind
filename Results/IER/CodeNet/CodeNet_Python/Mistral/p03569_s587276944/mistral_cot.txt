 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string as input and initializes several variables.
The variable s is assigned the value of the input string, which is "xabxa".
The variable i is initialized to 0, which will be used as the starting index for the while loop.
The variable j is initialized to the length of the string minus 1, which is 4 in this case.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to store the final answer.
The while loop starts and iterates until i is greater than or equal to j.
Inside the while loop, there are three nested while loops that check for specific patterns in the string.
The first nested while loop checks if the current characters at index i and j are both "x". If they are, it increments i and decrements j, and continues the loop until i is greater than j or i is equal to j.
The second nested while loop checks if the current character at index i is "x". If it is, it increments i and adds 1 to ans, and continues the loop until i is greater than j or i is equal to j.
The third nested while loop checks if the current character at index j is "x". If it is, it decrements j and adds 1 to ans, and continues the loop until i is greater than j or i is equal to j.
After all three nested while loops have finished, the code checks if the current characters at index i and j are not equal. If they are not, it sets ans to -1 and breaks out of the while loop.
Finally, the code prints the value of ans, which is 3.
