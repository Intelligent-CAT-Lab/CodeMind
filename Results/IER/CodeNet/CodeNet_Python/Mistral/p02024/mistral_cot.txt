 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four integers as input, h, w, s, and t.
The first if statement checks if h * w % 2 == 1, which is true in this case.
The second if statement checks if (s + t) % 2 == 1, which is also true in this case.
Since both conditions are true, the code prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
