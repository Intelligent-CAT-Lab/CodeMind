 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input, A, B and C, which are 6, 4 and 3 respectively.
The variable ans is calculated by subtracting A from B and then subtracting the result from C. This gives us ans = 3-4-3 = -6.
Since ans is negative, the if condition is not met and the code prints 0.
<<<Output>>>
0
