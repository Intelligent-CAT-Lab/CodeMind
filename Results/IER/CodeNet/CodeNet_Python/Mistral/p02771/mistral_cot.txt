 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input, a, b and c.
It then checks if a is equal to b and b is not equal to c. If this condition is true, it prints "Yes".
It then checks if b is equal to c and a is not equal to b. If this condition is true, it prints "Yes".
It then checks if a is equal to c and a is not equal to b. If this condition is true, it prints "Yes".
If none of these conditions are true, it prints "No".
In this case, a is 5, b is 7 and c is 5.
Since a is not equal to b and b is not equal to c, the first condition is not met.
Since b is not equal to c, the second condition is not met.
Since a is not equal to b, the third condition is not met.
Therefore, the code will print "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
