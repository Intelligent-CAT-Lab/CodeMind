<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input, n, a, and b.
It then calculates the product of n and a, and assigns it to the variable ans.
If the product of n and a is greater than b, it assigns b to ans. Otherwise, it assigns n * a to ans.
The final value of ans is then printed.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code for the input `4 2 9` would be `18`.
This is because 4 * 2 = 8, which is greater than 9, so the code assigns 9 to ans.
