 <<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes two variables, X and P, to 0.
It then enters a loop that iterates 10 times.
For each iteration, it calculates the value of P by multiplying the current value of i (starting from 1) by 111.
It then checks if X is less than N and N is less than or equal to P. If this condition is met, it prints the value of P.
The condition is met when i is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of X, which is 111.
<<<Output>>>
111
