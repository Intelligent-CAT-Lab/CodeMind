 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user in the form of a string, which is then split into a list of integers using the `split()` method. The list is then converted to a list of integers using a list comprehension.
The variables A, B, C, and D are assigned the values of the integers in the list.
The code then calculates the number of attacks for Aoki and Takahashi using the formula `A // D` and `C // B`, respectively. If the remainder of A divided by D is not 0, it is incremented by 1.
Finally, the code checks if the number of attacks for Takahashi is less than or equal to the number of attacks for Aoki. If it is, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
