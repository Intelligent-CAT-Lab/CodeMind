 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input n, which is a string of length 4.
The code then checks if the first three digits of n are equal or if the last two digits of n are equal.
If either of these conditions is true, the code prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
For the input "1118", the first three digits are "111" and the last two digits are "88". Since neither of these conditions is true, the code prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
