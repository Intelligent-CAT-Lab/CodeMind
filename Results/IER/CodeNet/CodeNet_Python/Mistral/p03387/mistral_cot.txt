 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes three integers as input, a, b and c, which are 2, 5 and 4 respectively.
The variable x is assigned the maximum value among a, b and c, which is 5.
The variable y is assigned the minimum value among a, b and c, which is 2.
The variable z is calculated as the sum of a, b and c minus x and y, which is 11.
The code then checks if the difference between z and y is even or odd. In this case, it is even, so the code prints the result of (x-z+(z-y)//2), which is 3.
<<<Output>>>
