 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the math module.
Then it takes three integers as input, w, h and c, and stores them in the variables w, h and c, respectively.
The code then calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of w and h using the math.gcd() function and stores the result in the variable size.
The code then calculates the cost by dividing w and h by size, and multiplying the result by c. The cost is calculated as follows:
cost = (w // size) \* (h // size) \* c
The code then prints the final value of cost.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is 100.
