 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys and math modules.
The input() function is defined as a lambda function that reads a line from the standard input, strips any whitespace, and returns it as an integer.
The mi() function is another lambda function that takes no arguments and returns a tuple of two integers, N and K, which are read from the standard input using the input() function.
The code then initializes the variable ans to 0 and enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive).
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is greater than or equal to K. If it is, it increments ans by 1. Otherwise, it calculates the value of pow(1/2, math.ceil(math.log2(K/i))) and adds it to ans.
After the loop finishes, the code divides ans by N and prints the result.
