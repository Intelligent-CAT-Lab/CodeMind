 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input: n, m, and d. In this case, n = 2, m = 3, and d = 1.
The code then calculates the output based on the following formula:
if d != 0:
print(2*(n-d)*(m-1)/n**2)
else:
print((m-1)/n)
In this case, d is not equal to 0, so the formula is:
print(2*(2-1)*(3-1)/2**2)
Simplifying this expression, we get:
print(2*1*2/4)
print(1)
Therefore, the return value of the code is 1.
