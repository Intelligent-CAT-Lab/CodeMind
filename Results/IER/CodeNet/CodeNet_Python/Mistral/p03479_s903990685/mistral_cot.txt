 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, x and y, which are 3 and 20, respectively.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the result of the loop.
The code enters a while loop that continues as long as x is less than or equal to y.
Inside the loop, the code increments ans by 1 and then multiplies x by 2.
The loop continues until x is greater than 20, which means that x will be 64 after 5 iterations.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 5.
<<<Output>>>
5
