 <<<Analysis>>>
The code imports the `re` module, which stands for "regular expressions".
It then defines a regular expression pattern using the `r` prefix to indicate that it is a raw string. The pattern is `^A?KIHA?BA?RA?$`, which means it matches a string that starts with either an optional letter A, followed by the letters KIHABRA, and ends with nothing (`$`).
The `input()` function is used to get the user's input, which is stored in the variable `S`.
The `re.match()` function is then called with the pattern and the input string as arguments. This function returns a `Match` object if the pattern matches the input string, or `None` if it doesn't.
Finally, the code checks if the `Match` object is `None` or not. If it is, it prints "NO", otherwise it prints "YES".
<<<Output>>>
YES
