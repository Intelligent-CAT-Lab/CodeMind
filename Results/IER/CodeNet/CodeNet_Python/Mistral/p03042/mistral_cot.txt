 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an input `n` from the user. It then extracts the first two digits of `n` and stores them in `a` and the last two digits of `n` and stores them in `b`.
The code then checks if `b` is equal to 0 or greater than 12. If `b` is 0, it prints "MMYY". If `b` is greater than 12, it prints "NA".
If `b` is neither 0 nor greater than 12, it checks if `a` is between 1 and 12. If it is, it prints "AMBIGUOUS". If `a` is not between 1 and 12, it prints "YYMM".
For the input `1905`, the first two digits are 19, which are stored in `a`. The last two digits are 05, which are stored in `b`.
Since `b` is greater than 12, the code prints "NA".
<<<Output>>>
NA
