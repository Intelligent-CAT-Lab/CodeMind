The return value of the code based on the input `20 10` would be 10.

The code first calculates `n2` as `N * 1` which is 20. It then calculates `n1` as `N * 1` which is 20. It calculates `m1` as `M * 1` which is 10. It calculates `mall` as `M * 2` which is 20.

The while loop that follows calculates `ans1` as 2. It then calculates `n2 - m1` as 10 - 10 which is 0. It then calculates `n1` as 20 + 0 - 10 which is 10. It then calculates `ans1` as 2.

The while loop that follows calculates `ans2` as 2. It
