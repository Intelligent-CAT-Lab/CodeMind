The code first defines a function `inpl()` that takes no arguments and returns a list of integers. It reads input from the user, splits it by spaces, and maps each element to an integer using the `map()` function. The resulting list is returned by the function.

The code then calls the `inpl()` function to read input from the user and store it in the variables `N` and `M`.

The code then initializes four variables: `n2`, `n1`, `m1`, and `mall`. `n2` is set to `N * 1`, `n1` is set to `N * 1`, `m1` is set to `M * 1`, and `mall` is set to `M * 2`.

The code then enters a while loop that continues until `mall` is less than or equal to 0. Within this loop, it subtracts `n1` from `mall` and sets `m1` to the negative of `mall` divided by 2. If `mall` is less than or equal to 0, the loop breaks.

The code then adds 1 to `ans1` and checks if `n2 - m1` is greater than or equal to 0. If it is, it subtracts `m1` from `n2`. If it is not, it adds `n2 - m1` to `n1` and sets `n2` to 0. If `n1` is less than or equal to 0, the loop breaks.

The code then adds 1 to `ans1` and enters another while loop that continues until `nall` is less than or equal to 0. Within this loop, it checks if `m2 - n1` is greater than or equal to 0. If it is, it subtracts `n1` from `m2`. If it is not, it adds `m2 - n1` to `m1` and sets `m2` to 0. If `m1` is less than or equal to 0, the loop breaks.

The code then adds 1 to `ans2` and subtracts `m1` from `nall`. It then sets `n1` to the negative of `nall` divided by 2. If `nall` is less than or equal to 0, the loop breaks.

Finally, the code prints the minimum of `ans1` and `ans2`.

<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code based on the input `20 10` would be 10.

The code first calculates `n2` as `N * 1` which is 20. It then calculates `n1` as `N * 1` which is 20. It calculates `m1` as `M * 1` which is 10. It calculates `mall` as `M * 2` which is 20.

The while loop that follows calculates `ans1` as 2. It then calculates `n2 - m1` as 10 - 10 which is 0. It then calculates `n1` as 20 + 0 - 10 which is 10. It then calculates `ans1` as 2.

The while loop that follows calculates `ans2` as 2. It
