 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable M and variable K are initialized to 3, 2 and 1, respectively.
The variable r is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the result.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to K+1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider all possible values of K from 1 to 3.
For each value of K, it calculates the result using the formula:
r += (cmb(N-1, K) * M * pow(M-1, N-K-1, mod)) % mod
where cmb(N, K) is the number of combinations of N items taken K at a time, M is the number of ways to choose K items from the set of N items, and pow(M-1, N-K-1, mod) is the power of (M-1) modulo N-K-1.
The condition is met when K is 1, 2 or 3.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of r, which is 11.
<<<Output>>>
