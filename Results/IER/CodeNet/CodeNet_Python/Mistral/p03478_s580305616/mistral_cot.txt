 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes three integers as input, n, a, and b. In this case, n is 20, a is 2, and b is 5.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n + 1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 21.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum.
The code checks if sum is within the range [a, b], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to ans. The condition is met when i is 2, 3, 4, 5, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
