The return value of the code for the input `02` would be 1.

The string `02` represents two throws, one red ball and one blue ball. The number of ways to throw the previous N-1 balls is 1 (since there is only one previous ball), and the number of ways to throw the next N-1 balls is 1 (since there is only one next ball). Therefore, the number of ways to throw the current ball is 1 + 1 = 2. The sum of the array lis is 1 + 2 = 3, which is 3 % 998244353 = 1.
