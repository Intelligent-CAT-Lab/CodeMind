 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string S as input, which represents the number of times a ball is thrown. The number of throws is represented by the number of 0s in the string. The number of times a red ball is thrown is represented by the number of 1s in the string. The number of times a blue ball is thrown is represented by the number of 2s in the string.

The code initializes an array lis of size 2*N+1, where N is the length of the input string S. The array lis is used to store the number of ways to throw the balls. The first element of the array lis is set to 1, which represents the case where no balls are thrown.

The code then iterates through the input string S and updates the array lis based on the number of throws and the colors of the balls. For each throw, the code checks if the throw is a red, blue or no-throw. If the throw is a red ball, the code adds the number of ways to throw the previous N-1 balls to the number of ways to throw the current ball. If the throw is a blue ball, the code adds the number of ways to throw the previous N-1 balls to the number of ways to throw the current ball and the number of ways to throw the next N-1 balls. If the throw is a no-throw, the code adds the number of ways to throw the previous N-1 balls to the number of ways to throw the current ball and the number of ways to throw the next N-1 balls.

After updating the array lis, the code prints the sum of the array lis.

<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code for the input `02` would be 1.

The string `02` represents two throws, one red ball and one blue ball. The number of ways to throw the previous N-1 balls is 1 (since there is only one previous ball), and the number of ways to throw the next N-1 balls is 1 (since there is only one next ball). Therefore, the number of ways to throw the current ball is 1 + 1 = 2. The sum of the array lis is 1 + 2 = 3, which is 3 % 998244353 = 1.
