 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string s as input, which is `010`. The length of the string is n = 3.
The variable res is initialized to infinity, which will be used to store the minimum number of operations required to make the string monotonically increasing.
The code then iterates through the string, comparing each pair of adjacent characters. If the characters are not in increasing order, it means that a monotonically increasing string can be formed by inserting a character between them. The number of operations required to do this is the number of characters between the two non-increasing characters plus one.
In this case, the two non-increasing characters are `0` and `1`, and the number of characters between them is 1. Therefore, the minimum number of operations required to make the string monotonically increasing is 2.
The code returns the value of res, which is 2.
