 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first defines a function `DigitsSum` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the sum of its digits.
The function uses a while loop to iterate over the digits of the number, adding each digit to a variable `sum`.
The variable `N` is then initialized to the input value, which is 15.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider pairs of numbers [1,15], [2,14], [3,13], [4,12], [5,11], [6,10], [7,9], [8,8], [9,7], [10,6], [11,5], [12,4], [13,3], [14,2], [15,1].
For each pair of numbers, it calculates the sum of their digits and stores it in `sum`.
The code checks if the sum is less than the current minimum sum, which is 10^5. If it is, it updates the minimum sum to be the new sum.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of the minimum sum, which is 15.
<<<Output>>>
15
