 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first reads the input string `S` and stores it in the variable `S`.
It then creates a dictionary `D` to store the frequency of each character in the string.
The function `hist()` is used to count the frequency of each character in the string.
The function `Node()` is used to create a node for the binary tree.
The function `pool` is used to create a binary tree by pushing nodes into the pool.
The function `traverse()` is used to traverse the binary tree and generate the output code.
The function `traverse()` takes a node and a code as input and recursively traverses the binary tree to generate the output code.
The function `traverse()` checks if the current node has a value, if not it generates the output code by recursively calling itself with the left and right children of the current node.
The function `traverse()` also checks if the current node has a key, if not it generates the output code by recursively calling itself with the left and right children of the current node.
The function `traverse()` returns the output code.
The function `ans` is used to calculate the sum of the output code.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is 10.
