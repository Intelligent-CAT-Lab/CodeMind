 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module, which is used to exit the program if the input string does not contain any 'x' characters.
The variable S is initialized to the input string, which is 'xabxa'.
The variables i and j are initialized to 0 and len(S)-1, respectively.
The variable c is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of 'x' characters in the input string.
The code enters an infinite loop that will continue until i is greater than or equal to j.
Inside the loop, the code checks if the characters at index i and j are equal. If they are, it increments i and decrements j.
If the characters are not equal, it checks if either of them is an 'x' character. If i is an 'x' character, it increments i and increments c. If j is an 'x' character, it decrements j and increments c.
If neither of the characters is an 'x' character, the code prints '-1' and exits the program using sys.exit().
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of c, which is 2.
