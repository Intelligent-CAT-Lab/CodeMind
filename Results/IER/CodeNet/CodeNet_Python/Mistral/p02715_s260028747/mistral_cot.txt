 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the math module.
It then defines a constant mod as 10**9+7.
The input is read as two integers n and k, which are 3 and 2 respectively.
The code initializes an array cnt of size k+1 with all elements set to 0.
It then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to k+1. For each i in this range, it calculates cnt[i] using the formula pow(math.floor(k/i), n, mod).
The code then enters another loop that iterates from k+1 to 1. For each i in this range, it calculates cnt[i] by subtracting cnt[i*j] from cnt[i], where j is 2. It then calculates cnt[i] modulo mod.
The code then initializes ans to 0 and enters a loop that iterates from 1 to k+1. For each i in this range, it adds cnt[i]*i to ans and calculates ans modulo mod.
Finally, the code prints the value of ans.
