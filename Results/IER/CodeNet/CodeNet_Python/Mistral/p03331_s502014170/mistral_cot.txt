 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the numpy library.
It then prompts the user to enter a number N, which is 15 in this case.
The function `Num_Each_Digit` is then called with N and 10 as arguments.
The function takes in two arguments, N and limit, and returns an array of the digits of N.
The function first checks if N is less than 10**(limit), which is 10 in this case. If it is, it loops through the digits of N and appends them to the array ans.
If N is greater than 10**(limit), the function prints "too large" and returns N.
The function then returns the array of digits.
The code then checks if N is equal to 10**(len(digit)-1), which is 10 in this case. If it is, it prints 10.
If it is not, it prints the sum of the digits in the array.
<<<Output>>>
[1, 5]
The return value of the code is an array of the digits of 15, which is [1, 5].
