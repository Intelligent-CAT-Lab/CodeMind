 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, A and B, and multiplies them together. The result is then printed to the console.
The input is given as `5 8`, which means that A is 5 and B is 8.
The multiplication of A and B is calculated using the `*` operator, which returns the product of the two numbers.
The result of the multiplication is then printed to the console using the `print()` function.
