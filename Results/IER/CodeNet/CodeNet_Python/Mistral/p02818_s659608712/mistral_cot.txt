 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input, a, b and c.
It then checks if a is greater than c. If it is, it prints the difference between a and c, followed by b.
If a is not greater than c, it checks if a plus b is less than c. If it is, it prints 0, followed by 0.
If neither of the above conditions is met, it means that a is greater than or equal to c and a plus b is greater than or equal to c. In this case, it prints the difference between a and c, followed by the sum of a and b minus c.
For the input `2 3 3`, a is 2, b is 3 and c is 3.
Since a is not greater than c, the code moves to the next condition. Since a plus b is not less than c, the code moves to the final condition.
The difference between a and c is 2, and the sum of a and b minus c is 2.
Therefore, the output of the code is `2 2`.
