 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer N as input and calculates its divisors using the `make_divisors` function.
The `make_divisors` function iterates from 1 to the square root of N and checks if N is divisible by i. If it is, it adds i to the list of divisors and also adds N//i (the quotient of N by i) to the list of divisors.
The list of divisors is then sorted and returned.
The code then calculates the maximum and minimum number of times a divisor appears in the list of divisors of N.
It does this by iterating over the list of divisors of N, excluding the last divisor (which is N itself), and checking if it has already appeared in the list of divisors of N. If it has, it skips it. Otherwise, it adds all the divisors of the current divisor to the list of divisors of N.
The code then prints the minimum and maximum number of times a divisor appears in the list of divisors of N.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code for N = 18 is 2, 2.
This is because the divisors of 18 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 18. The number 1 appears once, the number 2 appears twice, the number 3 appears once, the number 6 appears once, the number 9 appears once, and the number 18 appears once.
Therefore, the minimum number of times a divisor appears in the list of divisors of 18 is 1, and the maximum number of times a divisor appears in the list of divisors of 18 is 2.
