The return value of the code for the input "BBW" is 10.
The loop iterates over the characters "B", "B" and "W".
For the first character "B", b is 0, so a is 0.
For the second character "B", b is 1, so a is 1.
For the third character "W", b is 1, so a is 2.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of a, which is 2.
Therefore, the return value of the code for the input "BBW" is 2.
