 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes two inputs, n and c, which are 1 and 0, respectively.
The variable k is initialized to 10*n + c, which is 10*1 + 0 = 10.
The while loop starts and enters the loop body, where k is decremented by 1.
The function palindrome is called with k and c as arguments, which returns the number 10.
The function isPrime is called with 10 as an argument, which returns True.
Since the function isPrime returns True, the while loop breaks and the function prints 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
