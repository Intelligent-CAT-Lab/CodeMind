<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, R1 and R2, and stores them in the variables R1 and R2.
It then calculates the quotient of R1 and R2 divided by the sum of R1 and R2, and stores the result in the variable quotient.
The formula used is: quotient = (R1*R2)/(R1+R2)
The code then prints the value of quotient.
<<<Output>>>
0.5
