 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input from the user and then iterates through each character in the string. For each character, it checks if it is a digit or a lowercase letter. If it is a digit, it adds the digit to a list. If it is a lowercase letter, it adds the letter to a dictionary with the current index as the key.
The code then iterates through the dictionary and prints the index of each letter in the string.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code would be a list of indices of the lowercase letters in the input string.
For example, if the input string is "hello", the output would be [4, 5, 6].
