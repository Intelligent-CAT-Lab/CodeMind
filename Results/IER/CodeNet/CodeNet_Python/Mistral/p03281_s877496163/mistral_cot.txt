 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input n using the `input()` function and converts it to an integer using the `int()` function.
The code then checks if n is less than 105. If it is, it prints 0. Otherwise, it initializes a variable ans to 0 and enters a loop that iterates from 105 to n (inclusive) with a step of 2.
For each number i in this range, it initializes a variable cnt to 0 and enters another loop that iterates from 1 to i (inclusive) with a step of 2.
For each number j in this range, it checks if i is divisible by j. If it is, it increments cnt. Otherwise, it increments cnt by 1.
After the inner loop finishes, it checks if cnt is equal to 8. If it is, it increments ans.
After the outer loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans.
<<<Output>>>
0
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
The return value of the code based on the input 105 is 0, as n is less than 105.
