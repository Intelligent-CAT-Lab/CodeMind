 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and variable a are initialized to 3 and 1, respectively.
The function prepare is called with n and MOD as arguments. It returns two lists, factorials and finvs.
The function solve is called with n and a as arguments. It first calculates the factorials and finvs using the prepare function. It then calculates the invs using the factorials and finvs.
The variable r is set to n - a, which is 2.
The function solve then enters two loops. The first loop iterates from 0 to a - 1, and for each iteration, it calculates two values, tmp1 and tmp2. tmp1 is calculated using the factorials and finvs, and tmp2 is calculated using the factorials, finvs and invs. The ans variable is updated using these values.
The second loop iterates from 1 to a - 1, and for each iteration, it calculates two values, tmp1 and tmp2. tmp1 is calculated using the factorials and finvs, and tmp2 is calculated using the factorials, finvs and invs. The ans variable is updated using these values.
Finally, the function solve returns the value of ans, which is 1.
