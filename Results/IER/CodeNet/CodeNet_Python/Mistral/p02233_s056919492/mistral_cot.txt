 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `fib` takes two arguments: `n` and `memo`. `n` is the input number for which the Fibonacci sequence needs to be calculated, and `memo` is a dictionary that stores previously calculated Fibonacci numbers to avoid redundant calculations.
The function first checks if `n` is 0 or 1, in which case it returns 1.
If `n` is not in the `memo` dictionary, the function calculates the Fibonacci number recursively by calling itself with `n-1` and `n-2` as arguments, and stores the result in the `memo` dictionary.
If `n` is already in the `memo` dictionary, the function returns the previously calculated value for `n`.
The code then reads an input `n` from the user and calls the `fib` function with this input.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code for `n=3` would be 5.
