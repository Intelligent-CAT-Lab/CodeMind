The return value of the code when `n` is 3 is 2.

The calculation of `c` is as follows:

* When `i` is 1, `c` is calculated as `(n-1)//1 = 2`
* When `i` is 2, `c` is calculated as `(n-1)//2 = 1`
* When `i` is 3, `c` is calculated as `(n-1)//3 = 0`

Since the loop stops when `i` is equal to `n-1`, the final value of `c` is 2.

Therefore, the return value of the code when `n` is 3 is 2.
