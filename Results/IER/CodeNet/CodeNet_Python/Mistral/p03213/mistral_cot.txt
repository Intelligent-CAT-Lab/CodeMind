 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first initializes a list `cnt` of size 101 with all elements set to 1.
It then enters a nested loop that iterates from 2 to n (inclusive) for i and from 2 to n (inclusive) for j.
For each pair (i, j), it checks if i is divisible by j. If it is, it divides i by j and increments the corresponding element in the `cnt` list.
After the nested loop finishes, the code initializes several variables to 0: `san`, `go`, `jugo`, `nijugo`, and `shitigo`.
It then enters another loop that iterates from 2 to 100 (inclusive).
For each number i in this range, it checks if the corresponding element in the `cnt` list is greater than or equal to 3, 5, 15, 25, and 75. If it is, it increments the corresponding variable.
Finally, the code prints the sum of `shitigo`, `nijugo*(san-1)`, `jugo*(go-1)`, `go*(go-1)//2*(san-2)`.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is 100.
