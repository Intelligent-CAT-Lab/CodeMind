<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes input from the user, which is a string of numbers separated by spaces. It then uses the `split()` method to split the string into a list of individual numbers.
The `set()` function is then used to remove any duplicate numbers from the list.
The `len()` function is used to count the number of elements in the resulting set.
The final output is the length of the set of unique numbers.
