 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first initializes two variables N and M with the values 2 and 998244353, respectively.
It then initializes an array DP of size 6000x6000 with all elements set to -1.
The function P takes two arguments n and k, which represent the current number and the current sum, respectively.
The function checks if n or k is less than 0, in which case it returns 0.
If DP[n][k] is not -1, it returns the value stored in that position.
If k is equal to 1, it returns 1.
Otherwise, it calculates the value of DP[n][k] as the sum of the values of DP[n][k-1] and DP[n-k][k], modulo M.
The code then enters two nested loops that iterate from 0 to 5500.
For each i in this range, it initializes X[i] to 0 and DP[i][i] to 1.
For each j in the range [i+1, 5500], it calls the function P(i+1,j+1) and stores the result in DP[i][j].
The code then enters another loop that iterates from 0 to 10799.
For each i in this range, it initializes Y[i] to 0 and X[i] to the sum of Y[i] and X[i-1] multiplied by DP[i-1][i-1] and DP[i-1][i-1], modulo M.
Finally, the code initializes P to 0 and iterates from 1 to N.
For each i in this range, it adds X[i] to P and subtracts Y[2*i-N] from P, modulo M.
The final value of P is returned as the output.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is 1.
