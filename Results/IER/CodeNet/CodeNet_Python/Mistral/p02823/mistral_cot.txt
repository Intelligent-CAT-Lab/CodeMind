 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes three integers as input, N, A and B. In this case, N is 5, A is 2 and B is 4.
The code then checks if the difference between A and B is even. In this case, it is 2, which is even.
Since the difference is even, the code divides the difference by 2 and prints the result, which is 1.
