 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first defines a function `CheckDisit` that takes a string `a` as input and returns an integer.
The function iterates over the digits of the string `a` and calculates a sum based on their position in the string.
If the position of the digit is less than or equal to 4, the sum is calculated as the digit multiplied by the difference between 6 and its position.
If the position of the digit is greater than 4, the sum is calculated as the digit multiplied by the difference between 12 and its position.
The function then calculates the remainder of the sum divided by 11 and returns the result.
The code then reads a string `m` from the user and checks if the last digit of the string is a question mark (`?`).
If it is, the function `CheckDisit` is called with the string `m` as input and the return value is printed.
If the last digit of the string is not a question mark, the code iterates over the digits of the string and replaces the question mark with each digit in turn.
For each digit, the function `CheckDisit` is called with the modified string as input and the return value is checked to see if it matches the original value of the question mark.
If it does, the digit is added to a list `ans`.
If the list `ans` has only one element, the element is printed.
If the list `ans` has more than one element, the string "MULTIPLE" is printed.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code for the input `?12345678901` would be 0, since the sum of the digits of the string is 0 (0+0+0+0+0+0+0+0+0+0+0=0).
