 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a single integer `s` from standard input using the `I()` function.
The `solve()` function is then called with the value of `s`.
The `solve()` function uses a while loop to iteratively find the smallest positive integer `m` such that `m` is odd and `m*s` is not divisible by 2.
To do this, it starts with `m=1` and `pre=s`. It then enters a loop that continues until `pre` is divisible by 2.
Inside the loop, it calculates the next value of `pre` by either dividing it by 2 or multiplying it by 3 and adding 1.
If `pre` is already in the set `st`, it means that `m*s` is divisible by 2 and the loop terminates.
If `pre` is not in the set `st`, it is added to the set and the loop continues.
The function returns `m` if it finds a value of `m` that satisfies the condition.
If the loop terminates without finding a value of `m` that satisfies the condition, the function returns `None`.
