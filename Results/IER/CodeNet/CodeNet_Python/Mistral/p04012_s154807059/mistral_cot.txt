 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `solve()` is called when the program is executed.
The function reads the input line using `input()` and removes the newline character using `rstrip('\n')`.
It then converts the input string to a list of characters using `list(str(input().rstrip('\n')))`.
The `collections.Counter()` function is used to count the occurrences of each character in the list.
The function then iterates over the items in the `Counter` object and checks if the count of any character is odd. If it is, it prints "No" and exits the function using `exit()`.
If no odd count is found, it prints "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
