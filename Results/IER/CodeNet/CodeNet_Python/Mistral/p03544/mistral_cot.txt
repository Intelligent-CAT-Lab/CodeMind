 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `solve()` is called, which takes no arguments.
It first reads an integer `N` from the user, which is 5 in this case.
It then calls the function `fib(N + 1)`, which takes an integer `n` as an argument.
The function `fib()` initializes a list `memo` of length `n` with all elements set to 0.
It then sets the first two elements of `memo` to 2 and 1, respectively.
It then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to `n - 1` (inclusive).
For each index `i`, it sets the value of `memo[i]` to the sum of `memo[i - 1]` and `memo[i - 2]`.
Finally, it returns the value of `memo[n - 1]`, which is 8.
<<<Output>>>
8
