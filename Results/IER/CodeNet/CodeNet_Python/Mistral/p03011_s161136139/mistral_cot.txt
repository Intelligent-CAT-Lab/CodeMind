 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers P, Q, and R as input, separated by spaces. In this case, the input is `1 3 4`.
The code then creates a list `res` containing the sum of pairs of the input numbers. The list is initialized as follows:
```
res=[P+Q,P+R,Q+R]
```
In this case, `P+Q` is 4, `P+R` is 7, and `Q+R` is 7. So the list `res` is initialized as `[4, 7, 7]`.
The code then sorts the list `res` in ascending order using the `sort()` method.
Finally, the code prints the first element of the sorted list, which is 4.
<<<Output>>>
4
