 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers N and K as input, where N is the number of elements in the array and K is the number of elements to be chosen.
The variable MOD is initialized to 10**9 + 7, which is used to handle large numbers.
The code then checks if K is less than N. If it is, it prints 0, since it is not possible to choose K elements from an array of N elements.
If K is greater than or equal to N, the code initializes ans to 1 and enters a loop that iterates from K to K-N, with a step size of -1. This means that the loop will go backwards from K to K-N.
For each value v in this range, the code multiplies ans by v and takes the result modulo MOD. This is done to handle large numbers.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans.
