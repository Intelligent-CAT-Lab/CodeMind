 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes two integers as input, N and D. N is 6 and D is 2.
The code then checks if N is divisible by (2 * D + 1). Since 6 is divisible by (2 * 2 + 1), which is 5, the condition is met.
The code then divides N by (2 * D + 1), which gives a quotient of 1.
The return value of the code is 1.
