 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers n and k as input.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to store the final result.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from k to n+2 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from k to 5 (inclusive).
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of the terms (((2*n-i+1)*i)//2)-(i*(i-1)//2)+1.
The formula used is:
((2*n-i+1)*i)/2 - (i*(i-1))/2 + 1
The formula can be simplified as:
(n*i)/2 - (i*(i-1))/2 + 1
The code then adds this sum to ans.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans modulo 10^9+7.
