 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes two integers as input, a and b, using the `input().split()` method. The input is split by spaces and the resulting list is converted to integers using the `map()` function.
The code then checks if the product of a and b is even by using the modulo operator (%). If the remainder of the division of the product by 2 is 0, it is even.
If the product is even, the code prints "Even". Otherwise, it prints "Odd".
<<<Output>>>
Even
