 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes a list of 5 integers as input, which are stored in the variable `i`.
The function `in_retangle` takes 5 arguments: `w`, `h`, `x`, `y`, and `r`. These represent the width, height, x-coordinate, y-coordinate, and radius of a rectangle, respectively.
The function then checks if the point (x, y) is inside the rectangle by checking if the radius is less than or equal to the y-coordinate, y-coordinate is less than or equal to the height minus the radius, radius is less than or equal to the x-coordinate, and x-coordinate is less than or equal to the width minus the radius.
If all these conditions are met, the function prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
