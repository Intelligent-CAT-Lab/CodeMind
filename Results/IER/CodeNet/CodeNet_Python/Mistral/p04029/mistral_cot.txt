 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input from the user using the `input()` function and stores it in the variable `n`.
Then it calculates the return value using the formula `(n + 1) * n / 2`.
The formula calculates the sum of all integers from 1 to n, which is equal to `n(n+1)/2`.
The return value is then printed using the `print()` function.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code based on the input `3` would be 6.
