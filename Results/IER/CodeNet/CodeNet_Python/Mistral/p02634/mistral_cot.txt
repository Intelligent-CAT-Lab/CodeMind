 <<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes four variables a, b, c, and d with the values 1, 1, 2, and 2, respectively.
It also initializes a modulus value of 998244353.
The code then initializes a 2D array dp with dimensions (c+2) x (d+2), where c and d are the input values.
The first element of the first row of dp is set to 1, which corresponds to the case where a=1, b=1, and c=2.
The code then enters a nested loop that iterates over all possible values of i and j within the range [a, c+1] and [b, d+1], respectively.
For each pair (i, j), the code calculates the value of dp[i][j] using the recurrence relation:
dp[i][j] = dp[i+1][j] + dp[i][j]*j + dp[i][j]*i - dp[i+1][j+1]*i*j
The final value of dp[c][d] is then printed, which corresponds to the case where a=1, b=1, and c=2.
