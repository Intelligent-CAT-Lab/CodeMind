<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an input string S using the `input()` function.
It then iterates over each character in the string S using a for loop.
For each character, it checks if the character appears more than once in the string using the `count()` method.
If the character appears more than once, it prints "no" and exits the loop using the `exit()` function.
If the character appears only once, it continues to the next character.
After the loop finishes, it prints "yes".
<<<Output>>>
yes
