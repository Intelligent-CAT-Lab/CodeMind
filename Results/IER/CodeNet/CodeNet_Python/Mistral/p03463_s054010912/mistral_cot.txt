 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input, n, a, and b.
The first line of the code uses the map() function to convert the input string into integers.
The second line of the code uses an if-else statement to check if the difference between b and a is even. If it is, the code prints "Alice", otherwise it prints "Borys".
In this case, the difference between b and a is 4 - 2 = 2, which is not even. Therefore, the code will print "Borys".
<<<Output>>>
Borys
