 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an input string `s` from the user.
It then defines two lists, `odd` and `even`, which contain the characters that represent odd and even digits, respectively.
The code then enters two loops. The first loop iterates over every second character of the input string `s`, starting from the second character. For each character, it checks if it is not in the `odd` list. If it is not, it prints "No" and exits the loop using the `exit()` function.
The second loop iterates over every second character of the input string `s`, starting from the third character. For each character, it checks if it is not in the `even` list. If it is not, it prints "No" and exits the loop using the `exit()` function.
If both loops complete without finding any character that is not in the corresponding list, the code prints "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
