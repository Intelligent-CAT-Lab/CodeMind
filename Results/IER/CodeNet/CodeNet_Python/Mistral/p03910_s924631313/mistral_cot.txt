 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first initializes a variable `SIZE` to 4500.
Then it defines a function `main()` that takes an input `N` and performs the following steps:

1. It initializes a variable `n` to 1 and enters a loop that iterates from 1 to `SIZE+1`.
2. For each value of `n`, it checks if `n*(n+1)` is less than 2*`N` and if `(n+1)*(n+2)` is greater than or equal to 2*`N`. If both conditions are met, it breaks out of the loop.
3. If the loop completes without finding a value of `n` that satisfies the conditions, it increments `n` by 1.
4. It calculates the difference `d` between `n*(n+1)//2` and `N`.
5. It enters another loop that iterates from 1 to `n`. For each value of `i`, it checks if `i` is equal to `d`. If it is, it skips the current iteration using the `continue` statement.
6. If `i` is not equal to `d`, it prints the value of `i`.
7. The function returns.

When the input `N` is 4, the code first initializes `n` to 1 and enters the loop that iterates from 1 to `SIZE+1`. It finds that `n*(n+1)` is less than 2*`N` (4*5=20) and that `(n+1)*(n+2)` is greater than or equal to 2*`N` (5*6=30) when `n=2`. It breaks out of the loop and increments `n` to 3.

It then calculates `d` as (3*4)/2 - 4 = -1.

It enters the loop that iterates from 1 to `n`, and finds that `i` is not equal to `d` for any value of `i` in this range.

Finally, the function returns without printing anything.

No output is returned by the code.
