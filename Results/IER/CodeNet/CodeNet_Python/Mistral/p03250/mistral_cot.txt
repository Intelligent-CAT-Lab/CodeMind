 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user, which is a string of three integers separated by spaces. The input is then split using the `split()` method, which returns a list of the individual words in the string. The `map()` function is then used to convert each word in the list to an integer. The resulting list is stored in the variable `abc`.
The `sort()` method is then called on the `abc` list to sort it in ascending order.
The code then calculates the sum of the second and third elements of the sorted list, which is 5 + 2 = 7. This value is then added to the first element of the list, which is 1.
Finally, the sum of these two values is printed to the console.
