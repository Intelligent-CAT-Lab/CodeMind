 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first defines a function called `sort` that takes a list `A` as input. The function uses two nested loops to iterate through the list and compare adjacent elements. If the element on the left is smaller than the element on the right, the two elements are swapped using a temporary variable. This process continues until the entire list is sorted in ascending order.
The function then returns the sorted list.
The code then reads input from the user, which is a list of integers separated by spaces. The input is converted to a list of integers using the `map` function and the `int` function.
The sorted list is then passed as an argument to the `sort` function, which returns the sorted list.
The sorted list is then converted back to a string using the `join` function and the `str` function, and printed to the console.
