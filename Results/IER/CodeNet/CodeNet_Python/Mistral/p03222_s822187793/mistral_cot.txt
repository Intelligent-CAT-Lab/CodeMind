 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input: h, w, and k. In this case, h = 1, w = 3, and k = 2.
The code then initializes a modulus value of 10**9+7.
The code then initializes a list called fib, which will be used to store the Fibonacci sequence. The first four elements of the sequence are initialized to 1, 2, 3, and 5, respectively. The next 96 elements of the sequence are calculated using a loop that iterates from 1 to 96. Each element is calculated as the sum of the previous two elements in the sequence. The last four elements of the sequence are also initialized to 1.
The code then initializes a 2D list called dp, which will be used to store the results of the calculations. The list has h rows and w columns, where h is the number of rows and w is the number of columns. Each element of the list is initialized to 0.
The code then initializes the first two elements of the dp list with the first two elements of the Fibonacci sequence.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to h-1. For each row i in this range, it enters another loop that iterates from 0 to w-1. For each column j in this range, it calculates the value of dp[i][j] using the following formula:
dp[i][j] = (dp[i-1][j]*fib[j-1]*fib[w-2-j])%mod
if j >= 1:
dp[i][j] = (dp[i][j] + dp[i-1][j-1]*fib[j-2]*fib[w-2-j])%mod
if j <= w-2:
dp[i][j] = (dp[i][j] + dp[i-1][j+1]*fib[j-1]*fib[w-3-j])%mod
After the loops finish, the code prints the value of dp[-1][k-1], which is the final result.
