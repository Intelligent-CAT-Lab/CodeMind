 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers n and m as input, which are 3 and 9 respectively.
The variables mod1 and mod2 are initialized to 10**9+7 and 998244353, respectively.
The variable mod is initialized to mod1, which is 10**9+7.
The variable ans is initialized to (m+1)%mod, which is 10%10**9+7 = 10%1000000007 = 10%7 = 1.
Since n is not equal to 1, the code calculates a as m divided by n-1, which is 3 divided by 2 = 1.5.
The code then calculates the expression ((m+1)*(a+1)+(m+1)*a-(n-1)*a*(a+1))%mod, which is:
((9+1)*(1+1)+(9+1)*1-(2)*1*(1+1))%1000000007 = (10*2+9*1-2*1*2)%1000000007 = (20+9-2)%1000000007 = 29%1000000007 = 29.
Therefore, the return value of the code is 29.
<<<Output>>>
