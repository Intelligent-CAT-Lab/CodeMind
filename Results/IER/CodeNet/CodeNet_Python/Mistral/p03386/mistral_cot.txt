 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input, A, B and K.
It then creates two lists, X and Y, using list comprehensions.
X contains all integers from A to A+K, inclusive, that are less than or equal to B.
Y contains all integers from B-K+1 to B, inclusive, that are greater than or equal to A.
The code then finds the union of X and Y, removes duplicates using set and converts it back to a list.
The resulting list is sorted in ascending order.
Finally, the code prints each element of the sorted list.
<<<Output>>>
[2, 3, 8]
