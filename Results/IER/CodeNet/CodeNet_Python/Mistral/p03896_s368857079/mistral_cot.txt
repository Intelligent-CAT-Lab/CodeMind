 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an input n, which is 7 in this case.
It then creates a range from 0 to n-1, which is [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6].
It then adds n-1 to this range, which gives [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7].
The code then creates a list A, which is a 2D list of length n.
It initializes each element of A to be a list of length n-1, which is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].
It then iterates over the range r and for each element i in r, it iterates over the range s and for each element j in s, it calculates the value of A[A[j][i]-1][i] using the formula (j+1)%n.
If this value is equal to j+1, it swaps the values of A[j][i] and A[j][i-n].
Finally, the code prints the 2D list A.
<<<Output>>>
[[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 1], [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 1, 2], [4, 5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3], [5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4], [6, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [7, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]]
