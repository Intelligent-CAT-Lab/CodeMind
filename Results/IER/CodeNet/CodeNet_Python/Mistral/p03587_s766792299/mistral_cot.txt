 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an input from the user using the `input()` function and stores it in the variable `S`.
Then it uses the `count()` method of the string object to count the number of occurrences of the character '1' in the string `S`.
The `count()` method returns the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the specified substring in the string.
In this case, the input string is '111100', which contains 5 occurrences of the character '1'.
<<<Output>>>
5
