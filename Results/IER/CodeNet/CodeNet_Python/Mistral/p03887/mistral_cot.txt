 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n, variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized to 3, 1, 2 and 0, respectively.
The variable FACT and INVERSE\_FACT are initialized to [0] * (n + 1) and [0] * (n + 1), respectively.
The variable FACT[0] and INVERSE\_FACT[0] are initialized to 1.
The variable FACT[i] is calculated as FACT[i - 1] * i % MOD for i in range(1, n + 1).
The variable INVERSE\_FACT[i] is calculated as inverse(FACT[i]) for i in range(1, n + 1).
The variable ans is initialized to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to min(a + 1, c + 1).
For each value of y in this range, it enters another loop that iterates from 0 to (c - y) // 3 + 1.
For each value of z in this range, it calculates the values of x, rest3 and cur\_ans.
It then calculates the final value of ans by adding cur\_ans to ans and taking the result modulo MOD.
After the loops finish, the code prints the final value of ans.
