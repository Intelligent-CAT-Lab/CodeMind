 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module, which provides access to some system-specific information and functions.
The sys.stdin.readline function is used to read a line from the standard input stream.
The input is then split using the split() method, which splits the input string into a list of substrings based on a specified delimiter.
The input is then converted to integers using the map() function and the list() function.
The code then checks if either H or W is equal to 1. If either of them is, it prints 1 and exits the program using the exit() function.
Otherwise, it calculates the answer using the formula (H*W+1) // 2, which is equivalent to (H*W+1) \* (H+W) / 2.
The answer is then printed to the console.
