 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four integers as input, H, W, h, and w.
H and W represent the height and width of a rectangle, while h and w represent the height and width of the rectangle's sides.
The code first checks if H is divisible by h and W is divisible by w. If both conditions are true, it prints "No".
If W is not divisible by w, it prints "Yes" and then enters a nested loop that iterates through each row and column of the rectangle.
For each row, it checks if the current column is divisible by w. If it is, it prints a space. If it is not, it prints 100000.
For each column, it checks if the current row is divisible by h. If it is, it prints a space. If it is not, it prints -100000*(h-1)-1.
If neither of the conditions is true, it prints "Yes" and then enters another nested loop that iterates through each row and column of the rectangle.
For each row, it checks if the current column is divisible by w. If it is, it prints a space. If it is not, it prints 100000.
For each column, it checks if the current row is divisible by h. If it is, it prints a space. If it is not, it prints -100000*(h-1)-1.
