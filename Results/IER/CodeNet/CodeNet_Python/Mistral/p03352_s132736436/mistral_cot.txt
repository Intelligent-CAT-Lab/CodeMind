 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input from the user and stores it in the variable x.
It then initializes the variable ans to 1, which will be used to store the maximum value found.
The code enters two nested loops that iterate over all possible combinations of b and p within the specified ranges.
For each combination, it calculates the value of y by raising b to the power of p.
The code then checks if y is less than or equal to x and if it is greater than the current value of ans. If it is, it updates the value of ans to y.
After the loops finish, the code prints the final value of ans, which is the maximum value found.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is 100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
