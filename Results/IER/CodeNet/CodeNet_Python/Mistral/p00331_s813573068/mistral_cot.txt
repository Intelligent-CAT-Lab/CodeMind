 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, h and r, and stores them in the variables h and r, respectively.
The code then checks if the sum of h and r is equal to 0. If it is, it prints 0.
If the sum of h and r is greater than 0, it prints 1.
If the sum of h and r is less than 0, it prints -1.
In this case, h is -3 and r is 3, so the sum of h and r is -3 + 3 = 0.
Since the sum of h and r is equal to 0, the code prints 0.
<<<Output>>>
0
