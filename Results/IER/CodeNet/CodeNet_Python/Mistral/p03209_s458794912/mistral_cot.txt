 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs, n and x, which are integers.
The function f takes two arguments, N and X, which are integers.
The function f first checks if N is equal to 0. If it is, it returns 0 if X is less than or equal to 0, otherwise it returns 1.
If N is not equal to 0, it checks if X is less than or equal to 4*(2**(N-1))-2. If it is, it calls the function f recursively with N-1 and X-1 as arguments.
If X is equal to 4*(2**(N-1))-1, it returns 2**N.
If X is less than or equal to 4*2**N - 3, it returns 2**N + the result of calling the function f recursively with N-1 and X - 4*(2**(N-1)) + 1 as arguments.
If X is greater than 4*2**N - 3, it returns 2**(N+1) - 1.

For the input (2,7), the function f is called with N=2 and X=7.
Since N is not equal to 0, the function checks if X is less than or equal to 4*(2^(N-1))-2. Since X is greater than 4*(2^(N-1))-2, the function checks if X is less than or equal to 4*2^N - 3. Since X is greater than 4*2^N - 3, the function returns 2^(N+1) - 1, which is 2^3 - 1 = 7.
