<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers N and M as input.
It calculates the expression `((N-M)*100+M*1900)*2**M`.
The expression `((N-M)*100+M*1900)` is the sum of the products of the digits of N and M, where the digits of N are multiplied by 100 and the digits of M are multiplied by 1900.
The expression `2**M` is 2 raised to the power of M.
The final expression is the product of these two values.
