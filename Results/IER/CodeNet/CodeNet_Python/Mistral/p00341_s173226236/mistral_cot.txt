 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user, which is a list of 12 integers separated by spaces. The input is then split into a list using the `split()` method and stored in the variable `l`.
The `sort()` method is then called on the list `l` to sort the elements in ascending order.
The code then checks if all the elements of the sorted list are equal. It checks if the first 12 elements of the list are equal and if the last 12 elements of the list are also equal.
If all the elements are equal, the code prints "yes", otherwise it prints "no".
<<<Output>>>
no
