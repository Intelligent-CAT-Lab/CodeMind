 <<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes two variables, a and b, to 1.
It also initializes a variable i to 0.
The code then enters a while loop that will continue as long as i is less than n.
Inside the loop, the values of a and b are updated using a tuple unpacking operation. The new value of a is the sum of the current values of a and b, while the new value of b is the previous value of a.
The loop continues until i is equal to n, which is 3 in this case.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of a, which is 4.
<<<Output>>>
4
