 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes two integers N and M as input, separated by a space. In this case, N is 2 and M is 1.
The variable count is initialized to 0.
The code then checks if N is not equal to 0. Since N is 2, the condition is met and the code adds 2 * (2 - 1) // 2 to count, which is 1.
The code then checks if M is not equal to 0. Since M is 1, the condition is not met and no additional value is added to count.
Finally, the code prints the value of count, which is 1.
