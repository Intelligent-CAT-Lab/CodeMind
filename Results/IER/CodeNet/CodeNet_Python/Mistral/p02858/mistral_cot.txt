 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the fractions module, which is used to calculate the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two numbers.
The variables H, W, and T are initialized to 2, 2, and 1, respectively.
The gcd function is called twice, once for H and T, and once for W and T. The results are stored in gh and gw, respectively.
The variables h and w are then calculated by dividing H and W by gh and gw, respectively.
The variable MOD is set to 1000000007, which is used as the modulus for the arithmetic operations.
The code then uses the pow function to raise 2 to the power of h, w, and gcd(h, w), respectively, and subtracts 3. The result is then raised to the power of gh * gw modulo MOD.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is 10.
