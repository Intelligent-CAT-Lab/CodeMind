<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input, A, B and C.
It uses the `map()` function to convert the input string into integers.
The `input()` function reads a line from the console and returns it as a string. The `split()` method is then called on this string to split it into a list of words, which are then converted to integers using the `map()` function.
The code then checks if the sum of A and B is greater than or equal to C using an `if` statement. If it is, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
