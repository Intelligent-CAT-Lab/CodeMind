 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers n and k as input.
It initializes a variable tot to 0, which will be used to store the final result.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from k to n+2 (inclusive).
For each value of i in this range, it calculates the sum of the terms (n+2-i+(i-1)*(n+1-i)) and adds it to tot.
The formula used to calculate the sum of the terms is:
(n+2-i) + (i-1)*(n+1-i)
The final result is then printed by taking the remainder of tot divided by 1000000007.
<<<Output>>>
1

The return value of the code based on the input 3 2 is 1.
