<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input n and initializes a variable sum to 1.
It then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n+1, meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 6 (inclusive), since n is 5.
For each number i in this range, it multiplies sum by i and updates the value of sum.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum, which is 120.
<<<Output>>>
120
