 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes three integers as input, a, b, and c, which are 4, 12, and 20, respectively.
The code then checks if a, b, and c are equal and if a is even. In this case, a is even, but b and c are not equal.
Since the condition is not met, the code enters a while loop that continues until a, b, and c are equal and a is even.
Inside the loop, the code calculates new values for a, b, and c by taking the average of the three numbers.
The loop continues until a, b, and c are equal and a is even. In this case, after the first iteration, a becomes 8, b becomes 16, and c becomes 24. Since a is even, the loop exits and the code prints the value of res, which is 1.
