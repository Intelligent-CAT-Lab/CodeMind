 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an input string `s` using the `input()` function.
It then iterates over the range of the length of the string `s` minus 1, using a for loop.
For each iteration, it checks if the current character `s[i]` is equal to the next character `s[i+1]`. If it is, it prints the indices `i+1` and `i+2` and exits the loop using the `exit()` function.
After the loop finishes, it enters another for loop that iterates over the range of the length of the string `s` minus 2.
For each iteration, it checks if the current character `s[i]` is equal to the next character `s[i+2]`. If it is, it prints the indices `i+1` and `i+3` and exits the loop using the `exit()` function.
If none of the conditions are met, it prints `-1,-1` as the output.
<<<Output>>>
-1,-1
