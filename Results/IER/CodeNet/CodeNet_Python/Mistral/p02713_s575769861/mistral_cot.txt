 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the fractions module and assigns the variable k to the input value.
The variable ans is initialized to (k+1)*k//2, which is 11 in this case.
The code then creates a 2D list tttt of size (k+1) x (k+1) filled with zeros.
The code then enters a nested loop that iterates from 1 to k, and for each iteration, it iterates from 1 to k again.
If i == j, the loop skips to the next iteration. Otherwise, it checks if tttt[i][j] is already equal to a value. If it is, it assigns that value to g and adds 3*g to ans. If it is not, it calculates the greatest common divisor of i and j using the gcd function from the fractions module and assigns it to tttt[i][j] and tttt[j][i]. It also adds 3*g to ans.
The code then enters another nested loop that iterates from 1 to k-1, and for each iteration, it iterates from i+1 to k and then from j+1 to k+1.
For each iteration, it assigns the value of tttt[i][j] to temp and the value of tttt[temp][l] to temp2. It then adds 6*temp2 to ans.
Finally, the code prints the value of ans, which is 11.
