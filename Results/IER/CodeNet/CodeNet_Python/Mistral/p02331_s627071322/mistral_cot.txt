<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers N and K as input, where N is the base of the number system and K is the number to be raised to the power of N.
The function `pow()` is used to raise K to the power of N. The second argument of the function is 10**9+7, which is used as the modulus to avoid integer overflow.
The function returns the result of the power operation modulo 10**9+7.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code for the input `2 3` would be 11.
This is because 3 raised to the power of 2 is 9, and 9 modulo 10**9+7 is 11.
Therefore, the return value of the code for the input `2 3` is 11.
