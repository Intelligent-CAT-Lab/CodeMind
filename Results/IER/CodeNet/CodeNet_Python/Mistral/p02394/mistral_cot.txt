 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes a list of integers as input, which is `[5, 4, 2, 2, 1]`.
It then checks if the sum of the second and fourth elements (`i[2] + i[4]`) is less than or equal to the first element (`i[0]`). In this case, it is `4 + 2 = 6`, which is less than `5`.
Next, it checks if the difference between the second and fourth elements (`i[2] - i[4]`) is greater than or equal to zero. In this case, it is `4 - 2 = 2`, which is greater than or equal to zero.
Then, it checks if the sum of the third and fourth elements (`i[3] + i[4]`) is less than or equal to the first element (`i[1]`). In this case, it is `2 + 2 = 4`, which is less than `4`.
Finally, it checks if the difference between the third and fourth elements (`i[3] - i[4]`) is greater than or equal to zero. In this case, it is `2 - 2 = 0`, which is greater than or equal to zero.
Since all the conditions are met, the code prints "Yes".
