 <<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by importing the math module.
It then initializes two variables: num\_year and t\_maney.
num\_year is initialized to 0, which will be used to keep track of the number of years.
t\_maney is initialized to 100, which is the initial amount of money.
The code then prompts the user to enter a value for x, which is 103 in this case.
The code enters a while loop that continues until t\_maney is greater than or equal to x.
Inside the loop, num\_year is incremented by 1 and t\_maney is multiplied by 1.01 to simulate the growth of the money over time.
The loop continues until t\_maney is greater than or equal to x, which is 103 in this case.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of num\_year, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
