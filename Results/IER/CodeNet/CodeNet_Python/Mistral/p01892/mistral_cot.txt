 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input: a, b, and n. In this case, a = 19, b = 30, and n = 3.
The variable score is initialized to the absolute difference between a and b, which is 11.
The code then enters two nested loops that iterate from 1 to n (inclusive) for both x and y.
For each pair of x and y, it checks if b * x is divisible by y. If it is, it calculates the new value of a as b * x / y and updates the value of score to the minimum of the current score and the absolute difference between a and the new value of a.
After the loops finish, the code prints the final value of score, which is 11.
<<<Output>>>
11
