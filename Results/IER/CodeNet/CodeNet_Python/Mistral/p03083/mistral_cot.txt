The code first initializes two variables, B and W, with the values 2 and 1 respectively.
It then initializes a variable mod to 1000000007 + 7, which is equal to 1000000007.
The code then defines two functions, doubling and inved.
The doubling function takes two arguments, n and m, and returns the value of n raised to the power of 2m modulo mod.
The inved function takes an argument a and returns the multiplicative inverse of a modulo mod.
The code then initializes two lists, fact and invf, with the values 1 for all integers from 1 to B+W+1.
It then iterates through the range B+W to B+W+1 and calculates the value of fact[i] as the product of all integers from 1 to i, modulo mod.
It then calculates the value of invf[-1] as the multiplicative inverse of fact[-1] modulo mod.
It then iterates through the range B+W to 0, and for each i, it calculates the value of invf[i-1] as the product of invf[i] and i, modulo mod.
The code then initializes two lists, bina and invb, with the values 1 for all integers from 1 to B+W+1.
It then iterates through the range B+W to B+W+1 and calculates the value of bina[i] as the product of all integers from 1 to 2i, modulo mod.
It then calculates the value of invb[-1] as the multiplicative inverse of bina[-1] modulo mod.
It then iterates through the range B+W to 0, and for each i, it calculates the value of invb[i-1] as the product of invb[i] and 2, modulo mod.
The code then checks if B is equal to W. If it is, it prints the value of invf[2].
If B is greater than W, it prints the value of invf[2] for the first W numbers, and then calculates the value of P as the product of invf[2] and the value of invf[i-1-W] for the remaining numbers. It then calculates the value of F for each number i in the range W+1 to B+1, and prints the value of F.
It then calculates the value of P as the product of invf[i-1-B] and invf[B-1] for the remaining numbers. It then calculates the value of F for each number i in the range B+1 to B+W+1, and prints the value of F.
If B is less than W, it prints the value of invf[2] for the first B numbers, and then calculates the value of P as the product of invf[2] and the value of invf[i-1-B] for the remaining numbers. It then calculates the value of F for each number i in the range B+1 to W+1, and prints the value of F.
It then calculates the value of P as the product of invf[i-1-B] and invf[B-1] for the remaining numbers. It then calculates the value of F for each number i in the
