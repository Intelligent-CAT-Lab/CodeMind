The return value of the code is the final state of the list1 after the loop has finished executing.
For the input `15`, the list1 will be `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]`.
Therefore, the return value of the code for the input `15` is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]`.
