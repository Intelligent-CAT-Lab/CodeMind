 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable g is initialized to 9.8.
The variable eps is initialized to 1e-10.
The variables N, V, X, and Y are initialized to 0, 7, 3, and 1, respectively.
The variable obstacles is an empty list.
The code then enters a loop that iterates N times.
For each iteration, it reads four integers L, B, R, and T from the input.
It checks if L is less than X, if so it adds the tuple (L, B, R, T) to the obstacles list.
After the loop finishes, the code calls the check function with X and Y as arguments.
The check function first checks if X is 0, if so it returns 0.
It then calculates a, b, and c using the given values.
It calculates D using the formula b^2 - 4ac.
If D is less than -eps, it returns 0.
If -eps <= D < 0, it sets D to 0.
It then enters a loop that iterates two times.
For each iteration, it calculates tt using the formula (-b + d*D^0.5)/(2*a).
It checks if tt is less than or equal to 0, if so it continues to the next iteration.
It calculates t using the square root of tt.
It calculates vx and vy using the given values.
It calls the calc function with vy and X/vx as arguments.
If the result is less than Y - eps, it returns 0.
It then enters another loop that iterates four times.
For each iteration, it checks if L or R is 0, if so it continues to the next iteration.
It calls the check function with L and T as arguments.
If the result is 1, it prints "Yes" and exits the program.
If the result is 0, it continues to the next iteration.
After the loop finishes, it enters another loop that iterates four times.
For each iteration, it checks if L or R is 0, if so it continues to the next iteration.
It calls the check function with R and T as arguments.
If the result is 1, it prints "Yes" and exits the program.
If the result is 0, it continues to the next iteration.
After the loop finishes, it prints "No".
