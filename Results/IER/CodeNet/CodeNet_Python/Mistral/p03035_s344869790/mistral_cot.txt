 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the math module.
Then it reads two integers A and B from the user, separated by a space.
The code then checks if A is less than or equal to 5. If it is, it prints 0.
If A is greater than 5 but less than or equal to 12, it divides B by 2 and prints the floor of the result.
If A is greater than 12, it simply prints B.
In this case, A is 30 and B is 100.
Since A is greater than 12, the code simply prints B, which is 100.
<<<Output>>>
100
