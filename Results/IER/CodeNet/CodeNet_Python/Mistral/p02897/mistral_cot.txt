 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input from the user using the `input()` function and stores it in the variable `N`.
The code then performs an arithmetic operation on `N` using the `//` operator, which performs integer division. The result is divided by 2, which gives `N//2`.
The code then takes the absolute value of the result using the `abs()` function, which returns the absolute value of a number.
Finally, the code prints the result of the division by multiplying the absolute value by -1.
<<<Output>>>
-2
