 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes two integers as input, a and b, using the `input().split()` method. It then initializes a variable `cnt` to 0, which will be used to accumulate the number of combinations.
The code then enters a loop that checks if a and b are both greater than 1. If they are, it calls the `cmb` function with the arguments a and 2, which returns the number of combinations of a and 2.
The code then adds the result of the `cmb` function to the `cnt` variable.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of `cnt`, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
