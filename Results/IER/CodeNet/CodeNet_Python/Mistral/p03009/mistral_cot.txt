 <<<Analysis>>>
The variables N, H, and D are initialized to 2, 2, and 1, respectively.
MOD is initialized to 10**9 + 7.
The code then initializes two arrays, fact and fact\_cum, to store the factorial of numbers up to N.
The code also initializes two arrays, ap and ap\_cum, to store the values of the polynomial.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to H.
For each value of n in this range, it calculates the value of the polynomial using the formula ap[n] = (ap\_cum[n-1] + x)%MOD, where x is calculated as x = ap\_cum[n-1] \* fact\_cum[N] \* (MOD-2)%MOD.
After the loop finishes, the code calculates the final value of the polynomial by multiplying ap[H] by fact[N] and then taking the result modulo MOD.
The final value of the polynomial is 1.
