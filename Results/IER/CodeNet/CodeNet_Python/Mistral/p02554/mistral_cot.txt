 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input n, which is 2 in this case.
The variables ant, bnt and cnt are initialized to 1, 1 and 1, respectively.
The code then enters a loop that iterates n times.
For each iteration, it calculates the new values of ant, bnt and cnt using the following formulas:
ant = 10^ant % 1000000007
bnt = 9*bnt % 1000000007
cnt = 8*cnt % 1000000007
After the loop finishes, the code calculates the difference between ant and the sum of bnt and cnt, which is (10^1*1000000007 - 9*1*1000000007 + 8*1*1000000007) % 1000000007 = 1000000007 - 1000000007 + 8 = 8.
Since ans is positive, the code prints 8.
<<<Output>>>
8
