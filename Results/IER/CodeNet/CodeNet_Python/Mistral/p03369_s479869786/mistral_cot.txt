 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first prompts the user to enter a string using the `input()` function and stores it in the variable `s`.
The variable `ans` is initialized to 700.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each character in the string `s`.
For each character, it checks if it is equal to 'o'. If it is, it adds 100 to the variable `ans`.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of `ans`, which is 800.
<<<Output>>>
800
