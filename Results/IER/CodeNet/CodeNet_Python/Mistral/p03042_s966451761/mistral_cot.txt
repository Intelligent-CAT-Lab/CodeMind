 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first defines several functions to handle input and output.
The function `input()` returns the input line as a string, and the functions `I()` and `LI()` return integers and lists of integers, respectively, from the input line.
The function `SR()` returns a string, and the function `LS()` returns a list of strings from the input line.
The function `is_yymm()` checks if the first two digits of a number are in the range of 1 to 12, and the function `is_mmyy()` checks if the last two digits of a number are in the range of 1 to 12.
The code then reads the input line and extracts the first two digits f and the last two digits l.
It then checks if f and l are in the range of 1 to 12, and if f is less than or equal to l.
If both conditions are met, it prints "YYMM".
If f is greater than l, it prints "MMYY".
If neither condition is met, it prints "NA".
<<<Output>>>
NA
