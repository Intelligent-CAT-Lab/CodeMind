 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes three integers as input, a, b and c, which are 4, 12 and 20, respectively.
The variable d is initialized to 0, which will be used to keep track of the number of iterations.
The code then enters a while loop that checks if all three numbers are even. In this case, all three numbers are even, so the loop continues.
The code then checks if all three numbers are equal. In this case, they are not equal, so the loop continues.
The code then increments d and performs some arithmetic operations on a, b and c to find three new numbers that are equal.
The loop continues until all three numbers are equal, which is not the case in this input.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the value of d, which is 0.
<<<Output>>>
0
