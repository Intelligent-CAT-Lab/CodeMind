 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user, which is a string of three integers separated by spaces. The input is split using the `split()` method and converted to a list of integers using a list comprehension. The list comprehension converts each string element to an integer using the `int()` function.
The resulting list is stored in the variable `a, b, x`.
The code then checks if `x` is greater than or equal to `a` and less than or equal to `a + b`. If this condition is met, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'.
In this case, `a` is 3, `b` is 5 and `x` is 4. Since 4 is less than 3 + 5, the condition is not met and the code prints 'NO'.
<<<Output>>>
NO
