The code first takes input from the user, which is a string of three integers separated by spaces. It then converts this string into a list of integers using the `map()` function and the `int()` function. The resulting list is stored in the variable `num`.
The code then uses the built-in `min()` and `max()` functions to find the minimum and maximum values in the list `num`, respectively. These values are stored in the variables `min_val` and `max_val`.
Finally, the code prints the minimum and maximum values in the list `num` using the `print()` function.
