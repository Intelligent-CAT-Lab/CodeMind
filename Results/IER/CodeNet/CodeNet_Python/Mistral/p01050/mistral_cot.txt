 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized to the input string "0ig3he12fz99".
The variable abc is a list of all lowercase letters, and num is a list of all digits.
The variable abc\_cnt and num\_cnt are two lists of size 28 and 12, respectively, initialized to all zeros.
The code then enters two loops, one for each of the alphabet and digits in the input string.
For each character in the input string, it checks if it is a letter or a digit and increments the corresponding count in the respective list.
After the loops finish, the code initializes two variables, abc\_sum and num\_sum, to the sum of the counts in the respective lists.
The code then enters two while loops, one for each of the alphabet and digits in the input string.
For each character in the input string, it checks if it is a letter or a digit and finds the index of the character in the respective list.
If the count of the character is greater than zero, it checks if the character is the first occurrence of the character in the respective list. If it is, it sets the start variable to the index of the character.
If the count of the character is greater than one, it checks if the character is the last occurrence of the character in the respective list. If it is, it adds the difference between the start and current index to the answer variable.
If the count of the character is greater than one, it decrements the count of the character and the respective sum.
The while loops continue until the respective sum is zero.
After both while loops finish, the code prints the final value of the answer variable.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is 10.
