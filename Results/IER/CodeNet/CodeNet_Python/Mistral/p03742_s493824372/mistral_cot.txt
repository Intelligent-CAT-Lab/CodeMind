 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, X and Y, and compares their absolute difference. If the absolute difference is greater than or equal to 2, it prints "Alice", otherwise it prints "Brown".
In this case, X is 2 and Y is 1, so the absolute difference is 1. Since 1 is less than 2, the code prints "Brown".
<<<Output>>>
Brown
