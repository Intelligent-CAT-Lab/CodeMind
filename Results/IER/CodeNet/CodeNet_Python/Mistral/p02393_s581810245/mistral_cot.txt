The code first reads three integers from the user using the `map()` function and stores them in the variables `m[0]`, `m[1]`, and `m[2]`.
The code then checks the possible orderings of the three integers using a series of `if` and `elif` statements.
The first `if` statement checks if the three integers are in the order `m[0] < m[1] < m[2]` or if they are equal. If this condition is met, the code prints the three integers in the order `m[0]`, `m[1]`, `m[2]`.
The second `elif` statement checks if the three integers are in the order `m[2] < m[0] < m[1]` or if they are equal. If this condition is met, the code prints the three integers in the order `m[2]`, `m[0]`, `m[1]`.
The third `elif` statement checks if the three integers are in the order `m[1] < m[2] < m[0]` or if they are equal. If this condition is met, the code prints the three integers in the order `m[1]`, `m[2]`, `m[0]`.
The fourth `elif` statement checks if the three integers are in the order `m[0] < m[2] < m[1]` or if they are equal. If this condition is met, the code prints the three integers in the order `m[0]`, `m[2]`, `m[1]`.
The fifth `elif` statement checks if the three integers are in the order `m[2] < m[1] < m[0]` or if they are equal. If this condition is met, the code prints the three integers in the order `m[2]`, `m[1]`, `m[0]`.
The sixth `elif` statement checks if the three integers are in the order `m[1] < m[0] < m[2]` or if they are equal. If this condition is met, the code prints the three integers in the order `m[1]`, `m[0]`, `m[2]`.
The seventh `elif` statement checks if the three integers are in the order `m[0] < m[2] < m[1]` or if they are equal. If this condition is met, the code prints the three integers in the order `m[0]`, `m[2]`, `m[1]`.
The eighth `elif` statement checks if the three integers are in the order `m[2] < m[1] < m[0]` or if they are equal. If this condition is met, the code prints the three integers in the order `m[2]`, `m[1]`, `m[0]`.
The ninth `elif` statement checks if the three integers are in the order `m[1] < m[0] < m[2]` or if they are equal. If this condition is met, the code prints the three integers in the order `m[1]`, `m[0]`, `m[2]`.
The tenth `elif` statement checks if the three integers are in the order `m[0] < m[2] < m[1]` or
