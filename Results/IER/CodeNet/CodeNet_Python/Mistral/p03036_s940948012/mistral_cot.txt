 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input, r, d and x.
The variable r is 2, variable d is 10 and variable x is 20.
The code then enters a loop that iterates 10 times.
In each iteration, it calculates the new value of x by multiplying r by x and subtracting d.
The new value of x is then printed.
The final value of x after 10 iterations is 0.
<<<Output>>>
0
