<<<Analysis>>>
The code prompts the user to enter a number using the `input()` function and stores it in the variable `x`.
The code then checks if `x` is less than 1200 using an `if` statement.
If `x` is less than 1200, the code prints the string 'ABC'.
If `x` is greater than or equal to 1200, the code prints the string 'ARC'.
<<<Output>>>
ABC
