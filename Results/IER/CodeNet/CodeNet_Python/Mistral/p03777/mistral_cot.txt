 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs separated by a space, and stores them in the variables a and b.
The code then checks if a is equal to 'H'. If it is, it prints the value of b.
If a is not equal to 'H', it checks if b is equal to 'H'. If it is, it prints the string 'D'.
If neither of these conditions are met, it prints the string 'H'.
<<<Output>>>
H
