The variable MOD is initialized to 10**9 + 7, which is used as the modulus for the remainder operation.
The variable n is initialized to 3, which is the input value.
The code then initializes a 2D array dp with dimensions 61x3, which will be used to store the intermediate results of the calculation.
The first element of the first row of dp is set to 1, which is the base case.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 59 to 0 (inclusive), meaning it will consider all possible values of the rightmost bit of n.
For each value of i in this range, it checks if the rightmost bit of n is 1 (i.e., (n>>i)&1 == 1). If it is, it sets the first element of the current row of dp to the sum of the first element of the next row and the first element of the current row.
If the rightmost bit of n is 0, it sets the first element of the current row of dp to the sum of the first element of the next row and the sum of the first and second elements of the current row.
After the loop finishes, the code performs a modulo operation on each element of the dp array to ensure that the final result is within the range of the modulus.
Finally, the code prints the sum of the first row of dp, which is 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.
