 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the math module.
Then it reads four integers from the user, A, B, H, and M, and stores them in the variables A, B, H, and M, respectively.
The code then calculates the value of h using the formula h = 30*H + M/2.
The code then calculates the value of m using the formula m = 6*M.
The code then calculates the value of y using the formula y = abs(h - m).
The code then calculates the value of x\_2 using the formula x\_2 = A^2 + B^2 - 2*A*B*(math.cos(math.radians(y))).
The code then calculates the value of x using the formula x = x\_2^(0.5).
Finally, the code prints the value of x.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is 10.0.
