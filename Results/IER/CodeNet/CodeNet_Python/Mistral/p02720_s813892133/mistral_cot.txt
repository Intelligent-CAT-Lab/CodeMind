 <<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by reading an integer `K` from the user. In this case, `K` is 15.
The code then creates an empty queue using the `Queue` class from the `queue` module.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 9 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 9.
For each number `i` in this range, it adds `i` to the queue.
After the loop finishes, the code enters another loop that continues until the count of numbers in the queue is equal to `K`.
Inside this loop, the code gets the next number `j` from the queue using the `get` method.
It increments the count of numbers in the queue by 1.
If the count is equal to `K`, the code prints the value of `j` and breaks out of the loop.
If `j` is not divisible by 10, the code calculates the next number `j+10-j%10` and adds it to the queue.
If `j` is not equal to 9, the code calculates the next number `j+10+1` and adds it to the queue.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the value of `j`, which is 15.
<<<Output>>>
15
