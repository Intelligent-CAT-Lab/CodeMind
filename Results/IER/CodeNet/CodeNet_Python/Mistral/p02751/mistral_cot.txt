 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers n and m as input, which are then used to initialize the 2D list ans. The list ans is a matrix of size (2^n-1) x (2^m-1), where each element is either 0 or 1.
The code then enters a nested loop that iterates through all possible combinations of i and j, where i is a power of 2 between 1 and 2^n-1, and j is a power of 2 between 1 and 2^m-1.
For each combination, it checks if the element at position (i-1,j-1) in the ans matrix is 1. If it is, it sets it to 0, otherwise it sets it to 1.
Finally, the code prints out the contents of the ans matrix by iterating through each row and printing out the elements separated by spaces.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is a matrix of size (2^n-1) x (2^m-1), where each element is either 0 or 1. In this case, n=2 and m=3, so the matrix is of size (31-1) x (49-1) = 30 x 48 = 1440.
The specific contents of the matrix depend on the input values of n and m, but in this case, the output would be:
