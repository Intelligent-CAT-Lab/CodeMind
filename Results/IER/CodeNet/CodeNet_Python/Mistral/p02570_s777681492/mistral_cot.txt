 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input: d, t, and s.
The first condition checks if s*t < d. If this condition is true, the code prints "No". Otherwise, it prints "Yes".
In this case, s*t = 15*80 = 1200, and d = 1000. Since 1200 < 1000, the condition is true and the code prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
