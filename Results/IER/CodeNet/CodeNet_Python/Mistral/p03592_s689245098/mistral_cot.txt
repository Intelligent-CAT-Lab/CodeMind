 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input: n, m, and k. In this case, n = 2, m = 2, and k = 2.
The code initializes an array t of size n*m+1 with all elements set to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n+1. For each iteration, it calculates the value of a and b.
For each value of j from 0 to m-1, it sets the value of t[a] to 1 and updates the value of a and b.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if t[k] is equal to 0. In this case, t[k] is equal to 0, so the code prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
