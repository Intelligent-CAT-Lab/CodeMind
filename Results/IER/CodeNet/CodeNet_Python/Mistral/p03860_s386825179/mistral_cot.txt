 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three input strings `a`, `x`, and `c` separated by spaces.
The first character of each string is extracted using the indexing operator `[]` and stored in the variables `a0`, `x0`, and `c0`, respectively.
The code then prints the sum of these three characters using the `print()` function.
