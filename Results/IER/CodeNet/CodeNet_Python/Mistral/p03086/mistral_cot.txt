 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to store the maximum length of a substring consisting only of acgt.
The variable length is also initialized to 0, which will be used to keep track of the current length of the substring.
The code then reads the input string s, which is "ATCODER".
The code then iterates through each character in the string s.
For each character, it checks if it is one of the characters acgt. If it is, it increments the length of the current substring by 1 and updates the maximum length ans to be the maximum of the current ans and the current length.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 4.
<<<Output>>>
4
