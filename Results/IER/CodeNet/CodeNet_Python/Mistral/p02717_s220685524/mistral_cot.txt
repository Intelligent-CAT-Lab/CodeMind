<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user, which is `1 2 3`.
The input is then split into three parts using the `split()` method, which returns a list of the input separated by spaces.
The resulting list is `['1', '2', '3']`.
The `map()` function is then used to convert each element of the list to an integer, which results in the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` being assigned the values `1`, `2`, and `3`, respectively.
Finally, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are printed to the console using the `print()` function.
<<<Output>>>
3 2 1
