 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input from the user using the `input()` function and stores it in the variable `n`.
The code then uses an `if` statement to check if `n` is equal to 0. If it is, the code prints 1. Otherwise, the code uses the `//` operator to divide 2 by `n` and prints the result.
The `//` operator performs an integer division, which means it rounds down the result to the nearest integer.
