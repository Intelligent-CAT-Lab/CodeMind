<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four integers as input, N, A, B and C, and stores them in the variables N, A, B and C, respectively.
The code then subtracts A and B from N and adds C to the result.
The final expression is N - A - B + C.
For the given input `6 3 2 1`, the values of N, A, B and C are 6, 3, 2 and 1, respectively.
Substituting these values in the expression, we get:
6 - 3 - 2 + 1 = 0
Therefore, the return value of the code is 0.
<<<Output>>>
