<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input, a, b and x.
It uses the map() function to convert the input string into integers.
The code then performs the following arithmetic operations:
- b // x: division of b by x
- (a - 1) // x: division of (a - 1) by x
- b // x - (a - 1) // x: subtraction of the two results
The final result is then printed.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is 1.
