 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first prompts the user to enter two integers separated by a space. The user inputs `12 4`.
The input is then split using the `split()` method, which returns a list of strings. The list is then converted to a list of integers using a list comprehension. The resulting list is `[12, 4]`.
The variables A and B are assigned the values of the list elements, so A is 12 and B is 4.
The code then calculates the difference between A and 2B, which is 12 - 8 = 4.
Since the result is positive, the code prints the value of diff, which is 4.
<<<Output>>>
4
