<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input, n, a and b.
It uses the `map()` function to convert the input string into integers.
The `input()` function reads a line from the console and returns it as a string. The `split()` method is then called on this string to split it into a list of words, which are then converted to integers using the `map()` function.
The `min()` function is then called with two arguments, a and n multiplied by n.
The function returns the minimum of the two arguments.
