 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an input string S.
It then checks if the string contains the substring "AA". If it does, it prints "NO".
If it doesn't, it uses the `replace()` method to remove the substrings "KIH" and "A" from the string. The resulting string is then checked to see if it is equal to "BR". If it is, it prints "YES".
If neither of these conditions are met, it prints "NO".
<<<Output>>>
NO
