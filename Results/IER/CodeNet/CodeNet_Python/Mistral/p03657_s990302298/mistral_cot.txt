 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, a and b, separated by a space.
It then checks if either a or b is divisible by 3, or if the sum of a and b is divisible by 3.
If any of these conditions are met, the code prints "Possible". Otherwise, it prints "Impossible".
<<<Output>>>
Impossible
