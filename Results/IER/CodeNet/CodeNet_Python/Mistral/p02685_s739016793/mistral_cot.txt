 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first initializes the variables n, m, and k to 3, 2, and 1, respectively.
It then initializes the variables ans, mod, N, g1, g2, and inverse.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the final answer.
The variable mod is set to 998244353, which is the output's constraint.
The variable N is set to 2*10**5, which is the maximum value of n.
The variables g1 and g2 are initialized to [1, 1].
The variable inverse is initialized to [0, 1].
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 2 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the inverse of i modulo N and stores it in inverse[i].
The code then enters another loop that iterates from 2 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 2 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates g1[i] and g2[i] using the formula g1[i] = (g1[-1] \* i) % mod and g2[i] = (g2[-1] \* inverse[-1]) % mod.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 2 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the value of color using the formula color = m \* (m-1) \* (n-i-1) % mod.
The code then enters another loop that iterates from 2 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 2 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the value of now using the formula now = color \* (m-1) \* (n-i-1) % mod.
The code then adds the value of now to ans and updates the value of ans modulo N.
After the loops finish, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 1.
