 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first reads a string S from the standard input using the `SI()` function. It then calculates the length of the string N.
The code then iterates through the string S and counts the number of zeroes and ones in the string. It starts counting from the first zero or one in the string and counts the number of consecutive zeroes or ones until it reaches the end of the string.
The code then prints the minimum of the two counts.
For the input `000`, the code will count 3 zeroes and 0 ones, so it will print 3.
<<<Output>>>
3
