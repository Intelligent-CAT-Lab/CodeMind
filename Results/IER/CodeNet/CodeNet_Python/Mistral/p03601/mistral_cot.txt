 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user and splits it into a list of integers using the `split()` method. It then converts each element of the list to an integer using the `int()` function.

The code then initializes two variables, `e` and `f`, with the values of the fifth and sixth elements of the list, respectively.

The code then initializes two empty lists, `listx` and `listy`, which will be used to store the values of `x` and `y`, respectively.

The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to the length of the list minus 1. For each iteration, it initializes two variables, `a` and `b`, with the values of the first and second elements of the list, respectively.

The code then enters another loop that iterates from 0 to infinity. For each iteration, it calculates the value of `x` by multiplying `i` by `a` and `100`, and adding `j` times `b` and `100`. It then checks if `x` is greater than `f`. If it is, it breaks out of the loop. If it is not, it continues to the next iteration.

If `x` is 0, it increments `j` and continues to the next iteration. Otherwise, it checks if `x` is already in `listx`. If it is, it continues to the next iteration. Otherwise, it appends `x` to `listx` and continues to the next iteration.

After the loop finishes, the code enters another loop that iterates from 0 to infinity. For each iteration, it calculates the value of `y` by multiplying `i` by `c` and `100`, and adding `j` times `d`. It then checks if `y` is greater than `f`. If it is, it breaks out of the loop. If it is not, it continues to the next iteration.

If `y` is 0, it increments `j` and continues to the next iteration. Otherwise, it checks if `y` is already in `listy`. If it is, it continues to the next iteration. Otherwise, it appends `y` to `listy` and continues to the next iteration.

After the loop finishes, the code calculates the maximum value of `xy` that is less than or equal to `f`. It does this by iterating over all possible combinations of `x` and `y` from `listx` and `listy`, respectively, and checking if their sum is less than or equal to `f`. If it is, it continues to the next iteration. If it is not, it continues to the next iteration.

The code then calculates the maximum value of `y` that can be obtained by multiplying `c` by a value of `x` that is less than or equal to `f`. It does this by iterating over all possible values of `x` from `listx`, and checking if their product with `c` is less than or equal to `f`. If it is, it continues to the next iteration. If it is not, it continues to the next iteration.

Finally, the code prints the maximum value of `xy` and the maximum value of `y` that can be obtained by multiplying `c` by a value of `x` that is less than or equal to `f`.
