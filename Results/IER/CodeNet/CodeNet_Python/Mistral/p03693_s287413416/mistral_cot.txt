 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input, r, g, and b, and stores them in the variables r, g, and b, respectively.
The variable answer is then calculated by multiplying r by 100, g by 10, and b by 1, and adding the three products together.
The code then checks if the answer is divisible by 4 using the modulo operator (%). If it is, it prints "YES", otherwise it prints "NO".
<<<Output>>>
NO
