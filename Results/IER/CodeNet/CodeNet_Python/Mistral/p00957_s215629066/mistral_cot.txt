 <<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes two arrays, DP1 and DP2, of size 200. DP1 is initialized to all zeros, while DP2 is initialized to [1, 0]^200.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to l (inclusive), where l is 5 in this case.
For each i in this range, it sets DP1[i] to DP2[i - 1], and DP2[i] to DP1[i - 1].
If i is greater than or equal to k (which is 3 in this case), it adds DP2[i - k] to DP1[i].
After the loop finishes, the code prints the sum of DP1.
