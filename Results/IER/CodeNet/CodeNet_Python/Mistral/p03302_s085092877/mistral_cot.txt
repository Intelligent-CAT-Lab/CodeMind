 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, a and b, and checks if their sum or product is equal to 15.
If the sum of a and b is equal to 15, the code prints '+'.
If the product of a and b is equal to 15, the code prints '*'.
If neither of the above conditions is met, the code prints 'x'.
For the input `4 11`, the sum of a and b is 15, so the code will print '+'.
