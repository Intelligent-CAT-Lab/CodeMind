 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes four integer inputs from the user, which are stored in variables A, B, C, and D.
The code then enters an infinite loop that repeatedly subtracts B from C and checks if the result is less than or equal to 0. If it is, the loop breaks and the code prints "Yes".
The code then subtracts D from A and checks if the result is less than or equal to 0. If it is, the loop breaks and the code prints "No".
The condition is met when C is 1, B is 9, A is 10 and D is 10.
<<<Output>>>
No
