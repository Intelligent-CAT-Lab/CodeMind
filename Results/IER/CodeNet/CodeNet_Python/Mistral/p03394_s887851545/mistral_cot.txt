 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized to 3, which is the input value.
The function _agc022\_b is called with N as its argument.
The function first checks if N is greater than or equal to 4. Since N is 3, this condition is not met.
Therefore, the function proceeds to the else block, where it prints the string "2 5 63".
The return value of the function is not explicitly defined, but it is the string "2 5 63" that is printed to the console.
<<<Output>>>
2 5 63
