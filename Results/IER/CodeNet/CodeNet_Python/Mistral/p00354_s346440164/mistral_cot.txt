 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input from the user using the `input()` function and stores it in the variable `a`.
The code then uses an `if` statement to check the remainder of `a` when divided by 7.
If the remainder is 1, the code prints "fri".
If the remainder is 2, the code prints "sat".
If the remainder is 3, the code prints "sun".
If the remainder is 4, the code prints "mon".
If the remainder is 5, the code prints "tue".
If the remainder is 6, the code prints "wed".
If the remainder is 0, the code prints "thu".
In this case, the remainder of 1 when divided by 7 is 1, so the code prints "fri".
<<<Output>>>
fri
