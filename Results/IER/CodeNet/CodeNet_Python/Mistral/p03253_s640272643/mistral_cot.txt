 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes two integers n and m as input, which are 2 and 6 respectively.
The variable mod is initialized to 10**9+7, which is used to perform modular arithmetic.
The function combination is defined to calculate the number of combinations of n items taken r at a time.
The function get\_prime\_dic is defined to count the number of occurrences of each prime factor of m.
The function get\_prime\_dic is called with m as input and returns a dictionary with prime factors as keys and their occurrences as values.
The variable ans is initialized to 1 and is used to store the final result.
The function combination is called for each prime factor in the dictionary returned by get\_prime\_dic. The first argument of the function is n-1+j, which is the number of items to choose from n-1 to j. The second argument is j, which is the number of items to choose. The result of the function is multiplied by ans and the result is divided by mod.
After all the combinations are calculated, the final result is printed.
