 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable X, and variable M are initialized to 6, 2, and 1001, respectively.
The code then creates an empty list called List.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 5.
For each number i in this range, it calculates X as the square of i modulo M, which is 1, 4, 9, 16, 25 in this case.
The code then checks if X is in the List. If it is, it finds the index of X in the List and stores it in key. It also stores the current number i in num.
The code then breaks out of the loop.
After the loop finishes, the code calculates the sum of all the numbers in the List and stores it in ans.
The code then checks if the length of the List is equal to N. If it is, it prints the sum of the List.
If the length of the List is not equal to N, the code calculates the remainder of the difference between N and the length of the List divided by the difference between num and key. It then calculates the sum of the List from key to num and adds it to ans.
Finally, the code calculates the sum of the List from key to key+((N - len(List)) % (num - key)) and adds it to ans.
The condition is met when i is 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.
After the loop finishes, the code calculates the sum of the List as 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 + 25 = 55.
Since the length of the List is equal to N, the code prints the sum of the List, which is 55.
<<<Output>>>
55
