 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers N and K as input, where N is the number of elements in the array and K is the number of elements to be selected.
The code initializes a 3D array dp with dimensions (N+1) x (N+1) x (K+N*2+1).
The first element of the array dp[0][0][0] is set to 1, which represents the case where no elements are selected.
The code then iterates through all possible combinations of selecting K elements from the array of size N.
For each combination, the code updates the dp array using the recurrence relation:
dp[i+1][j][k+j*2] += dp[i][j][k]
dp[i+1][j][k+j*2] %= MOD
dp[i+1][j+1][k+(j+1)*2] += dp[i][j][k]
dp[i+1][j+1][k+(j+1)*2] %= MOD
dp[i+1][j][k+j*2] += dp[i][j][k] * j * 2
dp[i+1][j][k+j*2] %= MOD
if j >= 1 :
dp[i+1][j-1][k+(j-1)*2] += dp[i][j][k] * j * j
dp[i+1][j-1][k+(j-1)*2] %= MOD
The code then prints the value of dp[N][0][K], which represents the number of ways to select K elements from the array of size N.
