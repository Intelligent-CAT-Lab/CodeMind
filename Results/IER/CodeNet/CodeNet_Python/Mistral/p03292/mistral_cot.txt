 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes a list of three integers as input, separated by spaces. The input is `1 6 3`.
The code then calculates the absolute differences between each pair of adjacent elements in the list.
The absolute differences are calculated using the `abs()` function, which returns the absolute value of a number.
The differences are stored in variables `b`, `c`, and `d`.
The code then uses the `min()` function to find the smallest of the three differences.
The return value of the code is the smallest absolute difference between adjacent elements in the input list.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is 5.
