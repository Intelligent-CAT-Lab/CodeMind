 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `inpl()` is called and returns a list of integers. The list is `[5, 1, 5, 2, 4]`.
The variables N, A, B, C, and D are assigned the values returned by `inpl()`.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N+1.
For each iteration, it calculates the value of the expression D*k - C*j, where k is the current iteration number and j is the iteration number minus k.
It then checks if this value is greater than or equal to B-A or greater than or equal to C*k - D*j.
If either of these conditions is met, the code prints 'YES' and breaks out of the loop.
If none of these conditions are met, the code prints 'NO' after the loop finishes.
<<<Output>>>
NO
