 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the math module.
Then it takes three integers as input, a, b and x, and stores them in the variables a, b and x, respectively.
It calculates the value of c by dividing x by a.
Then it checks if c is greater than a*b/2. If it is, it calculates d by subtracting c from a*b, and then calculates e by taking the arctangent of d/a.
If c is not greater than a*b/2, it calculates d by multiplying c by 2 and dividing it by b, and then calculates e by taking the arctangent of b/d.
Finally, it prints the value of e in degrees.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code for the input `2 2 4` is 0.0 degrees.
This is because c is 2, which is less than 2*2/2, so the condition c > a*b/2 is not met.
Therefore, d is calculated as 2*2/2 = 2, and e is calculated as math.atan(2/2) = 0.0 degrees.
