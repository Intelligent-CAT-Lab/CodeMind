<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, N and K. N is the number of terms in the sequence and K is the first term of the sequence.
The code then calculates the product of K and the factorial of K minus one, raised to the power of N minus one.
The factorial of K minus one is calculated using a recursive function. The base case is when K is 1, in which case the factorial is 1. Otherwise, the factorial is calculated by multiplying K by the factorial of K minus 1.
The final result is then printed.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code for the input `2 2` is 2.

The calculation is as follows:
K = 2
N = 2
K*((K-1)**(N-1)) = 2*((2-1)**(2-1)) = 2*1 = 2
Therefore, the return value of the code is 2.
