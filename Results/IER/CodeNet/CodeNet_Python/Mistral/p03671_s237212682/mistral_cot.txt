 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes three integers as input, separated by spaces. The input is `700 600 780`.
The code then converts the input string into a list of integers using the `input().split()` method. The resulting list is `[700, 600, 780]`.
The code then uses a list comprehension to convert the list of integers into a list of integers. The resulting list is `[700, 600, 780]`.
The code then uses the `min()` function to find the minimum of three numbers: `a+b`, `b+c` and `c+a`.
The value of `a+b` is `1300`, the value of `b+c` is `1340` and the value of `c+a` is `1560`.
The minimum of these three numbers is `1300`, which is returned by the code.
<<<Output>>>
1300
