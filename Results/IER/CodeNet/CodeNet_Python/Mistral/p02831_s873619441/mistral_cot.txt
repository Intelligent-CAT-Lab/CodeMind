 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first defines a function `gcd` that takes two arguments `a` and `b` and returns the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b`. It does this using recursion, with the base case being when `a` is 0, in which case it returns `b`. Otherwise, it calls itself with the arguments `b%a` and `a`.
The code then reads in a list of integers from the user, which are stored in the variable `num`.
The code then calculates the product of the first two elements of the list, `num[0]*num[1]`, and divides it by the greatest common divisor of `num[0]` and `num[1]`, which is calculated using the `gcd` function.
The result is then printed to the console.
