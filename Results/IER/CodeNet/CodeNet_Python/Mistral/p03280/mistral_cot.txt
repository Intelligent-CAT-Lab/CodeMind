 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, a and b, and calculates their product.
The input is split using the split() method, which splits the input string into a list of substrings based on a specified delimiter (in this case, a space).
The map() function is then used to convert the two substrings to integers.
The code then calculates the product of a and b by multiplying them together.
Finally, the product is printed to the console.
