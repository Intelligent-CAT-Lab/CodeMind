 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user, which is a string of three integers separated by spaces. The input is then split into a list of strings using the `split()` method, which splits the string at every occurrence of a specified delimiter (in this case, a space). The list of strings is then converted to a list of integers using the `map()` function and the `int()` function. The resulting list of integers is assigned to the variables A, B, and C.
The code then checks if A is equal to B and B is equal to C using the `if` statement. If all three variables are equal, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
