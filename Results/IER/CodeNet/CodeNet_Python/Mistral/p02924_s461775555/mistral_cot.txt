 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first prompts the user to enter a number using the `input()` function and stores it in the variable `n`.
The variable `n` is then used in the expression `n*(n-1)//2`, which calculates the factorial of n divided by 2.
The factorial of n is calculated by multiplying all positive integers less than or equal to n.
The division by 2 is done using the floor division operator `//`, which returns the quotient of the division.
The final result is then printed using the `print()` function.
