 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an input string `s` using the `input()` function.
It then initializes an empty list `a` and a string variable `ans` with the value "yes".
The code then iterates over each character in the input string `s` using a for loop.
For each character, it checks if it is already in the list `a`. If it is not, it appends it to the list `a`. If it is, it sets the value of `ans` to "no" and breaks out of the loop.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the value of `ans`.
<<<Output>>>
no
