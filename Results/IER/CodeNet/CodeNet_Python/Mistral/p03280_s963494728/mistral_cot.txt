<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, A and B, and stores them in the variables A and B.
It then calculates the product of A and B, subtracts 1 from both numbers and multiplies the result.
The final expression is (A-1)*(B-1)
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code would be 1.
Since A and B are both 2, (A-1)*(B-1) becomes (2-1)*(2-1) = 1.
