 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable k is initialized to 101.
The code then checks if k % 10 is in [0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8]. It is not, so the code moves to the next condition.
The code then checks if k % 10 is equal to 1. It is not, so the code moves to the next condition.
The code then checks if k % 10 is equal to 3. It is not, so the code moves to the next condition.
The code then checks if k % 10 is equal to 7. It is not, so the code moves to the next condition.
The code then checks if k % 10 is equal to 9. It is not, so the code moves to the next condition.
Since none of the conditions are met, the code prints -1.
<<<Output>>>
-1
