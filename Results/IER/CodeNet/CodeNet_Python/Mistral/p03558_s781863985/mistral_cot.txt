 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer k as input, which is 6 in this case.
The function `solve` initializes an empty dictionary `dp` and a deque `que`.
It then appends the tuple (1, 1) to the deque and adds the key 1 to the dictionary with a value of 1.
The function enters a while loop that continues until the deque is empty.
Inside the loop, it pops the first element from the deque, which is (1, 1).
It calculates the next element y as (1 + 1) % 6 = 2, and checks if it exists in the dictionary `dp`. Since it does not exist, it adds it to the dictionary with a value of 1.
It then calculates the next element z as (10 * 1) % 6 = 0, and checks if it exists in the dictionary `dp`. Since it does not exist, it adds it to the dictionary with a value of 1.
The function then appends the tuple (2, 1) to the deque and the tuple (0, 1) to the deque.
The function then repeats the process until the deque is empty.
After the loop finishes, the function returns the value of the key 0 in the dictionary `dp`, which is 1.
