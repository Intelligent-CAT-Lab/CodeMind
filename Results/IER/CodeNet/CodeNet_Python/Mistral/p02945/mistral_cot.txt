<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, a and b, and uses the `map()` function to convert them to integers.
The `input()` function reads a line of text from the console, which is then split into two parts using the `split()` method.
The `map()` function takes a list of strings and applies a function to each element, converting them to integers.
The `max()` function is then called with three arguments: `a-b`, `a+b` and `a*b`. It returns the maximum of these three values.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is 18.
