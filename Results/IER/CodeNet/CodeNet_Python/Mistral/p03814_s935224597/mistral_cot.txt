 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an input string S, which is `QWERTYASDFZXCV`.
The function AtoZ is then called with the input string S.
The function AtoZ uses two nested loops to find the position of the first letter "A" in the string and the position of the last letter "Z" in the string.
The difference between these two positions is then returned as the answer.
In this case, the first letter "A" is found at position 0 and the last letter "Z" is found at position 25.
Therefore, the answer is 25 - 0 + 1 = 26.
<<<Output>>>
26
