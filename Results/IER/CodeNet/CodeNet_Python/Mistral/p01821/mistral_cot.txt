 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized to 3, which is the input value.
The function carmichael is called with N as its argument, and its return value is stored in the variable c.
The function solve is then called with N and c as its arguments, and its return value is stored in the variable k.
The code then checks if k is equal to -1 or if pow(N, k, c) is not equal to 1 % c. If either of these conditions is true, the code prints -1. Otherwise, it prints k.
<<<Output>>>
-1
