 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input from the user using the `input()` function and stores it in the variable `N`.
The code then calculates the return value using the formula `1 - (N//2)/N`.
The `//` operator performs an integer division, which means that the result is always a whole number.
In this case, `N` is 4, so `N//2` is 2, and `N//2/N` is 0.5.
Subtracting 0.5 from 1 gives a return value of 0.5.
<<<Output>>>
0.5
