 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, a and b, and stores them in the variables a and b, respectively.
The code then calculates the value (b+a-1)//a, which is equivalent to (b+a-1) divided by a.
The division operator // is used to perform an integer division, which means that the result is truncated to the nearest integer.
The final value is then printed to the console.
