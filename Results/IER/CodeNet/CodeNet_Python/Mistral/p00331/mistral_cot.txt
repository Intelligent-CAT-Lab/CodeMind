 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs, H and R, and converts them to integers using the `map()` function.
The code then checks if H is greater than or equal to 0. If it is, it prints 1.
If H is less than 0, it checks if H plus R is greater than 0. If it is, it prints 1.
If H plus R is equal to 0, it prints 0.
If H plus R is less than 0, it prints -1.

For the input `-3 3`, H is -3 and R is 3. Since H is less than 0, the code checks if H plus R is greater than 0. Since H plus R is -3 plus 3, which is 0, the code prints -1.

<<<Output>>>
-1
