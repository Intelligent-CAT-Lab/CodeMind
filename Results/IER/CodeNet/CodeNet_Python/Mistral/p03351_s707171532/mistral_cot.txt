 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four integers as input, a, b, c and x.
It then checks if the absolute difference between a and c is less than or equal to x. If it is, it prints "Yes".
If not, it checks if the absolute difference between a and b is less than or equal to x and the absolute difference between b and c is less than or equal to x. If both conditions are met, it prints "Yes".
If neither of these conditions are met, it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
