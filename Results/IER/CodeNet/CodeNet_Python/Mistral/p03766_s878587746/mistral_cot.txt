 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module and sets the value of MOD to 10**9+7.
It then reads the input from the standard input using the readline() function and stores it in the variable N.
The code then initializes three arrays dp1, dp2 and Dp1 with zeros and sets the first elements of dp1 and dp2 to 1 and N-1 respectively.
The code then calculates the values of dp1 and dp2 for each index i from 1 to N-1 using a loop.
For each index i, dp1[i] is calculated as (dp1[i-1] + Dp1[i-3] - 1) % MOD, where Dp1[i-3] is the value of dp1 at index i-3.
Similarly, dp2[i] is calculated as (dp2[i-1] + Dp2[i-3]) % MOD, where Dp2[i-3] is the value of dp2 at index i-3.
The code then calculates the values of Dp1[i] and Dp2[i] for each index i from 1 to N-1 using a loop.
For each index i, Dp1[i] is calculated as (Dp1[i-1] + dp1[i]) % MOD, and Dp2[i] is calculated as (Dp2[i-1] + dp2[i]) % MOD.
Finally, the code prints the sum of dp1[N-1] and dp2[N-1] modulo MOD.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is 10.
