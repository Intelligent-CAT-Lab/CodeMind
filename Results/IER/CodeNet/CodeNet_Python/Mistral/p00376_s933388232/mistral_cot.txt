 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes two integers as input, separated by a space. The input is `20 30`.
The first line of the code unpacks the input into two variables, `x1` and `x2`, using a tuple unpacking assignment.
The second line of the code checks if `x2` is greater than `x1`. In this case, `x2` is 30 and `x1` is 20, so the condition is `True`.
The third line of the code subtracts `x1` from `x2` and prints the result, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
