 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the functools module and defines a function called nCr that takes three arguments: n, r, and DIV.
The function checks if r is less than n-r, and if so, sets r to n-r. If r is 0, the function returns 1.
The function then defines a lambda function called f that takes two arguments x and y and returns x*y modulo DIV.
The function uses the reduce function to calculate the product of the numbers from n-r+1 to n and from 1 to r, and then calculates the product of the numbers from n-k+1 to n and from 1 to k, and finally calculates the product of the numbers from k+1 to n and from 1 to k, and returns the result modulo DIV.
The code then takes two integers n and k as input, and calculates the value of nCr(k-1, i, mod) and nCr(n-k+1, i+1, mod) for each value of i from 0 to k-1.
The code then calculates the product of these two values and returns the result modulo DIV.
The code then prints the result of this calculation for each value of i from 0 to k-1.
