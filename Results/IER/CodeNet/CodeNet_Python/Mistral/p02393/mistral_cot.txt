 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user, which is a list of three integers separated by spaces. The input is stored in the variable `s`.
The code then uses the `map()` function to convert the input list into an integer list. The `map()` function takes a function as an argument and applies it to each element of the input iterable. In this case, the function is `int()`, which converts each element of the input list to an integer.
The resulting integer list is stored in the variable `s`.
The code then uses the `sorted()` function to sort the elements of the list in ascending order. The sorted list is stored in the variable `s1`.
Finally, the code prints the first three elements of the sorted list, which are the smallest three elements of the original list.
