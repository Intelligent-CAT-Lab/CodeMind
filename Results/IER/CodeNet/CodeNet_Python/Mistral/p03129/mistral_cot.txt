 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs, N and K, which are integers.
The code first checks if N is even. If it is, it checks if N/2 is greater than or equal to K. If it is, the code prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".
If N is odd, it checks if N/2 + 1 is greater than or equal to K. If it is, the code prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".
For the input `3 2`, N is 3 and K is 2. Since N is odd, the code checks if N/2 + 1 is greater than or equal to K. Since 3/2 + 1 = 2, which is less than 2, the code prints "NO".
<<<Output>>>
NO
