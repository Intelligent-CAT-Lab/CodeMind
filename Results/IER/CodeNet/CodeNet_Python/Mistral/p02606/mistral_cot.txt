The variables L, R, and d are initialized to 5, 10, and 2, respectively.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the number of multiples of d in the range [L, R].
The code then enters a loop that iterates from L to R (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 5 to 10.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is divisible by d, which is 2 in this case. If it is, it increments the value of ans by 1. The condition is met when i is 5, 6, 8, 10.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 4.
<<<Output>>>
