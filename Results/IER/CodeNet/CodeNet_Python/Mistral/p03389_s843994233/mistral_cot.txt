 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first reads an integer t from the user, which is 1 in this case.
Then it enters a loop that iterates t times.
For each iteration, it reads three integers x, y and z from the user, which are 2, 5 and 4, respectively.
It then calculates the maximum and minimum of these three numbers and stores them in ma and mi, respectively.
If x is equal to ma, it checks if y is less than z. If it is, it calculates the difference between x and y and stores it in m, and the difference between x and z in n. If y is greater than z, it calculates the difference between x and z in m and the difference between x and y in n.
If y is equal to ma, it checks if x is less than z. If it is, it calculates the difference between y and x in m and the difference between y and z in n. If x is greater than z, it calculates the difference between y and z in m and the difference between y and x in n.
If neither x nor y is equal to ma, it checks if x is less than y. If it is, it calculates the difference between z and x in m and the difference between z and y in n. If y is greater than x, it calculates the difference between z and y in m and the difference between z and x in n.
Then it calculates the answer ans by adding n and m, and dividing the result by 2. If the difference between m and n is odd, it adds 2 to the answer.
Finally, it prints the value of ans, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
