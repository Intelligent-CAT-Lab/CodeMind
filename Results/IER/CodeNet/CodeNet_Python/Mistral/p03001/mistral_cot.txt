 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four input values, w, h, x, and y, which are all floats.
The variables mx and my are calculated by dividing w and h by 2, respectively.
The variable res is initialized as an empty list, which will be used to store the results.
The code then appends the value (w*h)/2 to res.
The code then checks if x and y are equal to mx and my, respectively. If they are, it appends 1 to res, otherwise it appends 0.
Finally, the code prints the first two elements of res, which are the sum of w and h divided by 2 and 1 if x and y are equal to mx and my, respectively.
<<<Output>>>
(10.0, 1.0)
