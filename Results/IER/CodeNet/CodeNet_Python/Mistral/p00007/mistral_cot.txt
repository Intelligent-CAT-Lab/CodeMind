 <<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by initializing the variable `ans` to 100000.
Then it enters a loop that iterates for the number of times specified by the input.
In each iteration, it multiplies `ans` by 1.05.
After each multiplication, it checks if the remainder of `ans` divided by 1000 is not zero. If it is not, it adds 1000 - `ans` % 1000 to `ans`.
This is done to ensure that `ans` is always a multiple of 1000.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of `ans`.
<<<Output>>>
100000
