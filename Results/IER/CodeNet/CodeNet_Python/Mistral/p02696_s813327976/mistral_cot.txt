 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the math module.
Then it takes three integers as input, a, b and n, separated by spaces.
The code then checks if b is less than or equal to n + 1. If it is, it sets x to b - 1, otherwise it sets x to n.
The code then calculates g using the formula g = math.floor(a * x / b) and prints it.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is 1.
