 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input n from the user.
It then converts n to a string and converts the string back to a list of characters.
It then calculates the sum of the digits of n by iterating over the list of characters and converting each character back to an integer.
The code then checks if n is divisible by the sum of its digits. If it is, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".
For the input 12, the sum of its digits is 1 + 2 = 3.
Since 12 is not divisible by 3, the code prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
