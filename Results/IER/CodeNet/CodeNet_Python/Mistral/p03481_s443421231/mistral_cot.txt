 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers X and Y as input, which are 3 and 20 respectively.
It then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 10^18 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 10^18.
For each number i in this range, it checks if X*2^i is greater than Y. If it is, it prints the value of i and breaks out of the loop.
The condition is met when i is 18, since 3*2^18 = 6561 and 20*2^18 = 4194304.
<<<Output>>>
18
