<<<Analysis>>>
The code first prompts the user to enter a number using the `input()` function and stores it in the variable `N`.
The variable `N` is then raised to the power of 3 using the `**` operator and the result is printed using the `print()` function.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code would be 8, since 2 raised to the power of 3 is 8.
