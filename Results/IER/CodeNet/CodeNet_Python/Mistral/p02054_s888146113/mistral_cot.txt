 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input, a, b, and c.
It initializes a variable cnt to 0, which will be used to count the number of even numbers among a, b, and c.
The code then checks if a, b, and c are even by using the modulo operator (%). If the remainder of the division of a, b, or c by 2 is 0, it increments cnt by 1.
Finally, the code checks if cnt is greater than or equal to 2. If it is, it prints "Tem", otherwise it prints "Hom".
<<<Output>>>
Hom
