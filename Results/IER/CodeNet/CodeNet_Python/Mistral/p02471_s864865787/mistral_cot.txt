 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first defines a function `egcd` that takes two arguments `a` and `b`. It uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. The function returns the GCD, as well as two other values `x` and `y` that satisfy the equation `a*x + b*y = GCD`.
The code then reads two integers `a` and `b` from the user, which are 4 and 12, respectively.
The function `egcd` is called with these values, and it returns the GCD of 4 and 12, which is 2.
The code then checks if the product of `x` and `a` plus the product of `y` and `b` is equal to the GCD. In this case, it is not, so the code swaps the values of `x` and `y` to make it true.
Finally, the code prints the values of `x` and `y`, which are 2 and 6, respectively.
<<<Output>>>
