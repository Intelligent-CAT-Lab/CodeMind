The code initializes two variables N and M with the values 1 and 998244353, respectively.
It then initializes a 2D list dp with dimensions (3*N+1) x (2*N+1), which will be used to store the intermediate results of the dynamic programming algorithm.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 3*N+1. For each i in this range, it initializes the first row of dp[i] with 1, since the first row of dp[i] corresponds to the first number in the sequence.
The code then enters another loop that iterates from 2 to 2*N+1. For each j in this range, it calculates the value of dp[i][j] using the recurrence relation:
dp[i][j] = (dp[i-1][j-1] + dp[i-2][j+1]*(i-1) + dp[i-3][j]*(i-1)*(i-2)) % M
The condition is met when j is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126
