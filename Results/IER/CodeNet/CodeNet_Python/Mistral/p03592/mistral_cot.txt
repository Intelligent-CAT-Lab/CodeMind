 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input: n, m, and k. In this case, n = 2, m = 2, and k = 2.
The code initializes a variable ans to "No".
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n//2+1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 3.
For each number i in this range, it enters another loop that iterates from 0 to m.
For each combination of i and j, it calculates the value o using the formula o = i*j + (m-j)*(n-i).
It then calculates the value x using the formula x = n*m - o.
The code checks if o is equal to k or if x is equal to k. If either of these conditions is true, it sets ans to "Yes".
After the loops finish, the code prints the final value of ans, which is "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
