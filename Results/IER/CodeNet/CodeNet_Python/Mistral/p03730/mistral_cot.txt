 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input, a, b and c, which are 7, 5 and 1 respectively.
The function `foo` takes these three integers as arguments.
The function initializes a set called `seen` to keep track of the values of i that have been seen before.
It then calculates the remainder of a divided by b, which is 2.
It initializes i to 2 and enters a while loop that continues until i is in the set seen.
Inside the loop, it checks if i is equal to c. If it is, it prints "YES" and returns.
If not, it adds i to the set seen and calculates the next value of i by adding the remainder of (m + i) divided by b to i.
After the loop finishes, if i is not in the set seen, it prints "NO".
<<<Output>>>
NO
