 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input: n, a, and b. In this case, n is 8, a is 3, and b is 4.
The code calculates k by dividing n by the sum of a and b, which is 7. k is 1.1428571428571428.
The code then calculates p by taking the remainder of n divided by the sum of a and b, which is 1. p is 1.
The code then prints the result of k multiplied by a plus the minimum of p and a.
The minimum of p and a is 1, so the result is 1 + 1 = 2.
