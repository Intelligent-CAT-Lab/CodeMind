The variable N is initialized to 12.
The function `prime_factorization` is called with N as its argument.
The function returns a dictionary where the keys are the prime factors of N and the values are the powers of those prime factors.
The function first divides N by 2 as many times as possible, which leaves N equal to 3.
It then checks if N is divisible by any odd number between 3 and the square root of N (exclusive). It finds that N is divisible by 3 and 3, so it adds 3 to the dictionary with a value of 2.
Since N is not divisible by any other number, the function returns the dictionary `{3: 2}`.
The function `main` then prints the prime factorization of N in the format `N: prime1 prime2 ...`.
Since N is 12, the prime factorization is 2 x 2 x 3, so the output is `12: 2 2 3`.
<<<Output>>>
12: 2 2 3
