 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers N, K, and S as input. N is the number of elements in the array, K is the number of elements to be selected, and S is the sum of the elements in the array.
The code first checks if S is equal to 10**9. If it is, it means that the elements in the array are all equal to 10**9, and the answer is simply an array of K elements equal to 10**9, followed by (N - K) elements equal to 1.
If S is not equal to 10**9, the code initializes an array ans with K elements equal to S, followed by (N - K) elements equal to 10**9.
The code then prints the array ans.
<<<Output>>>
