 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four integers as input, A, B, C, and D.
It calculates the difference between the minimum of B and D and the maximum of A and C, and stores the result in the variable ans.
The condition is met when ans is greater than 0, which is the case when B is less than or equal to D and A is less than or equal to C.
In this case, B is 75, D is 100, A is 0 and C is 25.
Since B is less than or equal to D and A is less than or equal to C, the condition is met and ans is calculated as 75 - 25 = 50.
Since ans is greater than 0, the code prints 50.
<<<Output>>>
50
