The code takes two integers n and k as input, which are 1 and 1 respectively.
The variable l is initialized to 0 and r is initialized to k+1, which is 2.
The while loop runs until r-l>1, which is true in this case.
The variable m is calculated as the average of l and r, which is (0+2)/2=1.
The variable res is initialized to m, which is 1.
The variable t is also initialized to m, which is 1.
The for loop runs n-1 times, which is 0 times in this case.
The variable t is divided by 2 in each iteration, which results in t becoming 0.
The variable res is added to t in each iteration, which results in res becoming 1.
Since t becomes 0, the break statement is executed.
The if statement checks if res is greater than k, which is not true in this case.
The else statement is executed, which means that l is updated to m, which is 1.
The while loop continues to run until r-l>1, which is true in this case.
The variable m is calculated as the average of l and r, which is (1+2)/2=1.5.
The variable res is initialized to m, which is 1.5.
The variable t is also initialized to m, which is 1.5.
The for loop runs n-1 times, which is 0 times in this case.
The variable t is divided by 2 in each iteration, which results in t becoming 0.
The variable res is added to t in each iteration, which results in res becoming 1.5.
Since t becomes 0, the break statement is executed.
The if statement checks if res is greater than k, which is not true in this case.
The else statement is executed, which means that l is updated to m, which is 1.5.
The while loop continues to run until r-l>1, which is true in this case.
The variable m is calculated as the average of l and r, which is (1.5+2)/2=1.75.
The variable res is initialized to m, which is 1.75.
The variable t is also initialized to m, which is 1.75.
The for loop runs n-1 times, which is 0 times in this case.
The variable t is divided by 2 in each iteration, which results in t becoming 0.
The variable res is added to t in each iteration, which results in res becoming 1.75.
Since t becomes 0, the break statement is executed.
The if statement checks if res is greater than k, which is not true in this case.
The else statement is executed, which means that l is updated to m, which is 1.75.
The while loop continues to run until r-l>1, which is true in this case.
The variable m is calculated as the average of l and r, which is (1.75+2)/2=1.9375.
The variable res is initialized to m, which is 1.9375.
The variable t is also initialized to m, which is 1.9375.
