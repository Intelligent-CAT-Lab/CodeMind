 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first uses the `map()` function to convert the input string into a list of integers. The lambda function `lambda x: int(x)*2` is used to double each integer in the list. The resulting list is then assigned to the variable `[W, H, w, h, x, y]`.
The variables `X1`, `X2`, `Y1`, and `Y2` are then calculated based on the values of `W`, `H`, `w`, and `h`.
The variables `x1` and `y1` are then calculated by taking the maximum of the difference between the current number and the midpoint of the width and height, respectively, and the midpoint of the width and height, respectively.
The variables `x2` and `y2` are then calculated by taking the minimum of the difference between the current number and the midpoint of the width and height, respectively, and the midpoint of the width and height, respectively.
The variables `mx` and `my` are then calculated by taking the average of `x1` and `x2`, and `y1` and `y2`, respectively.
Finally, the code calculates the ratio of `my` to `mx` and prints it with 10 decimal places.
