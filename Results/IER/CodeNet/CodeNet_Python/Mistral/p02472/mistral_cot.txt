The code first takes input from the user, which is a string of two integers separated by a space. The input is split into two variables A and B using the split() method, which splits the string into a list of substrings based on a specified delimiter. In this case, the delimiter is a space.
The split() method returns a list of two strings, which are then converted to integers using the int() function and stored in the variables A and B.
The code then adds the values of A and B and prints the result.
