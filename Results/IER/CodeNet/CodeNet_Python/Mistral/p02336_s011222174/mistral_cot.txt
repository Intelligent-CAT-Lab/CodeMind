 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable K are initialized to 5 and 3, respectively.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to store the result of the calculation.
The code then creates an instance of the ModTools class with MAX = 10 and MOD = 10^9 + 7.
The class ModTools has a method nCr which calculates the number of combinations of n items taken r at a time.
The code uses the nCr method to calculate the number of combinations of N-1 items taken K-1 at a time.
The result is stored in the variable ans.
The code then prints the value of ans modulo 10^9 + 7.
