 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers n and m as input, which are 2 and 1 respectively.
The variable even is calculated by multiplying n by n-1 and dividing the result by 2. This gives us 1.
The variable odd is calculated by multiplying m by m-1 and dividing the result by 2. This gives us 0.
The code then adds the two variables and prints the result, which is 1 + 0 = 1.
<<<Output>>>
1
