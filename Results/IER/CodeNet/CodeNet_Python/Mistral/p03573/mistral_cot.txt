 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input, a, b and c, and assigns them to the variables a, b and c, respectively.
The code then checks if a is equal to b using the if statement. Since a is 5 and b is 7, the condition is not met.
The code then checks if b is equal to c using the elif statement. Since b is 7 and c is 5, the condition is not met.
Finally, the code checks if a is equal to c using the else statement. Since a is 5 and c is 5, the condition is met.
The code then prints the value of c, which is 5.
<<<Output>>>
5
