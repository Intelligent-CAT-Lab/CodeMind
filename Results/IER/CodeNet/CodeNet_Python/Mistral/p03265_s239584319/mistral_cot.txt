The code first imports the numpy library.
It then prompts the user to enter four integers, which are stored in the variables x1, y1, x2 and y2.
The variables p1 and p2 are then created as numpy arrays containing the values [x1, y1] and [x2, y2], respectively.
The variable v1 is calculated as the difference between p2 and p1.
The variable v2 is calculated as the 2D array [-v1[1],v1[0]].
The variable p3 is calculated as the sum of p2 and v2.
The variable p4 is calculated as the sum of p3 and (-v1).
Finally, the code prints the concatenation of the values in p3 and p4, separated by spaces.
