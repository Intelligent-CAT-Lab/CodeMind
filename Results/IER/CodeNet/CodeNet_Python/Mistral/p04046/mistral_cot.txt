 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the math module and defines some constants.
It then initializes four variables: H, W, A, and B, which are read from the input.
The code then defines a function f that takes two arguments, h and w, and returns the product of the factorial of h+w-2, the inverse factorial of h-1, and the inverse factorial of w-1, all modulo 10^9+7.
The code then initializes two variables, factorial and inv\_factorial, which are lists of integers that will be used to calculate the factorials and inverses of factorials.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to H+W+1. For each number i in this range, it calculates the factorial of i and stores it in factorial. It also calculates the inverse factorial of i and stores it in inv\_factorial.
The code then defines a variable answer, which is initialized to 0. It enters another loop that iterates from B+1 to W+1. For each number i in this range, it calculates the product of f(H-A, i) and f(A, W-i+1), both modulo 10^9+7, and adds the result to answer.
Finally, the code prints the final value of answer, which is 10.
