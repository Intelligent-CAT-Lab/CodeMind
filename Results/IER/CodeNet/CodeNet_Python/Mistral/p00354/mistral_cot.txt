 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input from the user using the `input()` function and stores it in the variable `X`.
It then uses the modulo operator `%` to find the remainder of `X` divided by 7. The remainder is stored in the variable `a`.
The code then uses an if-elif-else statement to check the value of `a` and print the corresponding day of the week.
If `a` is 2 or 3, it prints "wed" (which is the third element of the `Day` list).
If `a` is 4, 5 or 6, it prints "fri" (which is the sixth element of the `Day` list).
If `a` is 0 or 1, it prints "wed" (which is the third element of the `Day` list).

<<<Output>>>
wed
