 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module and sets the input variable to sys.stdin.readline.
It then reads the input line and splits it into N, A, B, C, and D using the map() function and the split() method.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to N-2 (inclusive), meaning it will consider all possible values of l and r.
For each value of l, it calculates the corresponding value of r using the formula D * i + A - C * (N - i - 1) + 1.
The code then checks if B is within the range [l, r]. If it is, it prints "YES" and breaks out of the loop.
After the loop finishes, if B is not within the range [l, r], it prints "NO".
<<<Output>>>
NO
