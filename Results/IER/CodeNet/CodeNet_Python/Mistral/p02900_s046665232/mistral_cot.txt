The code first takes two integers n and m as input, which are 12 and 18 respectively.
The variable g is then calculated as the greatest common divisor of n and m using the gcd function. The gcd function uses a while loop to repeatedly divide the larger number by the smaller number until the remainder is 0. In this case, g is 6.
The code then checks if g is equal to 1. If it is, it prints 1. Otherwise, it calls the factorization function with g as input. The factorization function takes an integer n as input and returns a list of pairs [i, cnt] where i is a factor of n and cnt is the number of times i divides n.
The factorization function first initializes an empty list arr. It then initializes a variable temp to n and iterates over all numbers from 2 to the square root of n (inclusive). For each number i in this range, it checks if temp is divisible by i. If it is, it initializes a variable cnt to 0 and repeatedly divides temp by i until the remainder is 0. It then appends the pair [i, cnt] to the list arr.
After the loop finishes, the function checks if temp is equal to 1. If it is, it appends the pair [temp, 1] to the list arr. If it is not, it means that temp is the product of all the factors of n, so it appends the pair [temp, 1] to the list arr.
Finally, the function returns the list arr.
For the input 12 18, the variable g is calculated as 6, which is not equal to 1. Therefore, the code calls the factorization function with g as input. The factorization function returns the list [[6, 2]].
The return value of the code is the length of this list plus 1, which is 2.
