 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N and variable K are initialized to 2 and 1, respectively.
The function main is called with these values.
The function main first initializes a 2D array C of size 5000x5000 with all elements set to 0. It then initializes a 2D array dp of size (N+10)x(N+10) with all elements set to 0.
The function then calculates the values of C and dp using a series of loops and mathematical operations.
The function then calculates the final answer using a series of mathematical operations and returns it.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code would be 1.
