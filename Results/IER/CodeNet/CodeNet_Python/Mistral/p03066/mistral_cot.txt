 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, N and X. N is the length of the string and X is the parity of the string. The code then iterates through all possible combinations of two characters in the string. For each combination, it calculates the distance between the two characters and checks if it is less than or equal to X. If it is, it calculates the number of ways to insert a zero between the two characters and adds it to the answer. If it is greater than X, it checks if the distance is odd and adds it to the answer if it is. If X is odd and the first character is zero, it does not add anything to the answer.
The code then calculates the answer by summing up all the possible combinations and taking the result modulo 998244353.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code for the input `3 3` would be 1.
This is because the only possible combination of two characters in the string is "01" and the distance between the two characters is 1, which is less than or equal to 3. The number of ways to insert a zero between the two characters is 1, so the answer is 1. Since X is odd and the first character is zero, the answer is not affected by this condition. Therefore, the return value of the code for the input `3 3` would be 1.
