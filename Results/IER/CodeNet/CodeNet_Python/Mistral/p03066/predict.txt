The return value of the code for the input `3 3` would be 1.
This is because the only possible combination of two characters in the string is "01" and the distance between the two characters is 1, which is less than or equal to 3. The number of ways to insert a zero between the two characters is 1, so the answer is 1. Since X is odd and the first character is zero, the answer is not affected by this condition. Therefore, the return value of the code for the input `3 3` would be 1.
