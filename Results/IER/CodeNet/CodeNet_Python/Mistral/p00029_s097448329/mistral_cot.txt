 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first prompts the user to enter a string using the `raw_input()` function and stores it in the variable `sent`.
The string is then split into a list of words using the `split()` method and stored in the variable `words`.
The code then iterates through each word in the list and checks if it has a higher frequency than the current maximum frequency. If it does, it updates the variable `freq_w` to the current word and updates the variable `max_f` to the frequency of the current word.
The code also checks if the current word has a higher length than the current maximum length. If it does, it updates the variable `len_w` to the current word and updates the variable `max_len` to the length of the current word.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the two variables `freq_w` and `len_w` in the format `(freq_w,len_w)`.
For the input `Thank you for your mail and your lectures`, the output would be `(you, 5)` as the word "you" appears twice and has a length of 3, which is the maximum length among all the words in the input.
<<<Output>>>
(you, 5)
