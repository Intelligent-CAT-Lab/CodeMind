 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes five integers as input, which are h1, m1, h2, m2 and k.
h1 and h2 represent the hours and m1 and m2 represent the minutes.
The input is then converted to integers and stored in the variables h1, m1, h2, m2 and k.
The code then calculates the value of r1 and r2 by multiplying h1 and h2 by 60 and adding m1 and m2, respectively.
The value of ans is then calculated by taking the maximum of 0 and the difference between r2 and r1 minus k.
Finally, the value of ans is printed to the console.
