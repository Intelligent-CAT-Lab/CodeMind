 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes two integers as input, a and b, using the `input().split()` method. The `map(int,input().split())` method converts the input string into two integers.
The code then checks if both a and b are less than 9 using the `if a<9 and b<9:` condition.
If both conditions are true, the code prints "Yay!". Otherwise, it prints ":(".
<<<Output>>>
Yay!
