The code takes two integers as input, a and b, and stores them in the variables a and b, respectively.
The code then calculates the sum of a and b and stores it in the variable sum.
The code then calculates the remainder of sum divided by 24 using the modulo operator (%).
The remainder is then printed to the console.
