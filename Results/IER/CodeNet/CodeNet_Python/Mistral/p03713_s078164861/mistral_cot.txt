 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, 3 and 5.
It then calculates the sum of the digits of each number and stores them in the variables sum1 and sum2.
The code then checks if sum1 is greater than or equal to sum2, which is True in this case.
If sum1 is greater than or equal to sum2, it prints the value of sum1, which is 8.
If sum1 is less than sum2, it prints the value of sum2, which is 5.
In this case, sum1 is greater than sum2, so it prints the value of sum1, which is 8.
<<<Output>>>
8
