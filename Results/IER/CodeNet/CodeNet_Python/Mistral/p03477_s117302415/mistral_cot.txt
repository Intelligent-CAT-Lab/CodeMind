 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four integer inputs, a, b, c, and d, separated by spaces.
It then compares the sum of a and b with the sum of c and d.
If the sum of a and b is greater than the sum of c and d, it prints "Left".
If the sum of a and b is less than the sum of c and d, it prints "Right".
If the sum of a and b is equal to the sum of c and d, it prints "Balanced".
<<<Output>>>
Balanced
