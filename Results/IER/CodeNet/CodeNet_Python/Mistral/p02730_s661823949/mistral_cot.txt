 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `check` takes a string `s` as input and checks if the first half of the string is equal to the second half of the string. If it is, it returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.
In the `main` function, the user is prompted to enter a string `s`. The function `check` is then called with this string as input.
If the function returns `True`, the function is called recursively with the first half of the string and the second half of the string. If both halves of the string are equal, the function prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".
If the function returns `False`, the function prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
