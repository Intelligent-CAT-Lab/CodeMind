<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an input from the user using the `input()` function and stores it in the variable `x`.
Then it converts the input from string to integer using the `int()` function and stores it in the variable `x`.
The variable `y` is then calculated by subtracting 30 from `x` and dividing the result by 2.
Finally, the value of `y` is printed using the `print()` function.
<<<Output>>>
