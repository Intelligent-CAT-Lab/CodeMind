 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable r, variable c, variable ar, variable ac, variable br, and variable bc are initialized to 4, 4, 0, 0, 3, and 3, respectively.
The variable maxans is initialized to 100000007, which will be used as the upper limit for the answer.
The code then calculates the minimum absolute difference between the row and column indices, and stores them in dr and dc, respectively.
The code then calculates the gain for the row and column, based on whether the absolute difference is equal to half the row or column length.
The code then calculates the answer by multiplying the factorial of the sum of row and column differences, divided by the product of the factorial of the row difference and the factorial of the column difference, multiplied by the gain for the row and column.
The condition is met when r is 4, c is 4, ar is 0, ac is 0, br is 3, and bc is 3.
After the calculation, the code prints the final answer, which is 120.
<<<Output>>>
120
