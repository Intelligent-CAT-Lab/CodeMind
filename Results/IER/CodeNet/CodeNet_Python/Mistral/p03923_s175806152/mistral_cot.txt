 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first reads two integers n and a from the input.
It then initializes a variable ans to 1e18, which is a very large number.
The code then enters a loop that iterates 40 times.
For each iteration, it calculates the maximum value of n that can be obtained by adding a number to the power of 2 raised to the current iteration.
It does this by calling the binaryOne function, which returns the maximum value of n that can be obtained by adding a number to the power of 2 raised to the current iteration.
It then calculates the minimum value of n that can be obtained by subtracting the maximum value of n that can be obtained by adding a number to the power of 2 raised to the current iteration from the maximum value of n that can be obtained by adding a number to the power of 2 raised to the current iteration.
It does this by calling the binaryTwo function, which returns the minimum value of n that can be obtained by subtracting the maximum value of n that can be obtained by adding a number to the power of 2 raised to the current iteration from the maximum value of n that can be obtained by adding a number to the power of 2 raised to the current iteration.
It then calculates the minimum value of ans that can be obtained by multiplying a by the current iteration and adding the maximum value of n that can be obtained by adding a number to the power of 2 raised to the current iteration.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 1e18.
<<<Output>>>
1e18
