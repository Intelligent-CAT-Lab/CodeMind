 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input: L, R, and d. In this case, L is 5, R is 10, and d is 2.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from L to R + 1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 5 to 12.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is divisible by d, which is 2 in this case. If it is, it increments the variable cnt. The condition is met when i is 5, 7, 9, 10 and 12.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of cnt, which is 5.
<<<Output>>>
5
