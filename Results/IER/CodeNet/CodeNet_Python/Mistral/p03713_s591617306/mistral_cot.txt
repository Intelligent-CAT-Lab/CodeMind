 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes two integers H and W as input, which are 3 and 5 respectively.
The code then calls four functions pat1, pat2, pat3 and pat4, passing H and W as arguments.
The function pat1 returns 0 if H is divisible by 3, otherwise it returns W. In this case, H is not divisible by 3, so pat1 returns 5.
The function pat2 returns 0 if W is divisible by 3, otherwise it returns H. In this case, W is not divisible by 3, so pat2 returns 3.
The function pat3 calculates the minimum of three possible sums: H*W, (H/2)*(W-1) and (H/2)*(W-2). It returns the minimum of these three sums. In this case, the minimum sum is H*W = 3*5 = 15.
The function pat4 calculates the minimum of three possible sums: W*H, (W/2)*(H-1) and (W/2)*(H-2). It returns the minimum of these three sums. In this case, the minimum sum is W*H = 5*3 = 15.
The code then compares the return values of all four functions and returns the minimum of them. In this case, the minimum of 5, 3 and 15 is 3.
