 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes three integers as input, a, b and c, using the `map()` function to convert the input string into integers.
The code then checks if c is greater than or equal to a and less than or equal to b using an if-else statement.
If the condition is true, the code prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
