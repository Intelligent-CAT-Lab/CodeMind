 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an input from the user using the `input()` function and stores it in the variable `x`.
The variable `a` is initialized to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates through each character in `x`.
If the character is 'x', the value of `a` is incremented by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code uses an if-else statement to check if the value of `a` is less than or equal to 7.
If it is, the code prints "YES", otherwise it prints "NO".
For the input "oxoxoxoxoxoxox", the value of `a` will be 10, which is greater than 7, so the code will print "NO".
<<<Output>>>
NO
