 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first reads input from the user using the `raw_input()` function and stores it in the variable `code`.
The `replace()` method is then used to remove any commas or periods from the input string.
The `split()` method is used to split the string into a list of individual words.
The code then creates an empty list called `list`.
A for loop is used to iterate over each word in the list of words.
For each word, the length of the word is checked to see if it is between 3 and 6 characters long. If it is, the word is added to the `list` using the `append()` method.
Another for loop is then used to iterate over the `list` and print each word.
