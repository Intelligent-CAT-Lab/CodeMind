<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, a and b, and stores them in the variables a and b, respectively.
The variable x is then calculated by taking the average of a and b, which is (a+b)//2.
The // operator performs an integer division, which means that the result is rounded down to the nearest integer.
The final value of x is then printed to the console.
<<<Output>>>
