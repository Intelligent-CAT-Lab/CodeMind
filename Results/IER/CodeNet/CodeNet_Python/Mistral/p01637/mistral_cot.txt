 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first defines a function `f(a,b,c)` that takes three arguments and returns `True` if `a*b` is less than 100*c, and `False` otherwise.
The code then reads in five integers from the user, which are stored in the variables `m`, `rd`, `rr`, `cd`, and `cr`.
The code calculates the value of `ex` by multiplying `cd` by 100 and dividing by `rd`, and then checks if `f(ex,rd,cd)` is `True`. If it is, `ex` is incremented by 1.
The code calculates the value of `ey` by multiplying `cr` by 100 and dividing by `rr`, and then checks if `f(ey,rr,cr)` is `True`. If it is, `ey` is incremented by 1.
Finally, the code subtracts `ex` and `ey` from `m`, and returns the result if it is greater than or equal to 0. If it is not, the code returns -1.
<<<Output>>>
-1
