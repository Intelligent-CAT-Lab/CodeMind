 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes two integers N and M as input, separated by a space. N is 2 and M is 0.
The variable a is initialized as an empty list.
The code then enters a loop that iterates M times. Since M is 0, the loop does not execute.
The variable num is initialized as N - M, which is 2 - 0 = 2.
The while loop runs until num is 0.
Inside the loop, ans is incremented by 1 and num is decremented by 1.
After the loop finishes, ans is 2 and num is 0.
The final value of ans - 1 is 1.
