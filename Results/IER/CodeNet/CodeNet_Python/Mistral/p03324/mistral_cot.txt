 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs, D and N, and converts them to integers using the `map()` function.
The code then checks if N is equal to 100. If it is, it calculates the result as 100 raised to the power of D multiplied by N. If it is not, it calculates the result as 100 raised to the power of D multiplied by N plus 1.
The final result is then printed.
