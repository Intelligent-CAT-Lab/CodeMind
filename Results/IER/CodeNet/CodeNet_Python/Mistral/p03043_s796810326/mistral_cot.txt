 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes two inputs, n and k, separated by a space. It then converts these inputs to integers using the `int()` function.
The variable `score` is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the final score.
The variable `r` is set to 1/n, which is 0.1 in this case.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider each possible roll of the dice.
For each roll, it initializes a counter to 0 and a multiplier to the roll value.
It then enters a while loop that continues until the multiplier is greater than or equal to k.
Inside the while loop, it multiplies the multiplier by 2 and increments the counter.
After the while loop finishes, it adds the result of the multiplier raised to the power of the counter, multiplied by r, to the score.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of score, which is 0.1464067407370955.
<<<Output>>>
0.1464067407370955
