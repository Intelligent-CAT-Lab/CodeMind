 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input from the user using the `input()` function and stores it in the variable `n`.
Then it uses the `//` operator to perform integer division between `n-1` and 2.
The `//` operator returns the floor division of the left operand by the right operand. In this case, it returns the largest integer that is less than or equal to the right operand.
Since `n-1` is 3 and 2 is 2, the result of the division is 1.
