 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input N, which is 20 in this case.
It initializes an empty list d of length N.
It initializes a variable r to 100, which is the maximum value of c.
It initializes a variable ii to 0, which will be used to calculate the value of c.
It then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to r (inclusive), meaning it will consider values of c from 1 to 100.
For each value of c in this range, it calculates the value of ii and s, and then calculates the value of c using the formula c = ii + s \* j.
It then enters another loop that iterates from 1 to j (inclusive), meaning it will consider values of k from 1 to j.
For each value of k in this range, it calculates the value of c using the formula c = ii + s \* j + 2\* k - 1.
It then checks if c is less than or equal to N. If it is, it adds the value of l to the corresponding element of the list d. The value of l is 3 if i == j, 1 if i == k, and 3 if j == k.
After the loops finish, the code prints the list d.
