 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes five inputs, A, B, C, X, and Y, and stores them in variables of the same names.
The variable mi is set to the minimum of X and Y.
The variable a is set to the product of A and X plus the product of B and Y.
The variable b is set to the product of mi and C multiplied by 2 plus the product of A and (X - mi) plus the product of B and (Y - mi).
The variable c is set to the product of the maximum of X and Y and C multiplied by 2.
Finally, the code prints the minimum of a, b, and c.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is 1600.
