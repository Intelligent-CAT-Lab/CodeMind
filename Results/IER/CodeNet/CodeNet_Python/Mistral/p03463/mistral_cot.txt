 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user, which is a string of three integers separated by spaces. The input is split using the `split()` method and the resulting list is assigned to the variable `a,b,c`.
The `abs()` function is used to get the absolute value of the difference between `b` and `c`. The `%` operator is used to check if the absolute difference is even or odd.
If the absolute difference is even, the code prints "Alice". Otherwise, it prints "Borys".
<<<Output>>>
Alice
