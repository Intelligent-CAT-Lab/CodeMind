 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first defines two functions: `is_collect` and `check`.
The `is_collect` function takes a fixed number as input and calculates a score based on the sum of its digits and their positions. It returns True if the score is valid and False otherwise.
The `check` function takes a string as input, finds the index of the "?" character, and iterates over all possible digits to fill in the missing digit. For each digit, it checks if the resulting fixed number is valid using the `is_collect` function. If it finds a valid fixed number, it returns the index of the missing digit. If it doesn't find any valid fixed number, it returns None.
The main program reads input from the user, reverses it, and passes it to the `check` function. If the function returns a valid index, it prints that index. Otherwise, it prints "MULTIPLE".
For the input `?12345678901`, the `check` function will iterate over all possible digits to fill in the missing digit. It will check if the resulting fixed number is valid using the `is_collect` function. Since the sum of digits of `12345678901` is 36, and the sum of digits of any other number in the range [2, 5] is not divisible by 11, the `is_collect` function will return False for all other numbers. Therefore, the `check` function will not find any valid fixed number and will return None.
