<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an input string `a` using the `input()` function.
It then counts the number of occurrences of the character "+" in the string using the `count()` method and stores it in the variable `e`.
It counts the number of occurrences of the character "-" in the string using the `count()` method and stores it in the variable `f`.
Finally, it subtracts the number of occurrences of "-" from the number of occurrences of "+" and prints the result.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is 3, as there are 3 occurrences of "+" and 0 occurrences of "-" in the input string `+-++`.
