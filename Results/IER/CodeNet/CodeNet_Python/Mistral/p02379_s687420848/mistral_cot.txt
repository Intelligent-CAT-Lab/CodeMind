 <<<Analysis>>>
The code imports the math module, which provides access to mathematical functions.
The input is a list of four floating-point numbers, which are assigned to the variables x1, y1, x2 and y2.
The code calculates the distance between the points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) using the distance formula:
dist = sqrt((x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2)
The distance is then printed using the format string "%.6f", which rounds the result to 6 decimal places.
