 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input n using the `input()` function.
It then checks if n is equal to 0. If it is, it prints 0 and exits the program using the `exit()` function.
If n is not equal to 0, it initializes an empty string ans.
The code then enters a loop that iterates 50 times. For each iteration, it checks if n is divisible by 2 raised to the power of i+1, where i is the current iteration number.
If n is divisible, it subtracts 2 raised to the power of i from n and appends a 0 to the beginning of ans.
If n is not divisible, it subtracts 2 raised to the power of i from n and appends a 1 to the beginning of ans.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if the first character of ans is 0. If it is, it prints the substring of ans starting from the second character.
If the first character of ans is not 0, it prints ans.
<<<Output>>>
-9
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
The return value of the code is -9.
