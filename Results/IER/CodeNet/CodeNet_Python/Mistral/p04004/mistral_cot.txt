The variable N, variable M, and variable K are initialized to 1, 1, and 1, respectively.
The variable U is initialized to 10^6.
The variable MOD is initialized to 10^9 + 7.
The function cumprod is used to calculate the cumulative product of an array.
The function make_fact is used to calculate the factorial of a number.
The function make_power is used to calculate the power of a number.
The variable power2, power2_inv, power3, and power3_inv are calculated using the make_power function.
The variable fact and fact_inv are calculated using the make_fact function.
The variable x is initialized to zeros and then filled with values using the formula (-1)^i * (power2[i] * power3_inv[K+1:N+M+K] % MOD) * (fact[K+1:N+M+K] * fact_inv[K] % MOD * fact_inv[1:N+M] % MOD) % MOD.
The variable coef is calculated using the formula (fact[N-1:N+M] * fact_inv[:M+1] % MOD * fact_inv[N-1] % MOD) * (power3[K:K+M+1][::-1] % MOD).
The variable answer is calculated using the formula (coef * x[N-1:N+M] % MOD).sum() % MOD.
