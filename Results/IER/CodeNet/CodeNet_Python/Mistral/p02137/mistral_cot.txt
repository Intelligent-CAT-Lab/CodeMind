 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an input from the user using the `input()` function. The input is then converted to an integer using the `int()` function.
The integer is then divided by 500 using the `//` operator, which performs an integer division. The result is 11.
The result is then multiplied by 500 using the `*` operator, which gives 5500.
Finally, the result is printed using the `print()` function.
<<<Output>>>
5500
