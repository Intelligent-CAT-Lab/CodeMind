 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes a list of integers as input, which is split by spaces and converted to a list of integers using the `map()` function. The resulting list is stored in the variable `n`.
The code then prints the product of the first two elements of the list (`n[0]*n[1]`) and the sum of the first two elements of the list (`(n[0]+n[1])*2`).
For the input `3 5`, the first two elements of the list are 3 and 5, so the product is 3*5 = 15 and the sum is 3+5 = 8. The sum of 8 multiplied by 2 is 16.
<<<Output>>>
15 16
