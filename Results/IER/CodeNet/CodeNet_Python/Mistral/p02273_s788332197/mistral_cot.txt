 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three arguments: p1, p2, and n. p1 and p2 are tuples representing the coordinates of the first and second points of the triangle, respectively. n is an integer representing the number of iterations to perform.
The function koch is a recursive function that takes in the coordinates of the first and second points of the triangle, as well as the number of iterations to perform. It returns a list of tuples representing the coordinates of the vertices of the triangle after n iterations.
The function first checks if n is equal to 0. If it is, it returns a list containing only the first and second points of the triangle.
If n is not equal to 0, the function calculates the coordinates of the midpoint of the triangle using the formula X = (x + a + r3(b - y))/2 and Y = (r3(x - a) + y + b)/2.
It then recursively calls the koch function with the midpoint and the first and second points of the triangle as arguments, and appends the result to a list.
Finally, it returns the list of vertices after n iterations.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is a list of tuples representing the coordinates of the vertices of the triangle after n iterations. The output of the code depends on the value of n.
For example, if n is 1, the output will be a list containing the first and second points of the triangle. If n is 2, the output will be a list containing the first point, the midpoint, and the second point of the triangle. If n is 3, the output will be a list containing the first point, the first midpoint, the second midpoint, and the second point of the triangle.
If n is not an integer, the function will raise a ValueError.
