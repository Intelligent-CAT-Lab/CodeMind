The return value of the code is a list of tuples representing the coordinates of the vertices of the triangle after n iterations. The output of the code depends on the value of n.
For example, if n is 1, the output will be a list containing the first and second points of the triangle. If n is 2, the output will be a list containing the first point, the midpoint, and the second point of the triangle. If n is 3, the output will be a list containing the first point, the first midpoint, the second midpoint, and the second point of the triangle.
If n is not an integer, the function will raise a ValueError.
