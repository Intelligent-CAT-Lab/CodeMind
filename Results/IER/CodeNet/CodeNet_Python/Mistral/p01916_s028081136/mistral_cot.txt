 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an input string `s` from the user.
It then initializes a list `cnt` of length 26, with all elements set to 0.
The code then iterates over each character in the input string `s`. For each character, it converts it to its corresponding ASCII value using the `ord()` function, and subtracts the ASCII value of 'a' to get the index of the character in the alphabet. It then increments the corresponding element in the `cnt` list by 1.
The code then initializes a variable `odd` to 0, which will be used to count the number of odd elements in the `cnt` list.
The code then iterates over each element in the `cnt` list. If an element is odd, it increments the `odd` variable by 1.
Finally, the code shifts the `odd` variable to the right by 1 using bitwise shift operator `>>` and prints the result.
