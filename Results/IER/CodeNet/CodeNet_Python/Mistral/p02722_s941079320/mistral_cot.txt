 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized to 6.
The function make\_divisors is called twice, once for N-1 and once for N.
The function make\_divisors takes an integer n as input and returns a list of its divisors. It does this by iterating from 1 to the square root of n, checking if n is divisible by each number in that range. If it is, it adds that number to the list of divisors and also adds n//i (the quotient of n divided by i) to the list if i is not equal to n//i.
The function then returns the list of divisors.
The code then iterates through the list of divisors for N and N-1, and for each divisor, it checks if N is divisible by that divisor. If it is, it adds the divisor to the list Nod.
Finally, the code prints the length of Nod, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
