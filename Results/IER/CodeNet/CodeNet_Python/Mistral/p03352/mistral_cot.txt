 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input `x` from the user. In this case, `x` is 10.
The variable `ans` is initialized to 1, which will be used to store the maximum value found.
The code then enters a loop that iterates `x` times. For each iteration, it enters another loop that iterates from 2 to `x` (inclusive).
For each iteration of the inner loop, it checks if `b**p` is less than or equal to `x`. If it is, it updates the value of `ans` to be the maximum of `ans` and `b**p`. If it is not, it breaks out of the inner loop.
After the inner loop finishes, the code prints the final value of `ans`, which is 1024.
<<<Output>>>
1024
