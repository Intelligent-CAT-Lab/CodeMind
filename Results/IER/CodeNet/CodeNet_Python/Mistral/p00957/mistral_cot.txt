 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the `lru_cache` function from the `functools` module.
The input is then read from the user using the `input()` function and split into two integers `l` and `k` using the `split()` method.
The `rec` function is defined with two arguments `i` and `isBlack`. It takes an integer `i` and a boolean `isBlack` as input.
The function checks if `i` is less than 0, in which case it returns 0. If `i` is 0, it returns 1 if `isBlack` is False, otherwise it returns 0.
If `isBlack` is True, it means the top is black, so it returns the sum of `rec(i-1, False)` and `rec(i-k, False)`.
If `isBlack` is False, it means the top is white, so it returns the sum of `rec(i-1, True)`.
The `sum` function is then used to sum the result of `rec(i,True)` for all values of `i` from 1 to `l`.
The final value of `ans` is the sum of the number of ways to reach the bottom of the stack with a black top and a white top.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is 10.
