 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes two integers as input, separated by a space. In this case, the input is `3 2`.
The code then uses the `divmod()` function to perform integer division and remainder operations on the two input numbers. The result of the division is stored in the variable `d` and the remainder is stored in the variable `r`.
The code then calculates the quotient of the two input numbers using the `/` operator and stores it in the variable `f`.
Finally, the code uses the `format()` method to print the values of `d`, `r`, and `f` in a formatted string. The `:.5f` format specifier is used to display the floating-point number `f` with 5 decimal places.
<<<Output>>>
0 0 1.5
