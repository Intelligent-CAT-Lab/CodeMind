 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user, which is a string of three integers separated by spaces. The input is split using the `split()` method, which returns a list of the individual words in the string.
The list comprehension `[int(i) for i in input().split()]` is used to convert the input string into a list of integers. The list is stored in the variable `a`.
The `sorted()` function is then used to sort the list in ascending order. The sorted list is stored back in the variable `a`.
Finally, the code calculates the difference between the second and first elements of the sorted list, and the difference between the third and second elements of the sorted list. It then adds these two differences together and prints the result.
