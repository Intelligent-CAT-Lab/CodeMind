 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers N and K as input. N is the number of stones and K is the number of stones that can be discarded in one move. The code uses dynamic programming to find the number of ways to discard K stones from the N stones.

The code first initializes an array lis of size 3300 with all elements set to 0. It then iterates through the range of N in reverse order. For each i, it initializes a new array nlis of size 3300 with all elements set to 0.

The code then iterates through the range of K+1 for j. For each j, it iterates through the range of 3300 for last. If i < j, it adds the number of ways to discard j stones from the remaining i stones to nlis[last]. If (last+j)//i + last < 3300, it adds the number of ways to discard j stones from the remaining i stones to nlis[last+(last+j)//i].

After the inner loop finishes, the code updates the lis array with the values from nlis.

Finally, the code calculates the answer by multiplying K(K+1)/2 by the number of ways to discard K stones from N stones, which is calculated using the formula (K+1)^N-1/(K+1-1).

The code then iterates through the range of 3300 for i and subtracts the number of ways to discard i stones from the answer.

<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code for input 2 2 would be 11.
