 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input from the user and stores it in the variable K.
The code then performs two arithmetic operations on K:
1. K // 2: This operation divides K by 2 and returns the floor of the division result.
2. K % 2: This operation returns the remainder when K is divided by 2.
The code then concatenates the result of these two operations using the addition operator (+) and the multiplication operator (*).
The final expression is (K // 2+ K % 2) * (K // 2), which simplifies to (K + 1) * (K // 2).
<<<Output>>>
For K = 3, the code evaluates the expression as follows:
(3 + 1) * (3 // 2) = 4 * 1.5 = 6
Therefore, the return value of the code for K = 3 is 6.
<<<Output>>>
6
