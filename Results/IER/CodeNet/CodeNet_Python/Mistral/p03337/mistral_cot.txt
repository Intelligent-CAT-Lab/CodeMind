<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, a and b, and uses the `map()` function to convert the input string into integers.
The `input()` function reads a line of text from the standard input and returns it as a string. The `split()` method is then called on this string to split it into a list of words, which are then converted to integers using the `int()` function.
The `map()` function takes two arguments: the first is the function to be applied to each element of the input iterable, and the second is the input iterable. In this case, the function is `int()`, which converts each element of the input list to an integer.
The `max()` function is then called with three arguments: a+b, a-b and a*b. This function returns the largest of the three arguments.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is 11, which is the largest of the three arguments (a+b, a-b and a*b) when a=3 and b=1.
