 <<<Analysis>>>
The function resolve() takes no arguments and returns nothing.
It starts by reading two integers a and b from the user, which are 5 and 3 respectively.
It then uses the max() function to compare the three possible values: 2*a-1, a+b and 2*b-1.
The three possible values are:
- 2*a-1 = 2*5-1 = 9
- a+b = 5+3 = 8
- 2*b-1 = 2*3-1 = 5
The max() function returns the largest of these three values, which is 9.
<<<Output>>>
9
