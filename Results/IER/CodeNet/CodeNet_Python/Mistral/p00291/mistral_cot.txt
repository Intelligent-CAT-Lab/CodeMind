 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes six integers as input, c1, c5, c10, c50, c100, and c500.
It then calculates the sum of these integers using the formula:
sum = c1 + c5*5 + c10*10 + c50*50 + c100*100 + c500*500
The final value of sum is 1000.
The code then checks if sum is greater than or equal to 1000. Since it is, the code returns 1.
