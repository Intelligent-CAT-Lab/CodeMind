The code first takes two integers as input, a and b, using the `input().split()` method. The input is split by spaces and the resulting list is converted to integers using the `map()` function.
The variable `lis` is a list of length 1000, initialized with zeros.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 999 (inclusive), meaning it will calculate the value of `lis[i]` for each i in this range.
For each i, it calculates the value of `lis[i]` using the formula `(i+2)*(i+1)//2`.
The code then checks if the difference between `lis[i]` and `lis[i-1]` is equal to `b-a`. If it is, it prints the difference between `lis[i]` and `b`, and breaks out of the loop.
The condition is met when i is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99.
The condition is met when i is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40,
