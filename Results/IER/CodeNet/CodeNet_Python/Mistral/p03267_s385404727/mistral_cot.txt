 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first reads an integer L from standard input.
It then calculates the number of bits needed to represent L using the formula floor(log2(L)) + 1.
The number of bits needed is 4 in this case.
The code then creates a list of edges for a complete binary tree with L nodes.
The edges are created by appending pairs of nodes and their weight, which is 0 for edges between left and right children and 2^(i-1) for edges between parent and child nodes.
The code then calculates the number of edges needed for the tree by multiplying the number of bits needed by 2.
The number of edges needed is 8 in this case.
The code then creates the edges for the tree by appending pairs of nodes and their weight.
The code then calculates the number of nodes needed for the tree by adding 1 to the number of bits needed.
The number of nodes needed is 5 in this case.
The code then calculates the number of edges needed for the tree by multiplying the number of nodes needed by 2.
The number of edges needed is 10 in this case.
The code then creates the edges for the tree by appending pairs of nodes and their weight.
The code then yields the number of nodes and edges needed for the tree.
The number of nodes needed is 5 and the number of edges needed is 10.
