<<<Analysis>>>
The code first initializes two lists: S and C.
The list S is initialized by reading input from the user, which is "C0DEFESTIVAL2O16".
The list C is initialized with the string "CODEFESTIVAL2016".
The variable cnt is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of differences between S and C.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to the length of C (inclusive), meaning it will compare each character of C with the corresponding character of S.
For each character i in this range, it checks if S[i] is equal to C[i]. If it is not, it increments cnt by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of cnt, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
