 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input n from the user.
It then checks if n is even or odd by checking if n%2 is equal to 0 or not.
If n is even, it calculates the answer ans by dividing n by 2 and then dividing the result by n again. This effectively calculates the average of n and 1.
If n is odd, it calculates the answer ans by dividing (n+1) by 2 and then dividing the result by n again. This effectively calculates the average of n and (n+1).
Finally, the code prints the value of ans.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code for n = 4 is 3.0.
