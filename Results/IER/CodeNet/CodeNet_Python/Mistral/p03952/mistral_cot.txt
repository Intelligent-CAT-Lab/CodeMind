 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes two integers as input, N and x. In this case, N is 4 and x is 4.
The code then checks if x is equal to 1 or 2*N-1. Since x is 4, it is not equal to 1 or 2*N-1, so the code moves on to the next condition.
The code then checks if x is greater than N. Since x is 4 and N is 4, this condition is not met.
The code then creates a list ans by generating all the numbers from 2*N-1 to N+x-1, in descending order. Since N is 4 and x is 4, ans will be [3, 2, 1].
Since x is not greater than N, the code does not need to reverse the order of the list.
Finally, the code prints "Yes" and then prints each element of the list ans.
