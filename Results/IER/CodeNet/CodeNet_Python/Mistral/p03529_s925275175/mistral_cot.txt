 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N and variable K are initialized to 2 and 2, respectively.
The function main is called with these values as arguments.
The function main first initializes an array power with all elements set to 1. It then iterates from 1 to N+10 and for each element, it multiplies the previous element by (K+1) and takes the result modulo MOD.
The function then calculates the final result using the formula K \* (K+1) // 2 \* N \* power[N-1] % MOD.
The function then initializes an array dp with all elements set to 1. It then iterates from N to 0 and for each element, it calculates the new dp array using the formula newdp[t + x] += dp[t].
The final result is returned by the function main.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is 10.
