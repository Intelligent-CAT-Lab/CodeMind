 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first reads two integers A and B from the input.
It then initializes an empty list X, which will be used to store a 2D array of characters.
The code then enters a loop that iterates 100 times. For each iteration, it creates a list of 100 characters, where each character is either "." or "#" depending on its position in the row.
The first 50 characters are "#" and the remaining 50 characters are ".".
The list is then appended to X.
The code then calculates the dimensions of the final output based on the values of A and B.
It then enters two nested loops that iterate over the rows and columns of the output array.
For each row and column, it sets the corresponding element in X to either "." or "#" depending on its position in the row and column.
Finally, the code prints the final output array X.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is the output array X, which is a 2D array of 100 characters.
The output array is:
```
.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#
