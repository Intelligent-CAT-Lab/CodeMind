 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable X, and variable D are initialized to 3, 4, and 2, respectively.
The code then checks if D is 0, which is not the case in this input.
The code then checks if D is negative, which is not the case in this input.
The code then initializes a defaultdict called memo, which will be used to store the results of previous calculations.
The code then iterates from 0 to N+1, and for each k, it calculates the left and right values of the range.
The left value is k*X + (k-1)*k//2*D, and the right value is k*X + (N-k+N-1)*k//2*D.
The code then appends the pair (left, right) to the memo dictionary for the remainder of D.
The code then iterates over the memo dictionary and sorts the pairs in ascending order.
The code then iterates over the sorted pairs and calculates the difference between the left and right values, and adds it to the answer variable ans.
The code then prints the final value of ans.
