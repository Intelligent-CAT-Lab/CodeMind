 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes 6 integers as input, a, b, c, d, e and f.
It initializes two variables, maxsugar and maxwater, to 0.
The code then enters a nested loop that iterates 31 times for i, 31 times for j and 3001 times for k.
For each iteration, it calculates the water and sugar values based on the input values and the current values of i, j and k.
It then checks if the sum of water and sugar is greater than f, if sugar is greater than the product of a, b, e and i, j multiplied by c, k, it continues to the next iteration.
If the condition is not met, it calculates the sugar value using the formula sugar = c*k.
It then checks if the sum of 100*maxsugar*(water+sugar) is less than 100*sugar*(maxsugar+maxwater), if it is, it updates the values of maxsugar and maxwater.
After the loops finish, the code prints the sum of maxsugar and maxwater, and the value of maxsugar.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code based on the input `1 2 10 20 15 200` is 105 15.
