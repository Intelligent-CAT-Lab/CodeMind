 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, a and b, which are 4 and 10, respectively.
The variable total is initialized to 1, which will be used to keep track of the current total value.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to store the final answer.
The code enters a while loop that continues as long as total is less than b.
Inside the loop, the code increments ans by 1 and then updates total by adding a-1 to it. This means that total is incremented by 1 for each iteration of the loop.
Since total starts at 1 and a-1 is always 0, the loop will continue until total is equal to b, which is 10.
When the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 9.
<<<Output>>>
9
