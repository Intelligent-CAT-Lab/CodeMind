 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers n and m as input, separated by a space.
The code first checks if n and m are equal to 1. If they are, it prints 1.
If n and m are not equal to 1, it checks which of them is smaller. If it is 1, it prints the difference between n and m, which is n-2.
If neither of the above conditions is met, it prints the product of n-2 and m-2.
<<<Output>>>
