 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first prompts the user to enter a number using the `input()` function and stores it in the variable `r`.
The variable `r` is then multiplied by itself twice (`r * r`) and the result is multiplied by 3 (`3 * r * r`).
The final value of the expression is then printed to the console using the `print()` function.
