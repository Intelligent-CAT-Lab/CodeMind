 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four integer inputs, sx, sy, tx, and ty, and assigns them to variables sx, sy, tx, and ty, respectively.
The code then calculates the difference between tx and sx and assigns it to x, and the difference between ty and sy and assigns it to y.
The code then initializes the variable order to "L" and performs a series of operations to manipulate the order string.
First, it adds "U" to the order string for y+1 times, then adds "R" for x+1 times, and finally adds "D".
Then, it adds "R" to the order string, followed by "D" for y+1 times, "L" for x+1 times, and "U".
Then, it adds "U" for y times, "R" for x times, "D" for y times, and "L" for x times.
Finally, it prints the order string.
