 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads input from the standard input (sys.stdin) and processes each line of input.
For each line, it splits the line into two parts using the split() method, which returns a list of the elements in the line.
The first element is stored in the variable a and the second element is stored in the variable b.
The code then adds the values of a and b and stores the result in the variable temp.
The code then calculates the square root of temp using the math.sqrt() function and stores the result in the variable sqrt_temp.
The code then checks if the square of the square root of temp is equal to temp. If it is, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
For the input `1 21`, the code first splits the line into two parts, `1` and `21`.
It then adds the values of a and b, which gives `1 + 21 = 22`.
The code then calculates the square root of 22 using the math.sqrt() function, which gives `4.699999999999999`.
The code then checks if the square of the square root of 22 is equal to 22. Since 4.699999999999999 * 4.699999999999999 = 22.000000000000001, the condition is met and the code prints "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
