 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input, a, b and c, and stores them in the variables a, b and c, respectively.
The code then checks if the condition a<c<b or a>c>b is met.
If the condition is met, the code prints 'Yes'. Otherwise, it prints 'No'.
In this case, a is 3, c is 5 and b is 8.
Since 3<5<8 and 3>5>8, the condition is not met.
Therefore, the code prints 'No'.
<<<Output>>>
No
