 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an input from the user using the `input()` function and stores it in the variable `a`.
It then checks if the length of the input is less than 6 characters. If it is, it prints "INVALID".
If the length is greater than or equal to 6, it initializes three variables `m`, `n`, and `l` to 0.
It then iterates through each character in the input using a for loop and checks if the character is a digit (48-57), a lowercase letter (97-122) or an uppercase letter (65-90).
If the character is a digit, it increments `m`. If it is a lowercase letter, it increments `n`. If it is an uppercase letter, it increments `l`.
After the loop finishes, it checks if any of the three variables are equal to 0. If any of them are, it prints "INVALID".
If none of them are, it prints "VALID".
