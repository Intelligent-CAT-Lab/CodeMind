<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string input from the user using the `input()` function and stores it in the variable `s`.
The code then checks the last character of the string using the `[-1]` index. If the last character is 's', it prints the string followed by the word "es". Otherwise, it prints the string followed by the word "s".
In the case of the input "apple", the last character is not 's', so the code prints "apples".
<<<Output>>>
apples
