 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input n, which is 4 in this case.
It then initializes an empty list s.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 2^n (inclusive), which is 16 in this case.
For each number i in this range, it appends a string to s that consists of the number i followed by a colon.
Then, it enters another loop that iterates from 0 to n (inclusive), which is 4 in this case.
For each number j in this range, it checks if i has a 1 in the jth position. If it does, it appends the number j to the string.
Finally, it appends a newline character to the string.
After both loops finish, the code joins all the strings in s using the join() method and prints the result.
The output of the code is:
