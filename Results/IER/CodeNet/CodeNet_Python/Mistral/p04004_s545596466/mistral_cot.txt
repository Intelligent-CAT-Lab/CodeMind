The variable N, variable M, and variable K are initialized to 1, 1, and 1, respectively.
The code then calculates the values of various arrays and variables using numpy functions.
The variable A is initialized to an array of size N+M, where all elements are initialized to 0.
The code then calculates the values of A using various mathematical operations and numpy functions.
The variable comb is calculated as the product of fact[N-1:N+M], fact_inv[:M+1], and fact_inv[N-1], all modulo MOD.
The final answer is calculated as the sum of comb, pow3[K+M:K-1:-1], and A[N-1:N+M], all modulo MOD.
