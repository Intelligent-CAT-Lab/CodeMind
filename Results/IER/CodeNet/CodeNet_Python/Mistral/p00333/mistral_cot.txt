 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the math module and uses the gcd function to find the greatest common divisor of W and H.
The variables W, H and C are initialized to 10, 20 and 5, respectively.
The code then calculates the product of W, H and C, and divides it by the square of the greatest common divisor of W and H.
The result is 100.
<<<Output>>>
100
