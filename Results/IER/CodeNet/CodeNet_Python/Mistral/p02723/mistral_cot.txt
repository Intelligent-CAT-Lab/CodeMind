 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an input string `s` using the `input()` function.
It then checks if the third and fourth characters of the string are equal and if the fifth and sixth characters are also equal.
If both conditions are true, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
For the input "sippuu", the third and fourth characters are "p" and "p", and the fifth and sixth characters are "u" and "u". Since both conditions are true, the code prints "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
