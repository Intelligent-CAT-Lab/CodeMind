 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first reads the input string `01B0` and converts it to a list of characters using the `list()` function.
It then initializes an empty deque called `ans`.
The code then iterates over each character in the list of characters.
If the character is "B", the code checks if the deque is empty. If it is, it continues to the next iteration. Otherwise, it removes the last element from the deque using the `pop()` method.
If the character is not "B", the code adds the character to the deque using the `append()` method.
After the loop finishes, the code converts the deque back to a string using the `join()` method and prints it.
