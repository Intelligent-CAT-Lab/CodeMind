 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the math module to use the factorial function.
It then defines three functions: P, C and H.
The P function calculates the number of ways to choose r items from a set of n items, by dividing the factorial of n by the factorial of n-r.
The C function calculates the number of ways to choose r items from a set of n items, by dividing the number of ways to choose r items from a set of n items by the factorial of r.
The H function calculates the number of ways to choose r items from a set of n items, by dividing the number of ways to choose r items from a set of n items by the factorial of r.
The code then reads two integers n and k from the input, and calculates the number of ways to choose k items from a set of n items using the C function.
If n is less than k, the result is the number of ways to choose k items from a set of n items using the C function, modulo MOD.
If n is greater than k, the result is 0.
If n is equal to k, the result is 1.
