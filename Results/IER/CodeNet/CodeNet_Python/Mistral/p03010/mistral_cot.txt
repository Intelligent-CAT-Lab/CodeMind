 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the necessary modules: itertools, sys and lambda.
It sets the recursion limit to 10^6 to avoid stack overflow.
The code defines several lambda functions: int1, p2D, II, MI, LI, LLI, SI.
The main function is defined, which takes an integer n as input.
The code then initializes the base list with the values [1, 2, 4, 7, 12, 20, 29, 38, 52, 73].
The ans list is initialized with a list of lists, where each inner list has n elements and all elements are initialized to 0.
The ans[1][0] and ans[0][1] are set to 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 3 to n.
For each value vn, it initializes mx to 0 and iterates over all permutations of range(vn-1).
For each permutation, it calculates the sum of the elements in the corresponding row of the ans list.
If the sum is greater than mx, it updates mx.
The code then updates the values in the ans list based on the mx value.
Finally, the code prints the values in the ans list.
<<<Output>>>
[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
