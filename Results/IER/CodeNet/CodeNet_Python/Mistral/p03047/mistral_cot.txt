 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers N and K as input.
It then calculates the difference between N and K, and prints the result.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code based on the input `3 2` would be `1`.

The calculation is as follows:
```
N - (K - 1) = 3 - (2 - 1) = 3 - 0 = 3
```
Therefore, the output of the code would be `3`.
