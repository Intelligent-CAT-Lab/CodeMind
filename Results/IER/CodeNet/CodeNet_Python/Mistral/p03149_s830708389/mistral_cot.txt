 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes a list of integers as input, which are then converted to a list using the `list()` function.
The `map()` function is used to convert the input string into a list of integers.
The `input().split()` method is used to split the input string into a list of integers.
The `map()` function is used again to convert the list of strings into a list of integers.
The `sum()` function is used to calculate the sum of the elements in the list `n` that are equal to 1, 9, 7 and 4.
The `check` variable is then calculated by multiplying the sum of the elements equal to 1, 9, 7 and 4.
The code then checks if the value of `check` is equal to 1. If it is, it prints "YES", otherwise it prints "NO".
<<<Output>>>
NO
