 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first reads the input `1 2` using the `LI()` function, which returns a list of integers.
It then calls the `A()` function, which is the main function that solves the problem.
The `A()` function takes two arguments, `n` and `m`, which are the number of vertices and edges in the graph, respectively.
It initializes an empty list `v` to store the adjacency lists of the vertices.
It then reads the `a` and `b` values for each edge using the `LI()` function and appends them to the corresponding adjacency lists in `v`.
It then initializes a boolean array `bfs_map` to keep track of the visited vertices and a list `f` to store the distances from the source vertex to all other vertices.
It initializes an empty deque `q` to store the vertices to be visited.
It initializes a flag `fl` to keep track of whether the Breadth First Search (BFS) has finished.
It then enters a loop that runs as long as the deque is not empty.
Inside the loop, it dequeues the next vertex to be visited from the deque.
It then iterates over the neighbors of the current vertex and checks if they have already been visited.
If they have not been visited, it sets the `bfs_map` value to 0 and updates the `f` list.
It then adds the neighbor to the deque.
If all neighbors have been visited, it sets the `fl` flag to 0 and breaks out of the loop.
After the loop finishes, it checks if the `fl` flag is still 1.
If it is, it means that the BFS has finished and it prints the answer.
If it is not, it means that the BFS has not finished and it continues to the next iteration.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is 0, which means that the BFS has finished and the answer is 0.
