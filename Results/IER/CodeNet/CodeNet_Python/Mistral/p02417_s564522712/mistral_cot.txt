 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads input from the standard input (sys.stdin) and converts it to lowercase using the `lower()` method.
It then iterates over the ASCII values of the characters in the range 97 to 122 (inclusive), which correspond to the lowercase letters 'a' to 'z'.
For each ASCII value, it prints the corresponding character and the number of times it appears in the input string s.
In this case, the input string is 'This is a pen.'.
The character 't' appears 2 times, 'h' appears 2 times, 'i' appears 2 times, 's' appears 2 times, 'a' appears 1 time, 'p' appears 1 time, 'e' appears 1 time, 'n' appears 1 time and '.' appears 1 time.
<<<Output>>>
t: 2
h: 2
i: 2
s: 2
a: 1
p: 1
e: 1
n: 1
.: 1
