 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module, which provides access to some system-specific information and functions.
It then sets the input variable to sys.stdin.readline, which reads a line from the standard input stream.
The input is then split using the split() method, which splits the input string into a list of substrings based on a specified delimiter (in this case, whitespace).
The list is then converted to an integer list using the map() function and the int() function.
The list is sorted using the sort() method.
Finally, the first two elements of the sorted list are added together and printed using the print() function.
