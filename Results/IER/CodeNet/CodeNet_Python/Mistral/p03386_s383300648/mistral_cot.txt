 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input: A, B, and K. In this case, A is 3, B is 8, and K is 2.
The code then checks if the sum of A and K minus 1 is greater than or equal to the difference between B and K plus 1. In this case, 3+2-1 = 4 is not greater than or equal to 8-2+1 = 5.
Since the condition is not met, the code enters the first else block. It starts by printing all numbers from A to A+K, which are 3, 4, and 5.
Then it prints all numbers from B-K+1 to B, which are 6, 7, and 8.
<<<Output>>>
