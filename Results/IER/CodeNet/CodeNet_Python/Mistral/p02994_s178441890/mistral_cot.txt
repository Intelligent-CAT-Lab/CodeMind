 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs, n and l, and uses them to calculate a value based on the following conditions:

* If l is greater than or equal to 0, the code prints l * (n - 1) + (n - 1) * n // 2.
* If l + n - 1 is less than 0, the code prints l * (n - 1) + (n - 1) * n // 2 - (n - 1).
* If neither of the above conditions is met, the code prints l * n + (n - 1) * n // 2.

In this case, n is 5 and l is 2.

* Since l is greater than or equal to 0, the code prints l * (n - 1) + (n - 1) * n // 2, which is 2 * 4 + 4 * 5 // 2 = 14.

Therefore, the return value of the code is 14.
