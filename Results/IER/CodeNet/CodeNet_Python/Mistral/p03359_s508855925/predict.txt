The return value of the code for the input `5 5` would be 6.

The analysis shows that a is 5, which is less than or equal to b (5). Therefore, the condition `a <= b` is true, and 1 is added to the result of `a - 1`, which is 4. The final result is 6.

Therefore, the return value of the code for the input `5 5` would be 6.
