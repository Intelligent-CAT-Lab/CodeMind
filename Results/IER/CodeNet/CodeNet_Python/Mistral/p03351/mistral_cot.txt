 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes four integers as input, a, b, c and d, which are 4, 7, 9 and 3 respectively.
It then uses the `map()` function to convert the input string into integers.
The code then uses a boolean expression to check if the absolute difference between a and c is less than or equal to d, or if the absolute difference between a and b is less than or equal to d and the absolute difference between b and c is less than or equal to d.
If the condition is not met, it prints the string "YNeos".
The boolean expression is `not (abs(a-c)<=d or abs(a-b)<=d and abs(b-c)<=d)::2`.
The `not` operator negates the boolean expression, so if the expression is `True`, the result will be `False` and vice versa.
The `::2` at the end of the expression means that it will return every other element of the boolean expression.
<<<Output>>>
YNeos
