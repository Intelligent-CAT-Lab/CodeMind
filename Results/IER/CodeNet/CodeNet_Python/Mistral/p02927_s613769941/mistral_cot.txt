 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, M and D, and initializes a variable count to 0.
It then enters a nested loop that iterates from 1 to M (inclusive) and from 22 to D (inclusive).
For each pair of values a and b, it extracts the digits d10 and d1 from b, and checks if d10 and d1 are both greater than or equal to 2 and if d10*d1 equals a.
If the condition is met, it increments the count variable.
The condition is met when a is 15 and b is 40, so the count variable is incremented to 1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of count, which is 1.
