<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, x and t, and uses the map() function to convert the input string into integers.
The code then uses an if-else statement to compare x and t. If x is greater than t, it subtracts t from x and prints the result. Otherwise, it prints 0.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is 83.

The output is 83 because x is 100 and t is 17, so x - t = 100 - 17 = 83.
