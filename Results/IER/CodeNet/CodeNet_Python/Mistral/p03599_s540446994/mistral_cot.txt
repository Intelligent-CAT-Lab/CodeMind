 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes 6 integers as input, a, b, c, d, e and f.
It initializes the variables A and B with the values of a and b multiplied by 100, respectively.
It initializes the variables x and y with the minimum of a and b multiplied by 100, and assigns the value of y divided by x to the variable dens.
It then starts an exhaustive search to find the minimum amount of water and sugar that can be used to make a drink with a density greater than or equal to e.
The search is done by iterating over all possible combinations of i, j, k and l that satisfy the conditions f // A + 1, (f - A * i) // B + 1, (rest // c + 1) and (rest - c * k) // d + 1, respectively.
For each combination, it calculates the total amount of water and sugar used and checks if the density of the resulting drink is greater than or equal to e.
If it is, it updates the values of dens, x and y with the total amount of water and sugar used.
After the search finishes, it prints the values of x and y, which represent the minimum amount of water and sugar needed to make a drink with a density greater than or equal to e.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code for the input `1 2 10 20 15 200` is `(100, 15)`.
This means that the minimum amount of water needed is 100 and the minimum amount of sugar needed is 15 to make a drink with a density greater than or equal to 15/21 (which is the maximum density).
