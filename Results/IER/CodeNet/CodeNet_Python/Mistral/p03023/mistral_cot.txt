<<<Analysis>>>
The code first prompts the user to enter a number using the `input()` function and stores it in the variable `n`.
The variable `s` is then calculated by multiplying 180 by `n - 2`.
The final value of `s` is then printed using the `print()` function.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is 360.
