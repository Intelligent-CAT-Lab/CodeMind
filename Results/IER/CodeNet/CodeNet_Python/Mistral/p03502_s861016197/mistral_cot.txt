 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an input n, which is `12`.
It initializes a variable _sum to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of digits of n.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to the length of n (inclusive), meaning it will consider each digit of n.
For each digit i in this range, it adds the digit to _sum.
The code then checks if n is divisible by _sum using the modulo operator (%). If n is divisible by _sum, it prints 'Yes', otherwise it prints 'No'.
In this case, n is 12, which is divisible by 1+2=3, so the code prints 'Yes'.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
