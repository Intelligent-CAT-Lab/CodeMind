 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three input values, A, B and C, separated by spaces. In this case, the input values are 5, 7 and 5.
The code then checks if A is equal to B and B is equal to C. Since A is 5, B is 7 and C is 5, this condition is not met.
The code then checks if A is not equal to B and B is not equal to C and C is not equal to A. Since A is 5, B is 7 and C is 5, this condition is not met.
Since neither of the conditions are met, the code prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
