 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module and sets the recursion limit to 10^8.
The ini, inm, inl, ins and debug functions are defined as lambda functions that perform various input/output operations.
The code then reads the input as two integers n and x using the inm function.
The solve function is then defined, which takes no arguments and returns nothing.
The solve function first checks if x is equal to 1 or 2*n-1. If it is, it prints "No" and returns.
Otherwise, it initializes an array a of size 2*n-1 with all elements set to None.
It then calculates the value of m as (2*n-1)/2 and assigns x, x-1 and x+1 to a[m], a[m-1] and a[m+1], respectively.
It then iterates over the remaining elements of a, starting from index 2, and assigns the next possible value of y to each element.
The value of y is incremented by 1 in each iteration, and if y is equal to x-1, x or x+1, it is incremented by 2.
Finally, the solve function prints "Yes" and the values of a, separated by newlines.
