 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module and sets the input variable to sys.stdin.readline.
The main function is defined, which takes two integer arguments a and b.
The function checks if a and b are both zero, in which case it prints "Zero" and returns.
If a is negative and b is negative, it checks if the absolute difference between them is even. If it is, it prints "Negative" and returns.
If neither of these conditions are met, it prints "Positive".
The code then calls the main function with the input values 1 and 3.
<<<Output>>>
Positive
