 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module, which is used to interact with the command line.
It then defines a list of dominoes, which are strings representing the pattern of the dominoes.
The code then removes any spaces and newlines from the strings using the replace() and strip() methods.
The code then reads an integer n from the user, which represents the number of rows to print.
If n is 2, the code prints -1 and exits. If n is 3, the code prints the first domino and exits.
If n is greater than 3, the code splits each domino into a list of rows using the split() method.
The code then defines a function called write, which takes two arguments: ix and col.
The function writes the domino pattern to the console, starting from the row ix and with a width of col.
The function first writes a row of dots, followed by the row at index ix, then another row of dots, and finally the row at index ix + 4.
It then increments col by 4 + n % 4 and subtracts 4 from rem.
The while loop continues until rem is 0.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is not applicable, as the code does not return anything. Instead, it prints the domino pattern to the console.
For the input of 6, the output would be:
```
aabbcc.
dd.dd.a
..d..da
..d..db
dd.dd.b
..d..dc
..d..dc
```
