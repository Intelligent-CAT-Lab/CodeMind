 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an input string S, which is `010`.
It then calculates the length of the string, which is 3.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from the second character (index 1) to the last character (index 2).
For each character, it checks if it is different from the next character. In this case, the first character is `0` and the second character is `1`, so the condition is met.
The code then calculates the minimum of the two possible lengths of the substring that starts at the current character and ends at the next character.
The two possible lengths are `i+1` and `len(S)-i-1`. In this case, `i+1` is 1 and `len(S)-i-1` is 2.
The minimum of these two values is 1, so the final value of ans is 1.
