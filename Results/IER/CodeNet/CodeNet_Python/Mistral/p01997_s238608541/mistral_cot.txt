<<<Analysis>>>
The code imports the math module, which provides access to mathematical functions and constants.
The input is read from the user using the input() function and split into two integers a and b using the split() method.
The code then calculates the result of the expression `4/3*b**3*math.pi` and prints it.
The expression calculates the product of 4 divided by 3, the cube of b (which is 2^3 = 8), and the value of pi (which is approximately 3.14159).
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is 16.666666666666668.
