 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module and defines two functions: input() and mapint().
The input() function reads a line from the standard input and removes any leading/trailing whitespace.
The mapint() function reads a line from the standard input, splits it into a list of integers, and converts each integer to an integer using the map() function.
The code then sets the recursion limit to 10^9 using the sys.setrecursionlimit() function.
The code reads two integers N and M from the standard input using the input() function and converts them to integers using the mapint() function.
The code then defines a function make_divisors(n) which takes an integer n as input and returns a list of its divisors.
The function first initializes two empty lists, lower_divisors and upper_divisors.
It then initializes a variable i to 1 and enters a while loop that continues until i*i is greater than n.
Inside the loop, it checks if n is divisible by i using the modulo operator (%). If it is, it appends i to the lower_divisors list and checks if i is not equal to n//i (integer division). If it is not, it appends n//i to the upper_divisors list.
After the loop finishes, the function returns the concatenation of the lower_divisors and upper_divisors lists.
The code then sorts the divisors list in ascending order using the bisect\_left() function from the bisect module.
It then finds the index of the largest divisor that is less than or equal to N using the bisect\_left() function and assigns it to the variable g.
Finally, the code prints the quotient of M and g.
