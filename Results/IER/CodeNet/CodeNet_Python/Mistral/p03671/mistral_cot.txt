<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user, which is a string of three integers separated by spaces. The input is then split using the `split()` method, which returns a list of the input string's elements.
The `map()` function is then applied to this list, converting each element to an integer. The resulting list is assigned to the variable `abc`.
The `sort()` method is then called on the `abc` list, sorting it in ascending order.
Finally, the first two elements of the sorted list are added together and the result is printed.
