 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input n and checks if it is divisible by 1000. If it is, it prints 0, otherwise it prints the difference between 1000 and the remainder of n divided by 1000.
In this case, n is 1900, which is not divisible by 1000. Therefore, the code will print the difference between 1000 and the remainder of 1900 divided by 1000, which is 900.
<<<Output>>>
900
