 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes two inputs, x and y, and converts them to integers using the map() function.
It then calculates the absolute value of x and y using the abs() function.
The code then checks the relationship between x and y using a series of if-else statements.
If x is less than y, it prints y - x.
If y is less than x, it prints x - y + 2.
If y is 0 and x is greater than 0, it prints x + 1.
If x is less than or equal to y and y is less than 0, it prints y - x.
If y is less than x and x is less than 0, it prints x - y + 2.
If x is 0 and y is less than 0, it prints abs_y + 1.
If x is less than 0 and y is greater than 0, it prints abs(abs_y - abs_x) + 1.
If y is less than 0 and x is greater than 0, it prints abs(abs_y - abs_x) + 1.

<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is 22.
