 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four integer inputs, A, B, C, and D, separated by spaces.
It then checks if the sum of A and B is less than the sum of C and D. If it is, it prints "Right".
If the sum of A and B is equal to the sum of C and D, it prints "Balanced".
If neither of these conditions is met, it prints "Left".
<<<Output>>>
Balanced
