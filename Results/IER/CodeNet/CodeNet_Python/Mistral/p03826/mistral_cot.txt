 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four integers as input, a, b, c and d, and stores them in the variables a, b, c and d, respectively.
The variable s is calculated by multiplying a and b, and storing the result in s.
The variable t is calculated by multiplying c and d, and storing the result in t.
The code then compares s and t using the greater than operator (>). If s is greater than t, it prints s, otherwise it prints t.
In this case, a = 3, b = 5, c = 2 and d = 7.
s = 3*5 = 15
t = 2*7 = 14
Since 15 > 14, the code prints 15.
<<<Output>>>
15
