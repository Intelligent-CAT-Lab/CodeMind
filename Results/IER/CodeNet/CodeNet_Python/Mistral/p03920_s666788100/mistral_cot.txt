 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input n, which is 4 in this case.
The variable m is initialized to 0, and tmp is initialized to 0.
The while loop runs until m is less than n, which is until m is 4.
Inside the loop, tmp is incremented by 1 and m is incremented by tmp. This means that m is incremented by 1, then by 2, then by 3, and finally by 4.
After the loop finishes, the for loop iterates from 1 to tmp+1, which is 5 in this case.
For each number i in this range, the code checks if m-n is not equal to i. Since m is 4 and n is 4, this condition is not met for any value of i.
Therefore, the code does not print any value.
<<<Output>>>
No output is returned.
