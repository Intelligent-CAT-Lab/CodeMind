 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, a and b, and subtracts b from a.
The input is split using the split() method, which splits the input string into a list of substrings based on a specified delimiter (in this case, a space).
The map() function is used to convert the input strings to integers.
The code then subtracts b from a and prints the result.
