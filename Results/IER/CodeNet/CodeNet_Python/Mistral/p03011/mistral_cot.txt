 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input, a, b and c, and stores them in the variables a, b and c, respectively.
The code then calculates the sum of a, b and c and stores it in the variable sum.
The code then finds the maximum value among a, b and c using the built-in max() function and stores it in the variable max_val.
Finally, the code subtracts max\_val from sum and prints the result.
