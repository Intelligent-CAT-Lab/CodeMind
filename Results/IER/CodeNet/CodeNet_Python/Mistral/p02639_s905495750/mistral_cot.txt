 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input as a string, which is then split using the split() method to create a list of integers. The list is stored in the variable x.
The code then iterates through each element in the list using a for loop.
For each element, it checks if it is equal to 0. If it is, it prints the index of the element plus 1.
In this case, the input is `0 2 3 4 5`, which is split into the list `[0, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
The loop iterates through each element in the list, and when it encounters 0, it prints 1.
The output of the code will be:
```
1
```
