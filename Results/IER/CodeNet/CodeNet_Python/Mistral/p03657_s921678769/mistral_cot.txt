 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes two integers A and B as input, separated by a space. In this case, A is 4 and B is 5.
The code then checks if either A or B is divisible by 3, or if the sum of A and B is divisible by 3.
Since neither 4 nor 5 is divisible by 3, and the sum of 4 and 5 is 9, which is not divisible by 3, the code prints "Impossible".
<<<Output>>>
Impossible
