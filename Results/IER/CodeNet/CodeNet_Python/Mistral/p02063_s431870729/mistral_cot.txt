 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first defines a function `inpl()` that takes no arguments and returns a list of integers. It does this by using the `input()` function to get a string input, splitting it into a list of strings using the `split()` method, and then using the `map()` function to convert each string to an integer. The resulting list is returned.

The code then calls `inpl()` to get the values of A and B, which are 4 and 6, respectively.

The code then defines a function `calca(x)` that takes an integer `x` as an argument and returns the value of `x//A + x%A`.

The code then calculates the value of X by subtracting B from the product of A and the reciprocal of B divided by A.

The code then calculates the value of Y by calling `calca(X - X//B*B) + X//B`.

Finally, the code checks if the value of Y is less than the reciprocal of B divided by A. If it is, it prints the value of X. Otherwise, it prints -1.

<<<Output>>>
-1
