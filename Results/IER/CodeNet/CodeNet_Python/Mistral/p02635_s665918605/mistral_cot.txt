 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable K and variable s are initialized to 4, 2 and "1101", respectively.
variable cnt is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the count of "1" in the string.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to the length of the string s (inclusive), meaning it will consider each character in the string.
For each character c in this range, it checks if c is "1". If it is, it increments cnt.
The condition is met when c is "1".
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of cnt, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
