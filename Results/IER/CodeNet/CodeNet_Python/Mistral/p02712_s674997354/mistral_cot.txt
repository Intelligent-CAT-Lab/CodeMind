 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input from the user using the `input()` function and stores it in the variable `N`.
The variable `sum` is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 15.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is not divisible by 3 and not divisible by 5. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum. The condition is met when i is 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 14.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum, which is 78.
<<<Output>>>
78
