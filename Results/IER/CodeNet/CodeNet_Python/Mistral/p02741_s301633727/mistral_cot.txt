 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first defines a list `lis` containing the elements [1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 5, 2, 2, 1, 5, 1, 2, 1, 14, 1, 5, 1, 5, 2, 2, 1, 15, 2, 2, 5, 4, 1, 4, 1, 51].
The code then prompts the user to enter an integer `n` using the `input()` function.
The code then uses the `int()` function to convert the user input to an integer.
The code then subtracts 1 from the integer to get the index of the element in the list.
Finally, the code uses the index to access the element at that position in the list using the `[]` operator.
The return value of the code is the element at index `n-1` in the list `lis`.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code would be 14, since the user input is 6 and the index of 14 in the list is 5, which is `int(input()) - 1`.
