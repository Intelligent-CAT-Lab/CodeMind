 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input N from the user. In this case, N is 10.
The variable answer is initialized to 0, which will be used to store the final result.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from the square root of N to 1, decrementing by 1 in each iteration.
For each number i in this range, it checks if N is divisible by i. If it is, it calculates the answer using the formula (i-1)+(N//i-1) and breaks out of the loop.
In this case, N is divisible by 2, 5 and 10. So, the loop will iterate from 2 to 1, and the answer will be calculated as (2-1)+(10//2-1) = 4.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of answer, which is 4.
<<<Output>>>
4
