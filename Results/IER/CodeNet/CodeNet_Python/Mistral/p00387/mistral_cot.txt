 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user, which is a string of two integers separated by a space. The input is stored in the variable `l` and then split into two variables `A` and `B` using the `split()` method.
The variable `kimawasi` is then calculated by dividing `B` by `A` and storing the result in `kimawasi`.
The code then checks if `B` is not divisible by `A` using the modulo operator `%`. If it is not divisible, `kimawasi` is incremented by 1.
Finally, the value of `kimawasi` is printed to the console.
