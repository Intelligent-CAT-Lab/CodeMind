 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input n, which is 100 in this case.
It then initializes a list called coin, which contains the values [25, 10, 5, 1].
The variable sum\_s is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of sent values.
The code then enters a loop that iterates through each value in the coin list.
For each value i in the list, it calculates the number of times n can be divided by i, which is 3 for i=25, 5 for i=10, 2 for i=5 and 1 for i=1.
It then subtracts the number of times n was divided by i from n and stores the result in n.
The code then adds the number of times n was divided by i to sum\_s.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum\_s, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
