 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string input S and initializes a variable a to 0.
It then iterates through each character in S using a for loop.
For each character, it checks if its index is even or odd using the modulo operator (%).
If the index is even, it checks if the character is 'L'. If it is, it increments a by 1.
If the index is odd, it checks if the character is 'R'. If it is, it increments a by 1.
After the loop finishes, it checks if a is equal to 0. If it is, it prints 'Yes'. Otherwise, it prints 'No'.
<<<Output>>>
No
