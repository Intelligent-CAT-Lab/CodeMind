 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input from the user and checks if it falls within the range of 65 to 90 (inclusive) using an if statement. If it does, it prints 1. If it doesn't, it moves to the next condition, which checks if the number falls within the range of 97 to 122 (inclusive) using an elif statement. If it does, it prints 2. If it doesn't, it moves to the final else statement, which prints 0.
