 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes two integers as input, a and b, using the `input().split()` method. The input is split by spaces, so the two integers are separated by a space.
The `map()` function is then used to convert the input integers to integers.
The variable c is then assigned the value of a multiplied by 3.
The variable d is then assigned the value of c plus b.
The variable e is then assigned the value of d divided by 2.
Finally, the variable e is printed to the console.
<<<Output>>>

[END-OF-RESPONSE]
Note that the input `1 3` is not valid because it has two spaces, which is not a valid input format. The program will raise an error if the input is not valid.
