 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports several modules: sys, fractions, itertools, collections.
It then sets the recursion limit to 10^5.
The variable s is assigned the input string, which is sorted in ascending order.
The variable g is assigned the result of groupby(s), which groups the sorted string into sublists based on their first element.
The variable l is assigned the length of the sorted string.
The variable res is initialized to the sum of all integers from 1 to l, which is calculated as l * (l - 1) // 2 + 1.
The code then iterates over each key-value pair in g. For each pair, it calculates the length of the sublist v and subtracts the sum of all integers from 1 to the length of the sublist (exclusive) from res.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of res.
