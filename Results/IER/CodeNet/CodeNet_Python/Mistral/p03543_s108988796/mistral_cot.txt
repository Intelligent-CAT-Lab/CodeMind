 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an input N using the `input()` function. In this case, the input is `1118`.
The code then checks if the first three digits of N (N[0], N[1], N[2]) are equal or if the second and third digits of N (N[1], N[2]) are equal.
In this case, the first three digits of N are not equal, and the second and third digits are not equal either.
Therefore, the code will print 'No' as the return value.
<<<Output>>>
No
