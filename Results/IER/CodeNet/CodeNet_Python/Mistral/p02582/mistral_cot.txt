 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a line of input from the standard input (sys.stdin) using the readline() function. The line is then decoded from utf-8 and stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace using the rstrip() method.
The resulting string is stored in the variable s.
The code then checks the value of s using a series of if-elif statements.
If s is equal to "RRR", the function prints 3.
If s is equal to "RRS" or "SRR", the function prints 2.
If s has no "R" characters, the function prints 0.
If s has at least one "R" character, the function prints 1.
In this case, s is equal to "RRS", so the function prints 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
