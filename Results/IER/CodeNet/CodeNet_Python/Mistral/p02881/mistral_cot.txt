 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the math module, which contains various mathematical functions.
It then prompts the user to enter a number n, which is 10 in this case.
The function ij takes an integer x as input and returns a tuple containing the greatest common divisor (GCD) of x and n, and the remainder when n is divided by x.
The code then calls the ij function with the square root of n (rounded down to the nearest integer) as input. This gives the GCD of the square root of n and n.
The code then subtracts 2 from the sum of the GCD and the remainder when n is divided by the GCD.
The remainder when n is divided by the GCD is 2, so the sum of the GCD and the remainder is 2 + 2 = 4.
The code then subtracts 2 from 4, giving a final result of 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
