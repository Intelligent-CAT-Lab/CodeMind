 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes two integers as input, a and b, using the `input().split()` method. The input is split by spaces and the resulting list is converted to integers using the `map()` function.
The `gcd()` function is then called with the values of a and b as arguments.
The function uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of a and b. It does this by repeatedly replacing a with b and b with the remainder of a divided by b until b becomes 0.
The function returns the final value of a, which is the greatest common divisor of the two input numbers.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code for the input `54 20` is 6.
