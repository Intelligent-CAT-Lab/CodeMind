 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first defines several functions to handle input and basic operations.
The function `getN()` returns an integer input.
The function `getNM()` returns a tuple of integers separated by spaces.
The function `getList()` returns a list of integers separated by spaces.
The function `getArray(intn)` returns a list of integers of length intn.
The function `input()` returns a line of input from sys.stdin.

The code then defines some constants and imports some modules.

The code then reads the input N and M and calculates the total number of points that can be earned.
The total number of points that can be earned is 1900 \* M + 100 \* (N - M).

The code then prints the total number of points that can be earned.

<<<Output>>>
1900*1 + 100*0 = 1901

Therefore, the return value of the code based on the input `1 1` is 1901.
