 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes two integers N and M as input, which are 1 and 2 respectively.
The variable mod is set to 998244353.
The code then checks if N is greater than M, and if so, swaps their values. In this case, N is greater than M, so the values are swapped.
The code then initializes three arrays: fact, powm, and pown, to store the factorials, powers of M+1 and N+1 respectively.
The code then initializes a function pow to calculate the power of a number modulo mod.
The code then initializes an array inv\_fact to store the inverse factorials.
The code then initializes a function C to calculate the binomial coefficient.
The code then initializes a variable ans to 0, which will be used to store the final result.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N+1. For each value of i, it calculates the binomial coefficient C(N, i) * C(M, i) * fact[i] * powm[N - i] * pown[M - i] and adds it to ans. The loop runs 2 times, since N is 1 and M is 2.
After the loop finishes, the code calculates the final value of ans modulo mod and prints it.
