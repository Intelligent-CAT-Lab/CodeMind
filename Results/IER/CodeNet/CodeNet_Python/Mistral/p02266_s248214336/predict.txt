The return value of the code for the input `\\//` would be 2.
The output would be:
```
2 
```
This is because the input string contains two backslashes, and the code calculates the difference between the current index and the last index in the left list as 2.
The output would be:
```
2 
```
since the Lake list is empty, and the code prints 0.
