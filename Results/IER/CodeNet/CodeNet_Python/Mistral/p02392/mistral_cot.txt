 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input, a, b and c, and stores them in the variables a, b and c, respectively.
The code then checks if a is less than b and b is less than c using the conditional statement if a<b<c.
If the condition is true, the code prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
In this case, a is 1, b is 3 and c is 8. Since 1<3<8, the condition is true and the code prints "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
