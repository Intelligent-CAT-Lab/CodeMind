The return value of the code for the input `((*)())` would be 1.
This is because the first 2 characters of the string are '((' and ')' respectively, so the difference between the number of left and right parentheses in the first 2 characters is 1.
The remaining characters of the string are '*()', so the difference between the number of left and right parentheses in the remaining characters is 0.
Therefore, the minimum of the two calculated values is 1.
