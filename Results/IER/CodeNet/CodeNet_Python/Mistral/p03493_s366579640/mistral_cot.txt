<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an input string `s` using the `input()` function.
It then uses a list comprehension to create a new list containing only the characters in `s` that are equal to "1".
The length of this new list is then calculated using the `len()` function and stored in the variable `len_list`.
Finally, the value of `len_list` is printed to the console.
<<<Output>>>
3
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

The return value of the code based on the input `101` is 3.
