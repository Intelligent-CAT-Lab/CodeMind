 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N and variable K are initialized to 2 and 1, respectively.
The function main is called with these values.
The function first initializes a 2D array C of size 2010x2010 with all elements set to 0.
It then initializes a 2D array dp of size (N+10)x(N+10) with all elements set to 0.
The function then calculates the values of dp using dynamic programming.
It then calculates the value of ans using the formula:
ans = (dp[1:N+2, N+1] * C[K-1:N+K, K-1][::-1] % MOD).sum() % MOD
Finally, it returns the value of ans.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is 1.
