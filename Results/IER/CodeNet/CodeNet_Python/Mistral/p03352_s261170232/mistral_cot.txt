 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the math module, which is used to calculate the square root of X.
The variable X is then initialized to 10, which is the input value.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to the square root of X (rounded up) plus 1. This means it will consider numbers from 1 to 3 (inclusive) in this case.
For each number i in this range, it enters another loop that iterates from 2 to 10 (inclusive).
For each combination of i and j, it checks if i raised to the power of j is less than or equal to X. If it is, it updates the answer variable to be the maximum of i raised to the power of j and the current value of answer.
After the loops finish, the code prints the final value of answer, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
