 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the math and sys modules.
It then defines two functions: rem() and isDouble().
The rem() function checks if three given numbers are even. If any of them are odd, it returns False, otherwise it returns True.
The isDouble() function checks if three given numbers are integers. If any of them are not integers, it returns False, otherwise it returns True.
The code then reads three integers a, b, and c from the user, and initializes a variable cnt to 0.
It enters a while loop that continues until the condition (cnt != 0 and fa == a and fb == b and fc == c) is met.
Inside the loop, it calculates three new numbers tmp1, tmp2, and tmp3 by dividing a, b, and c by 2, respectively.
It then checks if tmp1, tmp2, and tmp3 are integers using the isDouble() function. If any of them are not integers, it breaks out of the loop.
If all three numbers are integers, it increments cnt and updates the values of a, b, and c to tmp2 + tmp3, tmp1 + tmp3, and tmp1 + tmp2, respectively.
It then checks if the new values of a, b, and c satisfy the condition (not rem(a, b, c)). If they do, it breaks out of the loop.
Finally, if the loop completes without breaking, it means that the given numbers a, b, and c are not valid, so it prints -1 and exits the program.
If the loop completes and breaks, it means that the given numbers a, b, and c are valid, so it prints the value of cnt.

-1
