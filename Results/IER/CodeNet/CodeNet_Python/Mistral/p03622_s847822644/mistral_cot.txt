 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable m is initialized to 998244353.
The variables A and B are initialized to 1 and 1, respectively.
The variables f, g and h are initialized to arrays of length M, with all elements set to 0.
The variables f[0], g[0] and h[1] are set to 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to M (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 2 to 1000001.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the values of f[i], h[i] and g[i] using the given formulas.
The code then enters another loop that iterates from 1 to B (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 1.
For each number j in this range, it calculates the value of ans using the given formula.
The code then prints the final value of ans, which is 1.
