 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input L and converts it to binary using the built-in `bin()` function. The binary string is then sliced to remove the leading '0b' prefix and stored in the variable s.
The length of the binary string is calculated and stored in the variable l.
An empty list ans is created to store the output.
A for loop iterates from l-1 to 0, and for each iteration, it appends two tuples to the ans list. The first tuple contains the index i+1, i+2, and 2 raised to the power of l-i-1. The second tuple contains the same index i+1, i+2, and 0.
Another for loop iterates from 1 to l, and for each iteration, it checks if the binary digit at index k is not equal to '0'. If it is not, it appends a tuple to the ans list containing 1, k+1, and 2 raised to the power of l-k. It also updates the value of u by adding 2 raised to the power of l-k.
Finally, the length of the ans list and the value of l+1 are printed, followed by a for loop that iterates over the ans list and prints each tuple.
