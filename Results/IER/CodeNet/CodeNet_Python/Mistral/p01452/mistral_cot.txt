 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable M and variable K are initialized to 6, 4 and 0, respectively.
The function f is called with these values as arguments.
The function f takes three arguments: n, m and k.
It first calls the comb\_init function to initialize the values of cm.
It then initializes the variable r to 0.
It enters a loop that iterates from 1 to k+1.
For each iteration, it calculates the value of mt, lk and rk using the comb function.
It then adds the value of mt \* lk \* rk to the variable r.
After the loop finishes, the function returns the value of r.
The return value of the function f is 1.
