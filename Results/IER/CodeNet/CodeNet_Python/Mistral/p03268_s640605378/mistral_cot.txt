 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes two integers as input, N and K. In this case, N is 3 and K is 2.
The code initializes two variables, ans1 and ans2, to 0.
The code then checks if K is even or odd. In this case, K is even.
If K is even, the code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive). For each number i in this range, it checks if i is divisible by K. If it is, it increments ans1. It also checks if i is divisible by K//2 (which is 1 in this case). If it is, it increments ans2.
If K is odd, the code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive). For each number i in this range, it checks if i is divisible by K. If it is, it increments ans1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the cube of ans1 and ans2.
