 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input, a, b and c.
It then checks if c is less than or equal to the sum of a and b plus one.
If it is, it prints the sum of b and c.
If it is not, it prints the sum of a plus twice b plus one.
In this case, c is 4, which is less than or equal to the sum of a and b plus one (3+1+4=8), so it prints 4+3=7.
<<<Output>>>
7
