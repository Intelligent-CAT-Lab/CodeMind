 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes two integers as input, a and b, separated by a space. The input is then split using the `split()` method and the resulting list is converted to integers using the `map()` function. The resulting values are stored in the variables a and b.
The code then calculates the product of a and b and stores it in the variable c.
The code then checks if c is odd or even by using the modulo operator (%). If c is odd, it prints "Odd", otherwise it prints "Even".
<<<Output>>>
Even
