<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string input from the user using the `input()` function and stores it in the variable `S`.
The `print()` function then prints the first three characters of the string `S` followed by the string "8" and the last four characters of the string `S`.
The first three characters of the input string "2017/01/07" are "201" and the last four characters are "701". Therefore, the output of the code will be "2018701".
<<<Output>>>
2018701
