 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes two integers as input, n and x. It then checks if x is equal to 1 or 2 \* n - 1. If it is, it prints "No" and exits the program.
If n is equal to 2, it prints "Yes" and then prints the numbers 1, 2, and 3. It then exits the program.
If x is equal to 2, it initializes a list y with the values [3, 2, 1, 4].
If x is not equal to 2, it initializes y with the values [x - 1, x, x + 1, x - 2].
The code then enters a while loop that iterates from 1 to 2 \* n. For each iteration, it checks if the length of ANS is equal to 2 \* n - 1. If it is, it breaks out of the loop.
If i is in y, it increments i by 4.
If the length of ANS is equal to n - 3, it appends y to ANS and checks if the length of ANS is equal to 2 \* n - 1. If it is, it breaks out of the loop.
If i is not in y, it appends i to ANS and increments i by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints "Yes" and then prints each element of ANS.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
1
2
3
4

The return value of the code is the output that is printed to the console, which is "Yes" followed by the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4.
