 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes two integers as input, E and Y, using the `input().split()` method.
The variable E is assigned the value 0, and Y is assigned the value 2015.
The code then enters an if-elif-else block that checks the value of E.
If E is 0, the code checks the value of Y.
If Y is greater than 1912, the code prints "M" followed by the difference between Y and 1867.
If Y is greater than 1926, the code prints "T" followed by the difference between Y and 1911.
If Y is greater than 1989, the code prints "S" followed by the difference between Y and 1925.
If none of the above conditions are met, the code prints "H" followed by the difference between Y and 1988.
If E is not 0, the code prints the sum of E and Y.
If E is 1, the code prints 1867+Y.
If E is 2, the code prints 1911+Y.
If E is 3, the code prints 1925+Y.
If none of the above conditions are met, the code prints 1988+Y.
