 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first defines a function `SumOfDigits(n)` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the sum of its digits.
The function uses a while loop to iterate over the digits of the number, adding each digit to a variable `sum`.
The variable `n` is divided by 10 in each iteration of the loop, effectively removing the last digit from the number.
The function returns the final value of `sum`.

The code then takes three integers as input, `n`, `a` and `b`, using the `map()` function to convert the input string into integers.
The variable `sum` is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to `n+1`.
For each number `i` in this range, it calls the `SumOfDigits(i)` function and stores the result in `add`.
The code checks if `add` is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number `i` to `sum`. The condition is met when `i` is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of `sum`, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
