 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable S is initialized to the input string "RRS".
The variable cur_l is initialized to 0, which will be used to keep track of the current length of the longest increasing subsequence found so far.
The variable max_l is initialized to 0, which will be used to keep track of the maximum length of the longest increasing subsequence found so far.
The code then enters a loop that iterates through each character in the input string S.
For each character, if it is 'R', the current length of the longest increasing subsequence is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if the current length of the longest increasing subsequence is greater than the maximum length found so far, the maximum length is updated to the current length.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if the current length of the longest increasing subsequence is greater than the maximum length found so far. If it is, the maximum length is updated to the current length.
Finally, the code prints the maximum length of the longest increasing subsequence found, which is 3.
