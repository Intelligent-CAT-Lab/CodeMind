<<<Analysis>>>
The code first prompts the user to enter two numbers separated by a space, using the `raw_input()` function. The input is then split into a list using the `split()` method, which splits the input string into a list of substrings based on a specified delimiter (in this case, a space).
The first element of the list is assigned to the variable `a[0]`, which is 5, and the second element is assigned to the variable `a[1]`, which is 8.
The code then multiplies the two numbers together and stores the result in the variable `result`.
The final line of the code prints the value of `result`, which is 40.
<<<Output>>>
40
