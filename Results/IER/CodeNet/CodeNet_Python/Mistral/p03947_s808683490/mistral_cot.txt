<<<Analysis>>>
The code uses the `groupby()` function from the `itertools` module to group the input characters into groups of consecutive characters.
The `sum()` function is then used to sum the values of each group.
Finally, the `sum()` value is subtracted by 1 to get the final output.
For the input `BBBWW`, the output will be 4.
