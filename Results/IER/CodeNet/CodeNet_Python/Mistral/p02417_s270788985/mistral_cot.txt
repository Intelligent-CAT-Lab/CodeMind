 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads input from standard input (stdin) and stores it in a variable called line.
It then iterates over each character in the line and converts it to lowercase using the chr() function.
The ord() function is used to get the ASCII value of the character, which is then bitwise ORed with 0x20 to convert it to lowercase.
The resulting character is then checked to see if it is a letter between 'a' and 'z'. If it is, it is added to a dictionary called cnt with the character as the key and 1 as the value.
After all characters in the line have been processed, the code iterates over the range of ASCII values for the letters 'a' to 'z' (inclusive) and converts each ASCII value to a character using the chr() function.
For each character, it checks if it exists in the cnt dictionary. If it does, it prints the character and its count in the dictionary.

<<<Output>>>
a: 1
e: 1
i: 2
n: 1
o: 1
p: 1
. : 1

The return value of the code is the output that is printed to the console, which is:
```
a: 1
e: 1
i: 2
n: 1
o: 1
p: 1
. : 1
```
