 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input `x` from the user.
It then calculates the remainder of `x` divided by 11, which is stored in the variable `n`.
The code then subtracts 11*n from `x` and stores the result in `x`.
The code then checks the value of `x` using an if-elif-else statement.
If `x` is 0, it prints 2*n.
If 1<=x<=6, it prints 1+2*n.
If none of the above conditions are met, it prints 2+2*n.
In this case, `x` is 7, which is greater than 6, so the code will execute the else block.
The code then calculates 2+2*n, which is 2+2*1, which is 4.
<<<Output>>>
4
