 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first defines three sets: a, b and c.
a contains the values {1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12}
b contains the values {4, 6, 9, 11}
c contains the value {2}
The code then prompts the user to enter two integers separated by a space, which are stored in the variables x and y.
The code uses the map() function to convert the input string into integers.
The code then checks if either x or y is in set a, or if both are in set a, or if either x or y is in set b, or if both are in set b, or if either x or y is in set c, or if both are in set c.
If any of these conditions are met, the code prints 'Yes', otherwise it prints 'No'.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
