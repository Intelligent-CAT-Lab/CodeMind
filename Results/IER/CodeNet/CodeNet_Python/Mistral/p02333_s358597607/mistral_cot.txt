The variable N and variable K are initialized to 4 and 3, respectively.
The code then calculates the inverse of the numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 using the extended Euclidean algorithm.
The inverse of 2 is 1, the inverse of 3 is 1, the inverse of 4 is 2, the inverse of 5 is 4, the inverse of 6 is 5, the inverse of 7 is 6, the inverse of 8 is 7, the inverse of 9 is 8, and the inverse of 10 is 9.
The code then uses the formula for the combination of two numbers modulo a modulus to calculate the number of ways to choose 2 numbers out of 10.
The formula is nCr(n, r) = n! / (r!(n-r)!), where n is the total number of items, r is the number of items to choose, and ! denotes factorial.
The code then uses the formula for the sum of two numbers modulo a modulus to calculate the number of ways to choose 2 numbers out of 10.
The formula is ans = pow(K, N, MOD) - ((-1) ** ((r % 2) ^ 1)) * nCr(K, r) * pow(K - r, N, MOD) % MOD.
The code then calculates the final answer by subtracting the sum of the number of ways to choose 2 numbers out of 10 from the product of K raised to the power of N.
The final answer is 10.
