 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first prompts the user to enter a value for K using the `input()` function. The value entered by the user is then converted to an integer using the `int()` function and stored in the variable `K`.
The code then uses the `List` variable, which is a list of integers, to access the element at index `K-1` using the `List[K-1]` syntax.
The index `K-1` is calculated by subtracting 1 from the value of K, which gives the index of the last element in the list.
The code then prints the value of the element at index `K-1`, which is 5.
<<<Output>>>
5
