 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes two integers as input, x and y, and assigns them to the variables x and y, respectively.
Then it uses if-elif statements to assign values to the variables X and Y based on the values of x and y.
If x is 1 and y is 1, the code adds 400000 to the sum of X and Y and prints the result. Otherwise, it simply adds X and Y and prints the result.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code for the input `1 1` would be 400000.
