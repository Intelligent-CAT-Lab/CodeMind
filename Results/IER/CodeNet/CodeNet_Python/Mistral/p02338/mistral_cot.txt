 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integer inputs N and K, which are 5 and 10, respectively.
The function `main()` is called, which takes no arguments and returns a boolean value.
The function checks if N is less than or equal to K, which is True in this case.
Since N is less than or equal to K, the function returns 1.
