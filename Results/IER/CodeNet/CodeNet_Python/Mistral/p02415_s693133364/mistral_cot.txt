 <<<Analysis>>>
The code imports the string module, which provides access to a variety of string manipulation functions.
The toggle\_case function takes a single character c as input and returns the character with its case toggled. If c is not an ASCII letter, it returns c unchanged.
The function uses the index() method of the string.ascii\_letters object to get the index of the character c in the ASCII alphabet. It then adds 26 to this index and takes the result modulo 52 to wrap around the alphabet.
The input s is obtained from the user using the input() function.
The map() function is used to apply the toggle\_case function to each character in the input s. The result is a list of characters with their cases toggled.
The join() function is used to concatenate the elements of the list into a single string.
The final output is the string with the cases of its characters toggled.
