 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input: n, k, and s.
n is 4, k is 2, and s is 3.
The code initializes two lists: arr and arr2.
arr is a list of length k, and it is initialized with the value s.
arr2 is a list of length n-k, and it is initialized with the value num.
The code then concatenates the two lists and prints the resulting list.
