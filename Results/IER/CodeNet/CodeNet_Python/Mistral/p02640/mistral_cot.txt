 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, x and y.
It initializes a variable count to 0, which will be used to keep track of the number of pairs that satisfy the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to x+1.
For each value of a in this range, it calculates the corresponding value of b as x - a.
It then checks if the sum of 2a and 4b is equal to y. If it is, it sets count to 1 and breaks out of the loop.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if count is equal to 1. If it is, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
