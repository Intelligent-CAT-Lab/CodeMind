 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input n and initializes a variable c to 0.
It then enters a while loop that continues as long as n is greater than 1.
Inside the loop, it performs a right shift operation on n by dividing it by 2, which effectively removes the least significant bit.
It also increments the value of c by 1.
The loop continues until n is reduced to 1, at which point the loop terminates.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the value of 1<<c, which is 32.
<<<Output>>>
32
