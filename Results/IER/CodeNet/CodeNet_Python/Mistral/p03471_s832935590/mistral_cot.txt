 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the `collections` module and uses the `Counter` class to count the occurrences of each element in the input list `a`.
The `readInts()` function reads the input as a list of integers and returns it.
The `main()` function reads the input as two integers `n` and `y` using the `readInts()` function.
It then initializes a variable `wa` to 0.
The code then enters a nested loop that iterates from 1 to `n+1` for `i` and from 1 to `n+1` for `j`.
For each pair of `i` and `j`, it calculates `y1000` as the remainder when `y` is divided by the sum of `10000*i + 5000*j`.
If `i + j + y1000` is equal to `n`, it prints the values of `i`, `j`, and `y1000` and exits the loop.
If the loop completes without finding a solution, it prints `-1,-1,-1` and exits.
<<<Output>>>
-1,-1,-1
