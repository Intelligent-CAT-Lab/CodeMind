 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes three integers as input, separated by spaces. The input is `4 3 6`.
The variables X, A and B are initialized to 4, 3 and 6, respectively.
The variable over is calculated as B - A, which is 6 - 3 = 3.
The code then checks if over is less than or equal to 0, which is not true in this case.
Next, it checks if over is less than or equal to X, which is also not true in this case.
Finally, it checks if over is greater than X, which is true in this case.
Since over is greater than X, the code prints the string 'dangerous'.
<<<Output>>>
dangerous
