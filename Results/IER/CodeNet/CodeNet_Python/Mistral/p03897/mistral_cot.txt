 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input n, which is 2 in this case.
It initializes an empty list ans, which will be used to store the pairs of numbers that meet certain conditions.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 1.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is odd, and if it is, it adds the pair (i,0) to ans.
After the loop finishes, the code enters another loop that iterates from 0 to n-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 1.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is 1 (mod 6), and if it is, it enters another loop that iterates from 2 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 2 to 1.
For each number j in this range, it checks if j is even, and if it is, it adds the pair (i,j) to ans.
After the loop finishes, the code enters another loop that iterates from 0 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 1.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is 4 (mod 6), and if it is, it adds the pair (i,j) to ans for all j in the range [n].
After the loop finishes, the code enters another loop that iterates from 0 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 1.
For each number j in this range, it checks if (n-1+j) is odd, and if it is, it adds the pair (n-1,j) to ans.
Finally, the code prints the length of ans, which is 1, and then prints each pair in ans.
