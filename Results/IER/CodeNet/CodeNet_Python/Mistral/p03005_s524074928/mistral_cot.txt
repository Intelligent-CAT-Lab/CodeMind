<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, a and b, separated by a space.
The input is split using the `split()` method, which splits the input string into a list of substrings based on a specified delimiter (in this case, a space).
The `map()` function is then used to convert the two substrings to integers.
The code then checks if b is equal to 1. If it is, it prints 0. Otherwise, it subtracts b from a and prints the result.
<<<Output>>>
0
