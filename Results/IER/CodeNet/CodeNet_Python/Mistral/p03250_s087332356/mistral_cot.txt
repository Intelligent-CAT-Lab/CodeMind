 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user, which is a string of three integers separated by spaces. The input is then stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace using the `strip()` method.
The `split()` method is then used to split the string into a list of integers, which are stored in the variable `a`.
The list comprehension `[int(i) for i in a]` is used to convert the list of strings into a list of integers.
The list `b` is then sorted in ascending order using the `sort()` method.
Finally, the code calculates the sum of the third element of the sorted list (which is 2 in this case) multiplied by 10, the second element of the sorted list (which is 5 in this case) plus the first element of the sorted list (which is 1 in this case).
The final result is 32.
