The input is a string of 8 characters, which are all 'a' and 'b'.
The code first converts the input string to a numpy array of integers, where 'a' is 0 and 'b' is 1.
The array is then passed to the `solve` function, which takes an array of integers as input.
The `solve` function first calculates the length of the input array, which is 8.
It then initializes an empty array `ls` to store the length of the longest common prefix of substrings of the input array.
The function then initializes an empty array `sum_l` to store the sum of the length of the longest common prefix of substrings of the input array.
The function then initializes an empty array `sum_s` to store the sum of the length of the longest common suffix of substrings of the input array.
The function then initializes an empty array `lms` to store the indices of the longest common suffix of substrings of the input array.
The function then initializes an empty array `sorted_lms` to store the sorted indices of the longest common suffix of substrings of the input array.
The function then initializes an empty array `rec_s` to store the length of the longest common suffix of substrings of the input array.
The function then initializes an empty array `rec_upper` to store the upper bound of the length of the longest common suffix of substrings of the input array.
The function then initializes an empty array `ls_map` to store the mapping of the indices of the longest common suffix of substrings of the input array.
The function then initializes an empty array `lms_map` to store the mapping of the indices of the longest common suffix of substrings of the input array.
The function then initializes an empty array `lms` to store the indices of the longest common suffix of substrings of the input array.
The function then initializes an empty array `sorted_lms` to store the sorted indices of the longest common suffix of substrings of the input array.
The function then initializes an empty array `rec_s` to store the length of the longest common suffix of substrings of the input array.
The function then initializes an empty array `rec_upper` to store the upper bound of the length of the longest common suffix of substrings of the input array.
The function then initializes an empty array `rnk` to store the indices of the input array in sorted order.
The function then initializes an empty array `lcp` to store the length of the longest common prefix of substrings of the input array.
The function then initializes an empty array `sa` to store the suffix array of the input array.
The function then initializes an empty array `ls_map` to store the mapping of the indices of the input array to the indices of the suffix array.
The function then initializes an empty array `lms_map` to store the mapping of the indices of the input array to the indices of the longest common suffix of substrings of the input array.
The function then initializes an empty array `lms` to store the indices of the longest common suffix of substrings of the input array.
The function then initializes an empty array `sorted_lms` to store the sorted indices of the longest common suffix of substrings of the input array.
