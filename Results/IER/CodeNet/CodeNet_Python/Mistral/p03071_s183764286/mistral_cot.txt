 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes two integers a and b as input, separated by a space. In this case, a = 5 and b = 3.
The variable res is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the final result.
The code then calculates the maximum value between a and b, which is 5. It adds this value to res.
Next, the code subtracts 1 from the maximum value and assigns the result to a, and assigns the minimum value between a and b (which is 3) to b.
The code then calculates the maximum value between a and b again, which is 5. It adds this value to res.
Finally, the code prints the final value of res, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
