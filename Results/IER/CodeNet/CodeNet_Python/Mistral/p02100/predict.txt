The return value of the code would be the list of values of x that make the polynomial x^2+3x+2 equal to 0.
The polynomial x^2+3x+2 is a quadratic equation and its roots can be found using the quadratic formula: x = (-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a.
In this case, a = 1, b = 3, and c = 2.
Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
x = (-3 ± sqrt(3^2 - 4(1)(2))) / 2(1)
x = (-3 ± sqrt(9 - 8)) / 2
x = (-3 ± sqrt(1)) / 2
x = (-3 ± 1) / 2
x = -1 or x = 1
Therefore, the return value of the code would be the list [1, -1].
