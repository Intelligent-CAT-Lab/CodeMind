 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three input strings A, B and C, separated by spaces.
It then concatenates the first character of each string using the `+` operator and stores the result in variable S.
The variable S is then converted to uppercase using the `upper()` method.
Finally, the code prints the value of S.
