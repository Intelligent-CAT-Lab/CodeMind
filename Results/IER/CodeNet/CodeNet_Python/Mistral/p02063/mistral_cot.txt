 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first reads two integers A and B from the input. In this case, A = 4 and B = 6.
The code then checks if B is divisible by A. Since B is not divisible by A, the code prints -1 and exits.
Since B is not divisible by A, the code proceeds to the next part of the code.
The code initializes a variable k to -(-B//A), which is 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from k to k+10^7 (inclusive).
For each value of k, the code calculates the remainder of k*A divided by B, and then calculates the remainder of the remainder divided by A.
The sum of these three remainders is then added to k to get the value of n.
The code then checks if n is greater than k. If it is, the code prints k*A and exits.
Since n is not greater than k, the code continues to the next iteration of the loop.
After the loop finishes, the code prints -1 and exits.
<<<Output>>>
-1
