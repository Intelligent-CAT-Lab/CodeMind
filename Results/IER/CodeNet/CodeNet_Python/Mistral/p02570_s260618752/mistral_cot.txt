 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input, d, t and s.
The code then checks if d divided by t is less than or equal to s.
If it is, it prints 'Yes', otherwise it prints 'No'.
In this case, d is 1000, t is 15 and s is 80.
1000 divided by 15 is 66.66666666666667, which is not less than or equal to 80.
Therefore, the code will print 'No'.
<<<Output>>>
No
