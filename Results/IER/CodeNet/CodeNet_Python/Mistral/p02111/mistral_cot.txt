 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input from the user using the `input()` function. The input is then converted to an integer using the `int()` function.
The input is then multiplied by 2 using the `*` operator.
The result is then passed to the `divmod()` function, which returns a tuple containing the quotient and remainder of the division.
The quotient is then passed to the `print()` function using the `*` operator, which unpacks the tuple into individual arguments.
The return value of the code is the output of the `print()` function, which is the quotient of the division.
