 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first reads a string input from the user using the `input()` function and stores it in the variable `S`.
It then converts each character in `S` to its corresponding ASCII value using the `ord()` function and subtracts 97 to get the corresponding index in the alphabet (0-25).
It then initializes an array `alpha` with 26 elements, all set to 0.
It iterates through each character in `S` and sets the corresponding element in `alpha` to 1.
It then checks if the length of `S` is equal to 26. If it is not, it appends the missing character to `S` and generates all possible permutations of `S` using the `map()` function and the `chr()` function. It then prints the permutation that has the missing character in the correct position.
If the length of `S` is equal to 26, it iterates through the characters in `S` in reverse order and checks if any of them have a count of 0 in the `alpha` array. If it does, it generates all possible permutations of `S` without the missing character using the `map()` function and the `chr()` function. It then prints the permutation that has the missing character in the correct position.
If none of the above conditions are met, it sets the corresponding element in `alpha` to 0.
The code then prints -1.
<<<Output>>>
