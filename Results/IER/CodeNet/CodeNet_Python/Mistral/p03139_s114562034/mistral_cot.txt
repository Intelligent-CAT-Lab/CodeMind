 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes three integers as input, n, a and b, separated by spaces. In this case, n is 10, a is 3 and b is 5.
The code then calculates the minimum value between a and b, which is 3. This value is stored in the variable ma.
The code then calculates the maximum value between n and the sum of a and b, which is 10 + 3 + 5 = 18. This value is stored in the variable mi.
Since mi is less than 0, the code sets it to 0.
Finally, the code prints the values of ma and mi, which are 3 and 0, respectively.
<<<Output>>>
3 0
