 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first initializes several variables:
n: an integer representing the input number
l: a list of integers representing the previous terms of the sequence
a: an integer representing the current term of the sequence
b: an integer representing the previous term of the sequence
c: an integer representing the current term of the sequence
p: an integer representing the modulus
The code then enters two loops:
The first loop iterates from 2 to n-1 (inclusive), and for each i in this range, it updates the list l by multiplying the previous term l[p%i] by (p-int(p/i)) and adding the result to the list l.
The second loop iterates from n to 1 (inclusive), and for each i in this range, it updates the variables a, b and c by multiplying b and c by p modulo p, and then updating b and c by multiplying them by 2 and i, respectively.
Finally, the code calculates the return value by subtracting 2 times the value of a from the result of raising 3 to the power of n modulo p.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is 1.
