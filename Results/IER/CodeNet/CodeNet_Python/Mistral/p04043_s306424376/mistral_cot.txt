 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the itertools module, which provides various functions for working with iterables.
The input is read from the user using the input() function and split into a list using the split() method.
The code then uses the permutations() function from itertools to generate all possible permutations of the string '575'. The permutations() function returns an iterator, which is converted to a list using the list() function.
The code then iterates over each permutation in the list and calculates the sum of its elements. The sum is stored in the variable c.
The code then checks if the list(c) is equal to the input list a. If it is, the flag variable is set to 1.
Finally, the code prints the string 'YES' if flag is 1, indicating that the input is found in the permutations, otherwise it prints 'NO'.
<<<Output>>>
