 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers n and k as input.
It then calculates six variables s1, s2, s3, s4, s5 and s6 using the values of n and k.
The first for loop iterates from 0 to n//2+n%2, which is 2 in this case.
For each iteration, it calculates the values of a, b and c using the current value of s1, s4 and s5.
It then prints the values of a, b and c.
The second for loop iterates from 0 to n//2, which is 1 in this case.
For each iteration, it calculates the values of a, b and c using the current value of s1, s4 and s5.
It then prints the values of a, b and c.
If the sum of s1 and s4 is less than or equal to the average of s5 and s6, the code prints the values of a, b and c.
If not, it prints -1.
<<<Output>>>
-1
