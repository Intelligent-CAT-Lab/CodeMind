 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input: a, b and x. In this case, a = 180, b = 100 and x = 2400.
The variable c is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the final result.
The code enters a while loop that continues as long as x is greater than 0.
Inside the loop, the code checks if x is greater than 500. If it is, it adds the smaller of a and 2*b to c and subtracts 1000 from x. If x is less than or equal to 500, it adds the smaller of b and a to c and subtracts 500 from x.
The loop continues until x is less than or equal to 0, which happens after 4 iterations.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of c, which is 100.
<<<Output>>>
100
