 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input from the user using the `input()` function and stores it in the variable `n`.
Then it calculates the sum of `n`, `n**2` and `n**3` and stores the result in the variable `sum_of_cubes`.
Finally, it prints the value of `sum_of_cubes` using the `print()` function.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code would be 121.
