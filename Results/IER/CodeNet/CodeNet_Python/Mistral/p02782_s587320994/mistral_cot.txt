 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first initializes four variables: r1, c1, r2, and c2. These variables are then read from the input using the `input().split()` method.
The `map()` function is used to convert the input string into integers.
The `cmb()` function is then called with the values of r1, c1, r2, and c2 as arguments.
The `cmb()` function calculates the sum of all possible combinations of r1 and c1, r2 and c2, and r1 and c1. It does this by using the formula for the sum of combinations, which is (n choose r) = n! / (r!(n-r)!).
The `cmb()` function returns the sum of all possible combinations as a modulo 10^9 + 7.
The `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` variables are then assigned the values returned by the `cmb()` function.
Finally, the `ans` variable is calculated by subtracting `b` and `c` from `a`, and adding `d` to the result. The `ans` variable is then printed using the `print()` function.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is 10.
