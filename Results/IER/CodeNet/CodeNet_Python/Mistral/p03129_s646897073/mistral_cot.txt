 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input as a list of integers separated by spaces. The input is `3 2`.
The first element of the list is assigned to the variable `a[0]`, which is 3.
The second element of the list is assigned to the variable `a[1]`, which is 2.
The variables `N` and `K` are then calculated as `N = a[0] - 1` and `K = a[1] - 1`, which gives `N = 2` and `K = 1`.
The code then checks if `N/2 >= K`, which is `2/2 >= 1`, which is `True`.
Since the condition is met, the code prints "YES".
<<<Output>>>
YES
