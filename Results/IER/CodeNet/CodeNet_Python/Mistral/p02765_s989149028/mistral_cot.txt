 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs, n and r, and converts them to integers using the map() function.
The input is `2 2919`, so n is 2 and r is 2919.
The code then checks if n is less than 10. Since n is 2, the condition is not met.
Therefore, the code prints the value of r, which is 2919.
<<<Output>>>
2919
