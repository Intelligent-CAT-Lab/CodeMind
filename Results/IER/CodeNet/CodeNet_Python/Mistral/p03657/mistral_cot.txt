 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers a and b as input, separated by a space. In this case, a = 4 and b = 5.
The code then checks if any of the following conditions are met:
* If a is divisible by 3, it prints "Possible"
* If b is divisible by 3, it prints "Possible"
* If (a + b) is divisible by 3, it prints "Possible"
* If none of the above conditions are met, it prints "Impossible"
In this case, none of the conditions are met, so the code prints "Impossible".
<<<Output>>>
Impossible
