 <<<Analysis>>>
The variables A, B and X are initialized to 180, 100 and 2400, respectively.
The code then calculates k by dividing X by 1000 and taking the floor. k is 2.
ans is then calculated as k * min(A, 2*B), which is 2 * 100 = 200.
The code then calculates r by subtracting 1000*k from X, which is 2400 - 2000 = 400.
Since 0 < r <= 500, the code adds min(A, B) to ans, which is 100.
The final value of ans is 300.
<<<Output>>>
300
