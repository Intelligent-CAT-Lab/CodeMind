 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an input string `s` from the user.
It then checks if the first and last characters of the string are the same. If they are, it checks if the length of the string is even or odd. If it is even, it assigns the string to the variable `ans` and sets it to "Second". If it is odd, it assigns the string to the variable `ans` and sets it to "First".
If the first and last characters of the string are not the same, it checks if the length of the string is even or odd. If it is even, it assigns the string to the variable `ans` and sets it to "First". If it is odd, it assigns the string to the variable `ans` and sets it to "Second".
Finally, the code prints the value of `ans`.
