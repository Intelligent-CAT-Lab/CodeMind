 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes two integers a and b as input, separated by a space. In this case, a and b are 1 and 3, respectively.
The code then calculates the average of a and b by dividing their sum by 2. The average is stored in c, which is 2.5.
The code then converts c to an integer by casting it to int, which gives d = 2.
The code then checks if c is greater than d by subtracting c from d. Since c is 2.5 and d is 2, c-d is 0.5, which is not greater than 0, so the condition c-d>0 is not met.
Since the condition is not met, the code prints d, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
