 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input K, which is 2 in this case.
The code then checks if K is less than or equal to 500, which is not true in this case.
Since K is greater than 500, the code proceeds to the next block of code.
The code calculates KUP as ((K+1)//2+3)//4*4, which is 11 in this case.
The code then initializes an empty list ANS, which will be used to store the solution.
The code then initializes a variable begin to 0, which will be used to keep track of the current row in the solution.
The code then enters a nested loop that iterates KUP times.
Inside the loop, the code checks if the current row is even or odd. If it is even, it assigns the current column number to the current row. If it is odd, it assigns the current column number plus KUP to the current row.
After the nested loop finishes, the code enters another nested loop that iterates KUP*2-K times.
Inside this loop, the code checks if the current row, column and value in ANS match the solution. If it does, the code updates the value in ANS to be the solution minus KUP.
Finally, the code prints the solution.
