The function solve takes four arguments: C, K, i, and borrow. C is a list of integers representing the current state of the problem, K is an integer representing the number of remaining moves, i is an integer representing the current move, and borrow is an integer representing the number of borrowed coins.
The function first checks if i is equal to -1. If it is, it returns the sum of all the elements in C.
If i is not equal to -1, the function checks if A[i] - borrow >= B[i]. If it is, it means that the current move is valid and the function updates the current state of the problem by subtracting borrow from A[i] and B[i], and then recursively calls itself with the updated C, K, i-1, and 0.
If A[i] - borrow < B[i], it means that the current move is not valid and the function updates the current state of the problem by subtracting borrow from A[i] and adding 10 to B[i], and then recursively calls itself with the updated C, K, i-1, and 1.
If K is greater than 0, the function returns the maximum of the two possible solutions obtained by recursively calling itself with the updated C, K-1, i-1, and 0, and recursively calling itself with the updated C, K, i-1, and 1.
If K is equal to 0, the function returns the solution obtained by recursively calling itself with the updated C, K-1, i-1, and 1.
The input is a string of three integers separated by spaces, representing the initial state of the problem. The function first converts the input string to a list of integers and then initializes the variables A, B, and K with the corresponding values.
The function then calls itself with the initial state of the problem, the number of remaining moves, the current move, and 0.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is 100.
