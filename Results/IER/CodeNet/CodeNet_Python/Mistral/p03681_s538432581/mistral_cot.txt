 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers n and m as input, which are 2 and 2 respectively.
The variable ans1 and ans2 are initialized to 1.
The variable mod is set to 10**9 + 7, which is used to perform modular arithmetic.
The code checks if the absolute difference between n and m is at least 2. Since it is not, the code proceeds to the next step.
The code then enters two loops that iterate from 1 to n and m, respectively. For each iteration, the current number is multiplied by the current loop counter and the result is stored in ans1 and ans2, respectively. The modulo operation is performed to ensure that the result is within the range of 10**9 + 7.
After the loops finish, the code checks if the absolute difference between m and n is 1. Since it is not, the code proceeds to the next step.
The code then calculates the product of ans1 and ans2, and performs the modulo operation to ensure that the result is within the range of 10**9 + 7.
Finally, the code prints the result, which is 2.
