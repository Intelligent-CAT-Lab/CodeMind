<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a line of input from the standard input (stdin) using the `readline()` method of the `sys` module. The input is stored in the variable `S`.
The code then uses the `count()` method of the string class to count the number of occurrences of the characters '0' and '1' in the string S.
The `min()` function is used to find the minimum of these two counts.
Finally, the result is multiplied by 2 and printed to the console.
<<<Output>>>
