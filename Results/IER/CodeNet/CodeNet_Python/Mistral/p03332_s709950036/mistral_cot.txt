 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable MOD is initialized to 998244353.
The variables n, a, b, and k are initialized to 4, 1, 2, and 5, respectively.
The variable fac is a list of integers that will be used to store the factorials of the numbers from 0 to n.
The code initializes the first element of the list to 1, and then iterates from 1 to n, multiplying each element by its index and storing the result in the list.
The function comb is used to calculate the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of combinations that meet the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n + 1.
For each x in this range, it checks if k - x \* a < 0 or (k - x \* a) % b. If it is, it continues to the next iteration.
If it is not, it calculates y = (k - x \* a) // b. If n < y, it continues to the next iteration.
If both conditions are met, it calculates the sum of combinations of n items taken x at a time and y at a time, and adds it to ans.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
