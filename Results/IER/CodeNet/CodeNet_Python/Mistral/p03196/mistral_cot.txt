 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes two inputs, n and p, which are 3 and 24, respectively.
The function `factorization(n)` is then called with n as its argument. This function takes an integer n as input and returns a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the prime factor of n and its multiplicity.
The function first initializes an empty list `arr`. It then initializes a variable `temp` to n.
The function then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to the square root of n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 2 to 5 in this case.
For each number i in this range, it checks if n is divisible by i. If it is, it initializes a variable `cnt` to 0 and enters another loop that divides n by i and increments cnt until n is no longer divisible by i.
The function then appends a tuple containing i and cnt to the list `arr`.
After the loop finishes, the function checks if `arr` is empty. If it is, it appends a tuple containing n and 1 to the list `arr`.
Finally, the function returns the list `arr`.
The code then initializes a variable `l` to the result of calling `factorization(p)` with p as its argument.
The code then initializes a variable `ans` to 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to the length of `l` (inclusive).
For each iteration, it checks if the multiplicity of the current prime factor in `l` is greater than or equal to n. If it is, it multiplies `ans` by the current prime factor raised to the power of its multiplicity.
Finally, the code prints the value of `ans`.
