 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first prompts the user to enter a number using the `input()` function and stores it in the variable `a`.
Then it calculates the sum of `a`, `a ** 2` and `a ** 3` and prints it using the `print()` function.
The calculation is done using the exponentiation operator `**` and the addition operator `+`.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is 100.
This is because 2 + 2^2 + 2^3 = 2 + 4 + 8 = 14 + 16 = 30 + 32 = 62 + 64 = 100.
