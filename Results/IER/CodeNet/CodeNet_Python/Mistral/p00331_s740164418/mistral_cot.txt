 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, H and R, and stores them in the variables H and R, respectively.
The code then checks if H+R is equal to 0. If it is, it returns 0. If it is not, it checks if H+R is greater than or equal to 0. If it is, it returns 1. If it is not, it returns -1.
<<<Output>>>
-1
