 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first prompts the user to enter three integers separated by spaces. The input is stored in the variable `input()` and split into three integers using the `split()` method. The three integers are then stored in the variables `X`, `Y`, and `Z` using the `map()` function, which converts the input strings to integers.
The code then swaps the values of `X` and `B`, and the values of `Y` and `C`. Finally, the values of `Z`, `B`, and `A` are printed.
