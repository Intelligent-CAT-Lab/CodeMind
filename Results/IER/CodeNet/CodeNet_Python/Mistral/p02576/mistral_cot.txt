 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three inputs N, X and T, which are 20, 12 and 6 respectively.
The code first checks if N is divisible by X using the modulo operator (%). Since N is 20 and X is 12, the condition N%X != 0 is True.
Since the condition is True, the code executes the first block of code, which calculates the quotient of N and X (N//X) and then adds T to it. The result is 2*6+6=14.
Therefore, the return value of the code is 14.
<<<Output>>>
14
