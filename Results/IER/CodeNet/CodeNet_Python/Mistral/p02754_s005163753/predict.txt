The return value of the code for the input `8 3 4` is 10.

The code checks if 8 is divisible by the sum of 3 and 4, which is 7. Since it is not divisible, it calculates the quotient of 8 by 7, which is 1, multiplies it by 3 and adds 4, resulting in 10.

Therefore, the return value of the code for the input `8 3 4` is 10.
