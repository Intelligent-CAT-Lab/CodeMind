 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input, n, a and b.
It checks if n is divisible by the sum of a and b. If it is, it calculates the quotient of n by the sum of a and b, multiplies it by a and adds the remainder of n divided by the sum of a and b.
If it is not divisible, it calculates the quotient of n by the sum of a and b, multiplies it by a and adds a.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code for the input `8 3 4` is 10.

The code checks if 8 is divisible by the sum of 3 and 4, which is 7. Since it is not divisible, it calculates the quotient of 8 by 7, which is 1, multiplies it by 3 and adds 4, resulting in 10.

Therefore, the return value of the code for the input `8 3 4` is 10.
