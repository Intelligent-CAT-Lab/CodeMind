 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user, which is a string of four integers separated by spaces. The input is stored in the variable n.
The code then uses the split() method to split the string into a list of four integers, which are stored in the variables n[0], n[1], n[2], and n[3].
The code then calculates the product of the first two integers and stores it in the variable a1.
The code then calculates the product of the last two integers and stores it in the variable a2.
Finally, the code uses the max() function to find the maximum of a1 and a2, and prints the result.
