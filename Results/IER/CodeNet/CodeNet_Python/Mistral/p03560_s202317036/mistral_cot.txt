 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys and collections modules.
The sys module is used to set the recursion limit to 10^6, which is necessary for the code to run without encountering a stack overflow error.
The collections module is used to import the deque data structure, which is used to store the queue of nodes.
The variable k is initialized to 6, which is the number of nodes in the graph.
The variable g is a list of k lists, where each inner list represents the neighbors of a node.
The code then initializes the queue q with the node 1 and sets the initial value of res to infinity for all nodes except node 1, which is set to 1.
The while loop runs until the queue is empty.
Inside the loop, the current node v is popped from the queue.
If v is 0, the loop breaks.
Otherwise, the code iterates over the neighbors of v in g.
For each neighbor c and its distance d from v, the code checks if the distance from c to the source node 1 is less than or equal to the distance from v to c plus d.
If it is, the code continues to the next neighbor.
Otherwise, the code updates the distance from c to the source node 1 to be the distance from v to c plus d.
If d is not 0, the code appends c to the queue.
Otherwise, the code appends c to the front of the queue.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the value of res[0], which is the shortest distance from the source node 1 to node 0.
