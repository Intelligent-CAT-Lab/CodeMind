 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers n and k as input, and initializes p to 998244353.
It then uses a range function to generate a list of integers from 0 to k-1.
The variable f is initialized to [1].
The code then enters a loop that iterates k times. For each iteration, it calculates the value of f[i]*f[-2-i] modulo p, and adds it to the list f.
The final value of f is a list of k integers.
The code then uses another range function to generate a list of integers from 0 to n-1.
It then calculates the sum of f[-2]*pow(f[i]*f[-2-i],-1,p) for each i in the range.
The final value of the sum is calculated by summing the product of f[-2] and the inverse of f[i]*f[-2-i] modulo p for each i in the range.
The final value of the sum is then calculated by taking the sum modulo p.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is 100.
