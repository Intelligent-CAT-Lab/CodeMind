 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input, l, r, and d.
It calculates the quotient of r divided by d, and then subtracts the quotient of l divided by d.
The final result is the difference between the two quotients.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code for the input `5 10 2` is 3.

The calculation is as follows:

* r//d = 10//2 = 5
* (l-1)//d = (5-1)//2 = 2
* r//d - (l-1)//d = 5 - 2 = 3

Therefore, the return value of the code is 3.
