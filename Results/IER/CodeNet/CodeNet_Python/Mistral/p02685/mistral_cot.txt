The variables n, m, and k are initialized to 3, 2, and 1, respectively.
The variable mod is initialized to 998244353.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the final answer.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to k (inclusive), meaning it will consider all possible values of k.
For each value of k, it calculates the answer using the formula:
ans = m^(n-1-k) * (m-1)^(n-1-k) * mod_comb_k(n-1,k,mod)
where mod_comb_k is a helper function that calculates the number of combinations of k items taken n at a time, modulo the modulus.
The mod_comb_k function uses the formula:
mod_comb_k(n,k,mod) = fact[n] * fact_inv[k] % mod * fact_inv[n-k] %mod
where fact is a precomputed array of factorials, and fact_inv is an array of inverses of factorials, computed using the extended Euclidean algorithm.
The condition is met when k is 0, 1 or 2.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
