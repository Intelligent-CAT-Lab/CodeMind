 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an input `word` from the user.
It initializes a flag variable `cflg` to `True`.
The code then checks if the first character of the word is not 'A'. If it is not, it sets `cflg` to `False`.
Next, it checks if the substring from the second character to the second last character of the word contains exactly one 'C'. If it does not, it sets `cflg` to `False`.
The code then counts the number of uppercase letters in the word starting from the second character. If the count is not equal to 1, it sets `cflg` to `False`.
Finally, if `cflg` is `True`, it prints 'AC', otherwise it prints 'WA'.
<<<Output>>>
AC
