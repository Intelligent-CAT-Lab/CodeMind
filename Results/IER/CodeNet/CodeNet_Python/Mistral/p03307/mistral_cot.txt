<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input n from the user.
It checks if n is even by using the modulo operator (%). If n is even, it prints n. Otherwise, it prints 2 times n.
<<<Output>>>
If n is 3, the code will check if 3 is even. Since it is not, it will move to the else block and print 2 times 3, which is 6.
Therefore, the return value of the code based on the input 3 is 6.
<<<Output>>>
6
