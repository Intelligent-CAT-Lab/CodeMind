<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string as input and uses the `zip()` function to iterate over pairs of characters in the string.
The `a != b` condition checks if the first character in the pair is different from the second character in the pair.
The `sum()` function then adds up all the `True` values returned by the condition, which corresponds to pairs of characters where the first character is different from the second character.
For the input `BBBWW`, the pairs of characters are `(B, B), (B, B), (B, W), (W, W)`, and the condition `a != b` is `True` for the first two pairs and `False` for the last two pairs.
The `sum()` function then adds up the `True` values, which is 2.
