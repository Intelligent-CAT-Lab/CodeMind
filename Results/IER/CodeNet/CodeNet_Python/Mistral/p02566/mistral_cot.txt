The input string is "abcbcba".
The code first converts the string to a list of integers, where each integer represents the ASCII value of the corresponding character in the string.
The suffix array function "sa_is" is then called with this list of integers as input.
The suffix array function returns a list of integers representing the suffix array of the input string.
The lcp array function "lcp_array" is then called with the input string and the suffix array as input.
The lcp array function returns a list of integers representing the length of the longest common prefix of consecutive substrings of the input string.
The z-algorithm function "z_algorithm" is then called with the input string as input.
The z-algorithm function returns a list of integers representing the z-values of the input string.
The final output is the sum of the lengths of the longest common prefixes of consecutive substrings of the input string, minus the z-values of the input string.
The output for the input string "abcbcba" is 10.
