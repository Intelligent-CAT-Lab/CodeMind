 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input, b1, b2 and b3.
The first if statement checks if b1 is equal to 1. If it is, the second if statement checks if b2 is equal to 1. If it is, the code prints "Open". If it is not, the code prints "Close".
If b1 is not equal to 1, the second if statement checks if b2 is equal to 1. If it is, the code prints "Close". If it is not, the third if statement checks if b3 is equal to 1. If it is, the code prints "Open". If it is not, the code prints "Close".
<<<Output>>>
