 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four integers as input, which are 3, 5, 7, and 5.
It then initializes a variable `t` to 1<<(3+5+7+5) = 1<<25 = 16777216.
It also initializes a variable `haiku` to ( (1<<(3+5+7+5)) + (1<<(5+7+5)) + (1<<(7+5)) )>>1 = 16777216.
It then initializes an array `dp` of length `t` with all elements set to 0.
It sets the first element of `dp` to 1.
It then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to `n-1`.
For each iteration, it creates a new array `tm` that is a copy of `dp`.
It then initializes `dp` to all 0s.
It then enters another loop that iterates from 0 to `t-1`.
For each iteration, it creates a new variable `m` that is the result of shifting the current element of `dp` left by `d+1` bits and adding 1.
It then checks if `m` is equal to `haiku`.
If it is, it continues to the next iteration of the inner loop.
If it is not, it adds the current element of `tm` to the current element of `dp`.
It then moduloes the result by `mo` to ensure that it is within the range [0, mo-1].
It then continues to the next iteration of the inner loop.
After the inner loop finishes, it adds the current element of `dp` to the `sub` variable.
After the outer loop finishes, it subtracts the `sub` variable from `pow(10,n,mo)` to get the final answer.
It then prints the final answer and the value of `sub`.
It also prints the value of `dp`, `n`, and `n*t*10`.

The output of the code would be:
