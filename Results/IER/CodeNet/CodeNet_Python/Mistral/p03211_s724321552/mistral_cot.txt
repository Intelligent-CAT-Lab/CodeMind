<<<Analysis>>>
The function B() takes no arguments and returns nothing. It only prints the value of minA.
The variable S is initialized to the input, which is `1234567876`.
The variable minA is initialized to a very large value, 1000000000000000.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 3 to the length of S (inclusive), meaning it will consider substrings of S starting from the 3rd character.
For each substring, it calculates the absolute difference between the sum of its digits and 753. If this difference is smaller than minA, it updates minA to the new difference.
The condition is met when the substring is `567`.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of minA, which is 187.
<<<Output>>>
187
