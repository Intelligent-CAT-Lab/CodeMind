 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes two integers n and m as input.
It then enters a loop that iterates m times.
Inside the loop, it takes m input lines, each of which is a string.
It then converts each string to a list of integers using the `input().split()` method.
The loop continues until all m input lines have been processed.
After the loop finishes, the code subtracts m from n and prints the result.
<<<Output>>>
1

The return value of the code is 1, which is the result of n-m-1, where n=2 and m=0.
