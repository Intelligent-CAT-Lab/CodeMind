 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes three integers as input, a, b and c, separated by spaces.
It then checks if a is less than b. If it is, it checks if c is less than a. If it is, it prints c followed by b. If it is not, it prints a followed by c.
If a is not less than b, it checks if c is less than b. If it is, it prints c followed by a. If it is not, it prints b followed by c.
If a is greater than or equal to b, it checks if c is less than b. If it is, it prints c followed by a. If it is not, it prints b followed by c.
If a is greater than or equal to b and c is greater than or equal to b, it prints b followed by a.

For the input `4 5 3`, a is less than b, and c is less than a. Therefore, the code prints `3 5`.

3 5
