 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input from the user using the `input()` function and stores it in the variable `N`.
Then it checks if the value of `N` is between 65 and 90 (inclusive) using the `if` statement. Since 67 is within this range, the code inside the `if` block is executed.
The code inside the `if` block simply prints the value `1`.
Since the value of `N` is 67 and it is within the range specified in the `if` statement, the return value of the code is `1`.
