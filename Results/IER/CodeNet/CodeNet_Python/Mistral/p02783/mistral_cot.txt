<<<Analysis>>>
The code imports the math module, which provides access to mathematical functions.
The variables H and A are initialized to 10 and 4, respectively.
The code then calls the ceil() function from the math module, passing in the argument H/A. ceil() is a function that rounds a number up to the nearest integer.
The result of ceil(H/A) is 2.5, which is rounded up to 3.
