<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an input from the user using the `input()` function. This input is then converted to its ASCII value using the `ord()` function.
The ASCII value is then added 1 to get the next ASCII value, which is the Unicode code point of the next character in the ASCII table.
The `chr()` function is then used to convert this Unicode code point back to a character.
The resulting character is then printed to the console using the `print()` function.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code would be the next character in the ASCII table after the input character 'a'. Since 'a' has an ASCII value of 97, adding 1 to it gives 98, which corresponds to the Unicode code point of the character 'b'. The `chr()` function then converts this Unicode code point back to the character 'b', which is printed to the console.
Therefore, the return value of the code would be 'b'.
