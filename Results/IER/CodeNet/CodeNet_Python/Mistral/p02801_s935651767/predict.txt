The return value of the code would be the next character in the ASCII table after the input character 'a'. Since 'a' has an ASCII value of 97, adding 1 to it gives 98, which corresponds to the Unicode code point of the character 'b'. The `chr()` function then converts this Unicode code point back to the character 'b', which is printed to the console.
Therefore, the return value of the code would be 'b'.
