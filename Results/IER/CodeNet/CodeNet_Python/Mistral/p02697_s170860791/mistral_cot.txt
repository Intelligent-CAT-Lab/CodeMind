 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs, N and M, which are 4 and 1 respectively.
The first if statement checks if N is even. Since N is 4, the condition is True.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to (M+1)//2+1, which is 3 in this case.
For each number i in this range, it prints i and N-i+1.
The first iteration prints 1 and 3, the second iteration prints 2 and 2, and the third iteration prints 3 and 1.
The code then enters another loop that iterates from M-(M+1)//2 to 0, which is 1 in this case.
For each number i in this range, it prints M-i and M+i+2.
The first iteration prints 3 and 5, the second iteration prints 2 and 4, and the third iteration prints 1 and 6.
Since N is even, the code prints the numbers in pairs, with the first number being the sum of the two numbers in the pair.
The output of the code is:
```
1 3
2 2
3 1
3 5
2 4
1 6
```
<<<Output>>>
```
1 3
2 2
3 1
3 5
2 4
1 6
```
