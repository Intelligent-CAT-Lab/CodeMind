 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes five integers as input, H1, M1, H2, M2 and K.
It then calculates the value of the expression H2*60+M2-(H1*60+M1)-K.
The expression is equivalent to (H2*60+M2)-(H1*60+M1) + K.
The first term (H2*60+M2) calculates the value of H2 multiplied by 60 and added to M2.
The second term (H1*60+M1) calculates the value of H1 multiplied by 60 and added to M1.
The final term (K) is simply the value of K.
The expression is then subtracted to get the final result.
<<<Output>>>
-10
