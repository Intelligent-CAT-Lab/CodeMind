 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs, n and y, which are integers.
It then enters a nested loop that iterates from 1 to n+1 and from 1 to n-i+1.
For each iteration of the outer loop, it calculates the difference between y and the sum of the digits of y multiplied by 10000 and the digits of y multiplied by 5000.
It then divides this difference by 1000 and checks if the result is equal to n-i-j.
If it is, it prints the values of i, j and n-i-j and exits the loop.
If no such values are found, it prints -1 -1 -1.
<<<Output>>>
-1 -1 -1
