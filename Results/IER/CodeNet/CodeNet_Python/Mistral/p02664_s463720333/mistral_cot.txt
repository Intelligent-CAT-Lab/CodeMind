The variable f\_inf is set to float('inf') which is a special value in Python that represents infinity.
The variable mod is set to 10^9 + 7 which is a large prime number used as a modulus in some mathematical operations.
The function resolve() is defined which takes an input string t and replaces all occurrences of the character "?" with "D". It then prints the resulting string.
In the main block of the code, the resolve() function is called.
