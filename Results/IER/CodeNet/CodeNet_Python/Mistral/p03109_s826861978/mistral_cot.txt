 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an input string `s` from the user. It then extracts the year, month, and date from the input string using slicing.
The year is extracted from the first four characters of the input string, the month is extracted from the fifth to the seventh characters, and the date is extracted from the eighth to the tenth characters.
The year is then converted to an integer using the `int()` function.
The code then checks if the year is less than or equal to 2019. If it is, it checks if the month is less than or equal to 4. If it is, it prints "Heisei". Otherwise, it prints "TBD".
If the year is greater than 2019, it prints "TBD".
<<<Output>>>
Heisei
