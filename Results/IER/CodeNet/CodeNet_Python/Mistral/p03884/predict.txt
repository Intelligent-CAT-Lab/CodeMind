The return value of the code is the string 'F' followed by the number of 'F's equal to the value of L[i] for each i in the range of 299 to -1, and then concatenating the string OT and the string 'ESTIVAL'.
For the input '7', the return value of the code would be 'F' followed by the number of 'F's equal to the value of L[i] for each i in the range of 299 to -1, and then concatenating the string OT and the string 'ESTIVAL'.
Since the value of K is 10, the value of L[i] for each i in the range of 299 to -1 would be 0, and the return value of the code would be 'F' followed by the string OT and the string 'ESTIVAL'.
Therefore, the return value of the code for the input '7' would be 'F' followed by the string OT and the string 'ESTIVAL'.
