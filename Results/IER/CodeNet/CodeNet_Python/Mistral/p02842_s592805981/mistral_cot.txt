 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first reads an integer N from the user using the `input()` function and converts it to an integer using the `int()` function.
It then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 50000 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 50000.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the product of i and 1.08 and checks if it is equal to N. If it is, it prints the number i and exits the loop using the `exit(0)` function.
Since 432 is not equal to any product of a number between 1 and 50000 and their product multiplied by 1.08, the loop will not find any match and the code will print ":"(without quotes) and exit.
