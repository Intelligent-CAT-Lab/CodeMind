 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input n from the user. In this case, n is 10.
The variable ans is initialized to 10**12, which is a very large number.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to the square root of n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 3.
For each number k in this range, it checks if n is divisible by k. Since n is 10, it is divisible by 2 and 5, but not by 1, 3 or any other number.
If n is divisible by k, it calculates the value of m as n divided by k, plus k minus 2. In this case, m is 5.
The code then compares ans with m. Since ans is initially set to a very large number, it will be updated to the smaller value of m, which is 5.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 5.
<<<Output>>>
5
