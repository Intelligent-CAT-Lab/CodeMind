 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the math module and defines two variables A and B.
The input is read from the user and stored in the variables A and B.
The code then calculates the value of the expression `4/3*pi*B**3` and stores it in a variable.
The code uses the `format()` method to print the value of the expression with 10 decimal places.
The return value of the code is the value of the expression `4/3*pi*B**3` printed to the console.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is the value of the expression `4/3*pi*B**3` printed to the console.
Since the input is not provided, the return value cannot be determined.
