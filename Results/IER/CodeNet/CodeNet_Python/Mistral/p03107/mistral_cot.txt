 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first reads a string input from the user using the `input()` function and stores it in the variable `A`.
The length of the string is then calculated using the `len()` function and stored in the variable `N`.
The number of occurrences of the digit "0" and "1" in the string are then counted using the `count()` method of the list object and stored in the variables `C0` and `C1`, respectively.
Finally, the code prints the result of multiplying the minimum of `C0` and `C1` by 2.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code for the input `0011` would be 6.
