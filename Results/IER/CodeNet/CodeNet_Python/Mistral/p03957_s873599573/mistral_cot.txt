 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes a string input from the user using the `input()` function and stores it in the variable `s`.
It then initializes two variables `a` and `b` to 0.
The code then iterates through each character in the string `s` using a for loop.
For each character, it checks if it is equal to 'C'. If it is, it sets `a` to 1.
If the character is 'F' and `a` is equal to 1, it sets `b` to 1.
After the loop finishes, the code uses an if-else statement to check the value of `b`. If it is 1, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
