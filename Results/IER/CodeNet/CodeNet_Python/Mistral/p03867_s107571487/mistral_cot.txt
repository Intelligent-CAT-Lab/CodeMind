 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module and sets the recursion limit to 1000 or 10**9, whichever is greater.
It then defines three lambda functions: input, write, and fs.
The input function reads a line from the standard input and removes the newline character.
The write function writes a string to the standard output followed by a newline character.
The fs function takes an integer n as input and returns a list of its divisors, excluding n itself.
The code then reads two integers n and k from the standard input, and initializes M to 10**9+7.
It then calls the fs function to find the divisors of n, and stores them in the ds list.
It then initializes an array nums of length m (where m is the length of ds) with zeros.
It then iterates through each element in ds, and for each element, it calculates the value of val using the formula val = pow(k, (ds[i]+1)//2, M).
It then iterates through all the previous elements in ds, and for each element, it subtracts its value from val.
It then stores the final value of val in nums[i].
It then initializes an integer inv2 to 2^(M-2) mod M.
It then iterates through each element in ds, and for each element, it checks if it is even or odd. If it is even, it adds the element's value multiplied by its divisor sum (which is the sum of its divisors excluding itself) and inv2 to the ans variable. If it is odd, it adds the element's value multiplied by its divisor sum and inv2 to the ans variable.
Finally, it prints the final value of ans mod M.
