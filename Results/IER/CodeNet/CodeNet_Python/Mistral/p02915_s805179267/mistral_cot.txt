 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports several modules: sys, math, heapq, which are used for various purposes.
The recursion limit is set to 10^7 using sys.setrecursionlimit().
The variables INTMAX and INTMIN are defined as constants representing the maximum and minimum integer values, respectively.
The variable DVSR is defined as a constant representing the modulus used for arithmetic operations.
The functions POW(), INV(), and DIV() are defined to perform modular exponentiation, modular inverse, and modular division, respectively.
The functions LI(), LF(), and LS() are defined to read input in different formats.
The function II() is defined to read an integer input.
The function FLIST() is defined to generate a sequence of Fibonacci numbers.
The function gcd() is defined to find the greatest common divisor of two numbers.
The code then reads an integer input using II().
The return value of the code is the cube of the input integer.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is 8.
