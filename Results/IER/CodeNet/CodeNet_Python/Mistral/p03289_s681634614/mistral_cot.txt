 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module and sets the recursion limit to 2147483647. This is done to prevent the program from crashing due to a stack overflow error.
The code then defines a constant INF as the value of infinity and MOD as 10**9+7, which is used as the modulus for some operations.
The input function is defined as a lambda function that reads a line from the standard input, removes any trailing whitespace and returns it.
The resolve function is defined, which takes no arguments and returns nothing. It contains a regular expression pattern that matches a specific input format. The pattern is a string that starts with "A", followed by one or more lowercase letters, followed by "C", followed by one or more lowercase letters. The function uses the re.match() function to check if the input matches this pattern. If it does, the function prints "AC", otherwise it prints "WA".
<<<Output>>>
AC
