<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers n and m as input, which are 7 and 4 respectively.
The code calculates the remainder of n divided by m, which is 3.
The code then calculates the remainder of -n divided by m, which is -1.
The code uses the min() function to find the smaller of these two remainders, which is -1.
The return value of the code is -1.
<<<Output>>>
