 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes three integers as input, a, b and x, which are 3, 1 and 5, respectively.
It then calculates the difference between a and b, which is 2.
It then calculates the maximum value between 0 and the difference between x and b, which is 2.
Finally, it calculates the answer by adding x to the maximum value multiplied by b, which is 2.
The answer is 10, which is the final value of ans.
<<<Output>>>
10
