 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four input values, H, W, h, and w, which are 3, 3, 2, and 2 respectively.
The code then checks if H is divisible by h and W is divisible by w. Since both conditions are true, the code prints "No" and exits.
Since the code exits, the return value of the function is "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
