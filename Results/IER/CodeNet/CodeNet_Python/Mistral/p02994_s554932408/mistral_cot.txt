 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes two integers as input, N and L. N is 5 and L is 2.
The code then initializes an empty list A.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 5.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the value L+i-1 and appends it to the list A.
The list A becomes [2, 3, 4, 5, 6].
The code then checks if L is less than 0 and if 0 is not in A. Since L is 2 and 0 is not in A, the code removes the last element of the list A, which is 6.
The list A becomes [2, 3, 4, 5].
The code then checks if 0 is in A. Since 0 is not in A, the code prints the sum of the list A, which is 14.
<<<Output>>>
14
