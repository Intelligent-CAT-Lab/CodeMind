 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input: n, m, and r. In this case, n = 2, m = 0, and r = 3.
The first line of the code subtracts m times n from r, which gives us r = -3.
Since r is negative, the if statement is executed and the code prints 0.
Therefore, the return value of the code is 0.
<<<Output>>>
0
