 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, a and b, and multiplies them together.
The input is split using the split() method, which splits the input string into a list of substrings based on a specified delimiter (in this case, a space).
The map() function is then used to convert the list of strings into a list of integers.
The two integers are then multiplied together and the result is printed.
