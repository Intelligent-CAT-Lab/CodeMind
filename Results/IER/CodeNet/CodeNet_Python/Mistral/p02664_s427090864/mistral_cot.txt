 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string `t` of length `n`. It initializes an empty list `ans` to store the output.
The code then iterates over each character `t[i]` in the string `t`. If the character is `'?'`, it appends `'D'` to the `ans` list. Otherwise, it appends the character `t[i]` to the `ans` list.
Finally, the code prints the string formed by joining the characters in the `ans` list using the `join()` method.
