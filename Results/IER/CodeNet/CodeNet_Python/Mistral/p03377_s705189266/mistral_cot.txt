 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input as a string, which is then split using the split() method to create a list of integers. The list is stored in the variable l.
The code then checks if the first element of the list (l[0]) is less than or equal to the third element of the list (l[2]) and if the sum of the first two elements of the list (l[0] + l[1]) is greater than or equal to the third element of the list (l[2]).
If both conditions are met, the code prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".
<<<Output>>>
NO
