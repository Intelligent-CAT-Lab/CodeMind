 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports several modules, including `sys`, `heapq`, `bisect`, `math`, `itertools`, `string`, `queue`, `copy`, `time`, and `numpy`. It also sets the recursion limit to 10^8, defines some constants, and imports some functions from the `collections` module.

The code then defines three functions: `inp()`, `inpl()`, and `inpl_str()`, which are used to read input from the standard input.

The code then reads an integer `n` from the standard input using the `inp()` function.

Finally, the code prints the result of `3*n*n`, which is 27 in this case.

<<<Output>>>
27
