 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, X and Y, and compares their absolute difference. If the absolute difference is less than or equal to 1, it prints "Brown". Otherwise, it prints "Alice".
In this case, X is 2 and Y is 1, so the absolute difference is 1. Since the absolute difference is greater than 1, the code prints "Alice".
<<<Output>>>
Alice
