 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input n, which is 5 in this case.
The code then checks if n is equal to 1. Since it is not, it proceeds to the next block of code.
The code initializes an empty list ans, which will be used to store the Fibonacci sequence.
The code then enters a for loop that iterates from 0 to n-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 4.
For each number i in this range, it appends the sum of the last two numbers in the ans list to the end of the ans list.
The first two numbers in the ans list are 2 and 1, so the sum of the last two numbers is always 2+1=3.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the last number in the ans list, which is 3.
