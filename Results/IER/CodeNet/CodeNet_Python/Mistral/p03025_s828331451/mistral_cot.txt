 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first initializes the global variables mod, size, f and invf.
The variable mod is set to 1000000007, which is a large prime number.
The variable size is set to 50, which is the maximum size of the input numbers.
The variable f is a list of size size+1, initialized to 0.
The variable invf is a list of size size+1, initialized to 0.
The function inv is defined to calculate the modular inverse of a number n modulo mod.
The function comb is defined to calculate the number of combinations of k items taken n at a time, modulo mod.
The function init is defined to initialize the variables f and invf.
The input is read from the user and stored in the variables n, a, b and c.
The function init is called with 2*n as the argument to initialize the variables f and invf.
The variable m is initialized to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n-1.
For each k in this range, it calculates the value of m using the formula:
m = (m+comb(n+k,n)*(pow(a,n,mod)*pow(b,k,mod)+pow(a,k,mod)*pow(b,n,mod))*inv(pow(100-c,n+k+1,mod)))%mod
where comb(n,k) is the number of combinations of k items taken n at a time, modulo mod.
The condition is met when k is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50.
The final value of m is then printed.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is 1000000007.
