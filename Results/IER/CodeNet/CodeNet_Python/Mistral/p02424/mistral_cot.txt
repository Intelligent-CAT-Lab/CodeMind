 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, a and b, and performs bitwise operations on them.
The first operation is a bitwise AND operation, which returns the bits that are set in both a and b. The result is 2, which is 00000010 in binary.
The second operation is a bitwise OR operation, which returns the bits that are set in either a or b. The result is 14, which is 00001110 in binary.
The third operation is a bitwise XOR operation, which returns the bits that are set in either a or b, but not both. The result is 6, which is 00000110 in binary.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is:
```
00000010
00001110
00000110
```
This is the output of the three bitwise operations performed on the input numbers 8 and 10.
