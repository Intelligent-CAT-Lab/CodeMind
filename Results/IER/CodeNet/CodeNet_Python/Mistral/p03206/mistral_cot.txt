 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input from the user using the `input()` function and stores it in the variable `D`.
Then it defines a dictionary `d` with keys as integers and values as strings.
The keys are 25, 24, 23, 22, and the corresponding values are 'Christmas', 'Christmas Eve', 'Christmas Eve Eve', 'Christmas Eve Eve Eve', respectively.
The code then uses the `d` dictionary to retrieve the value associated with the key `D` using the `d[D]` syntax.
Since `D` is 25, the code retrieves the value associated with the key 25, which is 'Christmas'.
<<<Output>>>
'Christmas'
