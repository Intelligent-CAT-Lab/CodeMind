 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first reads two integers n and m from the input.
It then calculates the modulus as 10^9 + 7.
The code then checks if n is greater than m, if so it swaps n and m.
The function p(n) is defined which calculates the product of all integers from 1 to n modulo the modulus.
The function solve(n, m) is defined which checks if n is equal to m, if so it returns the product of p(n) and p(m) multiplied by 2 modulo the modulus. Otherwise, it returns the product of p(n) and p(m) modulo the modulus.
The code then checks if n is equal to m or n + 1 is equal to m. If so, it prints the result of solve(n, m). Otherwise, it prints 0.
