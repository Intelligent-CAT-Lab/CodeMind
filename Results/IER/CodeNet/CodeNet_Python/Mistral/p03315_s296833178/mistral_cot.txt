 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string as input and initializes a variable `ans` to 0.
It then iterates through each character in the string using a for loop.
If the character is '+', it increments the value of `ans` by 1.
If the character is '-', it decrements the value of `ans` by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of `ans`.
<<<Output>>>
-1

The return value of the code based on the input `+-++` is -1.
