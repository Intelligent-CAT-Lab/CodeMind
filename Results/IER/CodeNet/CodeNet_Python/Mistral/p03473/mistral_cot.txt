 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input from the user using the `input()` function and stores it in the variable `M`.
Then it uses the `print()` function to output the value `48 - M`.
The value of `48` is subtracted from the value of `M` to get the final output.
<<<Output>>>
48 - 21 = 27
Therefore, the return value of the code based on the input `21` would be 27.
