 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an input N, which is 3 in this case.
The variable res is initialized to 'Yes'.
The code then enters a while loop that iterates until 2^(k+1)-1 <= N, which is 7 in this case.
The variable k is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop, so it takes on the values 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
The variable K is calculated as 2^k - 1, which is 31 in this case.
The code then checks if N is equal to 1 or K+1, which is not the case in this example.
The code then calculates M as N-1 or N, which is 2 in this case.
The code then checks if (M-K)%4==0 and M>K, which is not the case in this example.
The code then calculates P as N-K, which is 2 in this case.
Since res is 'Yes', the code then prints the output.
The output is a list of numbers that satisfy the conditions in the problem statement.
The output is:
