 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input n using the `input()` function and converts it to an integer using the `int()` function.
The variable `cnt` is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of integers that meet the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 105.
For each number j in this range, it checks if j is even by using the modulo operator (%). If j is even, it skips the current iteration using the `continue` statement.
Then, it calls the `cnt_divisor()` function with j as an argument and stores the result in the variable `cnt`.
The `cnt_divisor()` function takes an integer n as an argument and initializes a variable `cnt` to 0. It then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 105.
For each number i in this range, it checks if n is divisible by i by using the modulo operator (%). If n is divisible by i, it increments the `cnt` variable by 1.
Finally, the code checks if `cnt` is equal to 8. If it is, it increments the `cnt` variable by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of `cnt`, which is 1.
