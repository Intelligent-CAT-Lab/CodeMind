 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input from the user using the `input()` function and stores it in the variable `m`.
Then it uses the `print()` function to output the expression `(24-m)+24`.
The expression `(24-m)+24` is evaluated by first subtracting the value of `m` from 24, and then adding 24 to the result.
For example, if `m` is 21, the expression becomes `(24-21)+24`, which simplifies to `3+24`, which equals 27.
<<<Output>>>
27
