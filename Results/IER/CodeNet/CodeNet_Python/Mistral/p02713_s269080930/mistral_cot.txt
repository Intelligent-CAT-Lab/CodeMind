 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the math module.
It then prompts the user to enter a value for K, which is 2 in this case.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to K (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 2.
For each number i in this range, it enters another loop that iterates from 1 to K (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 2.
For each number j in this range, it enters another loop that iterates from 1 to K (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 2.
For each number k in this range, it calculates the greatest common divisor of i, j and k using the math.gcd function and stores it in a variable a.
It then adds the value of dp[a][k] to ans.
After the loops finish, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
