 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input as a string, which is then split using the split() method to create a list of integers. The list comprehension is used to convert the input string into a list of integers.
The sorted() function is then used to sort the list of integers in ascending order.
The sorted list is then compared with the list [1,4,7,9] using the == operator.
If the two lists are equal, the variable ans is set to 'YES', otherwise it is set to 'NO'.
Finally, the value of ans is printed.
<<<Output>>>
NO
