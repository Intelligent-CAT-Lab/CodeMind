<<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the math module, which provides access to mathematical functions.
The variable k is then initialized to the input value, which is 3.
The code then uses the ceil() function from the math module to round k up to the nearest integer. The ceil() function returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to x. In this case, ceil(3/2) returns 2.
The code then uses the floor division operator // to divide k by 2 and round down to the nearest integer. The floor division operator returns the largest integer less than or equal to x. In this case, 3//2 returns 1.
The code then multiplies the two results together, which gives 2*1=2.
<<<Output>>>
2
