 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input, x, a and b.
It uses the `map()` function to convert the input string into integers.
The `input()` function reads a line from the console and returns it as a string. The `split()` method is then called on this string to split it into a list of words, which are then converted to integers using the `map()` function.
The `abs()` function is used to calculate the absolute value of the difference between x and a, and between x and b.
The `if` statement checks which of the two absolute differences is smaller, and prints 'A' if the difference between x and a is smaller, and 'B' otherwise.
In this case, the absolute difference between x and a is 5, and the absolute difference between x and b is 5. Since they are equal, the code prints 'B'.
<<<Output>>>
B
