 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string input from the user using the `input()` function and stores it in the variable `s`.
The length of the string is calculated using the `len()` function and stored in the variable `n`.
The variable `ans` is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of pairs of characters that are not equal in the string.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to `len(s)//2` (inclusive), meaning it will consider pairs of characters from the first to the second last character of the string.
For each pair of characters, it checks if they are not equal. If they are not, it increments the value of `ans` by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of `ans`, which is 2.
