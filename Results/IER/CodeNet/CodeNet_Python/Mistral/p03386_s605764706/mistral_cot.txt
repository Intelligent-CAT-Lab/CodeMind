 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three inputs, A, B and K, which are 3, 8 and 2 respectively.
The code first calculates the value of A\_th and B\_th based on the given inputs.
A\_th is calculated as B+1 if A+K > B+1, otherwise A+K. In this case, A\_th is 10 because 3+2 > 8+1.
B\_th is calculated as B-K+1 if B-K > A-1, otherwise A. In this case, B\_th is 6 because 8-2+1 > 3-1.
The code then creates two lists, A\_l and B\_l, which are the numbers from A to A\_th and B to B\_th, respectively.
The code then creates a set of the union of A\_l and B\_l, and sorts it.
Finally, the code iterates over the sorted set and prints each element.
<<<Output>>>
[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
