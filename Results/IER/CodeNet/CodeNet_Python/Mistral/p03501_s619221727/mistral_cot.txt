 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input, n, a, and b.
It then checks if n multiplied by a is greater than b.
If it is, it prints b.
If it is not, it prints n multiplied by a.
In this case, n is 7, a is 17, and b is 120.
7 multiplied by 17 is 119.
Since 119 is greater than 120, the code prints 120.
<<<Output>>>
120
