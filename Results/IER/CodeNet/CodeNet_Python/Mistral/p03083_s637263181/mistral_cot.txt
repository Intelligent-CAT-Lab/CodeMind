 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, B and W, which are 2 and 1 respectively.
The variable mod is set to 10**9 + 7, which is used as the modulus for the arithmetic operations.
The function comb is defined to calculate the number of combinations of n items taken r at a time, using the formula n! / (r!(n-r)!).
The variable ans is initialized as a list of size B+W+1, which will be used to store the final answer.
The variable ans\_change is also initialized as a list of size B+W+1, which will be used to store the intermediate results.
The variable change is calculated using the formula comb(B-1,0) \* 2^W modulo mod.
The variable two\_inv is calculated as 2^(mod-2) modulo mod.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to W+1.
For each value of i in this range, it calculates the intermediate results using the formula change, change2 and ans\_change.
The final answer is then calculated by adding the intermediate results to the previous value of ans.
The code then prints the final answer.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is 1.
