 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes three integers as input, which are 5, 3, and 2.
The function solve() is then called, which takes three arguments: N, A, and B.
The function first checks if the range of N is within the range of A and B, which is true in this case.
The function then checks if A is equal to 1, which is false in this case.
The function then calculates q and r using the formula (N - B) // (A - 1) and (N - B) % (A - 1), respectively.
The function then creates a list s by iterating through the range of B - q - 1 and appending the values N - i.
The function then creates another list s by iterating through the range of r + 1 and appending the values A * q + 1 + i.
The function then creates another list s by iterating through the range of q - 1 and appending the values A * i + j + 1.
Finally, the function returns the list s.
<<<Output>>>
