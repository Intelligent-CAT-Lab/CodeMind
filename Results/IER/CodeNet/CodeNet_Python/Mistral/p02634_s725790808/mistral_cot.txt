 <<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes four variables a, b, c, and d with the values 1, 1, 2, and 2, respectively.
The variable mod is set to 998244353, which is used as the modulus for the modular arithmetic operations.
The code then creates a 2D array dp of size (c+1) x (d+1), where dp[i][j] represents the number of ways to reach the pair (i,j) from the pair (a,b) in c steps.
The initial value of dp[a][b] is set to 1, which represents the only way to reach the pair (a,b) from the pair (a,b) in 0 steps.
The code then iterates through the range a+1 to c, and for each i in this range, it calculates dp[i][b] as the product of dp[i-1][b] and b. This represents the number of ways to reach the pair (i,b) from the pair (a,b) in i steps, where b is the current digit.
The code then iterates through the range a to c, and for each i in this range, it calculates dp[i][j] as the sum of dp[i][j-1]*i, dp[i-1][j]*j, and -dp[i-1][j-1]*(i-1)*(j-1). This represents the number of ways to reach the pair (i,j) from the pair (a,b) in i steps, where j is the current digit.
Finally, the code prints the value of dp[c][d], which represents the number of ways to reach the pair (c,d) from the pair (a,b) in c steps.
