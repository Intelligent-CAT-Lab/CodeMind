 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string S from standard input using the `stdin.readline()` method and removes any trailing whitespace using the `rstrip()` method.
It then initializes two lists, sho and dai, to store the number of occurrences of ">" and "<" in S, respectively.
The code iterates through S and updates the sho and dai lists accordingly.
It then reverses S using the `[::-1]` slice notation and updates the sho and dai lists again.
The code then computes the sequence of maximum values from sho and dai using list comprehension and the `zip()` function.
Finally, it prints the sum of the sequence.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is the sum of the sequence of maximum values from sho and dai, which is 5.
