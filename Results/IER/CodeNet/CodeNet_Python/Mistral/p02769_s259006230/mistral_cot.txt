 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and variable k are initialized to 3 and 2, respectively.
The variable INF is initialized to 10**9+7, which will be used to handle large numbers.
The variable p is initialized as a list of size n, with all elements set to 0.
The variable x and variable y are initialized to n-1 and n, respectively.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 2.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the value of p[i] using the formula x*y, where x and y are the current values of x and y, respectively.
The code then calculates the value of x and y using the formula x=(x*a*b)%INF and y=(y*a*b)%INF, where a and b are the values of a and b, respectively.
The code then calculates the value of ans by adding the values of p[i] for all i in the range [1, k+1] (inclusive), and then taking the modulo with INF.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 1.
