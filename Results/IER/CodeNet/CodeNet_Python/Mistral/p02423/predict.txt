The output of the code for the input `8` would be:
```
00000000000000000000000000000000
11111111111111111111111111111111
00000000000000000000000000000000
11111111111111111111111111111111
```
This is because the binary representation of 8 is `1000`, which has a 1 in the most significant bit and 0s in all the other bits.
The bitwise NOT of 8 is `11111111111111111111111111111111`, which has all the bits inverted, except for the most significant bit, which is still set to 1.
The left shift of 8 by 1 bit is `1001`, which has all the bits inverted, except for the most significant bit, which is set to 0.
The right shift of 8 by 1 bit is `1000`, which has all the bits inverted, except for the least significant bit, which is still set to 1.
