 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first initializes a variable `n` by reading an integer input from the user.
It then initializes a variable `mask` to (1<<32)-1, which is a 32-bit integer with all bits set to 1.
The code then uses bitwise operations to perform the following operations:
- `{:032b}`.format(n) prints the binary representation of n with leading zeros padded to make it 32 bits long.
- `{:032b}`.format(~n & mask) prints the bitwise NOT of n, ANDed with the mask. This effectively inverts all the bits in n, but only those that are not already set to 1.
- `{:032b}`.format((n<<1)& mask) prints the left shift of n by 1 bit, ANDed with the mask. This effectively sets all the bits in n to 0, except for the most significant bit, which is set to 1.
- `{:032b}`.format((n>>1)& mask) prints the right shift of n by 1 bit, ANDed with the mask. This effectively sets all the bits in n to 0, except for the least significant bit, which is set to 1.
<<<Output>>>
The output of the code for the input `8` would be:
```
00000000000000000000000000000000
11111111111111111111111111111111
00000000000000000000000000000000
11111111111111111111111111111111
```
This is because the binary representation of 8 is `1000`, which has a 1 in the most significant bit and 0s in all the other bits.
The bitwise NOT of 8 is `11111111111111111111111111111111`, which has all the bits inverted, except for the most significant bit, which is still set to 1.
The left shift of 8 by 1 bit is `1001`, which has all the bits inverted, except for the most significant bit, which is set to 0.
The right shift of 8 by 1 bit is `1000`, which has all the bits inverted, except for the least significant bit, which is still set to 1.
