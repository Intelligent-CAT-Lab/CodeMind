 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input n and uses a series of if-else statements to determine the return value based on the value of n.
If n is less than 1200, the return value is "ABC".
If n is less than 2800 but greater than or equal to 1200, the return value is "ARC".
If n is greater than or equal to 2800, the return value is "AGC".
In this case, n is 1199, which is less than 1200, so the return value is "ABC".
<<<Output>>>
ABC
