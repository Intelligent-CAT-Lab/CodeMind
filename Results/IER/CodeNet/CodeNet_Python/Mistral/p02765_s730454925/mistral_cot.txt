 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes two integers as input, n and r, separated by a space. In this case, n is 2 and r is 2919.
The code then checks if n is less than 10. Since n is 2, the condition is not met.
Therefore, the code proceeds to the else block, where it assigns the value of r to z.
In this case, z is assigned the value of 2919.
<<<Output>>>
2919
