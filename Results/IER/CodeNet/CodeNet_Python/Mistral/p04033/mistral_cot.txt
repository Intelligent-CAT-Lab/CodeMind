 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first defines four lambda functions:

* `si`: reads input from the user
* `ni`: converts input from the user to an integer
* `nm`: reads input from the user, splits it into a list of integers, and maps them to integers
* `nl`: reads input from the user, splits it into a list of integers, and returns the list of integers

The code then reads two integers `a` and `b` from the user using the `nm` function.

The code then checks the relationship between `a` and `b` using a series of if-elif statements.

* If `a` is less than or equal to 0 and `b` is less than or equal to 0, the code prints "Zero".
* If `b` is less than 0, the code checks if the difference between `b` and `a` plus 1 is odd or even. If it is odd, the code prints "Negative". If it is even, the code prints "Positive".
* If `a` is greater than 0, the code prints "Positive".

For the input `1 3`, the code first reads `a` and `b` using the `nm` function, which returns `(1, 3)`.

Since `a` is greater than 0, the code prints "Positive".

<<<Output>>>
Positive
