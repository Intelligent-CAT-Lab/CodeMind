 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes three integers as input, a, b and c, which are 7, 5 and 1 respectively.
It then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 100 (inclusive).
For each number n in this range, it checks if (a*n) % b == c. If it is, it prints "YES" and exits the loop.
Since (7*1) % 5 == 1, the loop stops after the first iteration and the code prints "YES".
<<<Output>>>
YES
