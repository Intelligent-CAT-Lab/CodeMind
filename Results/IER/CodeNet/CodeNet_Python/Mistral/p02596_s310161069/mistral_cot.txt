 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first reads an integer K from the user.
It then initializes a variable A to 7%K.
The variable Flag is initialized to False.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to K (inclusive).
For each iteration, it checks if A is equal to 0. If it is, it sets Flag to True and breaks out of the loop.
If A is not equal to 0, it updates the value of A using the formula (10*A+7)%K.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the value of T if Flag is True, or '-1' otherwise.
<<<Output>>>
-1
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
The return value of the code is '-1' because the value of A is not equal to 0 for any iteration of the loop.
