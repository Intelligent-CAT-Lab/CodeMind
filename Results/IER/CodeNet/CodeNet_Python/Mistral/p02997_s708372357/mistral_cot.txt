 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers n and k as input, where n is the number of vertices in the graph and k is the number of edges.
It then initializes a list of edges called edges, which will contain pairs of vertices that form an edge.
The variable cnt is initialized to (n-1)*(n-2)/2, which is the total number of edges in a complete graph.
The variable ans is initialized to n-1, which is the maximum number of edges that can be formed in a complete graph.
The code then checks if cnt is less than k. If it is, it means that there are not enough edges to form k edges, so it prints -1.
If cnt is greater than or equal to k, the code enters a nested loop that iterates over all pairs of vertices (i,j) in the graph. For each pair, it checks if cnt is greater than k. If it is, it means that there are still enough edges to form k edges, so it continues to the next iteration. If cnt is less than k, it means that there are not enough edges left to form k edges, so it breaks out of the loop and sets ans to the number of edges that were formed.
Finally, the code prints the value of ans and then prints each edge in the edges list.
