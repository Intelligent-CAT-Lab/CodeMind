<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input as a string, which is then split using the split() method to create a list of integers.
The list is then passed to the map() function, which converts each element of the list to an integer.
The resulting list is then passed to the set() function, which removes any duplicate elements from the list.
The length of the resulting set is then checked using the len() function.
If the length of the set is 2, the code prints 'Yes'. Otherwise, it prints 'No'.
<<<Output>>>
No
