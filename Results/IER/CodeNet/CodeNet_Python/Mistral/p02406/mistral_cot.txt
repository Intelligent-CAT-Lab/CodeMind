 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input n, which is 30 in this case.
It then initializes an empty list A.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 30.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is divisible by 3 using the modulo operator (%). If it is, it appends i to the list A.
It also checks if the string representation of i contains the substring "3". If it does, it appends i to the list A.
The condition is met when i is 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the elements of the list A in reverse order, separated by spaces.
The output will be: 30 27 24 21 18 15 12 9 6 3
<<<Output>>>
30 27 24 21 18 15 12 9 6 3
