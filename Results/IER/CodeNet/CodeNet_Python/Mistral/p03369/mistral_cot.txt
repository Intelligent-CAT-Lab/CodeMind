 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an input from the user using the `input()` function and stores it in the variable `s`.
The `count()` method is then called on the string `s` and returns the number of times the character "o" appears in the string.
The result is multiplied by 100 and added to 700 to get the final output.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code based on the input "oxo" would be 700 + 100 \* 3 = 800.
