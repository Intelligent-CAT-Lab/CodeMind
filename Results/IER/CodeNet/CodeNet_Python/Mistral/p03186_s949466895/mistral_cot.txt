 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input as a list of integers, which is then stored in the variable inputlist.
The first element of the list is assigned to the variable a, the second element to b and the third element to c.
The variable oishii is calculated by adding b and c.
The variable gedoku is calculated by adding a and b.
The variable doku is assigned the value of c.
The code then checks if doku is greater than gedoku by 1. If it is, it assigns the value of gedoku + 1 to the variable tabereru_doku, otherwise it assigns the value of doku to tabereru_doku.
The variable tabereta_doku is assigned the value of tabereru_doku.
Finally, the code prints the value of tabereta_doku + b.
For the input `3 1 4`, the values of the variables are:
a = 3
b = 1
c = 4
oishii = 2
gedoku = 4
doku = 4
tabereru_doku = 4
tabereta_doku = 4
tabereta_doku + b = 9
Therefore, the return value of the code is 9.
<<<Output>>>
9
