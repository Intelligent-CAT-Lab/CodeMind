 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads the input from sys.stdin.readline, which is a string. It then uses the map() function to convert the input string into a list of integers. The list contains the following values: 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0.
The function solve() takes the input list as an argument and calculates the answer based on the problem statement.
The function first initializes the variable Ans to the value of O, which is 1.
It then finds the minimum of I, J, and L, which is 0. It adds 3 times the minimum value to Ans, which gives Ans = 3.
It then subtracts the minimum value from I, J, and L, which gives Ans = 3.
It then calculates the sum of the integers in the list divided by 2, which gives Ans = 1.5.
It then calculates the remainder of the integers in the list divided by 2, which gives Ans = 1.5.
If the minimum value is greater than 0 and the remainder is 2, it adds 1 to Ans, which gives Ans = 4.
Finally, it prints the value of Ans, which is 4.
