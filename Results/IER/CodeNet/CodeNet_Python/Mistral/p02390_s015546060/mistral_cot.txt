 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input `x` from the user.
It then calculates the number of hours, minutes and seconds in `x` using the modulo operator.
The number of hours is calculated by dividing `x` by 3600 and taking the floor.
The number of minutes is calculated by taking the remainder of `x` divided by 3600 and then dividing by 60.
The number of seconds is calculated by taking the remainder of `x` divided by 60.
Finally, the code prints the number of hours, minutes and seconds in the format `hh:mm:ss`.
<<<Output>>>
0:00:00

The return value of the code is `0:00:00`, which is the representation of 0 hours, 0 minutes and 0 seconds.
