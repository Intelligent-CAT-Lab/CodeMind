 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads five integers from standard input, which are stored in variables A, B, C, X, and Y.
The code then checks if A + B <= 2 \* C. In this case, 2000 + 2000 <= 2 \* 1600, which is True.
Since the condition is met, the code multiplies A by X and B by Y and prints the result, which is 2000 \* 3 + 2000 \* 2 = 10000.

<<<Output>>>
10000
