 <<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes two variables, s and n. s is the input string and n is the length of the string.
The code then initializes a 2D array dp, which will be used to store the number of occurrences of each substring of the input string.
The first row of dp is initialized to 1, which means that the first substring (an empty string) occurs once.
The code then iterates through each character in the input string. For each character, it iterates through each of the four possible substrings that can be formed by including or excluding that character.
If the current character is '?', the code sets the value of dp[i+1][j] to 3 times the value of dp[i][j-1] modulo num. This is because a '?' character can be replaced by any of the three other characters, so the number of occurrences of the substring that includes the '?' character is three times the number of occurrences of the substring that excludes the '?' character.
If the current character is not '?', the code sets the value of dp[i+1][j] to the sum of two values: m and b. m is the number of occurrences of the substring that includes the current character, and b is the number of occurrences of the substring that excludes the current character.
The code then prints the value of dp[-1][3], which is the number of occurrences of the substring "AC".
<<<Output>>>
0
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
Note that the output is 0 because the substring "AC" does not appear in the input string "A??C".
