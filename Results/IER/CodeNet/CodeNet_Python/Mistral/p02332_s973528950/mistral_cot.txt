 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, n and k.
It calculates the factorial of k and k-n using the math module.
Then it calculates the answer by dividing the factorial of k by the factorial of k-n and taking the result modulo 10^9 + 7.
The answer is then printed to the console.
<<<Output>>>
0
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
The return value of the code is 0 because the input values n and k are not valid. The input values must be integers, and k must be less than or equal to n. In this case, k is 3 and n is 2, which is not valid.
