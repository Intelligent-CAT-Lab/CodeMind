 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input n, which is 4 in this case.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 4.
For each number i in this range, it adds i to ans and appends it to the list lst.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if ans is greater than or equal to n, which is not the case in this case.
Therefore, the code does not break out of the loop.
After the loop finishes, the code calculates the difference between ans and n, which is 0.
Since 0 is not in the list lst, the code does not remove any element from the list.
The code then calculates the length of the list lst, which is 4.
Finally, the code prints each element of the list lst in order, which are 1, 2, 3 and 4.
