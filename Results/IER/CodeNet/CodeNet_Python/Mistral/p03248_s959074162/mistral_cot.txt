 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable S is initialized to '1111'.
The variable N is initialized to the length of S, which is 4.
The variable base is initialized to 1.
The code then checks if S is equal to its reverse (S[::-1]). If it is not, it prints -1 and exits.
The code then creates a list of edges by iterating over the range from 1 to N-1. For each i in this range, it appends the edge (base, i+1) to the edges list. If S[i] is 1, it sets base to i+1.
The code then prints the edges list.
<<<Output>>>
[(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4)]
