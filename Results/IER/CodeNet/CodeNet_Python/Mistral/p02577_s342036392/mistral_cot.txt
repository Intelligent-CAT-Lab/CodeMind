 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys and math modules.
It then defines several lambda functions:
- input: reads a line from the standard input and removes the newline character.
- ins: reads a line from the standard input and removes the newline character.
- ini: reads a line from the standard input, removes the newline character, and converts it to an integer.
- inm: reads a line from the standard input, splits it into a list of integers, and converts it to a list of integers.
- inl: reads a line from the standard input, splits it into a list of integers, and converts it to a list of integers.
- out: prints a list of strings, separated by newlines.

The code then reads a line from the standard input, converts it to an integer, and checks if it is divisible by 9. If it is, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".

<<<Output>>>
No
