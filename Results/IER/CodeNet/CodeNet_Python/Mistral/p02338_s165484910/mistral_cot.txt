 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports several modules, including `sys`, `math`, `collections`, `bisect`, `itertools`, `fractions`, `functools`, `copy`, `heapq`, `decimal`, `statistics`, `queue`, and `numpy`.
It also sets the recursion limit to 1,000,000,100.
The code then defines several functions, including `ni`, `ns`, `na`, `prepare`, and `main`.
The `prepare` function takes two arguments: `n` and `MOD`, and returns two lists: `factorials` and `invs`.
The `factorials` list contains the factorials of the numbers from 0 to `n`, while the `invs` list contains the inverses of the factorials of the numbers from 0 to `n`.
The `main` function takes two arguments: `n` and `k`, and returns 1 if `n` is less than or equal to `k`, and 0 otherwise.
The `main` function calls the `prepare` function with `n + k` and `MOD`, and stores the returned `factorials` and `invs` lists in the `factorials` and `invs` variables, respectively.
The `main` function then checks if `n` is less than or equal to `k`, and returns 1 if it is, and 0 otherwise.
