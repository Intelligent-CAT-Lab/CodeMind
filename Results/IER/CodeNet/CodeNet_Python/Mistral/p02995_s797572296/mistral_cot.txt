 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the math module.
Then it takes four integers as input, a, b, c, and d, and stores them in variables.
The function gcd is then called with arguments c and d, which calculates the greatest common divisor of the two numbers. The result is stored in gcd_.
The variable cc is then calculated by dividing c by gcd_ and multiplying the result by d.
The variables mm1, mm2, and mmc are then calculated by dividing b by c, d, and cc, respectively.
The variables A1 and A2 are then calculated by subtracting the sum of mm2 and mm1 from mmc and mm2 and mm1 from mmc, respectively.
Finally, the code subtracts A2 from A1 and prints the result.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is 10.
