 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four integers as input, a, b, c, and d, and assigns them to the variables a, b, c, and d, respectively.
The code then checks if a is equal to b and c is equal to d, and if so, it prints "yes".
If a is equal to c and b is equal to d, it prints "yes".
If a is equal to d and b is equal to c, it prints "yes".
If none of the above conditions are met, it prints "no".
<<<Output>>>
no
