The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 1, 25 and 50, respectively.
variable C is initialized to 50, which will be used to calculate the inverse of 100 - C.
The class Comb is initialized with 2 \* N = 2 \* 1 = 2, modulo 10^9 + 7.
The class Inv is initialized with modulo 10^9 + 7.
The variable IL is calculated using the invL method of the Inv class, which calculates the inverse of a modulo a given modulo.
The variable IC is calculated using the invx method of the Inv class, which calculates the inverse of a modulo a given modulo.
The variable PA and PB are initialized with the values of A and B, respectively.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the final result.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider all possible values of i.
For each value of i, it calculates the product of (N + i) \* IC \* 100 \* PA[N] \* PB[i] \* IL[N + i] \* com.com(N + i - 1, i) % MOD.
It then adds this product to the ans variable.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
