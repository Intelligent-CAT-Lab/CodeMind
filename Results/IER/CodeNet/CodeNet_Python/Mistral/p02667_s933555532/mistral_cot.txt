 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string input T, which is "1101" in this case.
The variables i, r, a, and k are initialized to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates through each character c in T.
For each character c, it updates the variables i, r, a, and k as follows:
* i is incremented by 1.
* r is updated based on the current value of k and the current character c. If c is '0', r is decremented by 1. If c is '1', r is incremented by 2.
* a is updated based on the current value of i, k, and the current character c. If c is '0', a is incremented by 1. If c is '1', a is incremented by 2.
* k is updated based on the current value of r and the current character c. If c is '0', k is decremented by 1. If c is '1', k is incremented by 2.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of a, which is 4.
