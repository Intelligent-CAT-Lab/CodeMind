 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the numpy library.
Then it reads four integers from the user, which are stored in the variables x1, y1, x2, and y2.
The complex numbers a and b are then created using the complex() function and the variables x1, y1, x2, and y2.
The length of the complex number a-b is calculated using the abs() function.
The complex number c is then calculated using the formula (a-b) * complex(np.cos(-np.pi/2), np.sin(-np.pi/2)) + b.
The real and imaginary parts of c are then rounded to the nearest integer using the round() function and stored in the variables x3 and y3.
The complex number d is then calculated using the formula (b-a) * complex(np.cos(np.pi/2), np.sin(np.pi/2)) + a.
The real and imaginary parts of d are then rounded to the nearest integer using the round() function and stored in the variables x4 and y4.
Finally, the variables x3, y3, x4, and y4 are printed to the console.
