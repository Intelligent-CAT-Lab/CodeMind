 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads three integers from standard input, which are 1, 1, and 50.
The variable n is set to 50, which is the largest of the three integers.
The variable k is set to 1, which is the smallest of the three integers.
The variable a is set to 1, which is the middle of the three integers.
The code then initializes a list lst of length k+1, with all elements set to 0.
The element lst[-2] is set to 1, which is the base case.
The variable A is calculated as a*pow(100*n,mod-2,mod), where a is 1, n is 50, and mod is 998244353.
The variable inv is calculated as pow(n,mod-2,mod), which is 1 in this case.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from k-1 to 0 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 0.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the value of lst[i] using the formula A*(lst[i+1] - lst[i+n+1]) + lst[i+1].
If k > i + n, it means that i is less than k-1, so it calculates lst[i+1] - lst[i+n+1].
If k <= i + n, it means that i is greater than or equal to k-1, so it calculates lst[k] - lst[i+1].
The code then calculates the remainder of lst[i] when divided by mod.
Finally, the code prints the value of lst[0] - lst[1], which is 1.
