The variable mod is initialized to 11.
The variables n and k are initialized to 7 and 7, respectively.
The variable k is then subtracted by 8 and the result is taken modulo 11, which gives k=3.
The variable last is calculated as 7*n-7*2-2, which is 14.
The variable idx is initialized to -1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to last (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 14.
For each number i in this range, it checks if 3*(i+i+1+i+2)%mod==k. If it is, it sets idx to i and breaks out of the loop. The condition is met when i is 1.
The code then enters another loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 7.
For each number i in this range, it checks if (7*i-1-idx)%11==0. If it is, it sets r2idx to 7*i-1.
The code then enters another loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 7.
For each number i in this range, it checks if (7*i-idx)%11==0. If it is, it sets r1idx to 7*i.
The code then checks if idx is -1. If it is, it prints 0 and exits.
If r1idx is -1, it checks if r2idx is -1. If it is, it prints (last-idx)/11+1. If it is not, it prints (last-idx)/11+1-(last-r2idx)/(7*11)-1.
If r1idx is not -1, it checks if r2idx is -1. If it is, it prints (last-idx)/11+1-(last-r1idx)/(7*11)-1. If it is not, it prints (last-idx)/11+1-(last-r2idx)/(7*11)-1-(last-r1idx)/(7*11)-1.
The condition is met when r1idx is 7 and r2idx is 1.
The output of the code is 2.
