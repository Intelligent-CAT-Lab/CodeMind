 <<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a string S and its length l. It also initializes a modulus value of 10**9+7.
It then initializes a 2D array dp with 13 rows and 13 columns, where each element is initialized to 0.
The dp[0][0] is set to 1, which will be used as the base case for the recursive algorithm.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each character in the string S.
For each character, it checks if it is a question mark (?) or not.
If it is a question mark, it loops through all possible values of the digit that can replace it, and for each value, it updates the dp array using the recurrence relation.
If it is not a question mark, it updates the dp array using the recurrence relation with the digit value of the character.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the value of dp[l][5], which is the final answer.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code based on the input `??2??5` would be 1.
