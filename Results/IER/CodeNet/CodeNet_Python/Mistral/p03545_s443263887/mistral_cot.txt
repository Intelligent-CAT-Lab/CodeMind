 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to the input string '1222'.
op\_cnt is calculated as the length of n, which is 4.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 2^op\_cnt = 16.
For each i in this range, it initializes an empty list op and sets its length to op\_cnt.
It then iterates through each bit of i and sets the corresponding element in op to either '+' or '-' based on whether the bit is 1 or 0.
The formula is then constructed by iterating through n and op, concatenating the corresponding elements with a '+' sign.
The code then evaluates the formula using the eval() function and checks if it equals 7.
If it does, it prints the formula and breaks out of the loop.
In this case, the formula is '1+2+3+4' and it equals 7, so the code prints '1+2+3+4=7' and breaks out of the loop.
<<<Output>>>
1+2+3+4=7
