 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first defines a list of numbers called `nums`.
It then prompts the user to enter an integer using the `input()` function, which returns a string.
The `int()` function is then used to convert the string input to an integer.
The code then uses this integer to index into the `nums` list and prints the value at that index.
In this case, the input is `6`, so the code will index into `nums` at position `6` and print the value at that position, which is `1`.
