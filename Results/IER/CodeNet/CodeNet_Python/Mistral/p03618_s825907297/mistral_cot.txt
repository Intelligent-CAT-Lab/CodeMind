 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes a string input from the user using the `input()` function and stores it in the variable `s`.
It then calculates the length of the string using the `len()` function and stores it in the variable `len(s)`.
The variable `count` is then calculated by multiplying the length of the string by its length minus one, dividing by 2 and adding 1. This is done to calculate the number of unique characters in the string.
The code then creates an empty dictionary called `dic`.
It then iterates through each character in the string using a for loop and for each character, it tries to append it to the corresponding key in the dictionary using a try-except block. If the key already exists in the dictionary, it appends the current index of the character to the list associated with that key. If the key does not exist in the dictionary, it creates a new key with the current character as its value and a list containing the current index of the character.
After the loop finishes, the code iterates through the values of the dictionary using another for loop and for each value, it subtracts the length of the value (minus one) multiplied by the length of the value minus one divided by 2 from the count variable. This is done to subtract the number of unique characters in each value from the count.
Finally, the code prints the value of the count variable, which is 1.
