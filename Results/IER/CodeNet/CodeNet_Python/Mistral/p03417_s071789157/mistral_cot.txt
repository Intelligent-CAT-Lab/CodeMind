 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers n and m as input, which are 2 and 2 respectively.
The code then checks if n and m are equal to 1. Since they are not, it moves to the next condition.
The code then checks if min(n,m) is equal to 1. Since it is not, it moves to the next condition.
The code then checks if n or m is equal to 1. Since neither is, it moves to the final condition.
The code then calculates (n-2) * (m-2), which is 0.
<<<Output>>>
