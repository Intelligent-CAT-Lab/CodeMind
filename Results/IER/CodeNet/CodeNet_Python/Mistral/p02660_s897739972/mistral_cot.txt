 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input n from the user.
It then calls the function `factorization(n)` which takes n as an argument and returns a list of tuples.
The function `factorization(n)` uses a for loop to iterate from 2 to the square root of n (inclusive).
For each number i in this range, it checks if n is divisible by i. If it is, it initializes a variable `cnt` to 0 and uses another for loop to repeatedly divide n by i until n is no longer divisible by i. The value of `cnt` is then appended to the list `arr` as a tuple `[i, cnt]`.
If n is not divisible by any number in the range [2, sqrt(n)], the function appends `[n, 1]` to the list `arr`.
If the list `arr` is empty, the function appends `[n, 1]` to the list.
The function then returns the list `arr`.
The code then initializes a variable `ans` to 0 and uses another for loop to iterate over the list `a` returned by the function `factorization(n)`.
For each tuple `i` in the list `a`, it calculates the value of `k` as the second element of the tuple.
It then calculates the value of `ans` by adding the value of `(-1+(1+8*k)**(0.5))/2` to `ans`.
Finally, the code prints the value of `ans`.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code would be 10.
