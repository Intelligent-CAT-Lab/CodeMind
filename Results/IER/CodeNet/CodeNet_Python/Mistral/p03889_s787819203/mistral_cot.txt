 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes a string input from the user using the `input()` function and stores it in the variable `s`.
It then reverses the string using the `reversed()` function and stores the reversed string in the variable `sr`.
The length of the string is calculated using the `len()` function and divided by 2 to get the middle index, which is stored in the variable `t`.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to `t+1`, meaning it will consider each character in the string and its corresponding character in the reversed string.
For each pair of characters, it checks if they are either "b" and "d", "d" and "b", "p" and "q", or "q" and "p". If any pair does not match these conditions, the code prints "No" and breaks out of the loop.
If all pairs match the conditions, the code prints "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
