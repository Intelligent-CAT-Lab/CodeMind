 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input N and checks if it is divisible by 10.
If N is divisible by 10, it means the last digit of N is 0.
If N is not divisible by 10, it means the last digit of N is not 0.
If N is divisible by 10, it prints "Yes".
If N is not divisible by 10, it prints "No".
In the case of input 29, the last digit is 9, which is not 0. Therefore, the code will print "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
