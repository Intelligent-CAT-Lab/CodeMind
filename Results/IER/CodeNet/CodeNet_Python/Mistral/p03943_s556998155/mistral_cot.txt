 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes a list of integers as input, separated by spaces. The input is `10 30 20`.
The list is then converted to a list of integers using the `map()` function and the `int()` function. The resulting list is stored in the variable `candy`.
The `candy` list is then sorted using the `sort()` method.
The code then checks if the sum of the first two elements of the sorted list is equal to the third element of the sorted list. In this case, the sum of the first two elements is 30, which is equal to the third element 20.
Since the condition is met, the code returns 'Yes'.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
