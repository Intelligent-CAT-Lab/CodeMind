 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input `l` and stores it in the variable `l`.
It then initializes the variable `d` to the maximum value of `d` in the range `[0, 29]` such that `2**d <= l`. This is done using a list comprehension that filters the range `[0, 29]` and returns the maximum value that satisfies the condition.
The variable `n` is then set to `d+1`, and `m` is set to `2*d`.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from `1` to `n-1` (inclusive), and for each iteration, it appends two tuples to the `ans` list. The first tuple contains the current number `i`, the next number `i+1`, and `0`. The second tuple contains the current number `i`, the next number `i+1`, and `2**(i-1)`.
After the loop finishes, the code enters another loop that iterates from `n-1` to `0` (inclusive), and for each iteration, it checks if the difference between `l` and `2**(i-1)` is greater than or equal to `2**d-1`. If it is, it appends a new tuple to the `ans` list, increments `m`, subtracts `2**(i-1)` from `l`, and breaks out of the loop.
Finally, the code prints the values of `n` and `m`, and then prints each tuple in the `ans` list.

For the input `4`, the variable `l` is set to `4`, and the variable `d` is set to `0`, since `2**0 <= 4`. The variable `n` is set to `1`, and `m` is set to `0`.
The first loop iterates from `1` to `1` (inclusive), and appends two tuples to the `ans` list. The first tuple contains `1`, `2`, and `0`, and the second tuple contains `1`, `2`, and `1`.
The second loop iterates from `1` to `0` (inclusive), and checks if the difference between `4` and `2**(0-1)` is greater than or equal to `2**0-1`. Since it is, it appends a new tuple to the `ans` list, increments `m`, subtracts `2**(0-1)` from `4`, and breaks out of the loop.
The final output is:
```
1 2
1 2
