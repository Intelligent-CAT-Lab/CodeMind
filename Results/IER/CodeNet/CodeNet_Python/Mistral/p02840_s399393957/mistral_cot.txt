The variable N, variable X, and variable D are initialized to 3, 4, and 2, respectively.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the final answer.
The code then enters a series of if-elif-else statements to check the values of X and D.
If X and D are both 0, the answer is 1.
If X is 0, the answer is N^2 - N*(N+1)/2 + 1.
If D is 0, the answer is N+1.
If D is negative, X is negated and D is negated.
The gcd function is called to find the greatest common divisor of the absolute values of X and D.
The values of X and D are then divided by the gcd value.
The code then creates a defaultdict called LR, which will be used to store the pairs of left and right values for each value of X.
The code then iterates through the range of values from 1 to N, and for each value, it calculates the left and right values using the formula (i-1)*i/2 and i*N - i*(i+1)/2.
The code then sorts the values in LR in ascending order.
The code then iterates through the values in LR, and for each value, it checks if the right value is less than the left value. If it is, it adds the difference between the right and left values to the ans variable.
Finally, the code prints the value of ans, which is 10.
