 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs N and k, which are 4 and 2 respectively.
The variable p is initialized to 0, which will be used to store the value of the function.
The variable p2 is also initialized to 0, which will be used to store the value of the function.
The variable memo is initialized to 0, which will be used to store the value of the function.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to N-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider values from 0 to 3.
For each value i in this range, it calculates the value of the function using the formula k*(p2+1)//(k-1) - 2.
The condition is met when i is 0, 1, 2 and 3.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of p2, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
