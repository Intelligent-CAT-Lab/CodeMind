 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes two integers as input, a and b, which are 2 and 2 respectively.
It then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 1000 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 1000.
For each number tax in this range, it calculates the tax amount by multiplying it by 0.08 and 0.1, which gives 8 and 10 respectively.
The code then checks if the calculated tax amounts are equal to a and b respectively. If they are, it sets the variable ans to the current number tax and breaks out of the loop.
In this case, the tax amount calculated for tax = 100 is 8.08 and 10.08, which are not equal to 2 and 2 respectively.
Therefore, the variable ans remains -1, which is the default value assigned to it.
<<<Output>>>
-1
