The code takes two inputs, x and y, which are separated by a space. In this case, x is 10 and y is 20.
The code then enters an if-elif-else block that checks the value of y.
If y is 0, the code checks if x is less than or equal to 0. Since x is 10, this condition is not met. Therefore, the code moves to the next if statement.
If y is greater than 0, the code checks if x is less than or equal to -y. Since x is 10 and y is 20, this condition is not met. Therefore, the code moves to the next if statement.
If y is less than 0, the code checks if x is less than or equal to -y. Since x is 10 and y is -20, this condition is met. Therefore, the code moves to the next if statement.
If 0 <= x <= y, the code checks if x is less than or equal to y. Since x is 10 and y is 20, this condition is not met. Therefore, the code moves to the next if statement.
If x < y < 0, the code checks if y is less than x. Since y is -20 and x is 10, this condition is not met. Therefore, the code moves to the next if statement.
If 0 <= x < -y, the code checks if x is less than -y. Since x is 10 and y is -20, this condition is not met. Therefore, the code moves to the next if statement.
If x > y, the code checks if x is greater than y. Since x is 10 and y is -20, this condition is not met. Therefore, the code moves to the next if statement.
If x < 0, the code checks if x is less than 0. Since x is 10, this condition is not met. Therefore, the code moves to the next if statement.
If y < 0, the code checks if y is less than 0. Since y is -20, this condition is met. Therefore, the code moves to the next if statement.
If x < y < 0, the code checks if x is less than y. Since x is 10 and y is -20, this condition is not met. Therefore, the code moves to the next if statement.
If 0 < x < y, the code checks if x is less than y. Since x is 10 and y is -20, this condition is not met. Therefore, the code moves to the next if statement.
If x > y, the code checks if x is greater than y. Since x is 10 and y is -20, this condition is not met. Therefore, the code moves to the next if statement.
If x < 0, the code checks if x is less than 0. Since x is 10, this condition is not met. Therefore, the code moves to the next if statement.
If y < 0, the code checks if y is less than 0. Since y is -20, this condition is met. Therefore, the code moves to the next if statement.
If x < y < 0, the code checks if x is less than y. Since x is 10 and y is -20, this condition is not met. Therefore, the code moves to the next if statement.
