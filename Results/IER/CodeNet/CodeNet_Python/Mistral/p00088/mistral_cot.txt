The code takes a string input from the standard input (stdin) and processes it using a dictionary d1 to convert each character in the string to its corresponding binary representation. The binary representation is then converted back to its corresponding ASCII character using another dictionary d2.
The resulting string is then printed to the console.
The input string "PETER POTTER" is processed as follows:
* P is converted to its binary representation "10100101" using d1.
* E is converted to its binary representation "10100010" using d1.
* T is converted to its binary representation "10100110" using d1.
* E is converted to its binary representation "10100010" using d1.
* R is converted to its binary representation "10010010" using d1.
* T is converted to its binary representation "10100110" using d1.
* E is converted to its binary representation "10100010" using d1.
* R is converted to its binary representation "10010010" using d1.
