 <<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a variable k to 103.
The variable now is initialized to 100.
The variable cnt is initialized to 0.
The code enters a while loop that continues as long as now is less than k.
Inside the loop, the code multiplies now by 1.01 and converts it back to an integer.
The code then increments cnt by 1.
The loop continues until now is equal to or greater than k, which is not the case in this input.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the value of cnt, which is 0.
<<<Output>>>
0
