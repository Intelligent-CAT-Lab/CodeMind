 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the Decimal module from the decimal package.
Then it reads two inputs from the user, a and b, separated by a space.
The first input, a, is converted from string to integer using the int() function.
The second input, b, is converted from string to decimal using the Decimal() function.
The code then multiplies the integer a by the decimal b and converts the result back to an integer using the int() function.
Finally, the code prints the result of the multiplication.
