 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module and sets the input variable to sys.stdin.readline.
It then defines a constant MOD, which is 998244353.
The variable U is set to 10000, which is used as a limit for the factorial calculation.
The code then initializes two lists, fact and fact\_inv, to store the factorial and its inverse, respectively.
The factorial is calculated using a loop that iterates from 1 to U+1, and the inverse is calculated using the formula pow(fact[n], MOD-2, MOD).
The code then defines a function comb(n,k) that calculates the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time.
The function F(x,y,N) is defined to calculate the number of ways to partition a set of N elements into two subsets, one with x elements and the other with y elements, such that the sum of the elements in the subset with x elements is divisible by 2.
The function uses a loop to iterate over all possible values of x from 1 to N, and for each value of x, it calculates the number of ways to partition the set of N elements into two subsets that meet the condition.
The code then initializes an empty list answer, which will store the final result.
For each value of S from 3 to K+3 (inclusive), the code calls the function F(x,y,N) with the appropriate arguments and appends the result to the answer list.
The code then checks if K is odd or even, and if it is odd, it reverses the order of the answer list.
Finally, the code prints the final result by joining the elements of the answer list with newlines.
