 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first initializes the variables mod, H, W, and K with the values 10**9+7, 2, 1, and 2, respectively.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to store the final answer.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from H+W-1 to H+W-K-1, with a step size of -1. This means it will consider all possible values of i from H+W-1 to H+W-K-1, and then work backwards to find the value of i that satisfies the condition.
For each value of i, it calculates the value of const by multiplying i by the previous value of const, and then taking the result modulo mod.
It then calculates the value of inv by raising (H+W-1) to the power of (mod-2) modulo mod.
It then calculates the value of temp1 by multiplying (K*(K+1)//2) by const and then multiplying the result by inv.
It then calculates the value of u by multiplying (K*(K**2-1))//6 and then taking the result modulo mod.
It then calculates the value of temp2 by multiplying (2*H*W) by u and then multiplying the result by const.
Finally, it adds temp1 and temp2, and then adds K*H+W and then takes the result modulo mod.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 10.
