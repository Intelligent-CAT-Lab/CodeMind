 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first prompts the user to enter a string using the `input()` function and stores it in the variable `moji`.
It then initializes an empty string `ans` that will be used to store the output.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each character in the `moji` string.
For each character, it checks if it is equal to "1". If it is, it appends "1" to the `ans` string. If it is not, it appends "9" to the `ans` string.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of `ans`, which is "119".
<<<Output>>>
119
