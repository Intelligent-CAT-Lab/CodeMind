 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string and applies three replacements to it.
First, it replaces all occurrences of the string "apple" with "???".
Then, it replaces all occurrences of the string "peach" with "apple".
Finally, it replaces all occurrences of the string "???" with "peach".
The resulting string is "the cost of one apple is higher than that of one peach."
<<<Output>>>
"the cost of one apple is higher than that of one peach."
