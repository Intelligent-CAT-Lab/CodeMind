 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first reads an integer K from the user. In this case, K is 101.
The code then checks if K is divisible by 7. Since 101 is not divisible by 7, the code proceeds to the else block.
In the else block, the code calculates L as 9 * K. Since K is 101, L is 909.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to L. In each iteration, the code calculates the remainder of n (which is 10 in this case) divided by L. If the remainder is 1, it means that n is one more than a multiple of L, and the code breaks out of the loop and sets ans to the current value of i.
In this case, the remainder of 10 divided by 909 is 1, so ans is set to 11.
<<<Output>>>
11
