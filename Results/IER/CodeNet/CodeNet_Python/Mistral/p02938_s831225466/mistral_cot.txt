 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable L and variable R are initialized to 2 and 3, respectively.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 63 (inclusive), meaning it will consider all possible combinations of bits from 0 to 63.
For each combination of bits, it checks if L and R have the same number of bits and if the bits are within the range [0, 1].
If L and R have the same number of bits and all bits are within the range [0, 1], the code sets the value of DP[0][0][0] to 1.
Else, the code sets the value of DP[0][1][0] to 1.

After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ANS, which is 1.
