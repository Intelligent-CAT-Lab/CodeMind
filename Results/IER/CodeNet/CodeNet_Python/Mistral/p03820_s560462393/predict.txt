The return value of the code would be 0, since the input N and K are not valid.

The code checks if N is equal to 1, and if K is equal to 1, it prints 1.
If N is equal to K, it calculates the value of dp[N-1][1] using dynamic programming.
If N is not equal to K, it calculates the value of ans using the formula ans = dp[K-1][M-N+K] * cmb(M-2, N-K-1, mod).

In this case, the input N is 2 and K is 1, which are not valid. Therefore, the code does not execute any of the calculations and returns 0.
