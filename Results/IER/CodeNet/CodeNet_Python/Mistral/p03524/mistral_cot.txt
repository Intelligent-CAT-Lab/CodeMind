<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an input string S, which is `abac`.
It then initializes a dictionary called s\_frq\_dict with three keys: 'a', 'b' and 'c', and three corresponding values: 0, 0 and 0.
The code then iterates over each character in the input string S, and for each character, it increments the corresponding value in the s\_frq\_dict dictionary by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code converts the s\_frq\_dict dictionary to a list of its values using the list() function, and stores it in a variable called frqs.
The code then calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values in frqs, which is 2.
Since the difference is greater than 1, the code prints 'NO'.
<<<Output>>>
NO
