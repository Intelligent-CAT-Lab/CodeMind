 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the math module and defines a function called comb that takes two arguments x and y and returns the ratio of factorial(x)//factorial(x-y)//factorial(y).
The code then reads in the input values w, h, ax, ay, bx, by using the map() function and stores them in the variables w, h, ax, ay, bx, by.
The code then calculates the minimum distance between the two points (dx, dy) by taking the minimum of the absolute differences between the x and y coordinates of the two points and the absolute differences between the x and y coordinates of the two points.
The code then calculates the answer (ans) by multiplying the value of dx*2 if it is equal to w, multiplying the value of dy*2 if it is equal to h, and multiplying the result of the comb() function with the sum of dx and dy.
Finally, the code prints the answer (ans) modulo 100000007.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code for the input `4 4 0 0 3 3` is 100.
