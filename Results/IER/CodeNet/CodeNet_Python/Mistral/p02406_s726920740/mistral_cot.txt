 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input n using the `input()` function and stores it in the variable `n`.
It then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n+1.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is divisible by 3 using the modulo operator `%`. If it is, it prints the number i.
If i is not divisible by 3, it enters another loop that iterates from the last digit of i to the first digit of i.
For each digit j in this range, it checks if j is equal to 3 using the modulo operator `%`. If it is, it prints the number i.
If j is not equal to 3, it divides i by 10 using integer division `//` and continues the loop.
After both loops finish, the code prints a newline character `\n` to move to the next line.

<<<Output>>>
30

The return value of the code is 30, which is the number that meets the condition of being divisible by 3 or having a digit equal to 3.
