The code first takes an integer input `num` from the user. It then initializes a list `check_list` of length `num * num` with all elements set to 0.
The function `make_bridge` takes two arguments `island1` and `island2`, which represent the two ends of a bridge. It checks if `island1` is less than `island2`, and if so, it sets the element at index `(island1-1)*num + (island2-1)` in the `check_list` to 1. Otherwise, it sets the element at index `(island2-1)*num + (island1-1)` to 1.
The code then checks if `num` is even or odd, and sets `sum_pair` accordingly.
The code then enters a nested loop that iterates over all pairs of numbers `i` and `j` from 0 to `num-1`. If the sum of `i+1` and `j+1` is not equal to `sum_pair`, it sets the element at index `j*num + i` in the `check_list` to 1.
The code then finds all elements in the `check_list` that are equal to 1, and increments a variable `bridge_num` for each such element.
Finally, the code prints all pairs of numbers `left` and `right` such that `check_list[left*num + right]` is equal to 1.

Given an input of `3`, the `check_list` will be initialized as `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,
