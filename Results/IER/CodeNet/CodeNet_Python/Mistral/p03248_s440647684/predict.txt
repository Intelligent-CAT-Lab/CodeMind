The code first checks if the first or last character of the input string is 0 or 1. If it is, it prints -1 and exits.
The code then checks if the input string has an even number of characters. If it does, it prints -1 and exits.
The code then checks if the input string has a palindrome structure. If it does, it stores the indices of the first and last characters of the palindrome in a list called possible.
The code then creates a list called edges, which will contain pairs of adjacent nodes in the graph. It does this by iterating over the possible indices and checking if each index is odd. If it is, it adds the next odd index to the edges list.
The code then creates the edges for the last node in the possible list by adding the next odd index to the edges list.
