 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string of symbols and uses a recursive descent parser to parse the input string into a list of integers.
The parser starts by splitting the input string into a list of tokens, where each token is either a number or a symbol.
The parser then uses a series of functions to parse the input string into a tree of expressions.
The parse_formula function is the top-level function that calls the parse_or function, which in turn calls the parse_and function, which in turn calls the parse_term function.
The parse_term function checks if the current token is "?" and returns [1, 1] if it is.
If the current token is "(" the parse_or function is called, which returns a tuple of two integers representing the zero and one values of the expression.
If the current token is ")" the parse_and function is called, which returns a tuple of two integers representing the zero and one values of the expression.
If the current token is "&" the parse_and function is called, which returns a tuple of two integers representing the zero and one values of the expression.
If the current token is "|" the parse_or function is called, which returns a tuple of two integers representing the zero and one values of the expression.
The final return value of the code is the tuple of two integers representing the zero and one values of the expression.
