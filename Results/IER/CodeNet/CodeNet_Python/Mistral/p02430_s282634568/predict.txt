The return value of the code for the input `5 3` would be:
```
0: 0
1: 1
2: 2
3: 3
4: 4
```
This is because the combinations of 3 numbers from the set [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] are:
```
(0, 1, 2) -> 0
(0, 1, 3) -> 1
(0, 1, 4) -> 2
(0, 2, 3) -> 3
(0, 2, 4) -> 4
(1, 2, 3) -> 5
(1, 2, 4) -> 6
(1, 3, 4) -> 7
(2, 3, 4) -> 8
```
And the corresponding bitwise representation of these numbers are:
```
0: 0
1: 1
2: 2
3: 3
4: 4
5: 11
6: 12
7: 13
8: 14
```
Therefore, the return value of the code for the input `5 3` is the list `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`.
