 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module, which provides access to some system-specific information and functions.
The function MI() is defined, which reads a line of input from sys.stdin, removes any whitespace at the beginning and end of the line, and splits the line into a list of integers using the split() method. The function returns this list of integers.
The code then reads the input from sys.stdin using the readline() method, which reads a line of input and returns it as a string. The rstrip() method is then called on this string to remove any whitespace at the end of the line. Finally, the split() method is called on this string to split it into a list of integers.
The variables N and K are assigned the values returned by the MI() function.
The code then checks if K is greater than ((N-1)*(N-2))//2. If it is, it prints -1 and exits the program.
If K is not greater than ((N-1)*(N-2))//2, the code prints the value of N-1+((N-1)*(N-2))//2-K.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to N. For each number i in this range, it prints 1 and i.
The code then enters another loop that iterates from 2 to N. For each number i in this range, it enters another loop that iterates from i+1 to N+1. For each pair of numbers (i,j), it checks if a is less than ((N-1)*(N-2))//2-K. If it is, it prints (i,j) and increments a by 1.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code based on the input 5 3 is 10.
