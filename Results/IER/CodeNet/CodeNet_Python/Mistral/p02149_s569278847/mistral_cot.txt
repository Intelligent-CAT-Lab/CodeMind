 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input, A, B and C, and stores them in the variables A, B and C, respectively.
The code then uses the `max()` function to find the maximum value among A, B and C.
The `max()` function returns the largest of the three arguments, so in this case, it returns 1000.
The code then checks if the maximum value is equal to A, B or C. Since the maximum value is 1000, which is equal to A, the code prints "A".
<<<Output>>>
A
