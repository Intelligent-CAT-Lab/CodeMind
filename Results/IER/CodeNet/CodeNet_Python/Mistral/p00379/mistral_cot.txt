 <<<Analysis>>>
The variables a, n, and m are initialized to 16, 2, and 1000, respectively.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the number of solutions.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 49 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 49.
For each number y in this range, it calculates the value of x by raising y + a to the power of n.
The code then checks if x is within the range [1, m] and if y is equal to the sum of the digits of x.
If both conditions are met, it increments the value of ans.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 1.
