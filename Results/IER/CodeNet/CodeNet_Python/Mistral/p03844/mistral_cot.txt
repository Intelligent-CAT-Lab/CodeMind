 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three inputs separated by a space, which are stored in the variables A, s and B.
The variable A is assigned the value of the first input, which is 1.
The variable B is assigned the value of the third input, which is 2.
The variable s is assigned the value of the second input, which is '+'.
The code then checks the value of s using an if-elif statement. Since s is equal to '+', the code executes the block of code under the if statement, which is `print(A+B)`.
The value of A+B is 3, which is printed to the console.
<<<Output>>>
3
