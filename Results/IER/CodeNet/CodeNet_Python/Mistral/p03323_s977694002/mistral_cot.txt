<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes two integers as input, a and b, separated by a space.
It then uses the `map()` function to convert the input string into a list of integers.
The `map()` function takes an iterable (in this case, a string) and applies a function of two arguments to each element, returning an iterator of the results.
The `int()` function is used to convert each element of the string to an integer.
The resulting list is assigned to the variables a and b.
The code then uses an `if` statement to check if both a and b are less than or equal to 8.
If both conditions are true, the code prints "Yay!". Otherwise, it prints ":(".
<<<Output>>>
Yay!
