 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the math module.
It then defines a function f(n, p1, p2) that takes three arguments: n, p1 and p2.
The function checks if n is equal to 0, and if so, it returns.
Otherwise, it initializes three empty lists: s, t and u.
It then calculates the values of s and t by taking the average of the first and second elements of p1 and p2, respectively.
It calculates the values of u by taking the difference between t and s, multiplying by the cosine and sine of 60 degrees, and adding s.
It then calls the function recursively with n-1, p1, s as arguments, and prints the values of s.
It then calls the function recursively with n-1, s, u as arguments, and prints the values of u.
It then calls the function recursively with n-1, u, t as arguments, and prints the values of t.
It then calls the function recursively with n-1, t, p2 as arguments, and prints the values of p2.
The function is then called with n = 1, p1 = [0,0] and p2 = [100,0].
The return value of the function is not specified, as the function does not return anything.
<<<Output>>>
The output of the code is:
```
[0.0, 0.0]
[50.0, 50.0]
[50.0, 50.0]
[100.0, 0.0]
```
This is the output of the recursive calls to the function, as the function does not return anything.
