 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input `x` from the user.
It then initializes a variable `n` to 1.
The code enters a while loop that continues until the remainder of `360 * n` divided by `x` is 0.
Inside the loop, `n` is incremented by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the value of `n * 360 // x`.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is 10.

The code works by repeatedly multiplying `n` by 360 and checking the remainder when divided by `x`. When the remainder is 0, it means that `x` divides evenly into `360 * n`, so the code prints the value of `n * 360 // x`.

In this case, `x` is 90, so `360 * n` must be a multiple of 90 for the remainder to be 0. The smallest value of `n` that satisfies this condition is 10, so the code prints 10.

Therefore, the return value of the code is 10.
