 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs, n and a, which are integers.
The variable ans is initialized to 10**18, which is a very large number.
The code then enters a loop that iterates 41 times.
For each iteration, it initializes two variables, l and r, to 0 and n, respectively.
It then enters a while loop that continues until r-l is equal to 1.
Inside the while loop, it calculates the midpoint m by averaging r and l.
If m raised to the power of k+1 is greater than or equal to n, it sets r to m.
Otherwise, it sets l to m.
After the while loop finishes, it enters another loop that iterates k+2 times.
Inside this loop, it calculates the product of l raised to the power of m and r raised to the power of (k+1)-m.
If this product is greater than or equal to n, it updates the value of ans to be the minimum of the current value of ans and the product of k*a+l*m+r\*(k+1)-m.
After the second loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code for the input 8 1 is 10.
