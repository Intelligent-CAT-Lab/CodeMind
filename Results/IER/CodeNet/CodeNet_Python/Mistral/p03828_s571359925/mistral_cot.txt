 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the necessary modules: sys, math and collections.
It then defines a constant MOD, which is used to handle integer overflow.
The function prime\_decomposition takes an integer n as input and returns a list of its prime factors.
The function solve takes an integer N as input and calculates the answer by multiplying the sum of the prime factors of N! (factorial of N) by (N+1).
The main function reads the input from the standard input, converts it to an integer and calls the solve function with the input.
The return value of the solve function is printed to the standard output.
<<<Output>>>
1

Therefore, the return value of the code for input `3` would be 1.
