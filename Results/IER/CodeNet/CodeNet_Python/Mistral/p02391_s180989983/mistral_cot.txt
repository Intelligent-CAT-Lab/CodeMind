 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, a and b, separated by a space. The input is `1 2`.
The code then compares the two numbers using an if-elif-else statement.
If a is greater than b, it prints "a > b".
If a is less than b, it prints "a < b".
If a is equal to b, it prints "a == b".
In this case, a is 1 and b is 2, so the condition a > b is not met. The condition a < b is also not met. However, the condition a == b is met, so the code prints "a == b".
<<<Output>>>
a == b
