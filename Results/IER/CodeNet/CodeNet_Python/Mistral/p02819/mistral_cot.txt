 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `check` takes an integer `num` as input and returns `True` if `num` is prime, and `False` otherwise.
The function first checks if `num` is greater than 1, since 1 is not considered prime. If `num` is greater than 1, it enters a loop that iterates from 2 to `num-1`. For each `i` in this range, it checks if `num` is divisible by `i`. If it is, it returns `False` and breaks out of the loop. If the loop completes without finding a divisor, it returns `True`.
The main program then reads an integer `a` from the user, and enters a loop that iterates from `a` to 100499. For each `i` in this range, it calls the `check` function with `i` as input. If the function returns `True`, it prints `i` and breaks out of the loop.
For the input `20`, the function `check` returns `False`, since 20 is not prime. Therefore, the main program does not print anything for this input.
<<<Output>>>
No output for the input `20`.
