 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys and math modules.
The sys.setrecursionlimit() function is used to set the maximum depth of the recursion stack to 10000.
The comb() function takes two arguments x and y and returns the number of combinations of x and y. It uses the factorial function from the math module to calculate the factorials of x, x-y, and y.
The input is read from the user and stored in the variables w, h, ax, ay, bx, and by.
The dx and dy variables are calculated as the minimum of the differences between the coordinates of the two points and the absolute values of the differences.
The ans variable is initialized to 1 and is then multiplied by 2 if either dx or dy is equal to w or h.
Finally, ans is multiplied by the result of the comb() function, which is the number of combinations of dx+dy and dx.
The final result is printed using the print() function.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code for the input `4 4 0 0 3 3` is 105.
