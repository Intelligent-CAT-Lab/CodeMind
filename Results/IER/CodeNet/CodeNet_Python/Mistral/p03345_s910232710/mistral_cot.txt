 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module and sets the recursion limit to 10^8.
It then sets the input variable to sys.stdin.readline, which reads a line from the standard input.
The main function is defined, which takes four integer arguments A, B, C and K.
The function calculates the difference between A and B, which is 1 in this case.
If K is even, the function prints the result, which is 1.
If K is odd, the function prints the negative of the result, which is -1.
The main function is called when the script is run.
