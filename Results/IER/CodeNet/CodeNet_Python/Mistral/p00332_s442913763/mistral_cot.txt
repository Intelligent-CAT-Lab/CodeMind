 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes two integers as input, e and y, using the `input().split()` method.
The variable e is assigned the value 0, and y is assigned the value 2015.
The code then checks the value of e using an if-elif-else statement.
Since e is equal to 0, the code checks the value of y using another if-elif-else statement.
Since y is greater than 1989, the code assigns the value "H" to the variable ans, and then adds the value of y-1989+1 to it.
The final value of ans is "H2016".
<<<Output>>>
H2016
