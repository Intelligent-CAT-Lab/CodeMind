The code first imports the heapq module, which is used to implement the Dijkstra algorithm.
The variable K is initialized to 6, which is the number of nodes in the graph.
The code then creates a list of lists called edge, where each inner list represents the edges of a node. Each edge is represented as a tuple of the form (node, cost), where node is the destination node and cost is the cost of the edge.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to K (inclusive), meaning it will consider edges from node 1 to node 6.
For each edge, it appends two tuples to the corresponding inner list of the edge. The first tuple represents an edge from the current node to the next node modulo K (i.e., the next node in the cycle), with a cost of 1. The second tuple represents an edge from the current node to the next node modulo K (i.e., the next node in the cycle), with a cost of 0.
The code then defines a function called dijkstra, which takes three arguments: fro (the starting node), to (the destination node), and v (the number of nodes in the graph).
The function initializes two lists called dist and check, which will be used to store the shortest distances from fro to all other nodes, and a flag indicating whether a node has been visited, respectively.
The function also initializes the value of dist[fro] to 0 and pq to a list containing the starting node and its cost.
The function then enters a loop that iterates v times.
For each iteration, it finds the node with the smallest cost in pq and updates the distances from that node to all its neighbors.
The function returns the value of dist[to], which is the shortest distance from fro to to.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is 10, which is the shortest distance from node 1 to node 0 in the given graph.
