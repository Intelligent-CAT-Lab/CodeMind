 <<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function `main()` that takes no arguments.
The function first reads two integers `x` and `y` from the user using the `input()` function and the `split()` method to split the input string by spaces.
The function then defines two lists `a` and `b` with the following values:
```
a = [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12]
b = [4, 6, 9, 11]
```
The function then checks if `x` is equal to 2 or if `y` is equal to 2. If either of these conditions is true, the function prints "No".
If neither of these conditions is true, the function checks if `x` is in the list `a` and if `y` is in the list `a`. If both of these conditions are true, the function prints "Yes".
If neither of these conditions is true, the function checks if `x` is in the list `b` and if `y` is in the list `b`. If both of these conditions are true, the function prints "Yes".
If neither of these conditions is true, the function prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
