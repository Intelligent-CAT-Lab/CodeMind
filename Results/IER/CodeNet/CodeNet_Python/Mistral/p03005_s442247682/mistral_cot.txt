 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs, x and y, separated by a space. It then splits the input string using the split() method and assigns the two resulting strings to the variables x and y.
The code then converts the string values of x and y to integers using the int() function and assigns them to the variables N and K, respectively.
The code then checks if K is equal to 1. If it is, it prints 0. Otherwise, it prints the value of N minus K.
In this case, x is "3" and y is "2", so N is 3 and K is 2. Since K is not equal to 1, the code prints 3-2, which is 1.
