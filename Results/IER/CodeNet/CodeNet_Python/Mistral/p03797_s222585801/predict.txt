The return value of the code for the input `1 6` is 3.
The condition N >= M is not met, so the code moves to the next condition N*2 <= M. Since 1*2 <= 6, it adds 1 to count.
The condition N*2 <= M is also not met, so the code moves to the next condition N*2 < M - N*2. Since 1*2 < 6 - 1*2, it adds 1 to count.
The condition N*2 < M - N*2 is also not met, so the code moves to the next condition N*2 < M - N*2. Since 1*2 < 6 - 1*2, it adds 1 to count.
The condition N*2 < M - N*2 is also not met, so the code moves to the next condition N*2 < M - N*2. Since 1*2 < 6 - 1*2, it adds 1 to count.
The condition N*2 < M - N*2 is also not met, so the code moves to the next condition N*2 < M - N*2. Since 1*2 < 6 - 1*2, it adds 1 to count.
The condition N*2 < M - N*2 is also not met, so the code moves to the next condition N*2 < M - N*2. Since 1*2 < 6 - 1*2, it adds 1 to count.
The condition N*2 < M - N*2 is also not met, so the code moves to the next condition N*2 < M - N*2. Since 1*2 < 6 - 1*2, it adds 1 to count.
The condition N*2 < M - N*2 is also not met, so the code moves to the next condition N*2 < M - N*2. Since 1*2 < 6 - 1*2, it adds 1 to count.
The condition N*2 < M - N*2 is also not met, so the code moves to the next condition N*2 < M - N*2. Since 1*2 < 6 - 1*2, it adds 1 to count.
The condition N*2 < M - N*2 is also not met, so the code moves to the next condition N*2 < M - N*2. Since 1*2 < 6 - 1*2, it adds 1 to count.
The condition N*2 < M - N*2 is also not met, so the code moves to the next condition N*2 < M - N*2. Since 1*2 < 6 - 1*2, it adds 1 to count.
The condition N*2 < M - N*2 is also not met
