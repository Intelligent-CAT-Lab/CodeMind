 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 4.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 4.
For each number k in this range, it calculates the sum of its divisors using the divCount function.
The sum of divisors for 1 is 1, for 2 is 2, for 3 is 6 and for 4 is 12.
The code then multiplies each sum by the corresponding number k and adds them up.
The final value of so_far is 1 + 2 + 6 + 12 = 19.
The code then prints the final value of so_far, which is 19.
<<<Output>>>
19
