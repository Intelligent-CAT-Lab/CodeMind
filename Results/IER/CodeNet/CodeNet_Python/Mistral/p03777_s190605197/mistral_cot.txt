 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an input string, which is split into two parts using the split() method. The first part is stored in the variable a and the second part is stored in the variable b.
Then, it checks if a is equal to b. If it is, the variable res is set to 'H', otherwise it is set to 'D'.
Finally, the code prints the value of res.
<<<Output>>>
H
