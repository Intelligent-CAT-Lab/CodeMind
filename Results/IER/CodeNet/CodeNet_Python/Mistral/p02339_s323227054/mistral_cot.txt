 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N and K are initialized to 4 and 3, respectively.
The variable MOD is set to 10**9 + 7.
The function comb(N, K) is used to calculate the number of combinations of N items taken K at a time.
The function pow(N) is used to calculate N raised to the power of k modulo MOD.
The function inv(N) is used to calculate the modular inverse of N.
The variable ans is initialized to the result of pow(k).
The variable sig is initialized to -1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from k-1 to 1.
For each i in this range, it calculates the product of the combination of k and i, the power of i and the inverse of i, all modulo MOD.
The product is added to ans.
After the loop finishes, the code calculates the final value of ans by multiplying it by the inverse of 1, 2, 3 and 4, all modulo MOD.
Finally, the code prints the final value of ans.
