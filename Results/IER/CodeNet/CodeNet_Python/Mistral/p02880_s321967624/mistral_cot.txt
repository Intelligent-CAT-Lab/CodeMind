 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input n using the `input()` function and converts it to an integer using the `int()` function.
It then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 9 (inclusive), meaning it will check if n is divisible by any number in this range.
For each number i in this range, it checks if n is divisible by i using the modulo operator `%`. If it is, it checks if n divided by i is less than 10 using the division operator `/`. If both conditions are met, it prints "Yes" and exits the loop using the `exit()` function.
If the loop completes without finding a number that satisfies both conditions, it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
