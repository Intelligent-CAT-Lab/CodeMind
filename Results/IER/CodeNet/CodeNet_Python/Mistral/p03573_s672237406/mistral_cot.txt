 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input, a, b and c, separated by spaces.
The code then checks if a is equal to b, if it is, it prints c.
If a is not equal to b, it checks if a is equal to c, if it is, it prints b.
If neither of the above conditions are met, it prints a.
In this case, a is 5, b is 7 and c is 5.
Since a is not equal to b, the code checks if a is equal to c. Since a is not equal to c, the code prints a, which is 5.
<<<Output>>>
5
