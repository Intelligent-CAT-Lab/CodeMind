 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and k are initialized to 3 and 2, respectively.
The variable ans is initialized to 1, which will be used to accumulate the final answer.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to min(k, n-1)+1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 2.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the product of two combinations using the formula (C(n, i) * C(n-1, i)) % MOD, where C(n, i) is the number of combinations of n items taken i at a time.
The code then adds the result of this calculation to ans.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 1.
