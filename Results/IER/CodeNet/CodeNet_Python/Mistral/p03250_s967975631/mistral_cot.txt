 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input as a string, which is then split using the split() method to create a list of integers. The list is stored in the variable l.
The map() function is used to convert the input string into a list of integers.
The list is then sorted using the sort() method.
The code then calculates the sum of the second and third elements of the sorted list, which is 5 + 2 = 7.
Finally, the code adds the first element of the list (which is 1) to the sum of the second and third elements, which gives a final result of 8.
<<<Output>>>
8
