 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes a list of integers as input, which is `[100]` in this case.
The length of the list is 1, so the first `if` condition is not met.
The second `if` condition checks if the first element of the list is not equal to 9. In this case, it is not, so the second `if` condition is not met.
The third `if` condition checks if the length of the set of the second element and all the other elements is equal to 1 and if the second element is equal to 9. In this case, the length of the set of the second element and all the other elements is 1 and the second element is not equal to 9, so the third `if` condition is not met.
The fourth `if` condition checks if the length of the set of all the elements is equal to 1. In this case, the length of the set of all the elements is 1, so the fourth `if` condition is met.
The code then prints `9*l`, which is `9*1` in this case, which is `9`.
