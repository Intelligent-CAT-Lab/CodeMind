 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first prompts the user to enter a number N using the `input()` function. The input is then converted to an integer using the `int()` function and stored in the variable N.
The code then calculates the value of x by multiplying N by (N+1) and dividing the result by 2. This can be simplified to N*(N+1)/2.
The value of x is then printed using the `print()` function.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code would be 35.
