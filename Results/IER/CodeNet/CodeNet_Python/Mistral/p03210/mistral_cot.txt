 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an input from the user using the `input()` function and stores it in the variable `X`.
The code then checks if `X` is equal to '7', '5' or '3' using an `if` statement.
If `X` is equal to '7', '5' or '3', the variable `ans` is set to 'YES'. Otherwise, `ans` is set to 'NO'.
Finally, the code prints the value of `ans` using the `print()` function.
<<<Output>>>
NO
