 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an input string S and checks if its length is 2. If it is, it checks if the first and second characters are equal. If they are, it prints 1, 2. Otherwise, it prints -1, -1 and exits the program.
If the length of S is not 2, it enters a loop that iterates from the third character to the end of the string, with a step of 3. For each substring of length 3, it checks if the set of its characters has a size of 2 or less. If it does, it prints the starting index and the ending index of the substring and breaks out of the loop. If it doesn't, it prints -1, -1.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is -1, -1.
