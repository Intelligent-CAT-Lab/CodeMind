 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input as a list of integers separated by spaces. The input is then converted to a list using the `list()` function.
The `map()` function is used to convert each element of the input list to an integer.
The `input().split()` method is used to split the input string into a list of strings, where each string represents an integer.
The `map()` function is then used to convert each string to an integer.
The resulting list is stored in the variable `num`.
The `sort()` method is then called on the `num` list to sort it in ascending order.
The code then checks if the first element of the sorted list is equal to the second element, and if the third element is equal to the fourth element.
If both conditions are true, the code prints "yes". Otherwise, it prints "no".
<<<Output>>>
no
