 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input n using the `input()` function and converts it to an integer using the `int()` function.
The function `factorize()` is then called with n as its argument.
The function `factorize()` uses a while loop to iterate until the square of the current value of b (which is 2 initially) is greater than n.
Inside the while loop, it uses another while loop to repeatedly divide n by b until n is no longer divisible by b. At each iteration, it appends b to the list fct.
After the inner while loop finishes, it increments b by 1.
After the while loop finishes, it checks if n is greater than 1. If it is, it appends n to the list fct.
Finally, the function returns the list fct.
The code then converts the list fct to a string using the `join()` method and the `str()` function, and prints the result using the `print()` function.
