 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input `x` from the user.
It then enters two nested loops that iterate from -1000 to 1000 (inclusive) for both `i` and `j`.
For each iteration of the outer loop, it calculates `i**5` and `j**5` and compares them to `x`.
If the two values are equal, it prints the values of `i` and `j` and breaks out of the loops.
If the two values are not equal, it continues to the next iteration of the outer loop.
If the inner loop completes without finding a match, it continues to the next iteration of the outer loop.
If the outer loop completes without finding a match, it prints "No solution found".
<<<Output>>>
No solution found
