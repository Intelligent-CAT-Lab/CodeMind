 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first initializes two variables a and b with the input values of 3 and 20, respectively.
The variable count is initialized to 1, which will be used to keep track of the number of times x is doubled.
The variable x is initialized to the value of a, which is 3.
The code then enters a while loop that continues as long as x * 2 is less than or equal to b.
Inside the loop, x is doubled and the value of count is incremented by 1.
The loop continues until x * 2 is greater than b, which means that x is 65536.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the value of count, which is 16.
<<<Output>>>
16
