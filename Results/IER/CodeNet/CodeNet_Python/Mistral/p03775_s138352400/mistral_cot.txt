 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input N, which is 10000.
The variable mini is initialized to the length of the string representation of N, which is 5.
The variable lim is initialized to the length of the string representation of the square root of N, which is 10.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to the square root of N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 2 to 10.
For each number i in this range, it checks if N is divisible by i. If it is, it compares the length of the string representation of i and N//i using the function function(). If the length of the string representation of i is greater than the length of the string representation of N//i, it updates the value of mini.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of mini, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
