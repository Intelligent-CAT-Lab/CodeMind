The variable n and variable k are initialized to 3 and 5, respectively.
The variable mod is initialized to 10**9 + 7.
The variable star is a 2D list of size 1001x1001, initialized with 1 at position (1,1), 1 at position (1,i) and 0 at position (0,i).
The function search takes two arguments, n and k, and returns the value of star[n][k] modulo mod.
The function search first checks if n is less than k, in which case it returns 0.
If star[n][k] is not None, it returns star[n][k] modulo mod.
If star[n][k] is None, it calculates the value of star[n][k] using the recursive formula:
star[n][k] = (search(n-1, k-1) + k * search(n-1, k)) % mod
The function search is called k times, with k ranging from 1 to 5.
The final value of ans is the sum of the values returned by the function search for each value of k, modulo mod.
