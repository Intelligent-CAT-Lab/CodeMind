 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, N and K. N is the number of elements in the array and K is the number of elements to be removed.
The variable count is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the number of elements in the array after removing K elements.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from K+1 to N+1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider all possible values of the array after removing K elements.
For each value i in this range, it calculates the number of elements in the array that are greater than or equal to i, and adds it to count.
The code also checks if there are any elements in the array that are less than i and greater than or equal to K, and adds it to count.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if K is equal to 0. If it is, it subtracts the number of elements in the range [K+1, N] from count.
Finally, the code prints the final value of count.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code for the input `5 2` is 10.
