 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes three input values, which are stored in the list rgb. Each value is converted to a string using the built-in `str()` function and then converted back to an integer using the built-in `int()` function. The resulting list is then converted to a string using the built-in `join()` function.
The resulting string is then converted to an integer using the built-in `int()` function and the remainder of the integer division by 4 is checked using the modulo operator `%`.
If the remainder is 0, the code prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'.
<<<Output>>>
NO
