 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module, which provides access to some system-specific functions and variables.
The read, readline and readlines functions are used to read input from the standard input stream.
The input is read as a string and split into N, d and x using the split() method.
The main function takes N, d and x as arguments and returns a value.
The while loop iterates until N becomes 0.
In each iteration, the value of ret is updated by adding d + (N-0.5) \* x.
The value of d is updated by adding d/N + (5*x)/(2*N).
The value of x is updated by adding 2*x/N.
The value of N is decremented by 1.
After the loop finishes, the value of ret is returned.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code for the input `1 3 3` would be 10.
