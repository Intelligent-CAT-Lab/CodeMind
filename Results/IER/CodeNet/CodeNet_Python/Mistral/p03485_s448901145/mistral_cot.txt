<<<Analysis>>>
The code imports the math module, which provides access to mathematical functions.
The input is read from the user using the input() function and split into two variables a and b using the split() method.
The input is then converted to integers using the map() function.
The code calculates the average of a and b by dividing them by 2 and storing the result in the variable sum.
The ceil() function from the math module is then called with the argument sum, which rounds the result up to the nearest integer.
The final result is printed to the console.
