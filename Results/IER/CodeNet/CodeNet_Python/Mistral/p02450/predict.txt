The return value of the code is a list of all permutations of the numbers from 1 to the number entered by the user.
For example, if the user enters 2, the output will be:
```
(1, 2)
(2, 1)
```
If the user enters 3, the output will be:
```
(1, 2, 3)
(1, 3, 2)
(2, 1, 3)
(2, 3, 1)
(3, 1, 2)
(3, 2, 1)
```
and so on.
