The variable n is initialized to the input string, which is "36".
The function solve1 is called with n as its argument.
The function solve1 first converts the input string to a list of integers using the map function. It then reverses the list and appends 0 to it.
It then iterates through the list, adding the current element to ans if it is less than 5, or adding 5 to ans if it is equal to 5 and the next element is less than 5. If the current element is greater than 5, it subtracts 10-c from ans and adds 1 to the next element.
Finally, it adds the last element of the list to ans.
The function solve2 is called with n as its argument.
The function solve2 initializes a 2D array dp with INF as its initial value. It then iterates through the input string, converting each element to an integer and adding it to dp.
For each element, it checks if it is less than 10 and updates dp[i+1][0] with the minimum of dp[i+1][0] and dp[i][j]+x.
If it is greater than 0, it updates dp[i+1][1] with the minimum of dp[i+1][1] and dp[i][j]+(10-x).
Finally, it prints the value of dp[n\_len][0], which is the minimum number of operations required to convert the input string to a valid number.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of solve1 is 15, which is the sum of the digits of the input string "36".
The return value of solve2 is 2, which is the minimum number of operations required to convert the input string "36" to a valid number.
