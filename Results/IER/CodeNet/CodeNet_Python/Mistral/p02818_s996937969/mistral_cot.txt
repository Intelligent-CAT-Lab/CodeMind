 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input, a, b and k. In this case, a = 2, b = 3 and k = 3.
The code then checks if a is greater than or equal to k. Since a is not greater than or equal to k, the code moves to the next condition.
The code then checks if a plus b is greater than or equal to k. Since a plus b is not greater than or equal to k, the code moves to the final condition.
The code then checks if a plus b is less than k. Since a plus b is less than k, the code prints 0, 0.
<<<Output>>>
0 0
