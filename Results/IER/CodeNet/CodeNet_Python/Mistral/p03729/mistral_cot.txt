 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes three input values, a, b, and c, separated by spaces. The input values are then split using the `split()` method and stored in the variables a, b, and c.
The code then checks if the last character of a is equal to the first character of b, and if the last character of b is equal to the first character of c. If both conditions are true, the code prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'.
In this case, the last character of 'rng' is 'n', which is not equal to the first character of 'gorilla', so the condition is not met and the code prints 'NO'.
<<<Output>>>
NO
