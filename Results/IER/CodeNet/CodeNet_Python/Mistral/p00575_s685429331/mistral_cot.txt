 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input, a, b and c. In this case, a = 3, b = 0 and c = 10.
The variable d is initialized to 0 and i is initialized to 1.
The code enters a while loop that will continue until d is greater than or equal to c.
Inside the loop, the code checks if i is divisible by 7. If it is, it adds a, b and d to d. Otherwise, it only adds a to d.
The loop continues until d is greater than or equal to c, which is 10.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the value of i, which is 11.
<<<Output>>>
11
