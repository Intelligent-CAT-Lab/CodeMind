 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports several modules, including `sys`, `math`, `collections`, `bisect`, `itertools`, and `numpy`.
It also sets the recursion limit to 10^7, defines a constant `INF` and a constant `MOD`.
The code then defines a lambda function `ni` to read a single integer from standard input, a lambda function `ns` to read multiple integers from standard input separated by spaces, a lambda function `na` to convert a list of integers from standard input to a list of integers, and a lambda function `na1` to convert a list of integers from standard input to a list of integers with 1 subtracted from each element.

The main function is defined, which takes no arguments. It first defines a helper function `make_prime_nums` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list of prime numbers up to `n`. The function uses a simple trial division algorithm to check for primality.

The main function then reads an integer `n` from standard input using the `ni` function, and calls the `make_prime_nums` function with `n`. It then initializes an empty list `ans` to store the prime numbers that satisfy the condition.

The main function then iterates over the prime numbers returned by `make_prime_nums`, and checks if the last digit of the prime number is 1. If it is, the prime number is added to the `ans` list.

Once the `ans` list has `n` elements, the main function prints the elements of the list separated by spaces using the `print` function.

<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is the list of prime numbers that satisfy the condition, which is `[3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97]`.
