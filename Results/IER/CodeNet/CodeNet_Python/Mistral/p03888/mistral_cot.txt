 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the math and sys modules.
The function getinputdata() is defined, which takes no arguments and returns an array of strings.
The function prompts the user to enter data, which is then split into a list of strings using the split() method.
The list of strings is then appended to the array_result list.
The function then enters a while loop that continues until the user enters an empty string.
Inside the loop, the user is prompted to enter data again, which is then split into a list of strings and appended to the array_result list.
The loop continues until the user enters an empty string, at which point the function returns the array_result list.
The code then calls the getinputdata() function and stores the result in the arr_data variable.
The code then extracts the first two elements of the arr_data list, which are stored in the variables r1 and r2.
Finally, the code calculates the return value using the formula 1/((r2+r1) /(r1*r2)).
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code based on the input `2 3` would be 0.5.
