 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first prompts the user to enter an integer using the `input()` function and stores it in the variable `age`.
The code then checks if the value of `age` is equal to 1 using an `if` statement. If it is, the code prints the string "Hello World".
If the value of `age` is not equal to 1, the code uses another `if` statement to check if the value of `age` is greater than 1. If it is, the code prints the sum of two integers entered by the user using the `input()` function.
The code then ends.
<<<Output>>>
Hello World
