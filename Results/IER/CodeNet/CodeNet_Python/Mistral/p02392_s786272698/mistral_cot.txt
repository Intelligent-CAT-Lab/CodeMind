 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first reads a line of input from the user using the `raw_input()` function. This line is then split into three parts using the `split()` method, which returns a list of the parts separated by spaces.
The first element of the list is assigned to the variable `a`, the second element is assigned to the variable `b`, and the third element is assigned to the variable `c`.
The code then checks if the condition `(a<b)and(b<c)` is true. In this case, it is true because 1 is less than 3 and 3 is less than 8.
Since the condition is true, the code prints the string "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
