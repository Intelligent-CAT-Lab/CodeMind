 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the necessary modules: `sys`, `numpy`, `fft_convolve`, `fps_exp`, `make_fact`, `cumprod`.
It then defines some constants: `N` and `MOD`.
The `cumprod` function is defined to compute the product of all numbers from 1 to `N` modulo `MOD`.
The `make_fact` function is defined to compute the factorial of `N` modulo `MOD`.
The `fft_convolve` function is defined to compute the convolution of two signals using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).
The `fps_exp` function is defined to compute the exponentiation of a signal using the Fast Pseudo-Sine Transform (FPST).
The `main` function is defined to compute the sum of the first `N` numbers whose product is equal to the product of all numbers from 1 to `N` modulo `MOD`.
The `main` function first calls the `make_fact` function to compute the factorial of `N` modulo `MOD`.
It then calls the `cumprod` function to compute the product of all numbers from 1 to `N` modulo `MOD`.
It then calls the `fft_convolve` function to compute the convolution of the signal `f` with the signal `g`.
It then calls the `fps_exp` function to compute the exponentiation of the signal `h` using the FPST.
It then computes the sum of the first `N` numbers whose product is equal to the product of all numbers from 1 to `N` modulo `MOD`.
The `main` function is then called with the input `2 998244353`.

The return value of the code is 1.
