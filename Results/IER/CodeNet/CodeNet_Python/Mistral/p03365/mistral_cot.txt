 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized to 4.
The variable fact is initialized to an array of integers with length N+1, where each element is 1.
The variable ifact is also initialized to an array of integers with length N+1, where each element is 1.
The function nCk is defined to calculate the number of combinations of choosing k elements from a set of n elements.
The variable ans is initialized to 0.
The variable c0 is initialized to 0.
The code enters a loop that iterates from n/2 to n.
For each value of i in this range, it calculates the number of combinations of choosing i-1 elements from the first i-1 elements and i elements from the last i elements, and multiplies it by the product of the factorial of i and the factorial of n-i-1.
It then adds this value to ans, multiplied by i.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of ans.
