 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first reads the input `8 1` from the standard input.
It then initializes the variable `ans` to `8`, which is the minimum number of terms needed to sum up to `8` with a coefficient of `1`.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from `1` to `44` (inclusive), which is the maximum possible number of terms that can be used to sum up to `8` with a coefficient of `1`.
For each number `s` in this range, it calculates the minimum number of terms needed to sum up to `8` with a coefficient of `1` and a coefficient of `s` for the last term.
The minimum number of terms needed is calculated as `2^s + s-1`, which is the sum of the number of terms with a coefficient of `1` and the number of terms with a coefficient of `s`.
The code then checks if this minimum number of terms is less than or equal to `8`. If it is, it updates the value of `ans` to be the minimum number of terms needed.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of `ans`, which is `4`.
