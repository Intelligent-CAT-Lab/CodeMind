 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first defines a function MI() that takes no arguments and returns a tuple of three integers.
The function uses the map() function to convert the input string into a list of integers, which are then split using the split() method.
The three integers returned by the function are stored in the variables N, X, and T.
The code then checks if N is not divisible by X. If it is not, it calculates the answer as (N//X+1)*T. Otherwise, it calculates the answer as N//X*T.
Finally, the code prints the value of the answer.
