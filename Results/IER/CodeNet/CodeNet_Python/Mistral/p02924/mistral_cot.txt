 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input from the user using the `input()` function and stores it in the variable `n`.
Then it calculates the result by multiplying `n-1` with `n//2` and prints it.
The expression `n//2` returns the floor division of n by 2, which is the integer quotient.
So, when n is 2, the expression `n//2` returns 1, and the final result is `(2-1)*1 = 1`.
