 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string input from the user and checks if the string contains the character "7".
It does this by converting the input string to a list using the `list()` function, and then checking if the "7" character is in the list using the `in` keyword.
If the "7" character is found in the list, the code prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
