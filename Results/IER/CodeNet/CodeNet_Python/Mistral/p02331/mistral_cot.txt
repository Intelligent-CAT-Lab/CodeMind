 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers n and k as input, where n is the base of the number and k is the exponent.
The code uses the modulo operator to calculate the result of k raised to the power of n modulo 10^9 + 7.
The modulo operator is used to calculate the remainder of the division of k raised to the power of n by 10^9 + 7.
The result is then printed to the console.
<<<Output>>>
10

The return value of the code based on the input `2 3` would be 10.
