 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input N using the `input()` function and converts it to an integer using the `int()` function.
The variable `answer` is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the count of numbers that have 8 divisors.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 105.
For each number i in this range, it calls the `divisor()` function, which returns the number of divisors of i.
If the number of divisors is 8, the code increments the `answer` variable.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of `answer`, which is 11.
<<<Output>>>
11
