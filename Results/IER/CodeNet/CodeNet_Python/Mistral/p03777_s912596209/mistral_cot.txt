 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes two inputs from the user, separated by a space, using the `raw_input()` function. The inputs are then split using the `split()` method and stored in the variables `a` and `b`.
The code then checks if both `a` and `b` are equal to either "H" or "D". If both are equal to "H", the code prints "H". If both are equal to "D", the code prints "D". If either `a` or `b` is not equal to "H" or "D", the code prints "D".
<<<Output>>>
D
