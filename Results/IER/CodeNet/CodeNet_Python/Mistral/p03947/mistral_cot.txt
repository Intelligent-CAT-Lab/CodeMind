 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string as input and initializes a variable `ans` to 0.
It then iterates over the length of the string minus 1, meaning it will consider each pair of characters in the string.
For each pair of characters, it checks if they are different. If they are, it increments the value of `ans` by 1.
The condition is met when the pair of characters is `BW` or `WW`.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of `ans`, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
