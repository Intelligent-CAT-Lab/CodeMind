 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string input `s` and checks if it meets the following conditions:

* The first and last characters of the string are the same (i.e., `s[0]==s[-1]`).
* The length of the string is even (i.e., `len(s)%2==0`).

or

* The first and last characters of the string are different (i.e., `s[0]!=s[-1]`).
* The length of the string is odd (i.e., `len(s)%2==1`).

If either of these conditions is met, the code prints "First". Otherwise, it prints "Second".

For the input `aba`, the first and last characters are the same (`a`), and the length of the string is even (3). Therefore, the code prints "First".
