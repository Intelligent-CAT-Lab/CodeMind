The code first imports several modules, including `bisect`, `collections`, `copy`, `heapq`, `itertools`, `math`, `string`, and `sys`.
It also defines several helper functions, including `I()`, `F()`, `SS()`, `LI()`, `LI_()`, `LF()`, and `LSS()`, which are used to read input from the user.
The `combMod()` function is used to calculate the number of combinations of k items taken r at a time, modulo p.
The `resolve()` function is the main function that takes two integers n and k as input, and calculates the number of combinations of k items taken r at a time, modulo p.
The function first checks if n is greater than or equal to k. If it is, it calculates the number of combinations using the formula `combMod(k, k - i, p) * pow(k - i, n, p)` for i in the range [0, k-1]. It then sums up these values and takes the result modulo p.
If n is less than k, the function returns 0.
