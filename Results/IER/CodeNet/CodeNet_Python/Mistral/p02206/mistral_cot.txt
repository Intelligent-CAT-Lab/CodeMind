The code reads two integers n and k from the standard input using the MI() function.
It then initializes two variables l and r to 0 and 1 respectively.
The while loop continues until l+1<r, which is true in this case.
Inside the loop, the variable m is calculated as the average of l and r, which is 1 in this case.
The ok() function is then called with m as its argument.
The ok() function checks if m is less than or equal to k, which is true in this case.
If it is, it increments s by m and cnt by 1.
If s is greater than k, it returns False.
If cnt is equal to n, it breaks out of the loop.
Since n is 1 in this case, the loop will break after the first iteration.
The ok() function returns True, so the loop continues to the next iteration.
Since l+1<r is still true, the loop continues to the next iteration.
The ok() function is called again with m=1, which is less than or equal to k.
It increments s by 1 and cnt by 1.
Since s is still less than or equal to k, the loop continues to the next iteration.
The ok() function is called again with m=1, which is less than or equal to k.
It increments s by 1 and cnt by 1.
Since s is still less than or equal to k, the loop continues to the next iteration.

Since s is still less than or equal to k, the loop continues to the next iteration.
