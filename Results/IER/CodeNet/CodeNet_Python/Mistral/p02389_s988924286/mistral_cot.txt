<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes two integers as input, a and b, using the `input().split()` method. The input is split by spaces, so the two integers are separated by a space.
The `map()` function is then used to convert the input integers to integers.
The code then prints the product of a and b, which is 15, and the product of 2 and the sum of a and b, which is 14.
<<<Output>>>
15 14
