The code first uses the `map()` function to convert the input string into a list of integers. The `map()` function takes two arguments: an iterable (in this case, a string) and a function. The function converts each element of the iterable into the desired data type (in this case, integers). The `raw_input()` function is used to read input from the user, and the `split()` method is used to split the input string into a list of individual elements.
The `sorted()` function is then used to sort the list of integers in ascending order. The `reverse=True` argument is used to sort the list in descending order.
Finally, the `for` loop iterates over the sorted list of integers and prints each element.
