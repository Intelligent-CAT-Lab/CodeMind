 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first defines a function `gcd` that takes two arguments `x` and `y` and returns their greatest common divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm.
The function `gcd` is then called with the values of `a` and `b`, which are 8 and 12, respectively. The result is 4, which is the GCD of 8 and 12.
The variable `k` is set to 2, which means that the function should return the value 4 - 1 = 3.
The code then enters a while loop that iterates until `cnt` is equal to `k`. Inside the loop, `ans` is decremented by 1 and checked if it is a common divisor of `a` and `b`. If it is, `cnt` is incremented by 1.
After the loop finishes, the final value of `ans` is printed, which is 3.
