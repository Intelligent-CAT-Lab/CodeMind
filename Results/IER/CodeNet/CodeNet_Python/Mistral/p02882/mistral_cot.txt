 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three inputs, a, b and x, which are 2, 2 and 4 respectively.
The variable h is calculated as x divided by a squared, which is 0.5.
Since h is greater than or equal to b divided by 2, the code proceeds to calculate V as 2*(a**2)*b - x, which is 0.
The code then calculates the arctangent of V and converts it to degrees using the math.degrees() function, which returns 0.
Therefore, the return value of the code is 0.
<<<Output>>>
