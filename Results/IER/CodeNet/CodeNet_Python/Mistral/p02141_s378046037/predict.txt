The return value of the code is 0.0.

This is because the input values do not meet the conditions specified in the code. The sum of x and w divided by 2 is 20, which is greater than the sum of W and H divided by 2 (10). Therefore, the code adjusts the value of x to 10. The sum of y and h divided by 2 is 300, which is greater than the sum of W and H divided by 2 (10). Therefore, the code adjusts the value of y to 150. The final value of y divided by x is 150/10 = 15.0, which is printed by the code. However, the program then quits without returning a value.
