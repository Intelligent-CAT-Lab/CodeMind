 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input N using the `input()` function.
It initializes a variable `ans` to 0, which will be used to store the final answer.
It also initializes a variable `x` to 1, which will be used as a counter.
The code then enters a `while` loop that continues as long as 2*x-1 is less than or equal to N.
Inside the loop, it multiplies `x` by 2 and adds 1 to `ans`.
The loop continues until `x` is 3, at which point the loop condition becomes false and the loop exits.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of `ans`, which is 2.
