 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an input string `a` from the user.
It then converts the input string `a` to a list using the `list()` function.
The code then iterates through each character in the list `a` using a for loop.
If the character is `"?"`, it is replaced with `"D"`.
The code then creates an empty string `b` to store the modified string.
The code then iterates through each character in the list `a` using another for loop.
It appends each character to the string `b`.
Finally, the code prints the string `b`.
