 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the math module, which contains functions for mathematical operations.
The variables a, b, and C are initialized to 4, 3, and 90, respectively.
The code then converts the angle C from degrees to radians by multiplying it by pi/180.
The code then uses the Pythagorean theorem to calculate the length c of the hypotenuse of a right triangle with sides a and b. It also calculates the height of the triangle using the cosine function.
The code then calculates the size of the triangle by multiplying the base (b) by the height (h) and dividing by 2.
Finally, the code calculates the length of the triangle by adding the lengths of its sides (a, b, and c).
The code then prints the size, length, and height of the triangle with 8 decimal places using the format() function.
