 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an input N, which is `100`.
The first character of N is `1`, so c is set to 1.
The length of N is 3, so K is set to 3.
c + 9 \* (K - 1) - 1 is calculated as 1 + 9 \* 2 - 1 = 18.
The for loop iterates over the characters in N starting from the second character, which is `0`. Since 0 is not equal to "9", the loop breaks immediately.
Therefore, the final value of ans is 18.
<<<Output>>>
18
