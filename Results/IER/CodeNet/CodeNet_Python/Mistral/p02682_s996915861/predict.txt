The return value of the code for the input `2 1 1 3` is 6.
The code first assigns 2 to sum and subtracts 2 from K, resulting in K = 0.
Then it checks if K is greater than or equal to B and greater than or equal to 1, which is not the case, so it sets K to 0.
Then it checks if K is greater than or equal to C and greater than or equal to 1, which is not the case, so it subtracts K from sum, resulting in sum = 6.
Finally, the code prints the final value of sum, which is 6.
