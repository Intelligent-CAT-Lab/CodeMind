The code first takes three integers as input, a, b and c, which are 10, 10 and 5 respectively.
The variable t is initialized to 0, which will be used to keep track of the current time.
The code then enters a loop that iterates 61 times.
For each iteration, it checks if t is within the range [a, c]. If it is, it prints the current time in the format of HH:MM:SS.
The condition is met when t is 10:00:00, 10:05:00, 10:10:00, 10:15:00, 10:20:00, 10:25:00, 10:30:00, 10:35:00, 10:40:00, 10:45:00, 10:50:00, 10:55:00, 10:60:00, 10:65:00, 10:70:00, 10:75:00, 10:80:00, 10:85:00, 10:90:00, 10:95:00, 11:00:00, 11:05:00, 11:10:00, 11:15:00, 11:20:00, 11:25:00, 11:30:00, 11:35:00, 11:40:00, 11:45:00, 11:50:00, 11:55:00, 11:60:00, 11:65:00, 11:70:00, 11:75:00, 11:80:00, 11:85:00, 11:90:00, 11:95:00, 12:00:00, 12:05:00, 12:10:00, 12:15:00, 12:20:00, 12:25:00, 12:30:00, 12:35:00, 12:40:00, 12:45:00, 12:50:00, 12:55:00, 12:60:00, 12:65:00, 12:70:00, 12:75:00, 12:80:00, 12:85:00, 12:90:00, 12:95:00, 13:00:00, 13:05:00, 13:10:00, 13:15:00, 13:20:00,
