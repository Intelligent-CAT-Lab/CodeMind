 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an input `s` from the user. The input is expected to be in the format of `x.y`, where `x` is an integer and `y` is a string.
The code then splits the input `s` into two parts `x` and `y` using the `split()` method.
The code then checks if the last character of `y` is `)`. If it is, it means that the input is in the format of `x.(y)` and the code proceeds to solve the problem.
If the last character of `y` is not `)`, it means that the input is in the format of `x.y` and the code proceeds to solve the problem.
The code then solves the problem using the `solve()` function.
The `solve()` function takes two arguments `p` and `q` and calculates their greatest common divisor (GCD) using the `gcd()` function from the `math` module.
It then divides both `p` and `q` by their GCD and prints the result in the format of `p/q`.
If the last character of `y` is `)`, the code then calculates `a` and `b` using the formula `a = int(x+y+z)` and `b = int(x+y)`, where `z` is the substring of `y` starting from the index after the last occurrence of `)` and ending before the last occurrence of `)`.
It then calls the `solve()` function with the arguments `a-b` and `(pow(10, len(z))-1)*pow(10, len(y))`.
If the last character of `y` is not `)`, the code then calculates `a` and `b` using the formula `a = int(x+y+z)` and `b = int(x+y)`, where `z` is the substring of `y` starting from the index after the last occurrence of `)` and ending before the last occurrence of `)`.
It then calls the `solve()` function with the arguments `a-b` and `(pow(10, len(z))-1)*pow(10, len(y))`.

<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is not applicable as the code does not return any value. It only prints the result of the `solve()` function.
