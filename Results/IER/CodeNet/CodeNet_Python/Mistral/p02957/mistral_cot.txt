 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes two integers A and B as input, which are 2 and 16, respectively.
It then calculates the value of x using the formula (A**2 - B**2) / (2 \* (A - B)).
x = (2**2 - 16**2) / (2 \* (2 - 16)) = -12
Since x is not an integer, the condition x%1==0 is not met, so the code prints 'IMPOSSIBLE'.
<<<Output>>>
IMPOSSIBLE
