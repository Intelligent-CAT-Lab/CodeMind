 <<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by importing the math module.
The variable n is initialized to the input value, which is 5.
The variable rent is initialized to 100000.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n (inclusive), meaning it will run 5 times.
For each iteration, it calculates the new value of rent by multiplying the current value of rent by 1.05, dividing by 1000, and then rounding up to the nearest integer using the ceil() function from the math module. The result is then multiplied by 1000 to get the final value of rent.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of rent, which is 105000.
<<<Output>>>
105000
