 <<<Analysis>>>
The variables R, G, B, and n are initialized to 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively.
The variable cnt is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of solutions.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n//R+1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 16.
For each number r in this range, it enters another loop that iterates from (n-r*R)//G+1 to (n-r*R)//G (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from (n-r*R)//G+1 to (n-r*R)//G-1.
For each number g in this range, it calculates the remainder of (n-r*R-g*G)//B and assigns it to b.
The code then checks if r * R + g * G + b * B == n. If it is, it increments cnt.
The condition is met when r is 1, g is 1, and b is 1.
After the loops finish, the code prints the final value of cnt, which is 1.
