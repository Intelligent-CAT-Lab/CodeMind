 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module, which provides access to some system-specific information and functions.
It then sets the recursion limit to the maximum of 1000 or 10**9, which is 1000 in this case.
The input function is defined as a lambda function that reads a line from the standard input, removes the newline character and returns the result.
The code then reads the input as two integers n and k, separated by a space.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the final answer.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from k+1 to n (inclusive).
For each value of b in this range, it calculates the value val using the formula (b-k) * (n//b) + max(0, (n%b)-k+1).
If k is 0, it subtracts 1 from val.
The code then adds val to ans.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans.
<<<Output>>>
10
<Code>

The return value of the code based on the input `5 2` is 10.
