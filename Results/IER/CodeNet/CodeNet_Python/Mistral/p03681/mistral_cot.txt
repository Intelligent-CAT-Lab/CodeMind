 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the math module and defines a constant MAX as 10**9+7.
It then reads two integers N and M from the input, which are 2 and 2 respectively.
The code calculates the difference between N and M, which is 0.
Since the difference is 0, the code checks if the product of factorial of N and factorial of M is divisible by MAX. It is not, so the code prints 0.
<<<Output>>>
0
