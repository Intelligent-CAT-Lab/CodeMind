 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user, which is a string of three integers separated by spaces. The input is split using the `split()` method and converted to a list of integers using a list comprehension. The list is stored in the variable `A`.
The `sort()` method is then called on the list `A` to sort it in ascending order.
The code then checks if the first element of the sorted list is equal to 5, the second element is also equal to 5 and the third element is equal to 7. If all these conditions are met, it prints "YES", otherwise it prints "NO".
<<<Output>>>
NO
