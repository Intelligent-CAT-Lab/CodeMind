<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads input from the standard input (stdin) and stores it in the variable `stdin`.
It initializes a variable `ans` to 0, which will be used to accumulate the count of the number 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each character in `stdin`.
For each character, it checks if it is equal to "1". If it is, it increments the value of `ans` by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of `ans`, which is the count of the number 1 in the input.
