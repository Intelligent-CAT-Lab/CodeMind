 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input as a string, which is then split using the split() method to create a list of integers. The list is then converted to a list of integers using the map() function. The resulting list is sorted using the sorted() function.
The code then calculates the absolute difference between the sum of the first and third elements of the sorted list and the sum of the second and fourth elements of the sorted list.
The output of the code is the absolute difference between the sum of the first and third elements of the sorted list and the sum of the second and fourth elements of the sorted list.
