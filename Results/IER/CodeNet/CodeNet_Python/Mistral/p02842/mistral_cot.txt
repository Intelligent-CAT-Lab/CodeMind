 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input n, which is 432 in this case.
It then initializes an empty dictionary called dic.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 50001 (inclusive). For each number i in this range, it calculates the value of p by multiplying i by 1.08.
The calculated value of p is then used as the key in the dictionary dic. If the key already exists in the dictionary, the corresponding value of i is stored in the dictionary.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if the input n is present in the dictionary dic. If it is, the corresponding value of i is printed. If it is not, the string ":(" is printed.
<<<Output>>>
432
