 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user, which is a string of three integers separated by spaces. The input is stored in the variable s.
The code then checks if the first element of s (s[0]) is less than the second element of s (s[1]) and if the second element of s (s[1]) is less than the third element of s (s[2]).
If this condition is met, the code prints 'Yes'. Otherwise, it prints 'No'.
In this case, the input is 1 3 8, which satisfies the condition. Therefore, the code will print 'Yes'.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
