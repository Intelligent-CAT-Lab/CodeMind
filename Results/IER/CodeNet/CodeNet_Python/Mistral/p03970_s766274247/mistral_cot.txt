 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first initializes a variable `S` with the input string, which is `C0DEFESTIVAL2O16`.
It also initializes a variable `A` with the string `CODEFESTIVAL2016`.
The variable `ans` is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of mismatches between the two strings.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the length of the input string `S`.
For each character `S[i]` in the input string, it checks if it is equal to the corresponding character `A[i]` in the string `A`.
If they are not equal, it increments the value of `ans` by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of `ans`, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
