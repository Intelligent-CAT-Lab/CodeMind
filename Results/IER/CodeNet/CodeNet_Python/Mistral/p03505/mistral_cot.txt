 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input, K, A and B.
The first condition checks if A is less than or equal to B and K is greater than A. If this condition is true, the code prints -1.
The second condition checks if A is greater than or equal to K. If this condition is true, the code prints 1.
The third condition is executed if neither of the previous conditions are true. It calculates the difference between K and A, and then calculates the difference between A and B. It then divides the difference between K and A by the difference between A and B, and multiplies the result by 2. Finally, it subtracts 1 from the result.
For the input 4000 2000 500, the first condition is not met, the second condition is not met, and the third condition is met.
The difference between K and A is 4000 - 2000 = 2000, and the difference between A and B is 2000 - 500 = 1500.
The result of the calculation is (2000 - 1500) / (1500 - 2000) * 2 = -1.
Therefore, the return value of the code is -1.
<<<Output>>>
-1
