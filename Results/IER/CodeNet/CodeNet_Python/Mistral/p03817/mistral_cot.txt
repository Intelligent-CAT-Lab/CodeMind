 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input from the user using the `input()` function and stores it in the variable `x`.
The variable `ans` is initialized to 0 and will be used to store the final result.
The code then uses the `divmod()` function to divide `x` by 11 and assigns the quotient to `q` and the remainder to `r`.
The code then adds 2 times the value of `q` to `ans`.
The code then uses the `divmod()` function again to divide `r` by 6 and assigns the quotient to `q` and the remainder to `r`.
The code then adds the value of `q` to `ans`.
If the remainder `r` is greater than 0, the code adds 1 to `ans`.
Finally, the code prints the value of `ans`.

<<<Output>>>
10

So the return value of the code based on the input `7` would be 10.
