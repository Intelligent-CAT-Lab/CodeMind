 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes three input values, a, b and c, separated by spaces.
It then uses the `map()` function to convert each input value to a string.
The `input().split()` method splits the input string into a list of strings, which is then passed to the `map()` function.
The `map()` function converts each string in the list to a string, which is then assigned to the variables a, b and c.
The code then checks if the last character of a is equal to the first character of b, and if the last character of b is equal to the first character of c.
If both conditions are true, the code prints "YES", otherwise it prints "NO".
<<<Output>>>
NO
