<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string input from the user and stores it in the variable S.
The code then checks if S is equal to "AAA" or "BBB". If it is, it prints "No". Otherwise, it prints "Yes".
In this case, the input is "ABA", which is not equal to "AAA" or "BBB". Therefore, the code will print "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
