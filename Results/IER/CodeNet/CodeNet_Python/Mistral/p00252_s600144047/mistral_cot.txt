 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input, a, b and c, and uses the `map()` function to convert the input string into integers. The input string is `0 0 1`.
The code then checks if the tuple `(a,b,c)` is equal to `(1,1,0)` using the `==` operator. Since the tuple `(0,0,1)` is not equal to `(1,1,0)`, the code moves to the next `elif` statement.
The code then checks if the tuple `(a,b,c)` is equal to `(0,0,1)` using the `==` operator. Since the tuple `(0,0,1)` is not equal to `(1,1,0)`, the code moves to the final `else` statement.
The code then prints the string `'Close'`.
<<<Output>>>
'Close'
