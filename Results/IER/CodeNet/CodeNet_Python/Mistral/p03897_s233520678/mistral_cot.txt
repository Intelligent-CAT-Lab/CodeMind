 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the necessary modules: sys, numpy as np.
It then reads the input N from the standard input using sys.stdin.readline.
It initializes a 2D numpy array grid with zeros, with dimensions (N,N) and data type int8.
It sets the values of the grid at specific positions using boolean indexing.
It sets the values of the grid at positions (0,:), (-1,:), (:,0) and (:,-1) to 1.
It sets the values of the grid at positions (::2,::2), (1::2,1::2), (::6,1::6), (::6,5::6), (2::6,1::6), (2::6,3::6), (4::6,3::6), (4::6,5::6) to 0.
It uses numpy's where function to find the positions of the 1's in the grid and stores them in the variables x and y.
It prints the length of the x array and then prints each element of the x and y arrays using a for loop and the zip function.

<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is not applicable as it does not have a function that returns a value. The code simply prints the values to the console.

The output of the code for the input 2 would be:
```
0
```
This is because the input 2 is not a valid input for the grid, as it is not a multiple of 2 or 3.
