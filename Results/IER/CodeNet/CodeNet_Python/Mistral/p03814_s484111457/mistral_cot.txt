<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an input string `s` using the `input()` function.
It then uses the `find()` method to find the index of the first occurrence of the letter 'A' in the string `s`.
It uses the `rfind()` method to find the index of the last occurrence of the letter 'Z' in the string `s`.
The range `[s.find('A'):s.rfind('Z')+1]` is then used to extract the substring between the first occurrence of 'A' and the last occurrence of 'Z' (inclusive).
The `len()` function is then called on this substring to get its length.
The final value is printed using the `print()` function.
