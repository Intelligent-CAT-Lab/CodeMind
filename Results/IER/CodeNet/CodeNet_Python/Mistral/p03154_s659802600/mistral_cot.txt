 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input: H, W, and K.
It then calculates the value of P = H + W + 10^9 + 7.
The variable x is then calculated using the formula:
x = (K*(K+3))/2 + (K^3 - K)/3*H*W*pow(N*N-N, P-2, P)
where N = 10^9 + 7.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to K-1. For each iteration, it calculates the value of x using the formula:
x = x*(N-i)%P
where i is the current iteration value.
Finally, the code prints the value of x.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code for the input `2 1 2` is 10.
