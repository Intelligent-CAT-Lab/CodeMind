<<<Analysis>>>
The code first prints the string "Yes" if the input string is equal to "YAKI" in the first 4 characters, otherwise it prints "No".
The input string "YAKINIKU" has 9 characters, so the first 4 characters are "YAKI".
Since "YAKI" is not equal to "YAKINIKU", the condition is not met and the code prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
