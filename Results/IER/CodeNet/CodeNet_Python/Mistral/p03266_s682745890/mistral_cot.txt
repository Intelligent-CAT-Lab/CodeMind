 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs, N and K, and stores them in the variables N and K, respectively.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then calculates the value of a by dividing N by K and converting it to an integer.
The code then calculates the cube of a and adds it to ans.
The code then checks if K is even. If it is, it calculates the value of b by dividing (N+int(K/2)) by K and converting it to an integer.
The code then calculates the cube of b and adds it to ans.
After the calculations, the code prints the final value of ans.
