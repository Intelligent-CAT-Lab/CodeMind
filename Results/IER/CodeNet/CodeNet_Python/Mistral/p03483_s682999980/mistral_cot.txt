The code first imports the sys module and sets the input variable to sys.stdin.readline.
It then reads the input string S and calculates its length L.
The code then initializes a binary indexed tree bit with 0 values for all indices from 0 to L+1.
The function query_sum takes an integer i as input and returns the sum of all elements in the range [0, i].
The function add takes an integer i and an integer x as input and updates the binary indexed tree bit[i] to bit[i] + x.
The main function first initializes an empty dictionary A.
It then iterates over the input string S and for each character s, it checks if s is already in the keys of A. If it is, it appends the current index i to the list of indices associated with s. If it is not, it adds s to the keys of A with a list containing only the current index i.
The code then iterates over the keys of A and for each key-value pair (s, B), it checks if the length of B is odd. If it is, it increments the odd variable by 1.
If odd is greater than 1, the code prints -1. Otherwise, it initializes an empty list make_ind.
It then iterates over the keys of A and for each key-value pair (s, B), it checks if the length of B is odd. If it is, it finds the middle index mid of B and iterates over all indices b in B. If b is less than mid, it appends b to make_ind.
It then sorts make_ind in ascending order and initializes an array IND of length L with None values.
It then iterates over make_ind and for each index m in make_ind, it finds the character s associated with m and updates the IND[m] to m+1.
It then finds the index inv associated with the last element of the list A[s] and updates IND[inv] to L-m.
If the length of B is odd, it increments the dic[s] by 1.
The code then initializes the ans variable to 0 and iterates over the indices in IND. For each index a in IND, it adds a - query_sum(a) to ans and updates the binary indexed tree bit[a] to bit[a] + 1.
Finally, the code prints the value of ans.
