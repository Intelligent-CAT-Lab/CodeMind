 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized to 3, which is the length of the input string "abc".
The variable MOD is initialized to 998244353.
The variable ABC is a dictionary that maps each character in the alphabet to its index in the string "abc".
The variable S is initialized to the input string "abc".
The function bruteforce is called with the input string S.
The function dfs is a recursive function that is called by bruteforce.
The function dfs takes a string s as input and performs a depth-first search on the string.
The function dfs checks if the current string s has already been seen before by checking if the tuple of its characters is in the set used.
If it has not been seen before, it adds the current string s to the set used and recursively calls itself on the string s.
The function dfs also checks if the current string s has a cycle by checking if the tuple of its characters is in the set used.
If it has a cycle, it returns 1.
The function bruteforce returns the length of the set used by dfs.
The code then checks if the length of the set used by dfs is equal to 3.
If it is, it prints 1.
If it is not, it initializes two 3x3 matrices P and Q.
The matrix P is used to store the number of occurrences of each character in the string s.
The matrix Q is used to store the number of occurrences of each character in the string s, taking into account the cyclic structure of the string.
The code then performs a matrix multiplication on P and Q to count the number of occurrences of each character in the string s.
The code then calculates the answer by summing the number of occurrences of each character in the string s.
The code then checks if the string s has a cycle by checking if the tuple of its characters is in the set used.
If it has a cycle, it prints 1.
If it does not have a cycle, it prints the answer.
