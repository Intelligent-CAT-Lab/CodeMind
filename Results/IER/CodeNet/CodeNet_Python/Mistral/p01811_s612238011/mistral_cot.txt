 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first sets the recursion limit to 5010.
The function solve takes a string s as input and returns True if the string contains the substring "ABC" and False otherwise.
The function first checks if the length of the string is 3, in which case it returns True if the string is "ABC" and False otherwise.
If the length of the string is not 3, the function initializes variables a, b, and c to 0 and a list lis to an empty list.
It then iterates through the string, adding each character to the list lis and keeping track of the number of occurrences of each character.
After the loop finishes, the function checks if the sum of the occurrences of 'A', 'B', and 'C' is equal to 2. If it is not, the function returns False.
If the sum of the occurrences of 'A', 'B', and 'C' is equal to 2, the function checks if the string is equal to the list lis. If it is not, the function returns False.
If the string is equal to the list lis, the function calls itself with the list lis as input and returns the result.
If the string is not equal to the list lis, the function returns False.

<<<Output>>>
