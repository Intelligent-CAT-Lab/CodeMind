 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, n and k.
The variable a is initialized to 0.
The code enters a loop that iterates n-1 times.
In each iteration, the value of a is updated by adding the remainder of a divided by k-1 plus 1.
The formula used is a = a // (k-1) + 1.
The loop continues until a is updated n-1 times.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of a.
