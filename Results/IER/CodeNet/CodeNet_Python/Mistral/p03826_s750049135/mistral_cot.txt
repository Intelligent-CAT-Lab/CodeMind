 <<<Analysis>>>
The function resolve() takes four arguments, A, B, C and D, which are integers.
The function first converts the input string into a list of integers using the map() function and the split() method.
Then it checks if the product of A and B is greater than the product of C and D. If it is, it prints A*B, otherwise it prints C*D.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is 70.
This is because the product of 3 and 5 is 15, which is greater than the product of 2 and 7, which is 14. Therefore, the function prints 15.
