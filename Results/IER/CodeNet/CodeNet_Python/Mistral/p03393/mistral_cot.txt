 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports several modules, including `sys`, `re`, `os`, `collections`, `math`, `itertools`, `operator`, `copy`, `string`, `fractions`, and `input`.
It then defines several helper functions, including `input()`, `STR()`, `INT()`, `MAP()`, `S_MAP()`, `LIST()`, `S_LIST()`, `sys.setrecursionlimit()`, `inf`, `mod`, and `atcoder()`.
The `atcoder()` function takes a string `s` as input and returns the number of unique characters in `s`.
The function first checks if the length of `s` is less than 26. If it is, it prints all possible characters that are not in `s` and exits.
If the length of `s` is 26, it prints all possible characters that are not in `s` and exits.
If neither of these conditions is met, it prints -1 and exits.
<<<Output>>>
-1
