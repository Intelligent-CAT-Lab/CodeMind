 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys and math modules.
The solve function is defined, which takes an integer n as input and prints its prime factorization.
The prime\_factorization function takes an integer n as input and returns a list of its prime factors.
The function first checks if n is less than 2, in which case it returns [n].
If n is greater than or equal to 2, it initializes an empty list res and a variable lim equal to the square root of n.
It then iterates over all numbers p from 2 to lim+1. For each p, it checks if n is divisible by p. If it is, it appends p to res and divides n by p.
If n is not divisible by any number p in the range, it appends n to res.
Finally, the function returns res.
In the main block, the solve function is called.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is not applicable as the code does not return any value. It only prints the prime factorization of the input number 12, which is 2 x 2 x 3.
