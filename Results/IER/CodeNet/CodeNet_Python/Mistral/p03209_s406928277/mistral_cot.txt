 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs, n and x, which are integers.
The variable size is initialized to [1] and pati is initialized to [1].
The code then enters a loop that iterates n times.
For each iteration, it calculates the next size and pati value based on the current size and pati value.
The code then enters another loop that iterates n times.
For each iteration, it checks if x is equal to the current size or the next size plus 2.
If it is, it adds the corresponding pati value to ans and breaks out of the loop.
If x is greater than the next size plus 2, it subtracts the next size plus 2 from x and adds 1 to ans.
If x is less than the next size plus 2, it subtracts 1 from x.
After both loops finish, the code checks if x is equal to 1. If it is, it adds 1 to ans.
Finally, the code prints the value of ans.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code for the input `2 7` is 10.
