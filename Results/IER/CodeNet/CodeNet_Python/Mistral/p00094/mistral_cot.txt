 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes two integers as input, a and b, using the input() function. The input is split using the split() method, which splits the input string into a list of strings based on a specified delimiter (in this case, a space). The list of strings is then converted to a list of integers using the map() function and the int() function.
The code then checks if both a and b are less than or equal to 100 using an if statement. If both conditions are true, it calculates the product of a and b, and then divides it by 3.305785. The result is then formatted using the f-string format specifier to have four decimal places.
The final result is then printed to the console using the print() function.
