 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input, a, b and c, and stores them in the variables a, b and c, respectively.
The variable d is calculated by subtracting the difference between a and b from c.
d = c - (a - b)
d = 3 - (4 - 3)
d = 3 - 1
d = 2
The code then checks if d is less than 0. Since d is 2, which is greater than 0, the code prints the value of d, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
