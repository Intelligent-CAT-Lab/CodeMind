 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, a and b, and stores them in the variables a and b, respectively.
The code then checks if the sum of a and b is greater than or equal to the absolute difference between a and b, and also if the sum of a and b is greater than or equal to the product of a and b.
If both conditions are met, the code prints the sum of a and b.
If the first condition is met but not the second, the code prints the absolute difference between a and b.
If neither condition is met, the code prints the product of a and b.
In this case, a is -13 and b is 3, so the sum of a and b is -10, which is less than the absolute difference between a and b (-13 - 3 = -16) and also less than the product of a and b (-13 x 3 = -39).
Therefore, the code will print -13 - 3 = -16.
<<<Output>>>
-16
