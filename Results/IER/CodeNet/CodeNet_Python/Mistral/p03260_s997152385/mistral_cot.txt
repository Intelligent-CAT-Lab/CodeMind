 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes two integers as input, separated by a space. The input is stored in the variable `input()` and split into two variables `a` and `b` using the `split()` method.
The `int(_)` function is used to convert the input string to an integer.
The code then checks if both `a` and `b` are in the set `(1,3)` using the `in` operator.
If both `a` and `b` are in the set `(1,3)`, the code prints `Yes`, otherwise it prints `No`.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
