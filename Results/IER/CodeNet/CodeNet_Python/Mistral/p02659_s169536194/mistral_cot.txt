 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the decimal module, which allows for decimal arithmetic.
Then it reads two input values, A and B, separated by a space.
A is converted from string to integer using the int() function.
B is converted from string to decimal using the Decimal() function.
Finally, the product of A and B is calculated using the int() function to convert the decimal result to an integer.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code would be 219.8.
