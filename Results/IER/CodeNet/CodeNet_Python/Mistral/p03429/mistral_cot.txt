 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n, variable m, variable a, and variable b are initialized to 3, 4, 4, and 2, respectively.
board is a 2D list of strings, where each row represents a row of the board and each column represents a column of the board.
The code then checks if n*m<2*(a+b), which is True in this case.
Since n*m<2*(a+b), the code proceeds to the next condition.
The code then checks if n==1 or m==1, which is False in this case.
Since n==1 or m==1 is False, the code proceeds to the next condition.
The code then checks if n==1 and m==1, which is False in this case.
Since n==1 and m==1 is False, the code proceeds to the next condition.
The code then checks if n==1, which is False in this case.
Since n==1 is False, the code proceeds to the next condition.
The code then checks if b>=1, which is True in this case.
Since b>=1 is True, the code proceeds to the next condition.
The code then checks if m//2<a, which is True in this case.
Since m//2<a is True, the code proceeds to the next condition.
The code then loops through the range 0 to m//2 and adds '<' and '>' to the board at the appropriate positions.
The code then prints 'YES' and loops through the range 0 to n and prints the board for each row.
