 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs, n and d, which are integers.
The code first checks if d is equal to 1. If it is, it prints n*(n-1)//2, which is 3*2 = 6 in this case.
If d is not equal to 1, it calculates the expression (n-1)+(n-d-1)*n-((n-d-1)*(n+d-2)//2).
In this case, n is 4 and d is 3, so the expression becomes (4-1)+(4-3-1)*4-((4-3-1)*(4+3-2)//2) = 3+3*4-((3*2)//2) = 3+12-6 = 9.
The code then prints 9.
<<<Output>>>
