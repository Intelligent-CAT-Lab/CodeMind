 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module, which allows it to read input from the standard input (sys.stdin) and write output to the standard output (sys.stdout).
The input is read using the readline() method of sys.stdin, which reads a line of text from the standard input and returns it as a string.
The input is then split using the split() method, which splits the string into a list of words based on a specified delimiter (in this case, whitespace).
The three integers A, B, and C are then mapped to integers using the map() function and stored in the variables A, B, and C, respectively.
The code then checks if any of the three numbers are even using the modulo operator (%). If any of them are even, the code prints 0 and exits. Otherwise, it calculates the product of A and B (AB), the product of B and C (BC), and the product of C and A (CA).
The code then prints the minimum of the three products (AB, BC, CA).
<<<Output>>>
0
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
The return value of the code is 0 because none of the three numbers are even.
