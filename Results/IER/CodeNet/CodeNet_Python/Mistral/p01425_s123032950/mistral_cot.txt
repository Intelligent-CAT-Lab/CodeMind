 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable V and variable X are initialized to 0, 7 and 3, respectively.
The variable Y is initialized to 1.
The variable g is initialized to 9.8.
The variable eps is initialized to 1e-10.
The variable obstacles is initialized to an empty list.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 0.
For each number L in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [B, T], which is [1, 1] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number L to obstacles. The condition is met when L is 1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of obstacles, which is [1].
<<<Output>>>
[1]
