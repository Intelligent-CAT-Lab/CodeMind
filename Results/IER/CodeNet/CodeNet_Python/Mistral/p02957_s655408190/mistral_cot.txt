 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers A and B as input, separated by a space. In this case, A is 2 and B is 16.
The code then checks if the sum of A and B is even by using the modulo operator (%). If the sum is even, it divides the sum by 2 and prints the result. If the sum is odd, it prints "IMPOSSIBLE".
In this case, the sum of A and B is 18, which is not even. Therefore, the code prints "IMPOSSIBLE".
<<<Output>>>
IMPOSSIBLE
