 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs, X and Y, separated by a space. It then compares X and Y using an if-elif-else statement.
If X is less than Y, it prints '<'.
If X is equal to Y, it prints '='.
If X is greater than Y, it prints '>'.
In this case, X is 2 and Y is 3, so the code will print '>'.
