 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the math module.
It then reads an integer N from the user.
The variable x is calculated by dividing N by 1.08 and rounding up to the nearest integer using the ceil() function from the math module.
The code then checks if the result of multiplying x by 1.08 is equal to N using the floor() function from the math module. If it is, it prints the value of x. Otherwise, it prints a colon and a parenthesis.
