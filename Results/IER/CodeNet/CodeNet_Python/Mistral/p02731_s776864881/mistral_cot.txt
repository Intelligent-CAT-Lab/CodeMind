 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the `sys` and `decimal` modules.
The `input` function is redefined to read input from standard input (`sys.stdin.readline().rstrip()`) instead of the default `raw_input()` function.
The variable `L` is then read from the standard input using the `input()` function and converted to an integer using the `int()` function.
The variable `d` is then created by initializing a `Decimal` object with the value of `L`.
The code then calculates the cube of the result of dividing `d` by 3 using the `**` exponent operator.
The final result is then printed to the console.
<<<Output>>>
0.0
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
Note that the result is 0.0 because the division by 3 is exact and the result is a decimal number with zero digits after the decimal point.
