 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes two integers as input, a and b, using the `map()` function to convert the input string into integers.
The code then performs three arithmetic operations on the input values:

* `a / b`: division of a by b
* `a % b`: modulo of a by b
* `float(a) / b`: division of a by b, where a is converted to a float before division

The code then uses the `print()` function to output the results of these operations in the format `%d %d %f`, where `%d` is used to format the integer values, `%f` is used to format the float value, and `%d` is used again to format the integer value.

The input for this code is `3 2`, so the output will be:
```
1.5 1 1.5
```
<<<Output>>>
1.5 1 1.5
