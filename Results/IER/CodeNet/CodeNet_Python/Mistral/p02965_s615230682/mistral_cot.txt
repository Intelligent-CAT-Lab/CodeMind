 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first initializes two variables o and f. o is set to 998244353, which is a large prime number. f is initialized as a list containing only one element, 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 2500100. For each iteration, it calculates the next element of f by multiplying the last element of f by the current iteration number i, modulo o. The resulting value is appended to f.
The code then defines a lambda function c that takes two arguments: n and k. It calculates the product of f[n] and f[n-k] raised to the power of o-2, modulo o, and multiplies it by the product of f[k] raised to the power of o-2, modulo o.
The code then reads two integers n and m from the input, and calculates w and u as 3*m and n-1, respectively.
It then calculates a as the product of c(w+u,u) and c(n+m-2,u), minus n times c(n+m-2,u).
Finally, if u is greater than m, the code enters another loop that iterates from m+1 to min(w,n). For each iteration, it checks if w-i+1 is odd. If it is, it subtracts the product of c(n,i) and c((w-i)//2+u,u) from a.
The final value of a is then printed, modulo o.
