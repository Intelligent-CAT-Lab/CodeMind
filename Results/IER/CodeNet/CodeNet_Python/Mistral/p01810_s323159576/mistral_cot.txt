 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers N and k as input. In this case, N is 4 and k is 2.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to store the final result.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to N - 1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 3.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the value of ans using the formula (ans * k + k - 1) // (k - 1).
The formula is applied as follows:
* For i = 0, ans = (0 * 2 + 2 - 1) // (2 - 1) = 1
* For i = 1, ans = (1 * 2 + 2 - 1) // (2 - 1) = 3
* For i = 2, ans = (3 * 2 + 2 - 1) // (2 - 1) = 7
* For i = 3, ans = (7 * 2 + 2 - 1) // (2 - 1) = 15
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 15.
<<<Output>>>
