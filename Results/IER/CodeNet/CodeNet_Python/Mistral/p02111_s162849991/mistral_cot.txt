<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input from the user using the `input()` function and stores it in the variable `s`.
The code then performs two arithmetic operations on `s`.
The first operation is `s // 30`, which performs integer division by 30. This operation returns the quotient of `s` divided by 30, which is 0 in this case.
The second operation is `2 * (s % 30)`, which multiplies 2 by the remainder of `s` divided by 30. Since `s` is 0, the remainder of `s` divided by 30 is also 0, so the operation becomes `2 * 0`, which returns 0.
Therefore, the final value of the expression is `0, 0`, which is printed to the console.
<<<Output>>>
0, 0
