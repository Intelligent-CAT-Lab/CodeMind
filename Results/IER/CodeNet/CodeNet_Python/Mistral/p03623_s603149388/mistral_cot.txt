 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input, x, a and b.
It calculates the absolute difference between x and a, and stores it in p.
It calculates the absolute difference between x and b, and stores it in q.
Then it compares p and q, and prints "A" if p is less than q, and "B" otherwise.
In this case, x is 5, a is 2 and b is 7.
p = abs(5-2) = 3
q = abs(5-7) = 2
Since p is less than q, the code prints "A".
<<<Output>>>
A
