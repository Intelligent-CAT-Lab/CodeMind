<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user, which is a string of three integers separated by spaces. The input is then split using the `split()` method, which returns a list of the input string's elements.
The `map()` function is then applied to the list of elements, converting each element to an integer. The resulting list is stored in the variable `list`.
The `sort()` method is then called on the list, which sorts the list in ascending order.
Finally, the first three elements of the sorted list are printed using the `print()` function.
