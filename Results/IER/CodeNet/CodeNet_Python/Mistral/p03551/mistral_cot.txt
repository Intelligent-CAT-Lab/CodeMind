 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers N and M as input.
It calculates the time by multiplying M by 1900 and adding (N-M) multiplied by 100.
Then it multiplies the time by 2 raised to the power of M.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code for input `1 1` would be 1900.

The calculation is as follows:

* N = 1
* M = 1
* time = 1900*1 + (1-1)*100 = 1900
* time*(2**M) = 1900*2 = 3800

Therefore, the return value of the code for input `1 1` would be 3800.
