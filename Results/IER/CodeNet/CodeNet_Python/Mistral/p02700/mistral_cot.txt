 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four integer inputs, A, B, C, and D, and assigns them to the variables A, B, C, and D, respectively.
The while loop runs as long as both A and C are greater than 0.
Inside the loop, C is subtracted by B. If C becomes less than or equal to 0, the loop breaks and the code prints "Yes".
Then, A is subtracted by D. If A becomes less than or equal to 0, the loop breaks and the code prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
