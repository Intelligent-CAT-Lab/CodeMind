<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user, which is a list of integers separated by spaces. The input is then converted to a list using the `list()` function.
The `map()` function is used to convert each element of the list to an integer.
The `sum()` function is then used to calculate the sum of all the integers in the list.
The code then checks if the sum is greater than or equal to 22. If it is, it prints "bust", otherwise it prints "win".
<<<Output>>>
win
