 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string input `s` and iterates over its characters from index 0 to `len(s)-1`.
For each character, it checks if it is equal to the next character. If it is, it prints "Bad" and exits the loop using the `exit()` function.
If the loop completes without finding any pair of equal characters, it prints "Good".
In the case of the input `3776`, the first character is `3`, which is not equal to the next character `7`. The second character is `7`, which is not equal to the next character `7`. The third character is `7`, which is not equal to the next character `6`. The fourth character is `6`, which is not equal to the next character `6`. The fifth character is `6`, which is not equal to the next character `6`. The sixth character is `6`, which is not equal to the next character `6`.
Since no pair of equal characters is found, the code prints "Good".
<<<Output>>>
Good
