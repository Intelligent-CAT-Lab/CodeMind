 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first initializes two variables, `cnt` and `l`, to 0.
It then iterates over the characters in the input string `s` using a for loop.
For each character, it checks if it is equal to 'W'. If it is, it increments `cnt` by the difference between the current index `i` and the previous index `l`. It also increments `l` by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of `cnt`.
<<<Output>>>
3

The return value of the code for the input `BBW` is 3.
