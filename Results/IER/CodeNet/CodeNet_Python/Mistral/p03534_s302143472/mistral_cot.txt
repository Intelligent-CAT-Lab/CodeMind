<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes a string input from the user, which is `abac`.
It then converts the string to a list using the `list()` function.
The `Counter()` function from the `collections` module is used to count the occurrences of each character in the list.
The `c` variable is then assigned a list of the counts of the characters 'a', 'b', and 'c'.
The code then checks if the difference between the maximum and minimum count in the list is less than 2. In this case, the maximum count is 2 and the minimum count is 1, so the difference is 1, which is less than 2.
Since the condition is met, the code prints "YES".
<<<Output>>>
YES
