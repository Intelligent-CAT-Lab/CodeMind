 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module, which allows it to set the recursion limit and read input from the standard input stream.
The input is read from the standard input stream using the readline() method of the sys.stdin object.
The input is then split into two integers N and X using the map() function and the split() method.
The function F() takes two arguments x and y, which represent the lengths of the sides of a right triangle. It calculates the length of the hypotenuse of the triangle using the Pythagorean theorem.
The function returns the length of the hypotenuse if it is an integer, or 0 if it is not.
The function is then called with the arguments X and N-X, which represent the lengths of the two shorter sides of the right triangle. The result is added to N to get the final answer.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is 11.
