 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an input string `s` using the `input()` function.
It then uses the `replace()` method to replace the substring "apple" with "X" in the string `s`.
It then uses the `replace()` method again to replace the substring "peach" with "apple" in the string `s`.
Finally, it uses the `replace()` method to replace the substring "X" with "peach" in the string `s`.
The resulting string is then printed using the `print()` function.
<<<Output>>>
The cost of one apple is higher than that of one peach.
