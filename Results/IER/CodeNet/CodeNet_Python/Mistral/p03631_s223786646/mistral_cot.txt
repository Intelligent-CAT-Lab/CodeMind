<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three inputs, a, b, and c, separated by spaces.
The code then checks if a is equal to c using the `==` operator.
If a is equal to c, the code prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".
In this case, a is 5, b is 7 and c is 5. Since a is equal to c, the code prints "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
