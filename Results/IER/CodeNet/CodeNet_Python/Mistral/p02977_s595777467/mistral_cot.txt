 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized to 3.
The code then checks if N&(N-1)==0, which is False in this case.
Since the condition is False, the code proceeds to the else block, which prints "Yes".
The code then checks if N%2==1, which is True in this case.
Since N%2==1, the code sets k=N//2, which is 1.5. However, since k must be an integer, the code sets k=2.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 2 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers 1 and 2.
For each number i in this range, it prints the following pairs:
(2*i, 2*i+1)
(2*i+1, 1)
(1, 2*i+N)
(2*i+N, 2*i+1+N)
After the loop finishes, the code prints (1, 3) and (2, 4).
The code then sets n=N.bit\_length()-1, which is 1.
The code sets a=2**n, which is 2.
The code sets b=N+1-a, which is 1.
The code then prints (3, 5) and (2, 4).
<<<Output>>>
Yes
(1, 3)
(2, 4)
(3, 5)
(2, 4)
