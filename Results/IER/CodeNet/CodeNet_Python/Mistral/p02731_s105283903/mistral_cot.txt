 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input from the user using the `input()` function and stores it in the variable `n`.
The code then calculates the cube of the value of `n/3` using the exponentiation operator `**` and stores the result in the variable `result`.
The final value of `result` is printed to the console using the `print()` function.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is 27.
