 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input N from the user.
It then checks if N is odd by checking if N is divisible by 2. If N is odd, it prints 0 and exits the program.
If N is even, it initializes ans to 0 and divides N by 2.
It then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 999. For each iteration, it calculates the sum of N divided by 5 raised to the power of i, and adds it to ans.
If N is less than 5 raised to the power of i, it prints the current value of ans and exits the program.
After the loop finishes, if N is greater than or equal to 5 raised to the power of 999, it prints the final value of ans.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is 12.
