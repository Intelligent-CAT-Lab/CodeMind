 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, H and W.
It first checks if either H or W is equal to 1. If either of them is, it prints 1.
If neither of them is equal to 1, it proceeds to calculate the answer using the formula:
ans = H*(W//2) + (H+1)//2*(W%2)
It then prints the value of ans.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code for the input `4 5` is 11.
