 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes a string input from the user using the `input()` function and stores it in the variable `s`.
Then it converts the string to a list using the `list()` function and stores the list in the variable `sList`.
The code then checks if the second and third elements of the list are equal and the fourth and fifth elements of the list are also equal.
If both conditions are true, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".
For the input "sippuu", the second and third elements of the list are "i" and "p", which are not equal. Similarly, the fourth and fifth elements of the list are "p" and "u", which are also not equal.
Therefore, the code will print "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
