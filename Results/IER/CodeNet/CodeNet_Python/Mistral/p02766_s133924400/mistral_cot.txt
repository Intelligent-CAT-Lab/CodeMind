 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, n and k. In this case, n is 11 and k is 2.
The variable res is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the result.
The code enters a while loop that continues as long as n is greater than 0.
Inside the loop, it increments res by 1 and then divides n by k. The result of the division is assigned back to n.
The loop continues until n is no longer greater than 0, which means that n has been divided by k until it becomes 0 or less.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of res, which is 6.
<<<Output>>>
6
