 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes 6 integers as input, A, B, C, D, E and F.
It initializes an empty list a, which will be used to store pairs of numbers that meet the condition.
The code then enters a nested loop that iterates 101 times for each of the variables A, B, C, D and E.
For each iteration, it calculates the value of x and y using the current values of A, B, C, D and E.
It then checks if x+y is greater than F or if x is equal to 0. If either of these conditions is true, it breaks out of the loop.
If x+y is not greater than F and x is not equal to 0, it checks if 100*y/(x+y) is less than or equal to E*100/(100+E). If this condition is true, it appends the pair [x+y, y] to the list a.
After the loops finish, the code sorts the list a in descending order based on the second element of each pair.
Finally, it prints the last element of the sorted list, which is the pair with the largest second element.
