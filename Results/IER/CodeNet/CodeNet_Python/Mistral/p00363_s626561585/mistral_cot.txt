 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three inputs: w, h, and c. In this case, w is 3, h is 3, and c is B.
The code first initializes the variables w, h, and c to their respective input values.
The variable end is set to a string consisting of a plus sign, followed by a string of hyphens with a length equal to w - 2, and then a plus sign.
The variable center is set to a string consisting of a vertical bar, followed by a string of dots with a length equal to (w - 3) // 2, followed by the letter B, followed by another string of dots with a length equal to (w - 3) // 2, and then a vertical bar.
The variable common is set to a string consisting of a vertical bar, followed by a string of dots with a length equal to w - 2.
The code then enters a loop that iterates h times.
For each iteration, it checks if the current iteration is the first or last iteration, in which case it prints the end string.
If the current iteration is the middle iteration, it prints the center string.
If the current iteration is neither the first, last, nor middle iteration, it prints the common string.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final result.
