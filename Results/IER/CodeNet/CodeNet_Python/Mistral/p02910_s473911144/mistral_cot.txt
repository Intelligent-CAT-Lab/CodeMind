 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string input `s` and initializes a flag variable to `True`.
It then iterates over each character in the string using a for loop with the `enumerate()` function.
For each character, it checks if the index of the character is even. If it is, it checks if the character is not one of the characters "L", "U" or "D". If it is not, it sets the flag variable to `False`.
If the index of the character is odd, it checks if the character is not one of the characters "R", "U" or "D". If it is not, it sets the flag variable to `False`.
After the loop finishes, it checks the value of the flag variable. If it is `True`, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
