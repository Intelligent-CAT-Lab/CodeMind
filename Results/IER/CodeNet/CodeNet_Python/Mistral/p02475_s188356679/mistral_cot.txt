 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes two integers as input, a and b, using the `input().split()` method. The input is split by spaces and the resulting list is converted to integers using the `map()` function.
The code then checks if the product of a and b is greater than or equal to zero. If it is, it prints the quotient of a divided by b using the `//` operator.
If the product of a and b is less than zero, the code prints the absolute value of the quotient of a divided by b using the `//` operator.
In this case, a is 5 and b is 8, so the product of a and b is 40. Since 40 is greater than or equal to 0, the code prints the quotient of 5 divided by 8, which is 0.625.
<<<Output>>>
0.625
