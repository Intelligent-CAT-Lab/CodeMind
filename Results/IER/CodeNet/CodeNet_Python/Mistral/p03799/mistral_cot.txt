 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first defines three functions: `INT()`, `MI()` and `LI()`.
`INT()` returns an integer value by converting the input string to an integer.
`MI()` returns a tuple of integers by converting the input string to a list of integers using `map()` and then converting the list to a tuple using `tuple()`.
`LI()` returns a list of integers by converting the input string to a list of integers using `map()` and then converting the list to a list using `list()`.
The code then reads two integers N and M from the user using `MI()` and stores them in the variables N and M.
The code then checks if 2 * N is less than or equal to M. If it is, it calculates the answer ans as N + (M - 2 * N) // 4. If it is not, it calculates the answer ans as M // 2.
Finally, the code prints the value of ans.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code based on the input `1 6` is 4.
