<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a lambda function as input, which takes a string as an argument and returns the sum of the number of occurrences of the substrings 'WB' and 'BW' in the input string.
The input string is then passed to the lambda function using the `input()` function.
The `input()` function reads a line from the standard input and returns it as a string.
The lambda function then counts the number of occurrences of the substrings 'WB' and 'BW' in the input string using the `count()` method of strings.
The sum of these counts is returned by the lambda function.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code for the input `BBBWW` is 4.
