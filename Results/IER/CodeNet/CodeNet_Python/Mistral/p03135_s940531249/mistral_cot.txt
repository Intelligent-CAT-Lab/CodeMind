 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, T and X.
The function solve(T, X) is called with these values as arguments.
The function solve(T, X) simply divides T by X and prints the result.
The main function reads the input from standard input and calls the solve function with the values of T and X.
The main function then returns nothing.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is the result of dividing 8 by 3, which is 2.6666666666666668.
