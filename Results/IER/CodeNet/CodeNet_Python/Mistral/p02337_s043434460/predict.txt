The return value of the code for input `3 5` would be 10.
This is because there are 3 ways to distribute 3 balls among 5 boxes:
- 1 ball in box 1, 1 ball in box 2, and 1 ball in box 3
- 1 ball in box 1, 2 balls in box 2, and 1 ball in box 3
- 3 balls in box 1
Therefore, the sum of the last row of D is 1 + 1 + 1 = 3, which is 3 % 10^9 + 7 = 10.
