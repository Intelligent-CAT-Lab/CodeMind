 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first prompts the user to enter a string of characters. The user inputs `?D-C'KOPUA`.
The code then enters a loop that iterates through each character in the input string.
For each character, it checks if it exists in the encode dictionary. If it does, it adds the corresponding encoded character to a new string called code0.
After the loop finishes, the code enters another loop that iterates through each character in code0.
For each character, it checks if it exists in the decode dictionary. If it does, it adds the corresponding decoded character to a new string called code.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of code, which is `?D-C'KOPUA`.
<<<Output>>>
?D-C'KOPUA
