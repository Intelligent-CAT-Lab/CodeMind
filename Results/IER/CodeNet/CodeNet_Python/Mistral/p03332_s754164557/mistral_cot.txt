 <<<Analysis>>>
The variables n, a, b, k are initialized to 4, 1, 2, and 5, respectively.
The variable m is calculated as n // 2 + 1, which is 3.
The variable mod is set to 998244353.
The variable comb is initialized as a list of integers with length m, all set to 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to m. For each i in this range, it calculates the value of comb[i] using the formula comb[i] = comb[i - 1] * (n + 1 - i) * pow(i, mod - 2, mod).
The code then calculates the remainder of comb[i] when divided by mod.
The variable ans is initialized to 0.
The code then enters another loop that iterates from 1 to n + 1. For each i in this range, it checks if a * i is greater than k. If it is, the loop breaks. Otherwise, it calculates j = k - a * i.
The code then checks if j is divisible by b. If it is, it calculates j // b and checks if 0 <= j <= n. If both conditions are met, it calculates the minimum of i and n - i, and the minimum of j and n - j. It then adds the product of comb[i] and comb[j] to ans, and calculates the remainder of ans when divided by mod.
After the loops finish, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 10.
