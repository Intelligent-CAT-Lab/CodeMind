 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes two integers as input, A and B, separated by a space. In this case, A is 8 and B is 6.
The code then checks if A is equal to 1, and if it is, it sets A to 14. Since A is not equal to 1, this condition is not met.
The code then checks if B is equal to 1, and if it is, it sets B to 14. Since B is not equal to 1, this condition is not met.
The code then compares A and B to determine which is greater. In this case, A is greater than B, so the code prints "Alice".
<<<Output>>>
Alice
