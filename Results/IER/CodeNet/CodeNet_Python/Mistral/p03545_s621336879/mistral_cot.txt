 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the itertools module, which provides the product function.
The variable S is initialized to the input string "1222".
The code then enters a loop that iterates 3 times, generating all possible combinations of "+", "-" characters.
For each combination, it creates a list of 4 elements, where the first element is the first character of the input string, the second element is the second character of the input string, the third element is the first character of the current combination, and the fourth element is the second character of the current combination.
It then evaluates the sum of the elements in the list using the eval function, which converts the string representation of the sum to an integer.
If the sum is equal to 7, it prints the combination of characters that resulted in a sum of 7.
The combination that results in a sum of 7 is "+-+-", which is the third combination generated by the loop.
<<<Output>>>
+-+-=7
