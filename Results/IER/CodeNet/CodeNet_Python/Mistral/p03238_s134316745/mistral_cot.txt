 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input N. If N is equal to 1, it prints "Hello World". Otherwise, it takes two integer inputs A and B, adds them together and stores the result in A\_B. It then prints the value of A\_B.
<<<Output>>>
If N is equal to 1, the return value of the code is "Hello World". If N is not equal to 1, the return value of the code is the sum of A and B.

For the input `1`, the return value of the code is "Hello World".
