 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integer inputs, A and B, separated by a space.
It then checks if A is greater than or equal to 13. Since A is 30, this condition is not met.
Next, it checks if A is between 6 and 12 (inclusive). Since A is 30, this condition is not met either.
Finally, it prints 0 because none of the conditions were met.
<<<Output>>>
0
