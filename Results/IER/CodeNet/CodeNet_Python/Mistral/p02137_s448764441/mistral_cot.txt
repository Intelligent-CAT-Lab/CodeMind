 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input n, which is 5700.
It then initializes a variable ans to 0, which will be used to store the final result.
The code then defines a list l, which contains the values [10000, 5000, 1000, 500].
The code then enters a loop that iterates 4 times.
For each iteration, it calculates the remainder of n divided by l[i], which is 0 for all i in this case.
It then calculates the quotient of n divided by l[i], which is 570 for i=0, 285 for i=1, 57 for i=2 and 11 for i=3.
It then multiplies the quotient by l[i] and adds the result to ans.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 11400.
<<<Output>>>
11400
