 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input `x` from the user.
It then calculates the remainder of `x` divided by 11 using the floor division operator `//`. The result is stored in the variable `ans`.
The code then checks if `x` is greater than 11*`ans` + 6. If it is, it prints `2*ans+2`.
If `x` is equal to 11*`ans`, it prints `2*ans`.
If neither of the above conditions are met, it prints `2*ans+1`.
For the input `7`, `x` is 7, `ans` is 0 (since 7 divided by 11 is 0 with no remainder).
Since `7` is not greater than 11*`ans` + 6, the code does not print `2*ans+2`.
Since `7` is not equal to 11*`ans`, the code does not print `2*ans`.
Therefore, the code prints `2*ans+1`, which is `2*0+1`, which is `1`.
