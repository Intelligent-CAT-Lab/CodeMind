The code first imports the necessary libraries: math, operator, functools, and fractions.
It then defines two user-defined functions: ncr and rd.
The ncr function takes two arguments, n and r, and calculates the number of combinations of r items taken n at a time. It does this by first calculating the numerator and denominator of the fraction representing the number of combinations, and then dividing the numerator by the denominator.
The rd function takes a single argument, p, and returns the input in the desired format based on the value of p. If p is 0, it returns the input as a string. If p is 1, it returns the input as an integer. If p is 2, it returns the input as a list of integers. If p is 3, it returns the input as a tuple of integers.
The code then defines a global variable, par, which is a list of size 100001, initialized to -1 for all elements. It also defines a function, find, which takes an integer u and returns the index of the smallest element in the par list that is greater than or equal to u. It does this by first checking if the par list at index u is less than 0, in which case it returns u. Otherwise, it recursively calls find on the par list at index u until it finds the smallest element greater than or equal to u.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to t (inclusive), where t is the first term of the input. For each term, it reads in the input using the rd function and initializes two variables, div and tot, to 10 and 0, respectively. It then checks if the term is odd. If it is, it prints 0 and moves on to the next term. If it is even, it enters a while loop that iterates as long as the term is greater than or equal to div. Inside the while loop, it calculates the number of terms in the term divided by div and adds it to the tot variable. It then multiplies div by 5 and moves on to the next iteration of the while loop. After the while loop finishes, it prints the value of tot.
