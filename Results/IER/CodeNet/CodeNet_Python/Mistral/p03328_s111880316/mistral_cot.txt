 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first defines a lambda function `LI` that takes no arguments and returns a list of integers. It does this by calling the `map` function on the input string, which is split by spaces, and converts each element to an integer using the `int` function. The resulting list is returned by the lambda function.

The code then calls the `LI` function and assigns the returned list to the variables `a` and `b`. In this case, `a` is 8 and `b` is 13.

The code then defines a lambda function `main` that takes no arguments and returns an integer. It does this by defining another lambda function `f` that takes an integer `x` as an argument and returns the result of `x * (x + 1) // 2`. It then calculates the value of `ans` by calling `f` with the argument `b - a - 1`, subtracting `a` from the result, and printing the final value.

In this case, `b - a - 1` is 4, `f(4)` is 10, `10 - a` is 2, and the final value of `ans` is 2.
