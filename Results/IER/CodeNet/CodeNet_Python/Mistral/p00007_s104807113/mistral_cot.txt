 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the math module.
It then defines a function called main() that takes an integer input n.
The variable _debt is initialized to 100000.
The code then enters a for loop that iterates n times.
Inside the loop, it calculates the interest earned on the current debt amount by multiplying it by 0.05 (5%), then multiplying that by 0.001 (0.001%), and then multiplying that by 1000 (to convert it to a whole number).
It then adds this interest to the current debt amount.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of _debt.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is the final value of _debt, which is 100000.
