 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the math module.
It then defines a function called combination that takes two integer arguments i and j and returns the number of combinations of i items taken r at a time.
The function uses the factorial function from the math module to calculate the factorial of i and (i-j) and (j) and then returns the result of the division.
The code then takes two integer inputs n and k from the user and stores them in the variables n and k, respectively.
It also defines a constant modulo which is 10**9 + 7.
The code then initializes a variable ans to 0.
It then checks if k is less than or equal to n. If it is, it enters a loop that iterates from 0 to k.
For each iteration, it checks if the current iteration i is even or odd. If it is even, it adds the result of (k-i) raised to the power of n multiplied by the result of the combination function with k and i as arguments. If it is odd, it subtracts the result of (k-i) raised to the power of n multiplied by the result of the combination function with k and i as arguments.
After the loop finishes, it calculates the final result by taking the modulo of ans.
Finally, it prints the final result.
