 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input n, which is a string of length 9.
It initializes a variable tmp to 0.
It then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 8 (inclusive), meaning it will consider each digit of n.
For each digit i in this range, it adds the digit to tmp and then applies the modulo operation with 9.
The modulo operation ensures that the value of tmp is always between 0 and 8.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if tmp is equal to 0. If it is, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
