 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first initializes a list `ans` with the values [0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 16, 12, 64, 24, 36, 48, 1024, 60].
Then it reads an integer `n` from the input and uses it to index into the `ans` list to retrieve the value at that index.
Since `n` is 1, the value at index 1 of the `ans` list is retrieved, which is 1.
