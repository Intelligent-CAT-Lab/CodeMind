 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input p and initializes a variable sum to 0.
It then checks if p is greater than or equal to 10000, 5000, 1000, 500, and 1000.
If p is greater than or equal to any of these values, it calculates the remainder of p divided by the corresponding value and adds the quotient multiplied by the corresponding value to sum.
For example, if p is greater than or equal to 10000, it calculates p//10000, which is 570, and adds 570*10000 to sum.
Then it subtracts p//10000*10000 from p.
The same process is repeated for the other conditions.
After all the conditions are checked, the code prints the final value of sum.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code based on the input 5700 is 100000.
