 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `solve()` takes two inputs, `mod` and `N, K`, which are 998244353 and 2, 4 respectively.
The function first calculates the values of `combs_mod(K,K,mod)` and `combs_mod(K-1,K-1,mod)` using the `combs_mod()` function.
It then iterates through the range of `r` from 0 to `K`, and for each value of `r`, it calculates the value of `ans` by adding the value of `com[r]` and subtracting the value of `com[N-2]` if `N>=2`.
It also checks if `dif` is less than `N` and if so, it adds the value of `com[r] - com[N-1-dif]` to `ans`.
Finally, it calculates the value of `ans` modulo `mod` and returns it.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is 1.
