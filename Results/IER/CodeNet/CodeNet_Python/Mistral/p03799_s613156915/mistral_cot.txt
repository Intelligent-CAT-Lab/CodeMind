 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module, which provides access to some system-specific information and functions.
The input() function is defined as a built-in function that reads a line from the standard input (sys.stdin) and removes any leading or trailing whitespace.
The resolve() function is defined as the main function that will be executed when the program is run.
The function takes two arguments, n and m, which are integers representing the number of elements in the array and the number of elements to be selected, respectively.
The function first initializes a variable cnt to 0, which will be used to store the number of elements selected.
The function then checks if 2*n <= m, which is true in this case. If it is, the function adds n to cnt, subtracts n*2 from m, and adds m//4 to cnt.
If 2*n > m, the function adds m//2 to cnt.
Finally, the function prints the value of cnt, which is 5.
<<<Output>>>
5
