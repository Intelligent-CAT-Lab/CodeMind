 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input from the user using the raw\_input() function and stores it in the variable s.
The variable now is initialized to the first character of the string s.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of times the character changes in the string.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to the length of the string s (inclusive), meaning it will consider each character in the string.
For each character i in this range, it checks if it is different from the current value of now. If it is, it increments the value of ans and updates the value of now to the current character i.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 3.
