 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input from the user using the `input()` function and stores it in the variable `X`.
Then it uses a series of `if-elif` statements to check the value of `X` and print a corresponding integer value between 1 and 2.
The first `if` statement checks if `X` is between 400 and 599 (inclusive), but `725` is not within this range.
The second `elif` statement checks if `X` is between 600 and 799 (inclusive), but `725` is not within this range either.
The third `elif` statement checks if `X` is between 800 and 999 (inclusive), but `725` is not within this range.
The fourth `elif` statement checks if `X` is between 1000 and 1199 (inclusive), but `725` is not within this range.
The fifth `elif` statement checks if `X` is between 1200 and 1399 (inclusive), but `725` is not within this range.
The sixth `elif` statement checks if `X` is between 1400 and 1599 (inclusive), but `725` is not within this range.
The seventh `elif` statement checks if `X` is between 1600 and 1799 (inclusive), but `725` is not within this range.
The eighth `elif` statement checks if `X` is between 1800 and 1999 (inclusive), but `725` is not within this range.
Since none of the `if-elif` statements are satisfied, the code does not print any value.
<<<Output>>>
No output is returned.
