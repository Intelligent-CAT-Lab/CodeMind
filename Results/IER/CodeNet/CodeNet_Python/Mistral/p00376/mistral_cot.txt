 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes two integers as input, separated by a space. The input is `20 30`.
The first line of the code uses the `map()` function to convert the input string into two integers, which are stored in the variables `a` and `b`.
The second line of the code uses an `if` statement to compare the values of `a` and `b`. If `a` is less than `b`, the code prints the difference between `b` and `a`. Otherwise, it prints the difference between `a` and `b`.
In this case, `a` is 20 and `b` is 30. Since `a` is less than `b`, the code prints `30-20`, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
