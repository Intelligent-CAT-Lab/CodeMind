 <<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes three variables: s, t and k.
s is assigned the value of the input string, which is "aabbaa".
t is initialized as an empty string, which will be used to store the current substring.
k is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of substrings.
prev is initialized as an empty string, which will be used to store the previous substring.
The code then enters a loop that iterates through each character in the input string s.
For each character, it appends it to the current substring t.
If the current substring t is different from the previous substring prev, it increments k by 1, updates prev to be t and clears t.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of k, which is 4.
<<<Output>>>
4
