 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input, a, b and c, and assigns them to the variables a, b and c, respectively.
The code then checks if a is equal to the sum of b and c, or if a is equal to the sum of b and c, or if a is equal to the sum of b and c.
If any of these conditions are met, the code prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
In this case, a is 10, b is 30 and c is 20.
The sum of b and c is 30 + 20 = 50.
The sum of a and b is 10 + 30 = 40.
The sum of a and c is 10 + 20 = 30.
Since none of these conditions are met, the code prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
