 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `solve()` takes two integer inputs, M and D, and returns the number of pairs (a,b) such that a and b are positive integers and a*b is less than or equal to M.
The function first initializes a variable `ans` to 0, which will be used to accumulate the number of pairs that meet the condition.
It then enters a loop that iterates from 12 to D (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 12 to 40.
For each number i in this range, it extracts the first two digits of i (a and b) and converts them to integers.
The code then checks if a and b are positive integers and if a*b is less than or equal to M. If both conditions are met, it increments the `ans` variable.
After the loop finishes, the function returns the final value of `ans`, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
