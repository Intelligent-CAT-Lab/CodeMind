The code takes an input string `n` and converts it to an integer using the `int()` function. It then extracts the four digits of the integer `n` using indexing.
The code then checks if the sum of the four digits is equal to 7 using a series of `if` and `elif` statements.
The first `if` statement checks if the sum of the four digits is equal to 7. If it is, it prints the four digits in the order they appear in the input string, separated by a space.
The next `elif` statement checks if the sum of the four digits is equal to 7, but with the digits in a different order. It then prints the four digits in the new order, separated by a space.
The next `elif` statement checks if the sum of the four digits is equal to 7, but with two digits swapped. It then prints the four digits in the new order, separated by a space.
The next `elif` statement checks if the sum of the four digits is equal to 7, but with two digits swapped and one digit removed. It then prints the four digits in the new order, separated by a space.
The next `elif` statement checks if the sum of the four digits is equal to 7, but with two digits swapped and two digits removed. It then prints the four digits in the new order, separated by a space.
The next `elif` statement checks if the sum of the four digits is equal to 7, but with two digits swapped and three digits removed. It then prints the four digits in the new order, separated by a space.
The next `elif` statement checks if the sum of the four digits is equal to 7, but with two digits swapped and four digits removed. It then prints the four digits in the new order, separated by a space.
The next `elif` statement checks if the sum of the four digits is equal to 7, but with two digits swapped and five digits removed. It then prints the four digits in the new order, separated by a space.
The next `elif` statement checks if the sum of the four digits is equal to 7, but with two digits swapped and six digits removed. It then prints the four digits in the new order, separated by a space.
The next `elif` statement checks if the sum of the four digits is equal to 7, but with two digits swapped and seven digits removed. It then prints the four digits in the new order, separated by a space.
The next `elif` statement checks if the sum of the four digits is equal to 7, but with two digits swapped and eight digits removed. It then prints the four digits in the new order, separated by a space.
The next `elif` statement checks if the sum of the four digits is equal to 7, but with two digits swapped and nine digits removed. It then prints the four digits in the new order, separated by a space.
The next `elif` statement checks if the sum of the four digits is equal to 7, but with two digits swapped and ten digits removed. It then prints the four digits in the new order, separated by a space.
The next `elif` statement checks if the sum of the four digits is equal to 7, but with two digits sw
