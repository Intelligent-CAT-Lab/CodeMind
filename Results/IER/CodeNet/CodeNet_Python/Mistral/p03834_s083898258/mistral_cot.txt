<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string `s` using the `input()` function.
The `replace()` method is then called on the string `s` with the argument `','` (a comma) and the replacement string `' '` (a space).
This replaces all occurrences of a comma in the string with a space.
The resulting string is then printed to the console using the `print()` function.
<<<Output>>>
happy newyear enjoy
