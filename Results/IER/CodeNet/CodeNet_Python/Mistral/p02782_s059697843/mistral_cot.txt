 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first initializes four variables: r1, c1, r2, and c2, which are 1, 1, 2, and 2, respectively.
The variable L is initialized to 10^9 + 7, which is a large prime number.
The code then defines a function called get\_euclidian, which takes two arguments A and B, and returns the greatest common divisor of A and B using the Euclidean algorithm.
The code then defines a function called get\_combi, which takes two arguments n and r, and returns the number of combinations of choosing r items from a set of n items.
The code then calls the get\_combi function four times with different arguments to calculate the number of combinations of choosing r2+1 items from r2+c2+1 items, choosing c1 items from r1+c1 items, choosing r1 items from r1+c2 items, and choosing r1 items from r1+c1 items.
Finally, the code subtracts the four combinations and adds L to the result, and returns the result modulo L.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is 10, which is the result of the calculation:
(int(combi1 - combi2 - combi3 + combi4) + L) % L = (int(1 - 1 - 1 + 1) + 10^9 + 7) % 10^9 + 7 = 10
Therefore, the return value of the code is 10.
