 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads the input `5 2` and stores it in two variables `n` and `k`, respectively.
The variable `n` is 5 and the variable `k` is 2.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from `k+1` to `n`, meaning it will consider numbers from 3 to 5.
For each number `b` in this range, it calculates the quotient `s` by dividing `n` by `b`, and adds the product of `s` and `b-k` to the variable `ans`.
It also adds the maximum of 0 and `n-s*b-k+1` to `ans`.
The condition is met when `b` is 3, so `s` is 1 and `ans` is 3.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of `ans`, which is 3.
