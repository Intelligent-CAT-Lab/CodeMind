 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input: n, a, and b. In this case, n is 4, a is 1, and b is 3.
The variable MOD is set to 10**9 + 7, which is used as the modulus for the operations.
The function modcomb is defined to calculate the number of combinations of n items taken r at a time, modulo MOD.
The variable X is calculated using the formula 2^n - 1, which is the number of combinations of n items taken 0 at a time, modulo MOD.
The variables A and B are calculated using the function modcomb, which calculates the number of combinations of n items taken a and b at a time, modulo MOD.
The variable ans is calculated by subtracting A and B from X, and then taking the result modulo MOD.
Finally, the value of ans is printed.
