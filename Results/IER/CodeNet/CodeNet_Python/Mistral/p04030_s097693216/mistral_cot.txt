 <<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by initializing the variable S to the input string "01B0".
The variable w is initialized to an empty string.
The code then enters a loop that iterates through each character c in S.
For each character c, the code checks if it is equal to "B". If it is, it checks if the string w is not empty. If it is, it removes the last character from w. If it is not, it does nothing.
If c is not equal to "B", it adds the character c to the end of w.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of w, which is "01B".
<<<Output>>>
01B
