 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the `collections` module, which is used to count the occurrences of each character in the input string.
The input string is then converted to a list using the `list()` function.
The code then creates a `Counter` object from the list using the `collections.Counter()` function.
The `Counter` object is used to count the occurrences of each character in the input string.
The code then checks if the product of the counts of the characters "N" and "S" is equal to 0. If it is, it checks if the counts of "N" and "S" are not equal. If they are not equal, the code sets the `ans` variable to "No".
The code then checks if the product of the counts of the characters "W" and "E" is equal to 0. If it is, it checks if the counts of "W" and "E" are not equal. If they are not equal, the code sets the `ans` variable to "No".
Finally, the code prints the value of the `ans` variable.
<<<Output>>>
