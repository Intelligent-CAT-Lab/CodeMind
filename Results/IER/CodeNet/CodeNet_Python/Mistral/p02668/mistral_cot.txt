 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the necessary modules: sys, numpy as np.
It then defines the constant MOD as 10**9 + 7.
The variables N and M are read from the standard input using the sys.stdin.buffer.read() method and stored as integers.
The function make_power() is defined to calculate the power of a number a raised to the power of L. It uses numpy to efficiently calculate the power.
The variables pow2 and ipow2 are created using the make_power() function.
The function update() is defined to update the dp array. It uses numpy to efficiently calculate the dp array.
The dp array is initialized with the values of pow2[:M+1].
The code then enters a loop that iterates N-1 times. For each iteration, the update() function is called with the current dp array.
After the loop finishes, the final value of dp[-1] is printed.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is 11.
