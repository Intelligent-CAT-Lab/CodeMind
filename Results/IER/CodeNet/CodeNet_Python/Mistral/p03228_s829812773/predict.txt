The return value of the code based on the input `5 4 2` would be `(2, 6)`.
This is because the loop iterates 2 times, and in the first iteration, `i` is even, so `a` and `b` are updated using the `play()` function.
After the first iteration, `a` is 2 and `b` is 6.
In the second iteration, `i` is odd, so `b` and `a` are updated using the `play()` function.
After the second iteration, `a` is still 2 and `b` is still 6.
Therefore, the final values of `a` and `b` are 2 and 6, respectively.
