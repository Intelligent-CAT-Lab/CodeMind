<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an input from the user using the `input()` function and stores it in the variable `S`.
The `count()` method is then called on the string `S` to count the number of occurrences of the characters "+", "-" in the string.
The `count()` method returns the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substring in the string.
The code then subtracts the number of occurrences of "-" from the number of occurrences of "+" and multiplies the result by 1.
The final result is printed to the console.
<<<Output>>>
1

The return value of the code based on the input `+-++` is 1.
