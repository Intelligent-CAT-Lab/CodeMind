 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first defines a constant MOD as 10**9+7.
Then it defines two functions:

* sum(a,d,n): This function takes three arguments: a, d and n. It returns the sum of the numbers from a to n, where each number is either a or d.
* main(): This is the main function that takes two arguments: n and m. It initializes a variable s to 0.

If n is equal to 1, s is set to m+1. Otherwise, s is calculated using the formula:

s = sum(m+1, -n+1, 1+m//(n-1))

The sum function is called three times with the arguments (m+1, -n+1, 1+m//(n-1)). The result of each call is added to the sum variable.

Finally, s is multiplied by 2 and subtracted by (m+1) to get the final value.

The return value of the main function is the final value of s modulo MOD.

<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code for the input `3 9` is 11.
