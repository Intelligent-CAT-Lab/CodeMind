 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads the input from the standard input (stdin) and stores it in two variables n and m.
The code then checks if the value of (n+1)/2 is greater than or equal to m.
If it is, the code prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'.
In this case, n is 3 and m is 2, so (n+1)/2 = 2.5, which is not greater than or equal to 2.
Therefore, the code will print 'NO'.
<<<Output>>>
NO
