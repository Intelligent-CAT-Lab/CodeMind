 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module and sets the recursion limit to 10^7.
It then reads the input from sys.stdin.readline and stores it in the variable n.
The variable MOD is set to 10^9 + 7, which is used as the modulus for the final answer.
The code then initializes an array factorial with all elements set to 0, except for factorial[0] which is set to 1.
It then calculates the factorial of n using a loop that iterates from 1 to n.
The code then initializes an empty list prime\_factors, which will be used to store the prime factors of n.
It initializes a variable i to 2 and enters a while loop that continues until i^2 is greater than n.
Inside the loop, it uses an extended Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of n and i. If n is divisible by i, it increments the count of occurrences of i in prime\_factors and divides n by i.
After the loop finishes, it checks if n is not equal to 1. If it is not, it adds (n, 1) to prime\_factors.
The code then initializes a variable ans to 1 and enters a loop that iterates over prime\_factors.
For each prime factor (i, ext), it multiplies ans by (i+1) and takes the result modulo MOD.
Finally, the code prints the value of ans.
