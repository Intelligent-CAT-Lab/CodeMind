 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first prints the string 'ai1333' using the print() function.
Then it uses the '+' operator to concatenate the string '3' with the result of the expression (int(input()) // 100).
The input() function reads a line of input from the user, which is '0' in this case.
The int() function converts the input string to an integer, which is 0.
The // operator performs integer division, so int(input()) // 100 is equal to 0 // 100 = 0.
Therefore, the expression (int(input()) // 100) is equal to 0.
The '*' operator multiplies the integer 0 by the integer 3, which is equal to 0.
So the final expression is 'ai1333' + '3' * 0, which is equal to 'ai1333'.
<<<Output>>>
ai1333
