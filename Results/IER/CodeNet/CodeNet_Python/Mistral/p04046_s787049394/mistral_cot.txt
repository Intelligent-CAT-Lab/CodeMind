 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the necessary modules: operator, functools, math, sys, and defines a modulus of 1000000007.
It then calculates the factorial of numbers from 1 to 2000001 and stores it in a list called factorial.
It also calculates the inverse factorial of numbers from 1 to 2000001 and stores it in a list called factorial\_inv\_rev.
The function ncr is defined to calculate the number of combinations of n items taken r at a time.
The input is read from the user and split into four variables: h, w, a, and b.
The code then generates a list of points by iterating over the range of h-a-1 to -1 with a step of -1, and for each point, it calculates the number of combinations of the points taken r at a time using the ncr function.
The former and latter lists are then calculated by iterating over the points list and applying the ncr function to each point.
Finally, the sum of the former and latter lists is calculated and the result is printed modulo the modulus.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code for the input `2 3 1 1` would be 10.
