 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input from the user using the `input()` function and stores it in the variable `N`.
The code then enters a nested loop that iterates from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for both `i` and `j`.
For each iteration of the outer loop, it checks if the product of `i` and `j` is equal to `N`. If it is, it prints "Yes" and exits the loop using the `exit()` function.
If the product of `i` and `j` is not equal to `N`, it continues to the next iteration of the outer loop.
After the inner loop finishes, if no product of `i` and `j` is equal to `N`, it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
