<<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the math module, which provides access to mathematical functions and constants.
It then prompts the user to enter a number N, which is stored in the variable N.
The code then calculates the square root of N using the math.sqrt() function and stores the result in the variable sqrt\_N.
It then multiplies the square of the square root of N (i.e. sqrt\_N * sqrt\_N) and stores the result in the variable result.
Finally, the code prints the value of result.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code would be 100.
