 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes two integers as input, a and b, and stores them in the variables a and b.
The variable MASK is initialized to (1 << 32)-1, which is a bit mask that has all bits set to 1.
The code then applies three bitwise operations to a and b:
- a & b: bitwise AND operation, which returns the bits that are set in both a and b.
- a | b: bitwise OR operation, which returns the bits that are set in either a or b.
- a ^ b: bitwise XOR operation, which returns the bits that are set in either a or b, but not both.
The code then prints the result of each operation using the format string "{:032b}" which formats the output as a 32-bit integer with leading zeros.
