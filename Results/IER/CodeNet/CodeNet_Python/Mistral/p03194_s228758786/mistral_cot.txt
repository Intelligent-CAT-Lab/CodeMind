 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the math module.
Then it reads two integers n and p from the user, separated by a space.
The code then checks if n is equal to 1. If it is, it simply prints p.
If n is not equal to 1, it initializes a variable ans to 1 and a variable limit to the integer value of p raised to the power of 1/n.
The code then enters a while loop that continues until limit is less than or equal to 1.
Inside the loop, it initializes a variable a to p and a variable cnt to 0.
The code then enters another while loop that continues until a is equal to 0.
Inside this loop, it checks if a is divisible by limit. If it is, it increments cnt by 1 and divides a by limit.
If a is not divisible by limit, it breaks out of the loop.
After the inner loop finishes, the code checks if cnt is greater than or equal to n. If it is, it sets ans to limit and breaks out of the outer loop.
Finally, the code prints the value of ans.
