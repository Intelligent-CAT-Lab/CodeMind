 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input from the user using the `input()` function and stores it in the variable `N`.
The code then checks if `N` is equal to 1 or 2 using an `if` statement. If it is, the code prints 0.
If `N` is not equal to 1 or 2, the code checks if `N` is even or odd using another `if` statement.
If `N` is even, the code calculates `N//2-1` and prints it.
If `N` is odd, the code calculates `N//2` and prints it.
In this case, since `N` is 4, the code will first check if `N` is equal to 1 or 2, which it is not.
Then it checks if `N` is even or odd. Since `N` is even, the code calculates `N//2-1` which is 2 and prints it.
