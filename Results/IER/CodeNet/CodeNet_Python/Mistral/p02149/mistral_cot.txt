 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes a list of integers as input, separated by spaces. The input is `1000 900 850`.
The code then uses the `map()` function to convert the input string into a list of integers. The list is stored in the variable `S`.
The code then uses the `index()` method to find the index of the maximum element in the list `S`. The maximum element is 1000.
The code then checks the index of the maximum element in the list `S`. If the index is 0, it prints "A". If the index is 1, it prints "B". If the index is 2, it prints "C".
In this case, the index of the maximum element is 0, so the code prints "A".
<<<Output>>>
A
