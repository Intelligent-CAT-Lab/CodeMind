 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the fractions and sys modules.
It then defines a function called lcm that takes two arguments, a and b, and returns their least common multiple.
The code then reads an integer N from the user, which is 2.
It then initializes a list called lis with the value 2.
It then enters a while loop that continues until the length of lis is at least 2 times N.
Inside the loop, it initializes a flag variable to True.
It then iterates through the list lis and checks if the current number is a factor of the current number. If it is, it sets the flag variable to False and breaks out of the loop.
If the flag variable is still True after the loop finishes, it means that the current number is not a factor of any number in lis, so it appends the current number to lis.
After the loop finishes, the code initializes an empty list called ans.
It then enters another loop that iterates through each element in the list ans.
Inside this loop, it enters another loop that iterates through each element in the list ans.
It then checks if the sum of the current row and column is even. If it is, it multiplies the current element in the list ans by the corresponding element in lis.
If the sum of the current row and column is odd, it checks if the sum of the current row and column plus N-1 is even. If it is, it multiplies the current element in the list ans by the corresponding element in lis.
If the sum of the current row and column plus N-1 is odd, it checks if the sum of the current row and column plus N-1 minus 1 is even. If it is, it multiplies the current element in the list ans by the corresponding element in lis.
After both loops finish, the code prints the final list ans.
