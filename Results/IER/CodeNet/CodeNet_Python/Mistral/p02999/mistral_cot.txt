<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integer inputs, a and b, separated by a space.
The input is split using the `split()` method, which splits the input string into a list of substrings based on a specified delimiter (in this case, a space).
The resulting list is then passed to the `map()` function, which applies a function to each element of the list and returns a new list with the results.
In this case, the function is `int()`, which converts each string element to an integer.
The resulting list is assigned to the variables a and b.
The code then uses an if-else statement to check if a is less than b. If it is, the code prints 0, otherwise it prints 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
