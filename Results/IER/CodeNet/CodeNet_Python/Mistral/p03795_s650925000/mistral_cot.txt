<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input from the user using the `input()` function and stores it in the variable `n`.
It then calculates the value of `N` by dividing `n` by 15 and using the floor division operator `//` to discard any decimal part.
Finally, it calculates the output by multiplying `n` by 800 and subtracting `N` multiplied by 200.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code would be 1040.
