 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input `ss` from the user.
It then calculates the hour, minute and second components of the input using the following steps:
- The hour component is calculated by dividing the input by 60**2 (i.e. 3600) and taking the integer part. This gives the number of hours in the input.
- The minute component is calculated by dividing the remainder of the input divided by 60 (i.e. 60) and taking the integer part. This gives the number of minutes in the input.
- The second component is calculated by taking the remainder of the input divided by 60 (i.e. 60) and taking the integer part. This gives the number of seconds in the input.
Finally, the code prints the hour, minute and second components of the input in the format `hh:mm:ss`.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is `14:59:09`.
