 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers N and K as input. N is 4 and K is 2.
The code initializes a variable MOD to 10**9 + 7, which is used to perform arithmetic operations with a large prime number.
The code initializes a variable i to 1 and sets M to N, which is 4.
The code enters a while loop that iterates until i * i is greater than N.
Inside the loop, the code checks if N is divisible by i. If it is, it appends i to a list div and also appends N // i to the list div.
After the loop finishes, the code sorts the list div in ascending order.
The code initializes an array num of length N1 + 1, where N1 is the length of the sorted list div.
The code initializes a variable ans to 0.
The code enters a for loop that iterates from 0 to N1.
Inside the loop, the code calculates the value of num[i] using the formula pow(K, (div[i] + 1) // 2, MOD).
The code then enters another for loop that iterates from 0 to i.
Inside this loop, the code checks if div[i] is divisible by div[j]. If it is, the code subtracts num[j] from num[i] and takes the result modulo MOD.
After the inner loop finishes, the code checks if div[i] is even. If it is, the code adds div[i] * num[i] // 2 to ans and takes the result modulo MOD.
If div[i] is odd, the code adds div[i] * num[i] to ans and takes the result modulo MOD.
After the outer loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans.
