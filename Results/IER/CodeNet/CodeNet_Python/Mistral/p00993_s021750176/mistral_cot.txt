 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first initializes a variable `n` with the value `1500`. It then uses a for loop to iterate over the range of numbers from 2 to `n`. For each number in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits using a lambda function `lambda x: sum(int(digit) for digit in str(x))`. It then checks if this sum is within the range `[2, 5]`. If it is, it adds the current number to a list `sum_1`.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the value of `sum_1`.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is the list `[2, 3, 4, 5, 11, 12, 13, 14, 2, 3, 4, 5, 11, 12, 13, 14, 2, 3, 4, 5, 11, 12, 13, 14, 2, 3, 4, 5, 11, 12, 13, 14, 2, 3, 4, 5, 11, 12, 13, 14, 2, 3, 4, 5, 11, 12, 13, 14, 2, 3, 4, 5, 11, 12, 13, 14, 2, 3, 4, 5, 11, 12, 13, 14, 2, 3, 4, 5, 11, 12, 13, 14, 2, 3, 4, 5, 11, 12, 13, 14, 2, 3, 4, 5, 11, 12, 13, 14, 2, 3, 4, 5, 11, 12, 13, 14, 2, 3, 4, 5, 11, 12, 13, 14, 2, 3, 4, 5, 11, 12, 13, 14, 2, 3, 4, 5, 11, 12, 13, 14, 2, 3, 4, 5, 11, 12, 13, 14, 2, 3, 4, 5, 11, 12, 13, 14, 2, 3, 4, 5, 11, 12, 13, 14, 2, 3, 4, 5, 11, 12, 13, 14, 2, 3, 4, 5, 11, 12, 13, 14, 2, 3, 4, 5, 11, 12, 13, 14, 2, 3, 4, 5, 11, 12, 13, 14
