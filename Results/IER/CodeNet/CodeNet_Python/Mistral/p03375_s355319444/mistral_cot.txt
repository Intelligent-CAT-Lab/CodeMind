 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first reads the input `2 1000000007` and stores it in the variables `n` and `MOD`, respectively.
The variable `SIZE` is set to `3001`, which is the maximum value of `n` that will be considered.
The code then initializes an array `inv` of size `SIZE` with all elements set to 0. It also initializes two arrays `fac` and `finv` of size `SIZE` with all elements set to 0.
The code then calculates the values of `inv`, `fac`, and `finv` using a recursive formula.
The function `choose` is defined to calculate the binomial coefficient `nCk mod MOD`.
The code then initializes an array `f` of size `SIZE` with all elements set to 0. It calculates the values of `f` using a recursive formula.
The function `size` is defined to calculate the value of `Sterling2[n][k]`, where `n` is the size of the array and `k` is the index of the element.
The code then calculates the value of `ans` by iterating over all possible values of `k` from 1 to `n`, and for each value of `k`, it calculates the value of `Sterling2[n][k]` using the formula `(Sterling2[n-1][k-1] + k*Sterling2[n-1][k])%MOD`. It then multiplies this value by the value of `size(k)` and adds it to `ans`.
The code then prints the value of `ans`.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is 0.
