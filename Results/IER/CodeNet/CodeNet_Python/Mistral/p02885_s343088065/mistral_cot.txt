 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, a and b, and uses the `map()` function to convert the input string into integers. The `input()` function reads a line from the console and returns it as a string. The `split()` method splits the string into a list of words, and the `map()` function converts each word to an integer.
The code then uses the `max()` function to find the maximum value between 0 and the result of the expression `a-2*b`. The expression `a-2*b` subtracts twice the value of b from the value of a.
The final return value of the code is the maximum value between 0 and the result of the expression `a-2*b`.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code for the input `12 4` is 12.
