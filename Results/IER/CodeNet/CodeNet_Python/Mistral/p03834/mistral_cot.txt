 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string `s` using the `input()` function.
The `replace()` method is then called on the string `s` with the argument `", "` (a comma and a space).
This replaces all occurrences of the comma in the string with a space.
The resulting string is then printed to the console using the `print()` function.
<<<Output>>>
happy newyear enjoy
