 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes two integers as input, a and b, using the `input().split()` method. The input is split by spaces, so the two integers are separated by a space.
The code then calculates the value of x by multiplying a and b, and dividing the result by 3.305785.
The value of x is then printed using the `print()` function and the `f-string` format specifier `{x:.6f}`, which formats the output to 6 decimal places.
