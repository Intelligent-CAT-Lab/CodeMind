 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input, r, D and x. The input is `2 10 20`.
The variable r is assigned the value 2, D is assigned the value 10 and x is assigned the value 20.
The code then enters a loop that iterates 10 times.
For each iteration, it calculates the value of x using the formula x = r \* x - D.
The formula is applied to the current values of r, D and x.
The value of x is then printed to the console.
After the loop finishes, the code has executed 10 times and the final value of x is printed.
