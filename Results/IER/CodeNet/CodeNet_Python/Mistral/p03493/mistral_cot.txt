<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string and uses the `count()` method to count the number of occurrences of the character '1' in the input string.
The `count()` method returns the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the specified substring in the string.
In this case, the input string is '101', which contains 3 occurrences of the character '1'.
