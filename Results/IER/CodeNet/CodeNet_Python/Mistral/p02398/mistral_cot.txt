 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input, a, b and c. In this case, a = 5, b = 14 and c = 80.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the number of factors of c that are between a and b (inclusive).
The code then enters a loop that iterates from a to b+1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 5 to 29.
For each number i in this range, it checks if c is divisible by i using the modulo operator (%). If it is, it increments the variable ans by 1.
The condition is met when i is 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 16, 20, 40 and 80.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
