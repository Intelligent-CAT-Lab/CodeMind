 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first defines two functions: `calc` and `cnk`.
The `calc` function takes two arguments: `n` and `mod`, and returns two values: `f` and `inv`.
The `cnk` function takes four arguments: `n`, `r`, `mod`, `f`, and `inv`, and returns a value.
The main part of the code reads an integer `n` from the user, and then calls the `calc` function with `n + 10` and `mod = 998244353`.
It then calculates the value of `ans` using the formula `ans = 3^n % mod`.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from `n // 2 + 10` to `n + 1`, and for each iteration, it calculates the value of `cur` using the formula `cur = 2 * cnk(n, k, mod, f, inv) * p[n - k]`.
It then subtracts `cur` from `ans`, and finally, it calculates the final value of `ans` by taking the remainder of `ans` divided by `mod`.
The return value of the code is the final value of `ans`.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is 1.
