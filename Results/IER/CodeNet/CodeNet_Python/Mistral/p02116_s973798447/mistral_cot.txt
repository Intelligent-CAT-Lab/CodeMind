 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input from the user using the `input()` function and stores it in the variable `n`.
Then it adds 1 to the input value using the `+1` operator and stores the result in the same variable `n`.
The code then uses the bitwise AND operator `&` to perform a bitwise AND operation between `n` and the value of `n` negated using the bitwise NOT operator `-`.
The bitwise NOT operator `-` flips all the bits in the number, so the result of `n&-n` is the number with all the bits set to 0.
Finally, the code prints the result of the bitwise AND operation.
<<<Output>>>
