 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string input S and iterates through each character in S. If the character is 9, it replaces it with 1. If the character is 1, it replaces it with 9. Otherwise, it leaves the character as is.
The resulting string is then printed.

The input for this code is "119".

After iterating through the characters in "119", the resulting string is "111".

<<<Output>>>
111
