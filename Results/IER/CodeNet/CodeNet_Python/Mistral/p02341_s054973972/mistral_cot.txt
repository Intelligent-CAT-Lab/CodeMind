 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, a and b, separated by a space. The input is split using the split() method, which splits the input string into a list of substrings based on a specified delimiter. In this case, the delimiter is a space. The map() function is then used to convert the two substrings to integers.
The code then uses the less than or equal to operator (<=) to compare the two integers. The result of this comparison is assigned to the variable int(a<=b), which is an integer value.
