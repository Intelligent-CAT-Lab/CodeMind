 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes three integers as input, A, B and C, which are 6, 4 and 3 respectively.
The variable get is calculated by subtracting B from A, which gives the result 2.
The variable i is then calculated by subtracting get from C, which gives the result 0.
The code then checks if i is less than 0, and if it is, it sets i to 0.
Finally, the code prints the value of i, which is 0.
<<<Output>>>
