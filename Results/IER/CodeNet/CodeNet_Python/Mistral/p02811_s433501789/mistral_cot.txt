<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs, K and N, and converts them to integers using the `map()` function.
The `input()` function reads a line of input from the user, which is then split into two parts using the `split()` method.
The `map()` function is used to convert the two input strings to integers.
The code then checks if 500 * K is greater than or equal to N. If it is, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
