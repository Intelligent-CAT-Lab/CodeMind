 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes input from the user using the `input()` function and stores it in a variable called `input()`.
The `str()` function is then called on the `input()` variable to convert it to a string.
The `[:-8]` slice notation is used to extract a substring from the beginning of the string to the second-to-last character.
The resulting substring is then printed to the console using the `print()` function.
