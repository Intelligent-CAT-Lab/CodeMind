 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input from the user and stores it in the variable D.
Then it uses an if-elif-else statement to check the value of D.
If D is equal to 25, the code prints "Christmas".
If D is equal to 24, the code prints "Christmas Eve".
If D is equal to 23, the code prints "Christmas Eve Eve".
If none of the above conditions are met, the code prints "Christmas Eve Eve Eve".
<<<Output>>>
Christmas
