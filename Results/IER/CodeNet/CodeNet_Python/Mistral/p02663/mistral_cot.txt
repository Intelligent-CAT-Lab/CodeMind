 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes five input values separated by spaces and stores them in the variables h1, m1, h2, m2, and k.
The variable t1 is calculated by multiplying h1 by 60 and adding m1.
The variable t2 is calculated by multiplying h2 by 60 and adding m2.
The code then calculates the difference between t2 and t1, and subtracts k from the result.
The final output is the result of this calculation.
