 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input n, which is 100 in this case.
It initializes a variable c to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then performs a series of arithmetic operations on n to reduce it to its smallest possible value while accumulating the sum of its digits.
n//25 reduces n to 4, which is the largest multiple of 25 less than or equal to n.
n%25 gives the remainder of n divided by 25, which is 0.
n//10 reduces n to 4, which is the largest multiple of 10 less than or equal to n.
n%10 gives the remainder of n divided by 10, which is 0.
n//5 reduces n to 4, which is the largest multiple of 5 less than or equal to n.
n%5 gives the remainder of n divided by 5, which is 0.
Finally, n%5 gives the remainder of n divided by 5, which is 0.
The code then adds the sum of the digits of n (which is 0) to c.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of c, which is 4.
<<<Output>>>
4
