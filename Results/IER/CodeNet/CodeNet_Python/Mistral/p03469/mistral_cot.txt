 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first prints the string '2018' to the console.
Then it uses the `input()` function to read input from the user.
The `input()` function reads a line of text from the user and returns it as a string.
The code then uses the `[4:]` slice notation to extract a substring of the input starting from the 5th character (index 4) and ending at the end of the string.
The resulting substring is then concatenated with the string '2018' using the `+` operator.
The resulting string is then printed to the console.
