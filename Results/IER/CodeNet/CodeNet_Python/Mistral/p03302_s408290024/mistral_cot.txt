 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input as a string, which is then split using the split() method. The resulting list is stored in the variable N.
The first element of the list N is stored in the variable a and the second element is stored in the variable b.
The code then checks if the sum of a and b is equal to 15 using the if statement. If it is, it prints '+'.
If the product of a and b is equal to 15, it prints '*'.
If neither of the above conditions are met, it prints 'x'.
<<<Output>>>
x
