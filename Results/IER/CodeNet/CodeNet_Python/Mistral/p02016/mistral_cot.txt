 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first prompts the user to enter a string using the `input()` function. The user inputs "ani".
The code then checks if the input string is equal to "ani". If it is, the code block `print('square1001')` is executed. If it is not, the code block `print('e869120')` is executed.
Since the input string is "ani", the code block `print('square1001')` is executed.
<<<Output>>>
square1001
