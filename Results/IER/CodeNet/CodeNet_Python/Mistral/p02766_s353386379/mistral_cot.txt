 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `Base_10_to_n` takes two arguments, `X` and `n`, where `X` is a number in base 10 and `n` is a number in base `n`. The function converts the number `X` from base 10 to base `n`.
The function first checks if `X` is divisible by `n`. If it is, it recursively calls itself with the quotient of `X` divided by `n` and the remainder of `X` divided by `n`. It then concatenates the remainder with the result of the recursive call.
If `X` is not divisible by `n`, it simply returns the remainder of `X` divided by `n` as a string.
The function is then called with the input `11` and `2` as arguments.
The input `11` is first converted to base 2 by dividing it by 2 repeatedly and taking the remainder of each division. The remainders are then concatenated in reverse order to form the output.
The output of the function is `1011`, which is the base 2 representation of the number `11`.
