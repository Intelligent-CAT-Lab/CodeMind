 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module, which provides access to some low-level system-specific functions.
The input() function is defined as a function that reads a line from the standard input (sys.stdin) and removes any leading or trailing whitespace.
The variable N is then read from the user input using the input() function and converted to an integer.
The sum\_N() function takes an integer N as input and returns the sum of its digits. It does this by repeatedly taking the remainder of N divided by 10 and adding it to the total, until N is less than 10.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 15.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum\_N(i).
It then calculates the sum of the digits of N - i and stores it in sum\_N(N - i).
The code then compares the sum of the digits of i and N - i and updates the variable ans if the sum is smaller.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 15.
<<<Output>>>
15
