 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 4 and p is initialized to [6].
The variable t is initialized to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10].
The variable dp is initialized to [inf] * (10**5) and dp[0] is set to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 10^5.
For each i in this range, it checks if i - ti >= 0, which is true for all values of i and ti in this case.
It then updates dp[i] to be the minimum of dp[i] and dp[i - ti] + p[num], where num is the index of ti in the list p.
After the loop finishes, the code prints dp[n], which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
