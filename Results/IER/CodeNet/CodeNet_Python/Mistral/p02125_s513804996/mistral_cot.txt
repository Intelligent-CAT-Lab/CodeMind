 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input n, which is 2 in this case.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the result.
The variable tmp is initialized to 1, which will be used to calculate the next number in the sequence.
The code enters a while loop that continues as long as tmp is less than or equal to n+1, which is 3 in this case.
Inside the loop, tmp is multiplied by 2 and ans is incremented by 1.
The loop continues until tmp is 4, at which point the loop terminates.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>
