<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, a and b, separated by a space.
The code then checks if both a and b are odd by using the modulo operator (%). If the remainder of a divided by 2 is not 0 and the remainder of b divided by 2 is not 0, the code prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
In this case, a is 3 and b is 1, so a % 2 = 1 and b % 2 = 0. Since only one of the conditions is met, the code prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
