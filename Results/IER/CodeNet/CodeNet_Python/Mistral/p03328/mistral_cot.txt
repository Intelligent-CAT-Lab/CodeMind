 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, a and b, separated by a space. In this case, a = 8 and b = 13.
The variable tower\_dis is calculated as b - a, which is 5.
The variable b\_height is calculated as tower\_dis \* (tower\_dis + 1) // 2, which is 10.
The variable ans is calculated as b\_height - b, which is 3.
The code then prints the value of ans, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>
