 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input, A, B and C.
It then checks if the sum of A and B is less than C.
If it is, it prints "No". Otherwise, it prints "Yes".
In this case, A is 50, B is 100 and C is 120.
The sum of A and B is 150, which is greater than C.
Therefore, the code will print "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
