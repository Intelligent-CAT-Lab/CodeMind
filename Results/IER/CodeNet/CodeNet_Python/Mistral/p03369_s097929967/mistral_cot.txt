<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by prompting the user to enter a string using the `input()` function. The user enters the string `oxo`.
The variable `s` is assigned the value of this string.
The variable `p` is initialized to 700.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each character in the string `s`.
For each character, it checks if it is equal to the letter 'o'. If it is, it adds 100 to the variable `p`.
Since the string `oxo` contains three 'o' characters, the variable `p` is incremented by 300 (100 for each 'o').
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of `p`, which is 1000.
<<<Output>>>
1000
