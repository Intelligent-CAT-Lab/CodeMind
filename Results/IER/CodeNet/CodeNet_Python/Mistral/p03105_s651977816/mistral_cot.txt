<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input, A, B and C.
It uses the `map()` function to convert the input string into integers.
The `input().split()` method splits the input string into a list of strings, which are then converted to integers using the `map()` function.
The code then calculates the minimum value between the quotient of B divided by A and C.
The quotient of B divided by A is 11/2 = 5.5, which is not an integer. Therefore, the minimum value is C, which is 4.
<<<Output>>>
4
