 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports several modules, including `bisect`, `random`, and `itertools`. It also sets the recursion limit to 10^5.
The `LI()`, `LF()`, `LI_()`, `II()`, `IF()`, `LS()`, `S()`, `IR()`, `LIR()`, `FR()`, `LFR()`, `LIR_()`, and `SR()` functions are defined to read input from standard input in different formats.
The `mod` and `inf` variables are defined as constants.
The `A()`, `B()`, `C()`, and `D()` functions are defined to solve the four problems.
The `B()` function is called when the program is run, so it will be executed.
The `B()` function takes an integer `s` as input and uses a `defaultdict` to keep track of the number of occurrences of each number from 1 to `s`. It then uses a helper function `f()` to find the next number in the sequence that has not yet been seen. The function starts with `i = 1` and continues to increment `i` until it finds a number that has not yet been seen. The function then prints the value of `i`.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is the value of `i` when the `B()` function is called. Since the input is `8`, the function will find the next number in the sequence that has not yet been seen, which is 3, and print the value of `i`, which is 2. Therefore, the return value of the code is 2.
