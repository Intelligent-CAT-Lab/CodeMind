 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the math module and defines a function gcd, which stands for greatest common divisor.
The variable K is initialized to 2, which is the input value.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the result of the gcd operations.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to K (inclusive), meaning it will consider pairs of numbers from 1 to 2.
For each pair of numbers a and b in this range, it calculates their gcd using the gcd function and stores the result in a variable.
Then it calculates the gcd of the result and the third number c in the range, and stores the result in a variable.
The code then adds the result of this gcd operation to ans.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
