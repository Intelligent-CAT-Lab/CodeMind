The variable n and k are initialized to 3 and 1, respectively.
The variable fac is a list of integers that stores the factorial of each number from 1 to n. It is initialized with a list of integers with the first element being 1 and the rest being 1.
The variable dp is a 2D list of integers that stores the number of ways to partition a set of n elements into k subsets. It is initialized with a list of integers with the first element being 0 and the rest being 0.
The variable last is initialized to 0.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n. For each value of i, it initializes a new 2D list ndp with the same dimensions as dp. It then updates the values of ndp using the following rules:
- If i is equal to 1, it adds the value of dp[0][0] to dp[0][1] and sets dp[0][0] to 0.
- For all other values of i, it updates the value of ndp[l][0] by adding the sum of dp[l] and dp[l-1][0] if i-k is greater than or equal to 0, and adding the sum of dp[l-1] if i+k is less than n. It then updates the value of ndp[l][1] by adding the sum of dp[l-1].
- It then updates the value of dp[0][0] to 1 and sets dp to ndp.
- It increments the value of i by 2*k.
After the loop finishes, the code updates the value of ans by subtracting the sum of dp[m] multiplied by the factorial of n-m for all odd values of m, and adding the sum of dp[m] multiplied by the factorial of n-m for all even values of m.
Finally, the code prints the value of ans.
