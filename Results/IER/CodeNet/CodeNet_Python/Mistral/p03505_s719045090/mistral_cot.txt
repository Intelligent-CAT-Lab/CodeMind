 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first defines a lambda function `ceil` that takes two arguments `a` and `b` and returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to `a / b`.
The code then reads three integers `K`, `A` and `B` from the input, which are 4000, 2000 and 500, respectively.
The code then checks if `A` is greater than or equal to `K`. If it is, it prints 1 and exits the program.
The code then calculates the difference between `A` and `B`, which is 1500.
The code then calculates the answer `ans` by multiplying the result of `ceil(K - A, A - B)` by 2.
The result of `ceil(K - A, A - B)` is 10, since `K - A` is 2000 and `A - B` is 500, and the smallest integer greater than or equal to 2000 / 500 is 4.
Therefore, `ans` is 20.
