<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an input from the user using the `input()` function and stores it in the variable `S`.
Then it checks if the first four characters of the input (`S[:4]`) are equal to 'YAKI'. If they are, it prints 'Yes', otherwise it prints 'No'.
In this case, the input is 'YAKINIKU', which has the first four characters 'YAKI'. Therefore, the code will print 'Yes'.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
