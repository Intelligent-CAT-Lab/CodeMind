 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first checks if n is odd, if it is, it prints -1 and exits.
If n is even, it calls the function f(a,bin,n) with initial values of a=[], bin=0 and n=input().
The function f(a,bin,n) uses recursion to generate all the binary numbers less than or equal to n. It does this by adding the current binary number to the list a and calling itself with the new binary number multiplied by 10 and 2 or 8, and n as the new input.
After the recursion finishes, the list a is sorted and the function g(n,0) is called with n as the input and 0 as the starting point.
The function g(n,p) uses binary search to find the index x in the list a such that a[x]==n. If such an index exists, it returns 1. Otherwise, it checks if n is divisible by the current binary number p. If it is, it calls itself with n//p as the new input and p+1 as the new starting point. If it is not divisible, it calls itself with n//p as the new input and p as the new starting point.
Finally, the function returns the maximum of the two results returned by g(n,p).
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is 1, since n is even and 2 is the smallest binary number less than or equal to n.
