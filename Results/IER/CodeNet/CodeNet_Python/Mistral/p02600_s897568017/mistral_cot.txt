 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input from the user using the `input()` function and stores it in the variable `x`.
Then it uses a series of `elif` statements to check the value of `x` and print a corresponding number from 1 to 8.
The first `elif` statement checks if `x` is between 400 and 599 (inclusive), which is not the case for `725`.
The second `elif` statement checks if `x` is between 600 and 799 (inclusive), which is also not the case for `725`.
The third `elif` statement checks if `x` is between 800 and 999 (inclusive), which is also not the case for `725`.
The fourth `elif` statement checks if `x` is between 1000 and 1199 (inclusive), which is also not the case for `725`.
The fifth `elif` statement checks if `x` is between 1200 and 1399 (inclusive), which is also not the case for `725`.
The sixth `elif` statement checks if `x` is between 1400 and 1599 (inclusive), which is also not the case for `725`.
The seventh `elif` statement checks if `x` is between 1600 and 1799 (inclusive), which is also not the case for `725`.
The eighth `elif` statement checks if `x` is between 1800 and 1999 (inclusive), which is also not the case for `725`.
Since none of the `elif` statements are true for `725`, the code does not print any output.
<<<Output>>>
No output is printed.
