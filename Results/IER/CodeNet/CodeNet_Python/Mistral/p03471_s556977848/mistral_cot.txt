 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs, n and y, which are 9 and 45000, respectively.
The code initializes a flag variable to False.
The code then enters a nested loop that iterates from 0 to n (inclusive) and from n to 0 (inclusive).
For each iteration of the outer loop, it calculates the remainder of y divided by 10000 * i, where i is the current value of the outer loop.
For each iteration of the inner loop, it calculates the remainder of y divided by 5000 * (n - i - j), where j is the current value of the inner loop.
The code then checks if the remainder of y divided by 10000 * i + 5000 * (n - i - j) is equal to n - i - j. If it is, it prints the values of i, j and the remainder divided by 1000.
The condition is met when i is 0, j is 9 and the remainder is 45000 - 10000 * 0 - 5000 * 9 = 45000.
After the loop finishes, the code prints 0 9 45000.
<<<Output>>>
0 9 45000
