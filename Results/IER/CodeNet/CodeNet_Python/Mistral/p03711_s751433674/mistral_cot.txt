 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes two integers as input, a and b, using the `input().split()` method. The input is split by spaces, so the two integers are separated by a space.
The code then creates a dictionary called `mydict` with the following keys and values:
{1: "a", 2: "c", 3: "a", 4: "b", 5: "a", 6: "b", 7: "a", 8: "a", 9: "b", 10: "a", 11: "b", 12: "a"}
The code then checks if the value associated with key a in the dictionary is equal to the value associated with key b in the dictionary. If it is, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
