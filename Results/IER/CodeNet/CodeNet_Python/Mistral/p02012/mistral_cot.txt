 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first reads the input `25` using the `I()` function.
It then calls the `solve()` function, which is the main function of the program.
The `solve()` function first initializes some variables and data structures, such as `lis`, `f`, and `p`.
It then reads the input `25` again using the `I()` function and stores it in the variable `s`.
The function then calls the `fact()` function to calculate the factorial of `s`.
It then sorts the list of factors in descending order and iterates over them.
For each factor `k`, it iterates over all possible pairs of factors `(a,b)` such that `a` and `b` are both less than or equal to `k`.
If `p[(a,b)]` is `True`, it means that `a` and `b` have already been used in a previous pair, so it increments the count of the sum of `a` and `b` in the `f` dictionary.
It then iterates over all possible pairs of factors `(a,b)` such that `a` is less than or equal to `s` and `b` is greater than or equal to `s`.
If `p[(a,b)]` is `True`, it means that `a` and `b` have already been used in a previous pair, so it increments the count of the sum of `a` and `b` in the `f` dictionary.
Finally, the function calculates the answer by multiplying the count of each sum of factors in the `f` dictionary by the count of the sum of factors in the `f` dictionary divided by the factor `k`.
It then prints the answer, which is `1`.
