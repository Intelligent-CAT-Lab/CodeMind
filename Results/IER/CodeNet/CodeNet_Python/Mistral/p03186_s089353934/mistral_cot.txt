 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes three integers as input, A, B and C, which are 3, 1 and 4 respectively.
The condition `(A+B)>C-1` is checked, which is `(3+1)>4-1`, which is `False`.
Since the condition is not met, the code executes the `else` block, which prints `B+(A+B)+1`, which is `1+(3+1)+1`, which is `6`.
<<<Output>>>
6
