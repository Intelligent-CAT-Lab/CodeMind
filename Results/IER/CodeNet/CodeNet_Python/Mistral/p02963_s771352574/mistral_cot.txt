The code first initializes a list sosu with the value 2. It then enters a while loop that iterates until now is greater than 10^9.
Inside the loop, it checks if now is divisible by any number in sosu. If it is, it is added to the list sosu.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the list sosu, which is [2, 3].
The code then reads an integer S from the user and initializes two variables st1 and st2 to the square root of S.
It enters a while loop that iterates until st1 * st2 - S is non-negative.
Inside the loop, it checks if st1 * st2 - S is divisible by any number in sosu. If it is, it prints the result (0, 0, st1, cd // i, i, st2) and breaks out of the loop.
After the loop finishes, the code updates the values of st1 and st2 based on the mode variable.
The code then updates the values of st1 and st2 based on the mode variable.
