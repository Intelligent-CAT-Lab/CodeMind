 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input from the user using the `input()` function and stores it in the variable `n`.
Then it calculates the value of `(n-2) * 180` and prints it to the console.
The value of `(n-2) * 180` is calculated by subtracting 2 from the input value `n`, and then multiplying the result by 180.
For example, if the input is 3, the value of `(n-2) * 180` would be `(3-2) * 180 = 1 * 180 = 180`.
<<<Output>>>
180
