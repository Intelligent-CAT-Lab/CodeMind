 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes five integers as input, which are 5, 4, 2, 2, and 1.
The variables W, H, x, y, and r are initialized to these values.
The code then checks if the following conditions are met:
- left: x-r >= 0, which is true in this case since x-r=2>=0
- right: x+r <= W, which is true in this case since x+r=7<=2
- top: y+r <= H, which is true in this case since y+r=3<=4
- bottom: y-r >= 0, which is true in this case since y-r=3>=0
Since all four conditions are true, the code prints "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
