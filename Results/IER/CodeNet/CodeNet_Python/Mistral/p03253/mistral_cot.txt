 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first initializes two variables, n and m, with the values 2 and 6, respectively.
It then defines three constants, MAX, MOD and invfact, which are used to store the maximum value of the input, the modulus used for arithmetic operations and the inverse factorial of a number, respectively.
The code then defines three lists, fact, inv and invfact, which are used to store the factorial of a number, the inverse factorial of a number and the inverse factorial of a number multiplied by the factorial of another number, respectively.
The function comb_build is then called with the argument n, which is 20 in this case. This function initializes the three lists with the values 1, 1 and 1, respectively, and then calculates the factorial and inverse factorial of each number from 2 to 20 using a loop.
The function nCk is then called with the arguments n and k, which are 20 and 2, respectively. This function calculates the number of combinations of k items taken from a set of n items using the formula nCk = (n! / (k!(n-k)!)).
The function prime_factor is then called with the argument n, which is 20 in this case. This function calculates the prime factorization of the number n using a loop and returns a dictionary with the prime factors as keys and their multiplicities as values.
Finally, the code multiplies the product of the inverse factorial of each prime factor of n with the number of combinations of k items taken from a set of n items and returns the result modulo the modulus used for arithmetic operations.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is 100, which is the result of multiplying the inverse factorial of 2 (which is 1) with the inverse factorial of 2 (which is 1) and the number of combinations of 2 items taken from a set of 20 items (which is 190).
