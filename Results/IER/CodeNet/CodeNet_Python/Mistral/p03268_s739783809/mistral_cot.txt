 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers N and K as input, where N is the number of elements in the array and K is the number of elements in each subarray.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of the squares of the differences between the number of subarrays and the number of elements in each subarray.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider all possible subarrays.
For each subarray, it calculates the number of subarrays and the number of elements in each subarray.
It then calculates the difference between the number of subarrays and the number of elements in each subarray.
The code checks if the difference is an integer, if it is, it adds the square of the difference to ans.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
