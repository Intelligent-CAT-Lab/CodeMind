<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an input string `s` using the `input()` function.
It then calculates the length of the string `s` using the `len()` function and subtracts 2 from it to get the length of the string without the first and last characters.
The length of the string without the first and last characters is then converted to a string using the `str()` function and stored in the variable `l`.
Finally, the code concatenates the first character of the string `s`, the length of the string without the first and last characters `l`, and the last character of the string `s` using the `+` operator and prints the result.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is the concatenation of the first character of the input string, the length of the string without the first and last characters, and the last character of the input string.
For the input "internationalization", the return value would be "i1n".
