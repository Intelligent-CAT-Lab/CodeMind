 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three input values separated by spaces and stores them in the variables a, b and c.
The code then checks if a is equal to b, if a is equal to c, or if neither of these conditions is met.
If a is equal to b, the code prints c. In this case, c is 5.
If a is equal to c, the code prints b. In this case, b is 7.
If neither of these conditions is met, the code prints a. In this case, a is 5.
<<<Output>>>
5
