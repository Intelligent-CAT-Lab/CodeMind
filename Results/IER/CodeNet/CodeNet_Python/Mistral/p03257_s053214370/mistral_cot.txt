 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first initializes a list of primes up to 100000 using a sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm. It then initializes a 2D array ans of size 502 x 502, where each element represents the answer for a given input.
The code then iterates through all possible pairs of integers (i, j) from 1 to 501, and calculates the answer for each pair based on the conditions given in the problem.
For even pairs (i + j) % 2 == 0, the code calculates the answer by multiplying the primes at the positions (i + j) / 2 and 753 + (i - j) / 2 in the list of primes.
For odd pairs (i + j) % 2 == 1, the code calculates the answer by multiplying the answer for the previous pair (i - 1, j), the answer for the next pair (i + 1, j), the answer for the pair (i, j - 1), and the answer for the pair (i, j + 1), and then taking the square root of the result and adding 1.
Finally, the code iterates through all possible integers from 1 to N and prints the answer for each integer.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code for input 2 is not applicable as the input is not a valid integer. The code expects an integer input.
