 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the itertools module.
It then reads two integers N and K from the input, which are 5 and 3 respectively.
The variable x is calculated as (N-1)*(N-2)//2, which is 10 in this case.
The code then checks if x is less than K, which is true in this case.
Since x is less than K, the code prints -1 and exits.
Therefore, the return value of the code is -1.
<<<Output>>>
-1
