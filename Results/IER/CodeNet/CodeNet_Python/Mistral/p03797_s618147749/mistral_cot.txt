 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes two integers n and m as input, separated by a space.
It then checks if n * 2 >= m, which is equivalent to n >= m/2.
If this condition is true, it prints m//2, which is 3 in this case.
If the condition is false, it calculates the remainder of m divided by n * 2, which is 1.
It then adds n to this remainder and divides the result by 4, which gives 0.
Finally, it prints 0.
<<<Output>>>
0
