 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers m and n as input, which are 2 and 3 respectively.
The variable mod is initialized to 10**9 + 7, which is a large prime number used as a modulus to avoid integer overflow.
The variable ans is initialized to the result of raising m to the power of n modulo mod.
The code uses the built-in function `pow()` to calculate the result of raising m to the power of n.
The result is then printed using the `print()` function.
