<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user, which is a string of three integers separated by spaces. The input is then split using the `split()` method, which returns a list of the input string's elements.
The `map()` function is then applied to the list of integers, which converts each element to an integer. The resulting list is assigned to the variable `A`.
The `min()` function is then called on the list `A`, which returns the smallest element in the list.
The `max()` function is then called on the list `A`, which returns the largest element in the list.
The final output is the minimum and maximum values of the list `A`.
