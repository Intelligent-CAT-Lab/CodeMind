 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first reads a string input from the user using the `raw_input()` function and stores it in the variable `s`.
Then it checks if the first character of the string is 'x' and the last character is also 'x'. If both conditions are true, it prints 'x', otherwise it prints 'o'.
In the case of the input 'oxxoxoo', the first character is 'o' and the last character is 'o', so the code prints 'o'.
<<<Output>>>
o
