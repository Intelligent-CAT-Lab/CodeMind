 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module, which allows it to read input from the standard input stream.
The input function is defined to read a line of input from the standard input stream and remove any trailing whitespace.
The main function is defined to take four integer arguments, h, w, a, and b, which represent the dimensions of a grid.
It creates an empty list S, which will be used to store the rows of the grid.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from b to h-b (inclusive), meaning it will consider rows from 1 to 3.
For each row i in this range, it creates a string of length w, consisting of alternating 1s and 0s.
The number of 1s in the string is determined by the value of a, which is 1 in this case.
The number of 0s in the string is determined by the value of w-a, which is 2 in this case.
The code then appends this string to the list S.
After the loop finishes, the code enters another loop that iterates from h to h-b (inclusive), meaning it will consider rows from 4 to 3.
For each row i in this range, it creates a string of length w, consisting of alternating 1s and 0s.
The number of 1s in the string is determined by the value of a, which is 1 in this case.
The number of 0s in the string is determined by the value of w-a, which is 2 in this case.
The code then appends this string to the list S.
Finally, the code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to h-1 (inclusive), meaning it will print each row of the grid.
For each row i in this range, it prints the string in the list S[i].
