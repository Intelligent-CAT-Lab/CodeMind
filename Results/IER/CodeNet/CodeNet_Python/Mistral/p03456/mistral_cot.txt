 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two numbers a and b from the standard input using the `sys.stdin.readline().split()` method. The two numbers are then added and the result is stored in the variable n.
The variable sqrtn is then calculated by taking the integer square root of n using the `int(sqrt(n))` method.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to sqrtn (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 4.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i squared is equal to n. If it is, it prints 'Yes' and breaks out of the loop.
After the loop finishes, if no number was found, it prints 'No'.
<<<Output>>>
No
