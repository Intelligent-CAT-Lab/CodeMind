The return value of the code for the input `2 2` would be 1.

This is because the condition `A <= sum_order <= B` is met only once for `i = 2`, and the sum of the digits of 2 is 2, which is within the range [2, 5]. Therefore, the value of `i` is added to `sum_1`, which is 2. The final value of `sum_1` is 2, which is less than or equal to 5, so the condition is met. The function returns 2.
