 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports several Python libraries, including sys, numpy, math, fractions, itertools, collections, heapq, and bisect.
It then reads an integer n from the standard input, which is 575.
The code then calculates the remainder j of n divided by 10, which is 5.
It also calculates the quotient i of n divided by 100, which is 5.
Since i and j are equal, the code prints "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
