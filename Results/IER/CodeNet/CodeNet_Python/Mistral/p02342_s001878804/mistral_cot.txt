 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers N and K as input, where N is the number of rows and K is the number of columns.
The variable MOD is initialized to 10**9 + 7, which is used to handle the large values that may be returned by the calculations.
The variable D is a 2D list of size (N+1) x (K+1), which is used to store the values of the matrix.
The code initializes the first row and first column of the matrix with 1.
The code then initializes the rest of the matrix by iterating over all possible pairs of rows and columns, and calculating the value of the cell at position (row, column) using the formula:
D[row][column] = (D[row-k][column] + D[row-1][column-1]) % MOD
where k is the number of columns in the current row.
Finally, the code prints the value of the cell at position (N, K) of the matrix, which is the answer to the problem.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is 100.
