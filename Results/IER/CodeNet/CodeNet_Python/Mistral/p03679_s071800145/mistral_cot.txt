 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable x, variable a and variable b are initialized to 4, 3 and 6, respectively.
The code then enters a conditional statement that checks if b is less than or equal to a. Since b is 6 and a is 3, the condition is not met and the code moves on to the next conditional statement.
The code then checks if (b - a) is less than or equal to x. Since (6 - 3) is 3 and 3 is less than or equal to 4, the condition is met and the code prints "safe".
<<<Output>>>
safe
