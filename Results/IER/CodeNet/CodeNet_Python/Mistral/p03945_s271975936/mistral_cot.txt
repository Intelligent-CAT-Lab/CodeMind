 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string S from standard input, which is `BBBWW`.
It initializes the variable turn to 0 and the variable current to the first character of the string, which is B.
It then iterates over the characters of the string, comparing each character with the current character.
If the characters are different, it increments the turn variable and updates the current variable to the new character.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the value of turn, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>
3
