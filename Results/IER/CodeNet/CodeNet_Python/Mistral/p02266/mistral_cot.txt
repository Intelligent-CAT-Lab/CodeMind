 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first defines a function `func(c)` that takes a character c as input and returns the value of a global variable `cnt` after performing some operations on c.
The function uses a dictionary to map characters to integers, where '_' is 0, '/' is 1 and '\' is -1. It then updates the global variable `cnt` based on the value of c in the dictionary.
The code then initializes a list `g` with a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a function call to `func(c)` for a character c in the input, and a boolean value indicating whether the function call returned True or False.
The code then finds the maximum value in the first element of each tuple in `g`, and sets the boolean value of the corresponding tuple to True.
The code then initializes variables `puddles`, `volume` and `saface_level` to empty lists, integers and None, respectively.
The code then iterates over the list `g` in reverse order, starting from the last element. For each element, it checks if `saface_level` is not None. If it is, it adds the volume of the current puddle to the `volume` variable and checks if the current level is equal to the previous level. If it is, it adds the volume to the `puddles` list and sets `saface_level` to None and `volume` to 0. If `saface_level` is None and the boolean value of the current tuple is True, it sets `saface_level` to the current level.
Finally, the code reverses the `puddles` list and prints the sum of the elements in the list and the length of the list.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of `\\//` would be 2, since the function call to `func('\\')` would update the global variable `cnt` to 2.
