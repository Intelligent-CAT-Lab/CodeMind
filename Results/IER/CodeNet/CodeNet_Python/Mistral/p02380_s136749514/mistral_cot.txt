 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the necessary modules: enum, sys, math.
It then defines three constants: BIG\_NUM, MOD and EPS.
The input is read from the user and stored in the variables A, B and DEGREE.
The variable rad is calculated by converting the value of DEGREE from degrees to radians using the math.radians() function.
The variable S is calculated by multiplying A and B and dividing the result by 2, then multiplying it by the sine of rad.
The variable C is calculated by taking the square root of the sum of A squared and B squared, minus twice A and B multiplied by the cosine of rad.
The variable h is calculated by dividing S by A.
Finally, the code prints the values of S, A+B+C and h rounded to 10 decimal places using the "%.10f" format specifier.

The return value of the code for the input `4 3 90` would be:
