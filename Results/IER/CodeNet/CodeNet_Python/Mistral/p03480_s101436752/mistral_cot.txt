 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input string `S` and removes any leading or trailing whitespace using the `strip()` method.
The length of the string is then calculated and stored in the variable `K`.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from the second character (index 1) to the second-to-last character (index `K-1`) of the string.
For each character, it checks if it is different from the next character. If it is, it calculates the length of the longest contiguous subsequence of characters that are different from the current character. This is done by finding the maximum of the length of the subsequence starting from the current character (`i+1`) and the length of the subsequence ending at the current character (`len(S)-i-1`).
The length of the longest contiguous subsequence of different characters is then compared to the current value of `K`. If it is smaller, `K` is updated to the new value.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of `K`.
<<<Output>>>
2

The return value of the code based on the input `010` is 2.
