 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four integers as input, a, b, c and d.
It initializes a variable ans to -1000000000000000000, which is the maximum value possible for an integer.
The code then uses the max() function to find the maximum of four possible values:
* a * c
* a * d
* b * c
* b * d
The max() function returns the largest of the four arguments, so the final value of ans will be the largest of the four possible values.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code will be 10, which is the maximum of the four possible values: 1*1, 1*1, 2*1 and 2*1.
