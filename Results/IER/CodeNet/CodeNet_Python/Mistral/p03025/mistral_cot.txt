 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n, variable a, variable b, and variable c are initialized to 1, 25, 25, and 50, respectively.
The variable p is initialized to 10**9 + 7.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the final result.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 1.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [a, b], which is [25, 25, 50] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to ans. The condition is met when i is 1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 25.
<<<Output>>>
25
