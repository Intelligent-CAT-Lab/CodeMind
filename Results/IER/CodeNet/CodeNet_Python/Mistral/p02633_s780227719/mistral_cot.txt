<<<Analysis>>>
The code first prompts the user to enter a value for X using the `input()` function and stores it in the variable `X`.
It then imports the `math` module to use the `gcd()` function.
The `gcd()` function calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers. In this case, it calculates the greatest common divisor of 360 and X.
The result of `gcd(360, X)` is then used to calculate the final value of `ans` using integer division (`//` operator).
The final value of `ans` is then printed to the console using the `print()` function.
<<<Output>>>
10

Therefore, the return value of the code based on the input `90` would be 10.
