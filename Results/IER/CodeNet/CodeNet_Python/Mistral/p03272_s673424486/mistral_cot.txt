 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads the input line using the `nm()` function, which returns a tuple containing the number of integers and the integers themselves. In this case, the input line is `4 2`, so the tuple returned by `nm()` is `(2, 4)`.
The variable `n` is assigned the value of the first integer in the tuple, which is 2, and the variable `i` is assigned the value of the second integer in the tuple, which is 4.
The `main()` function then prints the value of `n - i + 1`, which is 2 - 4 + 1 = -1.
<<<Output>>>
-1
