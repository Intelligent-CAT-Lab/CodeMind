 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input, a, b and c, and assigns them to the variables a, b and c respectively.
The code then checks if a is equal to b and b is equal to c using the logical operator 'and'.
If both conditions are true, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
