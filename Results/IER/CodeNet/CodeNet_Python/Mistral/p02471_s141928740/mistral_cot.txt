 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first defines a function `ex_euclid` that takes two arguments `x` and `y`. It uses a while loop to perform the Euclidean algorithm on `x` and `y`. The algorithm works by repeatedly replacing `x` with `y` and `y` with the remainder of `x` divided by `y`. The algorithm terminates when `y` becomes 0.
The function returns three values: `c`, `a`, and `b`. `c` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, `a` is the quotient of `x` divided by `c`, and `b` is the quotient of `y` divided by `c`.
The code then reads two integers `x` and `y` from the user using the `input()` function and the `map()` function to convert the input string into integers.
It then calls the `ex_euclid` function with `x` and `y` as arguments and stores the returned values in the variables `c`, `a`, and `b`.
Finally, it prints the values of `a` and `b`.
