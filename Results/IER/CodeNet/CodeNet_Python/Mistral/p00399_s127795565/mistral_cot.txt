<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four integers as input, which are stored in the variables r, b, w, and g.
The code then adds the values of these variables and prints the result.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code would be 7.

The output is obtained by adding the values of the variables r, b, w, and g, which are 4, 2, 1, and 1 respectively.

Therefore, the return value of the code is 7.
