 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes two integers as input, a and b, using the `input().split()` method. The `map()` function is then used to convert the input integers to integers.
The code then uses an `if` statement to check if the absolute difference between a and b is greater than 1. If it is, the string 'Alice' is printed, otherwise the string 'Brown' is printed.
In this case, the input is `2 1`, so the absolute difference between a and b is 1, which is less than 1. Therefore, the string 'Brown' is printed.
<<<Output>>>
Brown
