The return value of the code is not applicable, as it does not return a value. Instead, it prints the values of s and l to the console.
For the input value of 2, the values of s and l would be:
s = 12.566370614359172
l = 25.13274063492503
Therefore, the output of the code would be:
12.56637 25.13274
