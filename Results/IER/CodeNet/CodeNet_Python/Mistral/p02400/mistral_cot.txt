 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the math module.
It then prompts the user to enter a value for r, which is stored in the variable r.
The variable s is then calculated by multiplying r by itself and multiplying the result by pi, which is stored in the math module.
The variable l is then calculated by multiplying r by 2 and multiplying the result by pi.
Finally, the code prints the values of s and l rounded to 5 decimal places using the format string '%.5f %.5f'.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is not applicable, as it does not return a value. Instead, it prints the values of s and l to the console.
For the input value of 2, the values of s and l would be:
s = 12.566370614359172
l = 25.13274063492503
Therefore, the output of the code would be:
12.56637 25.13274
