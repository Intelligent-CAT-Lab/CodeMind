 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four integers as input, a, b, c and d, and stores them in variables a, b, c and d, respectively.
The code then uses the `map()` function to convert the input integers to integers.
The code then uses the `input().split()` method to split the input string into a list of integers.
The code then uses the `map()` function again to convert the list of integers to integers.
The code then uses the `max()` function to find the maximum value between a and c.
The code then uses the `min()` function to find the minimum value between b and d.
The code then subtracts the maximum value from the minimum value.
The code then uses the `max()` function again to find the maximum value between the result and 0.
The code then prints the final result.
