 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers n and m as input, which are 2 in this case.
It initializes an array d of size n+1 with all elements set to 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 1.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the value of d[i+1] using the formula:
d[i+1] = ((m-i)*((m-n+i)*d[i]+i*d[i-1]*(m-i+1)))%(10**9+7)
The condition is met when i is 0, 1 and 2.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of d[-1], which is 1.
