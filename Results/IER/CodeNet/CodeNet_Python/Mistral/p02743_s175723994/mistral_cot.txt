 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the math module and defines a constant mod as 10**9+7.
Then it takes three integers a, b and c as input using the map() function and converts them to integers.
The code then checks if the sum of the square roots of a and b is less than the square root of c. However, this condition is not used in the final code.
Instead, the code checks if 4*a*b is less than (c-a-b)**2 and c-a-b is greater than 0.
If this condition is met, the code prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".
For the input 2 3 9, the condition 4*a*b<(c-a-b)**2 and c-a-b>0 is not met, so the code prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
