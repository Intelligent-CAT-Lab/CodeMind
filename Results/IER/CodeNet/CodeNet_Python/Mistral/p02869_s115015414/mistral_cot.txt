 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first reads the input `1 1` and stores it in the variables `N` and `K`, respectively.
It then creates three lists `A`, `B`, and `C` based on the input.
`A` contains the elements of the set `{1}`, `B` contains the elements of the set `{1, 2}`, and `C` contains the elements of the set `{1, 2, 3}`.
The code then creates an instance of the `PMS` class with the input values.
The `PMS` class has several methods that can be used to perform various operations on the input data.
In this case, the code uses the `get` method to retrieve the value at index `1` from the `C` list, which is `2`.
The return value of the code is the value retrieved by the `get` method, which is `2`.
