 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable S is initialized to the input string "AtCoder".
The code then initializes flag to 0.
The first if statement checks if the first character of S is not "A". Since it is not, flag is set to 1.
The second if statement checks if the number of occurrences of "C" in S is not equal to 1. Since it is not, flag is set to 1.
The third if statement checks if the number of occurrences of uppercase letters in S is not equal to 2. Since it is not, flag is set to 1.
Since flag is set to 1 in all three if statements, the final print statement is "WA".
<<<Output>>>
WA
