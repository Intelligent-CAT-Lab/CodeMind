 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the math module.
Then it takes three integers as input, a, h, and x, and stores them in the variables a, h, and x, respectively.
The code then calculates y using the formula 2*h/a - 2*x/a**3.
It then calculates z using the formula (h**2)*a/(2*x).
The code then checks if b, which is x/(a**2), is greater than h/2. If it is, it calculates the arctangent of y using the math.atan function and converts it to degrees using the math.degrees function. If it is not, it calculates the arctangent of z using the math.atan function and converts it to degrees using the math.degrees function.
The final return value of the code is the arctangent of y or z, depending on the value of b.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code for the input `2 2 4` is 45.0 degrees.
This is because b is 2, which is less than h/2, so the code calculates the arctangent of z using the math.atan function and converts it to degrees using the math.degrees function.
