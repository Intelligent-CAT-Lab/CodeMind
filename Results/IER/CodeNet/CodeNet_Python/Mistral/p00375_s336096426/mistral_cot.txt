<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input F from the user.
It then calculates the value of a by subtracting 30 from F, dividing the result by 2 and taking the integer part.
The formula used to calculate a is:
a = (F - 30) / 2
Therefore, when F is 68, the value of a will be:
a = (68 - 30) / 2 = 16
<<<Output>>>
16
