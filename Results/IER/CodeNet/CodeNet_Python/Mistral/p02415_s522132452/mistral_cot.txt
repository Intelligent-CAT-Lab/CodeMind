<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string input from the user using the `input()` function and stores it in the variable `target`.
The `swapcase()` method is then called on the `target` variable, which swaps all the uppercase letters to lowercase and vice versa.
The resulting string is stored in the variable `Ans`.
The `print()` function is then called to print the value of `Ans`.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code would be:
`fair, later, occasionally cloudy.`
