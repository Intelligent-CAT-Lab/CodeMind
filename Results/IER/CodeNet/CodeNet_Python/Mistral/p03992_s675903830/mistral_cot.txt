<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string input from the user using the `input()` function and stores it in the variable `S`.
The `print()` function is then used to print the first 4 characters of the string (`S[0:4]`) and the next 8 characters of the string (`S[4:12]`).
The first 4 characters of the input string are "CODE" and the next 8 characters are "FESTIVAL".
<<<Output>>>
CODEFESTIVAL
