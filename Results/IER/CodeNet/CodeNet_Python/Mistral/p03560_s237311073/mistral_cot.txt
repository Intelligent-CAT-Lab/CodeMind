 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input and uses it to calculate the remainder when divided by 10. This remainder is used as the first digit of the number to be calculated.
The function `calc` uses a deque to keep track of the digits and their corresponding counts. It starts with a deque containing the digit 1 and its count of 1.
The function then enters a loop that iterates until the deque is empty. For each iteration, it calculates the next digit by multiplying the current digit by 10 and taking the remainder when divided by k. If this digit is not in the dictionary or its count is less than the current count, it updates the dictionary and adds the digit to the deque.
The function then calculates the next digit by adding 1 to the current digit and taking the remainder when divided by k. If this digit is not in the dictionary or its count is less than the current count, it updates the dictionary and adds the digit to the deque.
After the loop finishes, the function returns the count of the digit 0 in the dictionary.
For the input 6, the remainder when divided by 10 is 6, so the first digit is 6. The function then calculates the next digit by multiplying 6 by 10 and taking the remainder when divided by 6, which is 0. Since 0 is already in the dictionary with a count of 1, the function does not update the dictionary and does not add the digit to the deque.
The function then calculates the next digit by adding 1 to 6 and taking the remainder when divided by 6, which is 1. Since 1 is already in the dictionary with a count of 1, the function does not update the dictionary and does not add the digit to the deque.
After the loop finishes, the function returns the count of the digit 0 in the dictionary, which is 1.
