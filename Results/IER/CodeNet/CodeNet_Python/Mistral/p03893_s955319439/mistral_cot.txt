 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first prompts the user to enter a number using the `input()` function and stores it in the variable `x`.
The variable `j` is then initialized to 2.
The code then enters a loop that iterates `x` times.
In each iteration, `j` is multiplied by 2 and then added 2.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of `j`.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is 32.
