 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first reads input from the user using the raw\_input() function and stores it in the variable s.
The variable f is initialized to 0.
The code then iterates through each character in the input string s using a for loop.
For each character, it checks if it is equal to "C" and if f is equal to 0. If both conditions are true, it increments f by 1.
Then, it checks if f is equal to 1 and if the current character is equal to "F". If both conditions are true, it prints "Yes" and exits the loop using the exit() function.
If none of the conditions are met, it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
