 <<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a list dp with the first element set to 1 and all other elements set to 0.
The variables n and m are then read from the input, which are 2 and 1 respectively.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n (inclusive).
For each i in this range, it initializes j to 1 and enters a while loop that iterates as long as i+j is less than or equal to n and j is less than or equal to m.
Inside the while loop, it adds the value of dp[i] divided by n-i to dp[i+j].
After the while loop finishes, the code continues to the next iteration of the outer loop.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of dp[n], which is 1.
