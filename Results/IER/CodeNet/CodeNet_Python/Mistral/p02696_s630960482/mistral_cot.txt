 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input, A, B and N.
It first checks if N is greater than or equal to B. If it is, it sets x to B - 1. Otherwise, it sets x to N.
Then it calculates the answer ans using the formula:
ans = ((A * x) // B) - (A * (x // B))
This formula is used to find the remainder when dividing A by B, and then subtracting that remainder from the result of dividing A by B.
The final value of ans is then printed.
<<<Output>>>
