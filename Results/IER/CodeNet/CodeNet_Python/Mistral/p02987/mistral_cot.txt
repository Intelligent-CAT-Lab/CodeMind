 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes four inputs from the user, a, b, c and d.
It then initializes a variable flag to 0.
The code then checks if a is equal to b and c and d, and if so, sets flag to 1.
It then checks if a is equal to c and b and d, and if so, sets flag to 1.
It then checks if a is equal to d and b and c, and if so, sets flag to 1.
If none of these conditions are met, flag remains at 0.
The code then checks if a is equal to b, c and d, and if so, sets flag to 0.
Finally, the code checks if flag is equal to 1, and if so, prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
