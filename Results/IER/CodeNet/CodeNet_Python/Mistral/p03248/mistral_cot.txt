 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first checks if the last digit of the input string is 1 or if the first digit is 0. If either of these conditions is true, it prints -1 and exits.

Since the input string is "1111", neither of these conditions is met, so the code proceeds to the next step.

The code then iterates through half of the input string, comparing each character to the corresponding character from the end of the string. If any of these characters do not match, the code prints -1 and exits.

Since all characters in the input string match, the code proceeds to the next step.

The code creates a new string by adding a 1 to the end of the input string. It then creates a list of indices of all the 1's in the new string.

The code then iterates through the input string, using the bisect module to find the index of each character in the list of indices. It then prints the index of the character plus 1.

For the input string "1111", the output will be:

1 2
2 3
3 4

<<<Output>>>
1 2
2 3
3 4
