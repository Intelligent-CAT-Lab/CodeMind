 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable K, and variable M are initialized to 3, 1, and 998244353, respectively.
The variable L is calculated as (N+1)//2+1, which is 2 in this case.
The function even(n, k) is defined to calculate the number of ways to find a sequence of k consecutive integers with a sum of n modulo M.
The function loop(x, y) is defined to check if x and y are valid values for the problem.
The code first checks if K is even, and if it is, it calculates the product of two even numbers with a sum of N//2 and N+1//2, and then calculates the product of these two numbers modulo M.
If K is odd, the code initializes dp0, a 3D array to store the number of ways to find a sequence of k consecutive integers with a sum of n modulo M.
The code then iterates through each number i from 0 to N-1, and for each number i, it iterates through each pair (x, y) such that x and y are valid values for the problem.
For each pair (x, y), the code iterates through each z from x to y+1, and for each z, it checks if dp0[x][y][z] is 0. If it is, the code continues to the next z. Otherwise, the code updates dp1[y][x+1][z] by adding dp0[x][y][z] and then updating dp1[y][x+1][z] modulo M.
The code then updates dp0 to be dp1.
Finally, the code iterates through each pair (x, y) such that x and y are valid values for the problem, and for each pair (x, y), it iterates through each z from x to y+1, and for each z, it adds dp0[x][y][z] to a variable ret and updates ret modulo M.
The code then prints the value of ret.
