 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input `n` from the user.
It then initializes a boolean variable `yes` to `True`.
The code then checks if `n` is less than or equal to 10. If it is, `yes` remains `True`.
If `n` is between 11 and 81 (inclusive), the code checks if `n` is divisible by any of the primes in the list `primesand10`. If it is, `yes` is set to `False` and the loop is broken.
If `n` is greater than 81, `yes` is set to `False`.
Finally, the code checks if `yes` is `True` and prints "Yes" if it is, otherwise it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
