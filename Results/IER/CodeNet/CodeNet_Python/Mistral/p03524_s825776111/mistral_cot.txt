 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an input string S, which is "abac" in this case.
It then uses the `count()` method to count the number of occurrences of the characters "a", "b" and "c" in the string S.
The variables a, b and c are assigned the values 2, 1 and 1, respectively.
The code then checks if the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum of these variables is greater than or equal to 2.
In this case, the maximum is 2 and the minimum is 1, so the absolute difference is 1, which is less than 2.
Therefore, the code prints "YES".
<<<Output>>>
YES
