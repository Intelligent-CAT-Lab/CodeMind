 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module, which allows it to read from and write to the standard input and output streams.
The readline function is used to read a line of input from the standard input stream, which is then split into three integers N, M, and K using the split function.
The variable MOD is set to 10**9 + 7, which is used as the modulus for arithmetic operations.
The variable L is calculated as N+M+2*K, which is the total number of elements in the array.
The fact and rfact arrays are initialized using a loop that iterates from 1 to L+1. The fact array stores the factorial of each element, while the rfact array stores the inverse factorial of each element.
The C function is used to calculate the number of combinations of N+2*a+M+2*b elements taken N+2*a elements at a time.
The F function is used to calculate the number of ways to partition N+a and M+b elements into two groups.
The solve function then iterates over all possible values of a and b from 0 to K, and calculates the number of combinations and partitions for each value of a and b. It then multiplies these values together and sums them up, modulo MOD.
Finally, the solve function returns the sum of all possible combinations and partitions, modulo MOD.
