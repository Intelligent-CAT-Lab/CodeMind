The code imports the math module, which provides access to mathematical functions and constants.
The variables w, h, and c are initialized to 10, 20, and 5, respectively.
The code uses the map() function to convert the input string into integers.
The code then calculates the area of the rectangle by multiplying the width and height, and dividing by the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the width and height squared. The GCD is calculated using the math.gcd() function.
The result is then multiplied by the value of c.
The final result is printed to the console.
