 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first reads an integer K from the user using the input() function and stores it in the variable K.
It then initializes the variables N, div and mod. N is set to 50, div is calculated by dividing K by N using the // operator, and mod is calculated by taking the remainder of K divided by N using the % operator.
The variable A is then initialized as a list of length N, where each element is calculated using a list comprehension. The comprehension iterates over the range of N and for each i, it calculates the value a = i + div - mod.
The code then iterates over the range of mod and for each i, it adds N + 1 to the corresponding element of the list A.
Finally, the code prints the value of N and the list A.
