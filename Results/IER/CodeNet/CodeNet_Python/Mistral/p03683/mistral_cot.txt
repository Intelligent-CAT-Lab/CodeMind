 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, N and M.
It initializes a threshold value of 10^9+7.
The code then checks if the absolute difference between N and M is equal to 1. If it is, it sets N to the smaller of the two numbers and sets retVal to 1. It then calculates the sum of squares of all numbers from 1 to N and checks if it is greater than or equal to the threshold. If it is, it takes the remainder of the sum divided by the threshold. It then adds N+1 to the sum and checks if it is greater than or equal to the threshold. If it is, it takes the remainder of the sum divided by the threshold. Finally, it prints the value of retVal.
If the absolute difference between N and M is not equal to 1, the code checks if N is equal to M. If it is, it sets retVal to 2 and calculates the sum of squares of all numbers from 1 to N. It then checks if it is greater than or equal to the threshold. If it is, it takes the remainder of the sum divided by the threshold. Finally, it prints the value of retVal.
If neither of the above conditions are met, the code prints 0.
