The return value of the code for the input `2 2` is 2.

The code checks if either n or m is equal to 1. Since neither of them is equal to 1, it moves to the next condition.
It calculates the product of n and m, which is 2 \* 2 = 4.
Since 4 is not equal to 1, it subtracts 2 from it, which gives 2.
Therefore, the return value of the code for the input `2 2` is 2.
