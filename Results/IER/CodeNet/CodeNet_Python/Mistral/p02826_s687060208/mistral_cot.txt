The code first takes two integers N and M as input, which are 2 and 998244353, respectively.
The variable A is initialized to a list of integers from 1 to N//2 (inclusive), which is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] in this case.
The code then checks if N is odd, which is True in this case. If N is odd, it adds (N+1)//2 to A, which is 5 in this case.
The variable d is initialized to a list of integers with the first element set to 1 and the rest of the elements set to 0. The length of d is N+N, which is 1998244353+1998244353=3996488706.
The code then enters a nested loop that iterates over each element in A and each element in d. For each iteration, it performs the following operations:
* It takes the current element x from A and adds it to the current element i in d.
* It takes the current element i in d and takes its modulo with M, which is 2 in this case.
* It takes the current element i+x in d and takes its modulo with M, which is 2 in this case.
* It takes the current element i+x in d and adds the current element i in d to it.
After the nested loop finishes, the code takes the sum of the first N elements in d, which is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102
