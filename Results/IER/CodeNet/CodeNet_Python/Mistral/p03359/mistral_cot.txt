 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user, which is a string of the form "5 5".
The input is then split using the split() method, which splits the string into a list of strings based on the whitespace character.
The list contains two strings, "5" and "5", which are then converted to integers using the map() function and the int() function.
The variables a and b are assigned the values 5 and 5, respectively.
The code then checks if a is greater than b using the if statement. Since a is equal to b, the condition is not met and the code proceeds to the else block.
In the else block, the code prints the value of a, which is 5.
<<<Output>>>
5
