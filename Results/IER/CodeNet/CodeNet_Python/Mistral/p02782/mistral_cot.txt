 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first initializes a modulus value of 10**9+7.
It then initializes a range value of 2000100.
The code then initializes a list fctr with the first element set to 1 and the rest of the elements set to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to the range value, and for each iteration, it calculates the value of fctr[i] by multiplying fctr[i-1] by i and taking the result modulo the modulus value.
The function finv is defined to calculate the inverse of a number in the range [0, mod-1] using the extended Euclidean algorithm.
The function cmb is defined to calculate the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, using the formula n!/(k!(n-k)!).
The code then takes four integers as input, x1, y1, x2, and y2, and uses them to calculate the number of combinations of x2 and y2 taken 1 at a time, x2 and y1 taken 1 at a time, x1 and y2 taken 1 at a time, and x1 and y1 taken 1 at a time.
It then subtracts the sum of the first two combinations from the sum of the last two combinations, and takes the result modulo the modulus value.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is 10.
