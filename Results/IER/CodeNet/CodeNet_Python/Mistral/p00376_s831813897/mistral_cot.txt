 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, a and b, separated by a space.
The code then checks if a is equal to b. If it is, it prints 0.
If a is greater than b, it prints the difference between a and b.
If a is less than b, it prints the difference between b and a.
In this case, a is 20 and b is 30, so the condition a-b==0 is not met.
The condition a>b is also not met.
The condition a<b is met, so the code prints b-a, which is 30-20=10.
<<<Output>>>
10
