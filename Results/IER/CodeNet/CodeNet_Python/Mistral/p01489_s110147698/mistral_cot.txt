The code first imports the sys module, which provides access to some system-specific functions and variables.
The readline function is used to read input from the standard input (sys.stdin), and the write function is used to write output to the standard output (sys.stdout).
The fibonacci function takes two arguments, N and M, and returns the remainder when N is divided by M. It uses a recursive approach to calculate the remainder.
The solve function takes no arguments and reads input from the standard input. It then calculates the remainder when K is divided by M using the fibonacci function. If the remainder is equal to K, it returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates the remainder when K is divided by M using the fibonacci function again, and returns the product of the two remainders.
The solve function then calls the fibonacci function twice with different arguments to calculate the two remainders.
The return value of the solve function is the product of the two remainders.
