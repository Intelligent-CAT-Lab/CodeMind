 <<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes three variables: N, h, and w. N is set to the input value, which is 2. The variables h and w are initialized to 0.
The code then enters two nested loops that iterate from 1 to 3500 (inclusive).
For each pair of i and j in this range, it calculates two values: tmp1 and tmp2. tmp1 is the product of N, i, and j, while tmp2 is the sum of (4 * i * j) - (N * j) - (N * i).
The code then checks if tmp2 is not equal to 0. If it is not, it calculates the remainder (m) and quotient (s) of tmp1 divided by tmp2 using the divmod function.
If m is 0 and s is greater than or equal to 0, it means that the remainder is 0 and the quotient is positive or equal to 0. In this case, it sets the values of n, h, and w to i, j, and s, respectively, and prints them.
The code then exits the loop using the exit() function.
Since the input value is 2, the code will only iterate once in the outer loop, and once in the inner loop. Therefore, the code will only calculate tmp1 and tmp2 once, and will not perform any division or modulo operations.
<<<Output>>>
No output is returned by the code, as it only prints the values of n, h, and w if they meet the condition. Since the input value is 2, no values meet the condition, and therefore no output is printed.
