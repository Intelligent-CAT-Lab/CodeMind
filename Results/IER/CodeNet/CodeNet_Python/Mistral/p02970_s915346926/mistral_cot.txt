 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs, n and d, which are integers.
It checks if n is divisible by 2*d+1. If it is, it means that n is not divisible by d+1, so it cannot be divided by 2*d+1.
If n is not divisible by 2*d+1, it means that n is divisible by d+1, so it can be divided by 2*d+1.
In both cases, the code calculates the quotient of n by 2*d+1 and adds 1 to it.
If n is divisible by 2*d+1, the quotient is n//(2*d+1) +1. If n is not divisible by 2*d+1, the quotient is n//(2*d+1).
The final result is stored in the variable ans.
