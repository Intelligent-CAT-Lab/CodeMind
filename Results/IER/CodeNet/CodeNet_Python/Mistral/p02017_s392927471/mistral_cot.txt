 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four integer inputs, H, W, x, and y, and stores them in variables of the same names.
The code then checks if the product of H and W is odd and if the sum of x and y is odd.
If both conditions are true, the code prints "No". Otherwise, it prints "Yes".
In this case, H = 3, W = 5, x = 1, and y = 4.
The product of H and W is 15, which is odd.
The sum of x and y is 5, which is odd.
Since both conditions are true, the code prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
