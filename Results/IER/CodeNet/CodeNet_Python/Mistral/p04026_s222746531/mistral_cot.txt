 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first reads a string input from the user using the `raw_input()` function and stores it in the variable `s`.
The length of the string is calculated using the `len()` function and stored in the variable `N`.
The variables `A` and `B` are initialized to -1, which will be used to store the indices of the two consecutive characters in the string that have the same value.
The code then enters two loops.
The first loop iterates from 0 to N-2 (inclusive), meaning it will consider all pairs of consecutive characters in the string.
For each pair of consecutive characters, it checks if they have the same value. If they do, it updates the values of `A` and `B` to the indices of the two characters.
The second loop iterates from 1 to N-3 (inclusive), meaning it will consider all pairs of consecutive characters in the string, excluding the first pair.
For each pair of consecutive characters, it checks if they have the same value. If they do, it updates the values of `A` and `B` to the indices of the two characters.
After both loops finish, the code prints the values of `A` and `B`, which are the indices of the two consecutive characters in the string that have the same value.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is not applicable, as it does not return any value. It simply prints the values of `A` and `B` to the console.
In this case, the output would be:
```
-1 -1
```
This means that there are no pairs of consecutive characters in the input string that have the same value.
