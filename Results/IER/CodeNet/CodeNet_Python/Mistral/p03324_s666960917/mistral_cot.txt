 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes two integers as input, a and b, using the `input().split()` method. The input is split by spaces and the resulting list is converted to integers using the `map()` function.
The code then checks if b is equal to 100. If it is, it adds 1 to b.
Finally, the code multiplies b by 100 raised to the power of a and prints the result.
<<<Output>>>
100000
