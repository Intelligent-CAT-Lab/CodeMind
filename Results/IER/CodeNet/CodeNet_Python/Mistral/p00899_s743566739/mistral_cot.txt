 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 3, which means the input will be a list of 3 strings.
The variable ts is initialized to an empty list, which will be used to store the strings that meet the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 2 (inclusive), meaning it will consider the first three strings in the input.
For each string s in this range, it checks if it is not equal to any of the other strings in the input. If it is not, it adds it to the ts list.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of len(ts), which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
