 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes 6 integers as input, which are 2, 2, 0, 0, 1, and 1.
The variables R, C, ay, ax, by, and bx are initialized to 2, 2, 0, 0, 1, and 1, respectively.
The variable MOD is initialized to 10**9+7, which is used as the modulus for the operations.
The variable INF is initialized to 10**9+7, which is used as the maximum value for the distances.
The variable dists is a 2D list of size (R, C), which is used to store the distances between the points.
The variable ptns is a 2D list of size (R, C), which is used to store the number of paths between the points.
The variable q is a deque, which is used to store the points to be processed.
The variable dxs and dys are 2D lists of size (4, 2), which are used to store the directions for the 4 cardinal directions.
The variable ans_d is initialized to None, which will be used to store the answer.
The code enters a while loop that continues until the deque q is empty.
For each point in q, it checks if ans_d is not None and if the current distance is greater than ans_d. If it is, it breaks out of the loop.
If the current point (x, y) is equal to (bx, by), it updates ans_d to the current distance.
If the current distance is greater than the distance stored in dists[y][x], it continues to the next point.
If the current distance is less than the distance stored in dists[y][x], it updates the distance stored in dists[y][x].
For each of the 4 cardinal directions, it updates the distances and the number of paths between the points.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the value of ans_d and the number of paths between the points (bx, by) modulo the modulus.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is (1, 1)
