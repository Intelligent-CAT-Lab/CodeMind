<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input, a, b and c.
It then checks if the difference between b and a is equal to the difference between c and b.
If it is, it prints "YES", otherwise it prints "NO".
In this case, the difference between b and a is 4, and the difference between c and b is also 4.
Therefore, the condition is met and the code prints "YES".
<<<Output>>>
YES
