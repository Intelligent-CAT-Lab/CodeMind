 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, K and S.
It initializes a variable ans to 0, which will be used to count the number of pairs (i, j) that satisfy the condition.
The code then enters a nested loop that iterates from 0 to K+1 (inclusive) for i, and from 0 to K+1 (inclusive) for j.
For each pair (i, j), it calculates the value of k = S - i - j.
The code then checks if k is within the range [0, K], which is [0, 2] in this case. If it is, it increments the value of ans by 1.
After the loops finish, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 3.
