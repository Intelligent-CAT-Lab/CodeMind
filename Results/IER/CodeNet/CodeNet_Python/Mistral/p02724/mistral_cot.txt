 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input from the user, which is 1024.
It then calculates the number of 500's in the input by dividing the total by 500 and taking the floor (// operator). This gives us 2.
The remainder is calculated by subtracting the result of the division by 500 from the total. This gives us 200.
The code then calculates the number of 5's in the input by dividing the remainder by 5 and taking the floor. This gives us 40.
Finally, the code calculates the output by multiplying the number of 500's by 1000 and adding the number of 5's multiplied by 5. This gives us 2000 + 200 = 2200.
<<<Output>>>
2200
