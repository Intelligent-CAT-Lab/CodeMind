 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable S is initialized to '0??', which means there are 3 '0', 3 '1' and 4 '?' in the string.
The function solve(S) is called with this input.
The function first converts the string S to a tuple of integers, where 0 represents '0', 1 represents '1' and 2 represents '?'.
The function then defines a lookup table that maps each digit to its corresponding value.
The function defines a judge function that takes two integers, target\_lo and target\_hi, and returns True if the sum of the digits of the string S is equal to target\_lo or target\_hi, and False otherwise.
The function then initializes best to 10**6*2, which is the maximum possible sum of digits.
The function then uses the bisect function to find the value of target\_lo and target\_hi that satisfy the condition.
The function then returns the minimum of best and the difference between target\_lo and target\_hi.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is 10, which is the minimum possible sum of digits for the string '0??'.
