 <<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a variable `n` with the input value of 54.
The variable `ret` is initialized to 1.
The variable `i` is initialized to 0.
The code enters a while loop that continues as long as `ret` is less than or equal to `n`.
Inside the loop, `ret` is calculated as 2 raised to the power of `i`.
The loop continues until `ret` is greater than 54, which happens when `i` is 5.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the value of `ret//2`, which is 26.
<<<Output>>>
26
