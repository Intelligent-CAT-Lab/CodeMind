 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an input string `s` and calculates its length `n`.
It then initializes a variable `ans` to `n`.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to `n-1` (inclusive), meaning it will consider all characters in the string except the last one.
For each character `i` in this range, it checks if the previous character `i-1` is equal to the current character `i`. If it is, the code skips the current iteration using the `continue` statement.
If the previous character is not equal to the current character, the code updates the value of `ans` to be the minimum of `ans` and the maximum of `i` and `n-i`.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of `ans`.
<<<Output>>>
3

The return value of the code based on the input `010` is 3.
