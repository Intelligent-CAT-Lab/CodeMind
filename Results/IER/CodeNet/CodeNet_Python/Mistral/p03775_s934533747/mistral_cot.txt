 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the math module.
It then prompts the user to enter a number N, which is 10000 in this case.
The code then calculates the square root of N using the math.sqrt() function, which returns 100.
The code then enters a while loop that iterates until i is greater than 0.
Inside the loop, the code checks if N is divisible by i using the modulo operator (%). If N is divisible by i, it calculates the length of the string representation of N divided by i using the floor division operator (//) and the len() function.
The code then prints the length of the string representation of N divided by i.
Since N is not divisible by any number less than or equal to its square root, the loop will not find a divisor and will exit.
