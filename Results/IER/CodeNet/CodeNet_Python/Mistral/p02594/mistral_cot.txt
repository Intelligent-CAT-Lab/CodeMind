<<<Analysis>>>
The code prompts the user to enter a number using the `input()` function and stores it in the variable `X`.
The code then checks if `X` is greater than or equal to 30 using the `>=` operator.
If `X` is greater than or equal to 30, the code prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
