 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module, which is used to access the sys.path variable, which contains a list of directories to search for modules.
The range function is also imported, which is used to generate a sequence of numbers.
The input function is also imported, which is used to read input from the user.
The mod variable is set to 10**9 + 7, which is used as the modulus for the multiplication operation.
The n, h, and d variables are read from the user using the input() function and stored in the variables n, h, and d, respectively.
The big variable is set to 10**6+10, which is used as the upper limit for the factorial calculation.
The fac variable is initialized as a list with only the value 1, and then it enters a while loop that continues until the length of the fac list is greater than or equal to big. In each iteration of the loop, the value of fac is calculated as the product of the previous value of fac and the current length of fac, modulo mod.
The cumfac variable is initialized as a list with only the value 0, and then it enters a for loop that iterates over the values of fac. In each iteration of the loop, the value of cumfac is calculated as the sum of the previous value of cumfac and the current value of fac, modulo mod.
The DP variable is initialized as a list with only the value 0, and then it enters a for loop that iterates over the values of h. In each iteration of the loop, the value of DP is calculated as the product of the previous value of DP and the current value of cumfac, modulo mod.
The special case is when h is equal to n, in which case the value of DP[h] is calculated as the sum of the values of DP[max(0,h-d):h], modulo mod.
Finally, the value of DP[-1] is printed, which is the final answer.
