<<<Analysis>>>
The code first prompts the user to enter a string using the `input()` function. The user enters "ARC".
The code then checks if the entered string is equal to "ARC" using the `==` operator. Since the entered string is "ARC", the code executes the `else` block.
The `else` block prints the string "ARC".
Therefore, the return value of the code is "ARC".
<<<Output>>>
ARC
