 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first defines two functions: `gcd` and `main`.
The `gcd` function takes two arguments, `a` and `b`, and returns `b` if `a` is divisible by `b`, otherwise it calls itself recursively with `b` and `a % b` as arguments.
The `main` function takes four arguments, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`, which are read from the input. It calculates the absolute difference between `b` and `d` (`h`) and the absolute difference between `c` and `a` (`w`). If either `h` or `w` is 0, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it calls the `gcd` function with the maximum of `h` and `w` as the first argument and the minimum of `h` and `w` as the second argument. Finally, it returns the sum of `h`, `w`, and the result of the `gcd` function.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code for the input `1 1 3 4` is 10.
