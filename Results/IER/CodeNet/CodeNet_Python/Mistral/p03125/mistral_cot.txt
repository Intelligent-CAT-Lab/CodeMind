 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, x and y, and stores them in the variables x and y, respectively.
The code then checks if y is divisible by x using the modulo operator (%). If y is divisible by x, the code prints x+y. Otherwise, it prints y-x.
In this case, x is 4 and y is 12. Since 12 is divisible by 4, the code prints 16.
<<<Output>>>
16
