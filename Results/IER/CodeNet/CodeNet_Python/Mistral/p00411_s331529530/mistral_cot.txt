 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user, which is a string of three numbers separated by spaces. The input is then split into a list of three strings using the `split()` method.
The list comprehension `[float(i) for i in input().split()]` is used to convert each string in the list to a float.
The variables `a`, `t`, and `r` are assigned the values of the three floats.
The code then calculates the result by multiplying `t` and `r` and dividing by `a`.
The final result is then printed to the console.
