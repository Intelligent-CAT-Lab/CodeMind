 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string S of length 20, where each character in S is either a digit from 0 to 9 or a question mark (?). The function func takes three arguments: S, index, and cnt. S is the current string being considered, index is the current index of the string being considered, and cnt is the number of times the digit 5 has been used so far.
The function first checks if index is equal to 20. If it is, it means that all characters in the string have been considered, and the function returns 0. If cnt is 0, it means that the digit 5 has not been used yet, so the function returns 0.
If index is not equal to 20, the function recursively calls itself with the next index and the current value of cnt. It also creates a new string S_ by replacing the current character in S with the digit 5. It then calls the function again with the new string S_ and the next index, plus 1.
The function then checks if the digit 5 has been used at least once. If it has, it returns the result of the recursive call multiplied by (-1) ** (cnt + 1). If it has not, it returns the result of the recursive call.
The main program initializes the string S to all question marks, and then calls the function with S, 0, and 0.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is 100.
