 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input as a string, separated by spaces, and converts it to a list using the `map()` function. The list is then assigned to the variable `_input`.
The first element of the list is assigned to the variable `a`, the second element to `b`, and the third element to `x`.
The code then calculates the result by performing the following arithmetic operations:
- `b // x`: division of `b` by `x` (rounded down)
- `(a - 1) // x`: division of `(a - 1)` by `x` (rounded down)
- `b // x - (a - 1)// x`: subtraction of the two results
The final result is then assigned to the variable `result`.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is 1.
