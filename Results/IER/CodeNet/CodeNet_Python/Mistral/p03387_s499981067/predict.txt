The return value of the code for the input `2 5 4` would be 10.
This is because the even list contains 2 and 4, and the odd list contains 5. Since both lists have a length of 2, the code increments the cnt variable by 1 and appends 3 to the ns list. The ns list is then sorted to [2, 3, 4, 5], and the maximum value is 5. The difference between 5 and each number in the ns list is 0, so the code adds 0 to cnt for each number. The final value of cnt is 10.
