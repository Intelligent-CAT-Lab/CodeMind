 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the `Counter` class from the `collections` module.
It then reads a list of integers from the user using the `input()` function and stores it in the variable `A`.
The length of the list is stored in the variable `a`.
The code then converts the list `A` to a set using the `Counter()` function and stores the result in the variable `A`.
The code then initializes a variable `cnt` to 0.
It then iterates over the values in the set `A` using a for loop.
For each value in the set, it checks if it is not equal to 1. If it is not equal to 1, it calculates the sum of the value and its preceding value (i.e. the value minus 1) and divides it by 2. It then adds this sum to the variable `cnt`.
Finally, the code calculates the final result by multiplying the length of the list `a` by its length minus 1, dividing by 2, subtracting the value of `cnt` and adding 1.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is 10.
