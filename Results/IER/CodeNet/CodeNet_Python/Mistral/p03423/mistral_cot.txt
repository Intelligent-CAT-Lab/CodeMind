<<<Analysis>>>
The code prompts the user to enter a number, which is then stored in the variable `input()`.
The variable `input()` is a built-in function in Python that reads a line from the standard input (usually the keyboard).
The code then performs an integer division operation on the input value and the number 3, using the `//` operator.
The `//` operator performs an integer division operation, which means it rounds down the division result to the nearest integer.
The result of the division operation is then printed to the console using the `print()` function.
<<<Output>>>
2

Therefore, the return value of the code based on the input `8` would be 2.
