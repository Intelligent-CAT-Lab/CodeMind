 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes three integers as input, K, A and B. K is 4000, A is 2000 and B is 500.
The code then checks if K is less than or equal to A. Since K is 4000 and A is 2000, this condition is not met.
The code then checks if A is less than or equal to B. Since A is 2000 and B is 500, this condition is not met.
Since neither of the above conditions are met, the code proceeds to the next block of code.
In this block, the code calculates the value of x using the formula (K-B-1)/(A-B)+1. Plugging in the values of K, A and B, we get:
x = (4000-500-1)/(2000-500)+1 = 10
The code then prints 2*x-1, which is 2*10-1 = 19.
<<<Output>>>
19
