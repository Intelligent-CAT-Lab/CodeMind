 <<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function `solve()` that takes two arguments, `n` and `d`.
The function first converts the input string to integers using the `map()` function and the `input().split()` method.
Then it calculates the value of `n//(2*d+1)` and prints it.
The `if __name__ == '__main__':` block calls the `solve()` function.

For the input `6 2`, the function will calculate `6//(2*2+1)` which is equal to `6//5` which is equal to `1.2`.

<<<Output>>>
1.2
