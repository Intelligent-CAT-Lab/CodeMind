 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 3, 3 and 0, respectively.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 3.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if A <= sum_order <= B, which is not true in this case.
Therefore, the variable sum\_1 is not updated.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum\_1, which is 0.
<<<Output>>>
0
