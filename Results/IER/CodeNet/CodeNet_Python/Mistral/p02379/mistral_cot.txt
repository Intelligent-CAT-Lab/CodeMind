 <<<Analysis>>>
The code imports the math module, which provides access to mathematical functions.
The input is a string of four numbers separated by spaces, which are then converted to floats using the map function and lambda function.
The variables x1, y1, x2 and y2 are assigned the values of the input numbers.
The code then calculates the distance between the points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) using the distance formula, which is the square root of the sum of the squares of the differences between the x and y coordinates.
The result is then printed using the format string "{:f}" to display the result with two decimal places.
