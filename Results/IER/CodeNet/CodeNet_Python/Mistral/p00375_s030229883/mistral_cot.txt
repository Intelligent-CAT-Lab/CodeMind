 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first prompts the user to enter a number using the `input()` function and stores it in the variable `f`.
The code then subtracts 30 from the value of `f` using the `-` operator and stores the result in a new variable `f_minus_30`.
The code then divides the value of `f_minus_30` by 2 using the `//` operator and stores the result in a new variable `f_minus_30_divided_by_2`.
Finally, the code prints the value of `f_minus_30_divided_by_2` using the `print()` function.
