 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys and string modules.
It then defines a string variable alpha, which contains the alphabet in lowercase.
The variable tbl is created using the string.maketrans() function, which replaces the first occurrence of each character in alpha[:-1] with the corresponding character in alpha[1:].
The code then enters a loop that reads input from sys.stdin.
For each line of input, it checks if it contains any of the specified keywords ('the', 'this', 'that'). If it does not, it applies the tbl to the input using the translate() method.
The code then prints the input without the last character, which is assumed to be a newline character.
The input 'xlmw mw xli tmgxyvi xlex m xsso mr xli xvmt.' contains all three specified keywords ('the', 'this', 'that'), so it is not processed by the while loop.
<<<Output>>>
xlmw mw xli tmgxyvi xlex m xsso mr xli xvmt.
