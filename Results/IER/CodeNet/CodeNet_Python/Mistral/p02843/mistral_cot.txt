<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input N and stores it in the variable N.
It then uses the divmod function to divide N by 100 and assigns the quotient to the variable q and the remainder to the variable mod.
The code then checks if mod is less than or equal to q multiplied by 5. If it is, it prints 1, otherwise it prints 0.
In this case, N is 615, which is greater than 100, so q is 6 and mod is 15.
Since 15 is less than 6 multiplied by 5 (30), the condition is met and the code prints 1.
