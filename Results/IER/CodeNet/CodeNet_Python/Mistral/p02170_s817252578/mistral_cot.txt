 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable K and variable A are initialized to 1, 1 and 50, respectively.
dp is a list of size K+1, initialized with 0 except for dp[0] which is set to 1.
The code then calculates the values of p\_coin and p\_dice using the given values of A and N.
p\_coin is calculated as A \* 100^(mod-2) modulo mod, where mod is 998244353.
p\_dice is calculated as N^(mod-2) modulo mod.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to K (inclusive), meaning it will consider all possible values of the remaining points.
For each value i in this range, it calculates dp[i] using the formula c \* p\_coin modulo mod.
c is updated as (dp[i] - dp[i-N]) \* p\_dice modulo mod.
After the loop finishes, the code calculates the final value of dp[K] \* p\_coin^(mod-2) modulo mod.
The final value is then printed.
