 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an input string `s` from the user.
It then initializes a dictionary `dic` with three keys: 'a', 'b', and 'c', and three corresponding values: 0, 0, and 0.
The code then iterates over each character in the input string `s` using a for loop.
For each character, it increments the corresponding value in the dictionary by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code extracts the three values from the dictionary using the `values()` method and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`.
Finally, the code checks if the absolute difference between any two of these values is less than or equal to 1 using the `max()` function and the `abs()` function.
If the condition is met, the code prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'.
<<<Output>>>
NO
