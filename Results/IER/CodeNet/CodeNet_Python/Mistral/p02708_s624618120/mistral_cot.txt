 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first defines two functions: `coun` and `sigma`.
The `coun` function takes two arguments, `n` and `r`, and returns the value of `n*r+1+r-r**2`.
The `sigma` function takes three arguments: `func`, `frm`, and `too`, and iterates from `frm` to `too+2`, calling the `func` function for each value in that range and accumulating the results in a variable `result`.
The code then reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, and initializes a variable `mod` to 10**9+7.
Finally, the code calls the `sigma` function with the `coun` function as the first argument, `k` as the second argument, and `n` as the third argument.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code would be 11.
