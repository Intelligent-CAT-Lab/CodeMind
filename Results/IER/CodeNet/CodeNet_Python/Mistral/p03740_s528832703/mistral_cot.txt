 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes two integers as input, X and Y, separated by a space. It then converts the input string to a list of integers using the `map()` function and the `int()` function. The resulting list is stored in the variable `X, Y`.
The code then checks the absolute difference between X and Y using the `abs()` function. If the absolute difference is less than 2, it prints "Brown", otherwise it prints "Alice".
<<<Output>>>
Alice
