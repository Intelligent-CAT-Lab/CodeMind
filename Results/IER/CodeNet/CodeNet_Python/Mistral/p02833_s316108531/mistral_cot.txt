 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input n using the `input()` function and converts it to an integer using the `int()` function.
The code then checks if n is odd by using the modulo operator `%` to check if n is not divisible by 2. If n is odd, the code prints 0 and exits the loop.
If n is even, the code initializes the variables i and cnt to 1 and n1 to n, respectively.
The code then enters a while loop that continues until n1 is 0. In each iteration of the loop, the code calculates n1 by dividing n by 2 and then dividing the result by 2^i, where i is the current iteration number. The result is then added to cnt.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of cnt.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code for input 12 is 10.
