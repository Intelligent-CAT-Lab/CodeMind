The variables N, A and B are initialized to 5, 1 and 3, respectively.
MOD is initialized to 998244353.
The code then checks if B is 0. Since it is not, it proceeds to the next steps.
The code initializes f to 1 and F to an array of size N+1, all elements of which are set to 1.
It then calculates F[i] = f \* i mod MOD for each i from 1 to N+1.
The code initializes FI to an array of size N+1, all elements of which are set to 1.
It then calculates FI[i] = f^(MOD-2) \* i mod MOD for each i from N to 1.
The code initializes z to 0.
It then iterates over all possible values of k from min(A+1, N-B) if N-B-A is not defined, otherwise from A+1.
For each k, it calculates x = (B-k) \* F[B+k-1] \* FI[B] \* FI[k] mod MOD.
It also calculates y = F[N+A-B-2*k-1] \* FI[N-B-k-1] \* FI[A-k] mod MOD.
Finally, it adds x \* y mod MOD to z.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of z, which is 10.
