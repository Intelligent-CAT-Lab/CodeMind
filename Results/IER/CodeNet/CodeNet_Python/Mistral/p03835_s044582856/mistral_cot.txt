 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers k and s as input.
It initializes a variable ans to 0, which will be used to count the number of pairs (x, y) that satisfy the condition.
The code then enters a nested loop that iterates from 0 to k+1 for x and from 0 to k+1 for y.
For each pair (x, y), it calculates the value of z = s - x - y.
The code then checks if 0 <= z <= k. If it is, it increments the value of ans by 1.
After the loops finish, the code prints the final value of ans, which is the number of pairs that satisfy the condition.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code for input `2 2` is 1.
There is only one pair (x, y) that satisfies the condition: (1, 1), where z = 2 - 1 - 1 = 0, which is less than or equal to 2.
Therefore, the return value of the code is 1.
