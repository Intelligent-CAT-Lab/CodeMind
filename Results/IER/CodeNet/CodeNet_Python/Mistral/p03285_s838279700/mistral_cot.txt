 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input n, which is 11 in this case.
It initializes a variable cnt to 0, which will be used to count the number of solutions.
The code then enters a nested loop that iterates from 0 to n-1 (inclusive) for k, and from 0 to n-1 (inclusive) for j.
For each pair (k,j), it checks if 4*k+7*j equals n, which is 11 in this case. If it does, it increments cnt by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if n is less than 4 or if cnt is equal to 0. In this case, n is 11 and cnt is 1, so the condition is not met.
The code then prints "No" as the return value.
<<<Output>>>
No
