 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes two integers as input, a and b, separated by a space. The input is split using the `split()` method and the resulting list is converted to a list of integers using a list comprehension. The resulting list is stored in the variable `a` and `b`.
The code then calculates the sum of the two numbers in the list `b` and stores it in the variable `c`.
The code then checks if the difference between `a` and `c` is not zero and if it is greater than or equal to zero. If both conditions are met, it prints the difference between `a` and `c`. Otherwise, it prints 0.
The condition is met when a is 12 and b is 4, so the difference between a and c is 8.
<<<Output>>>
8
