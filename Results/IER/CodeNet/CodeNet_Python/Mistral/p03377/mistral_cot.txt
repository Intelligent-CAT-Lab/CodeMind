<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input, a, b and x.
It uses the `map()` function to convert the input string into integers.
The code then checks if a is less than or equal to x and if a plus b is greater than or equal to x.
If both conditions are true, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'.
<<<Output>>>
NO
