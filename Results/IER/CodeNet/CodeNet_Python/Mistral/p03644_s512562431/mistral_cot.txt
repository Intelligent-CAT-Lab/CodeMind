 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an input from the user, which is stored in the variable N.
The input is then converted from string to integer using the int() function.
The variable n is initialized to 0 and a while loop is started that continues until 2**n is less than or equal to N.
Inside the loop, n is incremented by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the value of 2**(n-1), which is 31.
<<<Output>>>
31
