 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four integer inputs, sx, sy, tx, and ty, and uses them to calculate the width and height of a rectangle.
The width is calculated as tx - sx, and the height is calculated as ty - sy.
The code then creates an empty string ans, which will be used to store the final output.
The code enters a loop that iterates h times, and for each iteration, it appends the letter "U" to ans.
Then, it enters another loop that iterates w times, and for each iteration, it appends the letter "R" to ans.
After that, it enters another loop that iterates h times, and for each iteration, it appends the letter "D" to ans.
Then, it enters another loop that iterates w times, and for each iteration, it appends the letter "L" to ans.
After that, it appends the letter "L" to ans.
Then, it enters another loop that iterates h+1 times, and for each iteration, it appends the letter "U" to ans.
Then, it enters another loop that iterates w+1 times, and for each iteration, it appends the letter "R" to ans.
Then, it appends the letter "D" to ans.
Then, it appends the letter "R" to ans.
Then, it enters another loop that iterates h+1 times, and for each iteration, it appends the letter "D" to ans.
Then, it enters another loop that iterates w+1 times, and for each iteration, it appends the letter "L" to ans.
Then, it appends the letter "U" to ans.
Finally, the code prints the final value of ans.
