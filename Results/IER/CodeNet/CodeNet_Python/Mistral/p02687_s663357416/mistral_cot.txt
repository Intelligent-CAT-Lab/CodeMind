 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the math module.
Then it defines four functions: readInt(), readInts(), readChar() and readChars().
The readInt() function reads a single integer from the user and returns it as an integer.
The readInts() function reads multiple integers from the user and returns them as a list of integers.
The readChar() function reads a single character from the user and returns it as a string.
The readChars() function reads multiple characters from the user and returns them as a list of strings.
The code then reads a single character from the user using the readChar() function and stores it in the variable s.
The code then checks if s is equal to "ABC". If it is, it prints "ARC", otherwise it prints "ABC".
<<<Output>>>
ABC
