The return value of the code based on the input `2 3 1 3 1 0` would be 10.
This is because the sum of digits of the number 2 is 2, the sum of digits of the number 3 is 3, the sum of digits of the number 1 is 1, the sum of digits of the number 3 is 3, the sum of digits of the number 1 is 1, and the sum of digits of the number 0 is 0.
The sum of digits of the number 2 is 2, the sum of digits of the number 3 is 3, the sum of digits of the number 1 is 1, the sum of digits of the number 3 is 3, the sum of digits of the number 1 is 1, and the sum of digits of the number 0 is 0.
Therefore, the minimum sum of digits of all pairs of numbers (i, j) in the range [0, 2] x [0, 3] is 10.
