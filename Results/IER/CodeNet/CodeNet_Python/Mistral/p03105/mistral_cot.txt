 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input, a, b and c, and stores them in the variables a, b and c, respectively.
The code then checks if the product of a and c is less than b. If it is, it prints c. Otherwise, it prints the quotient of b divided by a.
In this case, a = 2, b = 11 and c = 4.
a*c = 2*4 = 8
8 < 11
Therefore, the code will print c, which is 4.
<<<Output>>>
4
