The code imports the sys module, which provides access to some system-specific information and functions.
The sys.stdin.readline() function reads a line from standard input (which is the keyboard in this case) and returns it as a string.
The string is then split using the split() method, which splits the string into a list of words based on a specified delimiter (in this case, a space).
The two words are then converted to integers using the map() function and assigned to the variables a and b.
Finally, the code prints the sum of a and b using the + operator.
