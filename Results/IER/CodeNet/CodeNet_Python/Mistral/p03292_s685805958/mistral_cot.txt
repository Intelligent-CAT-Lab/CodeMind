 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the numpy library.
It then reads the input as a list of integers, which is `[1, 6, 3]`.
The input is then converted to a numpy array using the `np.array()` function.
The sorted() function is then used to sort the array in ascending order.
The resulting array is `[1, 3, 6]`.
The code then calculates the difference between the second element of the array and the first element of the array, which is `[6-3, 3-1] = [3, 2]`.
Finally, the sum of this array is calculated using the `sum()` function, which returns `5`.
<<<Output>>>
