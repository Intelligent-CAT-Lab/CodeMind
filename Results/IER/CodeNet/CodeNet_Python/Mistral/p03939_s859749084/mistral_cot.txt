 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `solve` takes three arguments: `n`, `d`, and `x`.
The function uses a while loop to iterate until `n` becomes 0.
Inside the loop, it calculates the value of `ans` by adding `d + (2 * n - 1) * x / 2` to it.
Then it updates the values of `d` and `x` using the following formulas:
```
d = ((n + 1) * d + 5 * x / 2) / n
x *= (n + 2) / n
```
Finally, it decrements `n` by 1.
The function returns the value of `ans`.

Given the input `1 3 3`, the function first converts it to a list of floats using the `map` function and the `float` function.
Then it calls the `solve` function with the list of floats as arguments.
The return value of the function is then printed using the `print` function.
