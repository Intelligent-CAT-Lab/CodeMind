 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input n and initializes a variable ans to 0.
It then initializes a variable tmp to 1.
The code enters a while loop that continues as long as n is greater than tmp.
Inside the loop, tmp is multiplied by 3 and ans is incremented by 1.
The loop continues until n is greater than tmp, which means that n is greater than 3.
When the loop finishes, the code prints the value of ans, which is 4.
<<<Output>>>
4
