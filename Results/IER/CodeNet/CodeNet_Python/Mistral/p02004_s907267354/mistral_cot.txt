 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string from standard input using the `readline()` function and stores it in the variable `S`.
The variable `ans` is initialized to 0, which will be used to store the final answer.
The variable `d` is initialized to 0, which will be used to keep track of the current direction.
The variable `cur` is initialized to 0, which will be used to keep track of the current position.
The code then enters a loop that iterates through each character in the string `S`.
For each character `c`, the code checks if it is equal to "R". If it is, it increments the current position `cur` by 1 and changes the direction `d` to (d+1)%4. If `d` is 0 and `cur` is 4, it increments the answer `ans` by 1 and resets the current position `cur` to 0.
If the character `c` is not equal to "R", it decrements the direction `d` by 1. If `d` is 0, it resets the current position `cur` to 0.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of `ans`, which is 2.
