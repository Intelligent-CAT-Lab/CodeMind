 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an input string `s` using the `input()` function.
It then uses the `count()` method to count the number of occurrences of the characters 'a', 'b', and 'c' in the input string `s`.
The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the values returned by the `count()` method.
The code then checks if the absolute difference between `a` and `b`, the absolute difference between `b` and `c`, and the absolute difference between `c` and `a` are all less than or equal to 1.
If all three conditions are met, the code prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'.
For the input string 'abac', the variable `a` is assigned the value 2, `b` is assigned the value 2, and `c` is assigned the value 1.
The absolute difference between `a` and `b` is 0, the absolute difference between `b` and `c` is 1, and the absolute difference between `c` and `a` is 1.
Since only one of the conditions is met, the code prints 'NO'.
<<<Output>>>
NO
