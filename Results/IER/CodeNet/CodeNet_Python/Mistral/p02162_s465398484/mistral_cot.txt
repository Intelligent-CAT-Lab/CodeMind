 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes four integers as input, T1, T2, R1, and R2.
It then checks if -1 is present in either R1 or R2. If it is, it means that the game is not yet over, and the code proceeds to check if T1 is less than T2. If it is, it means that Alice has won, and the code prints "Alice". If T1 is greater than T2, it means that Bob has won, and the code prints "Bob". If neither of these conditions is met, it means that the game is a draw, and the code prints "Draw".
