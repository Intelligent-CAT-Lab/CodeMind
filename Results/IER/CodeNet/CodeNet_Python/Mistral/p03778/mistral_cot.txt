 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input, w, a and b.
It then checks if the absolute difference between a and b is less than w. If it is, it prints 0. Otherwise, it prints the absolute difference between a and b minus w.
In this case, w is 3, a is 2 and b is 6.
The absolute difference between a and b is 4.
Since 4 is greater than 3, the code prints 4 - 3 = 1.
