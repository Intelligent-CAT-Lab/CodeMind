 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, a and b, and performs arithmetic operations on them.
The variable d is calculated by dividing a by b using integer division (// operator). The remainder of the division is stored in the variable r.
The variable f is calculated by dividing a by b using floating-point division (/ operator). The result is rounded to 5 decimal places using the format string f'{d} {r} {f:.5f}'.
The output is then printed to the console.
<<<Output>>>
1 0 1.00000

The return value of the code is the output that is printed to the console, which is "1 0 1.00000".
