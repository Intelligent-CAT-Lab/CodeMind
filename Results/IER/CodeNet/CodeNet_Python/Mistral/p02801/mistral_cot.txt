 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first prompts the user to input a character using the `input()` function and stores it in the variable `C`.
It then creates an empty list `al` and iterates over the range of ASCII values from 97 to 122 (inclusive) using a for loop. For each ASCII value in this range, it converts it to a character using the `chr()` function and appends it to the list `al`.
After the loop finishes, the code uses the `index()` method of the list `al` to find the index of the character `C` in the list.
Finally, the code prints the character at the index `idx+1` in the list `al`, which is the character immediately following the character `C` in the ASCII table.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is the character immediately following the character `C` in the ASCII table. If `C` is 'a', the return value will be 'b'. If `C` is 'z', the return value will be 'a'.
