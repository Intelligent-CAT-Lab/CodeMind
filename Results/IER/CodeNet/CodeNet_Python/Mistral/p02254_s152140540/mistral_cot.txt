The variable S is initialized to "abca".
The variable huffman is initialized to HuffmanCoding("abca").
The function get\_encode\_size() is called on huffman, which returns the total length of the encoded string.
The function gen\_encode\_bin() is called on huffman, which returns the encoded string.
The encoded string is then printed.
