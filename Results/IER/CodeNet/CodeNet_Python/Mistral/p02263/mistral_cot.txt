 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string input, which is split into a list of characters using the `split()` method. The list is stored in the variable `n`.
The variable `s` is an empty list that will be used to store the result of the operations.
The code then enters a loop that iterates through each character in the list `n`.
For each character, it checks if it is an operator (+, -, \*, /) or a number.
If it is a number, it is added to the list `s` as is.
If it is an operator, it performs the corresponding operation on the last two elements of the list `s`. The first element is popped from the list, and the second element is popped from the list. The operation is then performed on these two elements, and the result is appended to the list `s`.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the last element of the list `s`, which is the final result.
For the input `1 2 +`, the code first splits the input into the list `['1', '2', '+']`.
The loop then iterates through each character in the list.
When it reaches the second character, it recognizes it as an operator (+) and performs the addition of the last two elements of the list (which are 1 and 2). The result is 3, which is appended to the list `s`.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the last element of the list `s`, which is 3.
