 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input as a string, which is split into a list of integers using the `split()` method. The list comprehension `[i for i in map(int, input().split()) if i % 2 == 1]` is used to filter out the odd numbers from the list. The length of this filtered list is then checked using the `len()` function. If the length is greater than or equal to 2, the string 'Hom' is printed, otherwise the string 'Tem' is printed.
<<<Output>>>
Tem
