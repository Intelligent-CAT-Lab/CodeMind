 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the math module, which provides access to mathematical functions and constants.
Then it takes two integers as input, a and b, using the map() function to convert the input string into integers.
The code then uses the gcd() function from the math module to find the greatest common divisor of a and b.
Finally, the code adds a and b, subtracts the gcd, and adds 1 to the result.
