 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an input string S using the `input()` function and converts it to a string using the `str()` function.
The variable a is initialized to 99999.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from the second to the last character of the string S.
For each character, it calculates the sum of the three consecutive characters and compares it to the value of a.
If the sum is less than a, it updates the value of a to be the new minimum between the sum and a.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of a.
<<<Output>>>
9

The return value of the code is 9.
