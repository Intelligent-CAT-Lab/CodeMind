 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first calls the function `getNM()` to get the values of N and K. In this case, N is 5 and K is 2.
The code then initializes a variable `sum` to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of the two possible solutions.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 5.
For each number b in this range, it calculates the two possible solutions using the formula `opt1 = (N // b) * max(0, (b - K))` and `opt2 = max(0, (N % b) - K + 1)`.
If K is 0, then `opt2` is simply `N % b`.
The code then adds the sum of the two solutions to the variable `sum`.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of `sum`, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
