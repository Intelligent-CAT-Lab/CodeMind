<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an input from the user using the `input()` function and stores it in a variable.
Then it subtracts the integer value of the input from 48 and stores the result in a variable.
The `int()` function is used to convert the input string to an integer.
The final value of the variable is then printed using the `print()` function.
<<<Output>>>
