 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes three integers N, M, and K as input. In this case, N = 2, M = 2, and K = 2.
The code then enters a nested loop that iterates from 1 to N+1 and from 1 to M+1.
For each combination of x and y, it calculates the value of res using the formula x * M + y * N - x * y * 2.
If res is equal to K, the code prints "Yes" and exits the loop.
Since N = M = K = 2, the only combination of x and y that satisfies the condition is x = 1 and y = 1, which results in res = 2.
Since res is not equal to K, the code continues to iterate through the loop and eventually prints "No" when it has checked all possible combinations of x and y.
<<<Output>>>
No
