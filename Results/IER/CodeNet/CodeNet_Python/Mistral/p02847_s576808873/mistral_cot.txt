 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input `i` and checks if it is equal to one of the days of the week: "SUN", "MON", "TUE", "WED", "THU", "FRI" or "SAT".
If `i` is equal to "SUN", the code prints "7".
If `i` is equal to "MON", the code prints "6".
If `i` is equal to "TUE", the code prints "5".
If `i` is equal to "WED", the code prints "4".
If `i` is equal to "THU", the code prints "3".
If `i` is equal to "FRI", the code prints "2".
If `i` is not equal to any of the above days, the code prints "1".
