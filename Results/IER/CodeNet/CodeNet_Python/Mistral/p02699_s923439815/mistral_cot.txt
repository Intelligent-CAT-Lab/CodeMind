The code first imports the necessary modules: sys, os, collections, math, and fractions.
It also sets the recursion limit to 10^6.
The write function is assigned to sys.stdout.write, and the dbg function is defined as a lambda function that prints its arguments if the environment variable TERM_PROGRAM is present.
The main function takes an optional argument given, which defaults to sys.stdin.readline.
The input function is defined as a lambda function that reads a line from the given input and removes any trailing whitespace.
The LMIIS function is defined as a lambda function that takes a line of input, splits it by spaces, and maps each integer to an integer using the map function.
The II function is defined as a lambda function that takes a line of input and converts it to an integer.
The MOD constant is defined as 10^9+7.
The code then reads the first two integers S and W from the input, and checks if S is less than or equal to W. If it is, it prints 'unsafe'. Otherwise, it prints 'safe'.
