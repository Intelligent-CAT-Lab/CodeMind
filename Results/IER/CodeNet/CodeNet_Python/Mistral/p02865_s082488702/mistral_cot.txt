<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input from the user using the `input()` function and stores it in the variable `n`.
The code then checks if `n` is even by using the modulo operator `%` and checking if the remainder is 0. If it is, the code prints `n//2-1`. Otherwise, it prints `n//2`.
In this case, `n` is 4, which is an even number, so the code prints `4//2-1`, which is 1.
