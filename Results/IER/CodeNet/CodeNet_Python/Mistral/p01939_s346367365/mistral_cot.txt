 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an input string `s` and splits it into two parts `n` and `m` using the `split()` method.
The `n` and `m` are then converted to integers using the `int()` function.
The code then checks if `n` is equal to 1. If it is, it calculates the answer using the formula `(m+1)%1000000007` and prints it.
If `n` is not equal to 1, it calculates the value of `d` by dividing `m` by `n-1`.
It then calculates the values of `A` and `B` using the formulas `m - d * (n-1) + 1` and `m - (n-1) + 1`, respectively.
The answer is then calculated using the formula `(A+B)*d + (m+1)` and the result is stored in the variable `ans`.
The answer is then calculated using the modulo operator `%` with the value 1000000007.
Finally, the answer is printed.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code for the input `3 9` is 10.
