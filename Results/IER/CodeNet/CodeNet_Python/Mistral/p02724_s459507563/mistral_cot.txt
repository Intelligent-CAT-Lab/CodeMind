 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input from the user using the `input()` function and stores it in the variable `X`.
The code then performs two arithmetic operations on `X`.
The first operation is `X // 500 * 1000`, which divides `X` by 500 and then multiplies the result by 1000. This effectively shifts the bits of `X` to the left by 3 positions.
The second operation is `X % 500 // 5 * 5`, which takes the remainder of `X` divided by 500, then divides that remainder by 5 and finally multiplies the result by 5. This effectively shifts the bits of `X` to the right by 2 positions.
Finally, the two results are added together.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is 1029.
