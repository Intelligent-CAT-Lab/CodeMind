 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input from the user using the `input()` function and stores it in the variable `n`.
Then it uses an `if-elif-else` statement to check the value of `n`.
If `n` is less than 1200, the code prints "ABC".
If `n` is less than 2800 but greater than or equal to 1200, the code prints "ARC".
If `n` is greater than or equal to 2800, the code prints "AGC".
In this case, since `n` is 1199, which is less than 1200, the code will print "ABC".
<<<Output>>>
ABC
