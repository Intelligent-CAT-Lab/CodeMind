 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input, X, Y and Z, and assigns them to the variables X, Y and Z, respectively.
The variable isu is calculated by subtracting Z from X.
The variable hito is calculated by adding Y and Z.
The code then calculates the quotient of isu divided by hito and stores it in the variable isu // hito.
The quotient is calculated by performing integer division, which means that any decimal part is truncated.
The final value of isu // hito is 1.
