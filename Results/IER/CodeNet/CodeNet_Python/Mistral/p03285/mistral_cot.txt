 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input N from the user.
It then enters a nested loop that iterates from 0 to 24 (inclusive) for i and from 0 to 19 (inclusive) for j.
For each combination of i and j, it checks if 4*i + 7*j equals N. If it does, it prints "Yes" and exits the loop using the "exit()" function.
If no combination of i and j satisfies the condition, it prints "No" after the loop finishes.
<<<Output>>>
No
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
The return value of the code is "No".
