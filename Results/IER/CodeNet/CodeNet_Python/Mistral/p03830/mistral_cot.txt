 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports several modules such as math, string, itertools, fractions, heapq, collections, re, array, bisect, sys, random, and time.
It sets the recursion limit to 10^7 and defines some constants such as inf, mod, and sys.
The code defines several helper functions such as LI(), II(), LS(), and S().
The factorization function takes an integer n and returns a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a prime factor of n and its multiplicity.
The main function takes an integer n and uses a defaultdict to count the occurrences of each prime factor in n. It then calculates the product of all prime factors and their multiplicities, and returns the result modulo mod.
The code then calls the main function with n = 3 and prints the result.
