The return value of the code is the output of the recursive function, which is a list of all possible combinations of digits that sum up to W.
For the input 25, the output would be:
```
+
```
This is because the only combination of digits that sum up to 25 is 2+5=7, and the function only prints the combinations of digits that sum up to W.
