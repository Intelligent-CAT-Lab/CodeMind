 <<<Analysis>>>
The code is a recursive function that generates all possible combinations of digits from 0 to 9, and checks if the sum of the digits is equal to the input number W.
The function takes two arguments: digit and tmp\_sum.
The digit argument represents the current digit being considered, starting from 0.
The tmp\_sum argument represents the current sum of digits being considered, starting from 0.
The function uses recursion to generate all possible combinations of digits.
If digit is -1, it means that all possible combinations have been generated and the function checks if the sum of the digits is equal to W.
If digit is not -1, it means that the current digit is being considered and the function generates all possible combinations of digits by recursively calling itself with digit-1 and tmp\_sum.
The function also keeps track of the current combination of digits being considered in the work array.
The function returns nothing, it only prints the combinations of digits that sum up to W.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is the output of the recursive function, which is a list of all possible combinations of digits that sum up to W.
For the input 25, the output would be:
```
+
```
This is because the only combination of digits that sum up to 25 is 2+5=7, and the function only prints the combinations of digits that sum up to W.
