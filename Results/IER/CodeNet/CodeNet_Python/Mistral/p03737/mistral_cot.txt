<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user, which is then converted to uppercase using the `upper()` method.
The input is then split into three parts using the `split()` method, which splits the string at every occurrence of a space character.
The first character of each of the three parts is then extracted using indexing and stored in the variables s1, s2 and s3.
Finally, the code prints the sum of the first characters of s1, s2 and s3, which is 101.
<<<Output>>>
101
