<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes two integers as input, a and b, using the `input().split()` method. The input is split by spaces, so the two integers are separated by a space.
The `map()` function is then used to convert the input integers to integers.
The code then calculates two expressions: `a*b` and `(a+b)*2`.
The first expression multiplies the two input integers, resulting in 15.
The second expression adds the two input integers and then multiplies the result by 2, resulting in 30.
The code then prints both expressions and their results.
<<<Output>>>
15 30
