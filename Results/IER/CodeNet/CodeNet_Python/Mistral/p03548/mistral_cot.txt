 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input, X, Y, and Z. In this case, X is 13, Y is 3, and Z is 1.
The variable width is calculated as Y + 2 \* Z, which is 3 + 2 \* 1 = 5.
The while loop runs as long as width is less than or equal to X. In this case, width is 5, which is less than 13.
The loop increments width by Y + Z in each iteration, which is 3 + 1 = 4 in the first iteration and 3 + 1 = 4 in the second iteration.
After the loop finishes, the variable answer is printed, which is 2.
