 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes six integers as input, c1, c5, c10, c50, c100, c500, and stores them in variables with the same names.
The variable sum is then calculated by adding c1, 5*c5, 10*c10, 50*c50, 100*c100 and 500*c500.
The code then checks if the sum is greater than or equal to 1000. Since the sum of the input numbers is 3 + 1 + 4 + 0 + 4 + 1 = 13, which is less than 1000, the code prints 0.
<<<Output>>>
0
