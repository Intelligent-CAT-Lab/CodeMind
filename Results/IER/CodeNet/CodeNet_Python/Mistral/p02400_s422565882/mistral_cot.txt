 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the math module.
It then prompts the user to enter a value for r using the raw\_input() function and stores it in the variable r.
The variable menseki is calculated by raising r to the power of 2 and multiplying the result by pi.
The variable shuu is calculated by multiplying r by 2 and multiplying the result by pi.
The code then uses the format() method to print the values of menseki and shuu with 6 decimal places.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is not applicable as it does not return a value. Instead, it prints the values of menseki and shuu to the console.

For the input value of 2, the values of menseki and shuu would be:
menseki = 2.0 ** 2 * 3.14159265358979323846 = 12.566370614359172
shuu = 2.0 * 2.0 * 3.14159265358979323846 = 25.123185307179586

Therefore, the output of the code would be:
{:.6f} {:.6f}
12.566371 25.123185
