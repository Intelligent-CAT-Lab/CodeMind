 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three inputs separated by spaces, which are a, op and b.
The variable a is assigned the value of the first input, which is 1.
The variable b is assigned the value of the third input, which is 2.
The variable op is assigned the value of the second input, which is '+'.
The code then checks the value of op, which is '+'. If op is '+', it prints the sum of a and b, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>
