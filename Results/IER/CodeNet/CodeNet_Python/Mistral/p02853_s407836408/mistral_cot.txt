 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first initializes a list `sknList` with three elements: 300000, 200000, and 100000.
Then it prompts the user to enter two integers `x` and `y`, which are then converted to integers using the `map()` function.
The code then initializes a variable `prize` to 0, which will be used to accumulate the prize.
The code checks if `x` is equal to 1 and `y` is also equal to 1. If this condition is met, it adds 400000 to the `prize`.
If `x` is less than or equal to 3, it adds the corresponding element from the `sknList` to the `prize`.
If `y` is less than or equal to 3, it adds the corresponding element from the `sknList` to the `prize`.
Finally, the code prints the value of `prize`.
<<<Output>>>
400000
