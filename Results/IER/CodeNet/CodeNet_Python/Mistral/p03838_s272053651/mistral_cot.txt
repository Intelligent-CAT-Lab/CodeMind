 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes two integers as input, x and y, using the `input().split()` method.
It then checks if x and y have opposite signs, if so it assigns k=2, otherwise k=1.
It then checks if x and y are equal, if so it prints 0, otherwise it proceeds to the next condition.
If x is 0 and y is negative, it prints the absolute value of y plus 1.
If x is less than y, it checks the value of k and the relationship between x and y.
If k is 2 and x is 0, it prints y-x.
If y is 0, it prints the absolute value of x.
If y is not 0, it prints the absolute value of the difference between y and x plus k.
If x is greater than y, it checks the value of k and the relationship between x and y.
If y is 0 and x is negative, it prints the absolute value of x.
If y is not 0, it prints the absolute value of the difference between y and x plus k.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code for the input `10 20` is 21.
