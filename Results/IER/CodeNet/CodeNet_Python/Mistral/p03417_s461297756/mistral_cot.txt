 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers n and m as input.
The first if statement checks if both n and m are greater than or equal to 2. If this condition is true, it prints the product of n-2 and m-2.
The second if statement checks if n is equal to 1 and m is greater than 1. If this condition is true, it prints m-2.
The third if statement checks if m is equal to 1 and n is greater than 1. If this condition is true, it prints n-2.
The final else statement prints 1 if none of the previous conditions are met.
For the input `2 2`, both n and m are equal to 2, so the first if statement is not met. The second and third if statements are also not met. Therefore, the final else statement is executed and the code prints 1.
