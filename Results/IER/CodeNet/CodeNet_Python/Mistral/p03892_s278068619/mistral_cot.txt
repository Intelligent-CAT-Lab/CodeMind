 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the fractions module.
Then it reads four integers from the user, a, b, c and d, and stores them in the variables a, b, c and d, respectively.
The code then calculates the absolute difference between c and a, and stores it in the variable c.
It also calculates the absolute difference between d and b, and stores it in the variable d.
The code then calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the two largest numbers (max(c,d) and min(c,d)) using the fractions.gcd() function.
The code then calculates the quotients j and k by dividing c and d by gcd, respectively.
Finally, the code multiplies j and k, subtracts 1 from the result and multiplies by gcd to get the final output.
