 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input n using the `input()` function.
It then checks if n is divisible by 1000 using the modulo operator `%`. If n is divisible by 1000, it sets the variable `ans` to 0. Otherwise, it sets `ans` to 1000 - n%1000.
The code then prints the value of `ans`.
<<<Output>>>
0

The return value of the code is 0 because 1900 is divisible by 1000.
