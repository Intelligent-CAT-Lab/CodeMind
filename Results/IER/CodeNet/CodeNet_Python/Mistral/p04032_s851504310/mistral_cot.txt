 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an input string `s` from the user.
It then defines a function `solve(s)` that takes the input string `s` as an argument.
The function first calculates the length of the string `n` using the `len()` function.
It then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to `n-1` (inclusive).
For each index `i` in this range, it checks if the current character `s[i]` is equal to the previous character `s[i-1]`. If it is, it prints the index `i` and the next index `i+1`, and then returns from the function.
If no such pair of equal characters is found, the function enters another loop that iterates from 2 to `n-1` (inclusive).
For each index `i` in this range, it checks if the current character `s[i]` is equal to the previous two characters `s[i-2]`. If it is, it prints the index `i-1` and the next index `i+1`, and then returns from the function.
If no such pair of equal characters is found, the function prints `-1,-1` and then returns from the function.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is `-1,-1`, which is printed when no pair of equal characters is found in the input string.
