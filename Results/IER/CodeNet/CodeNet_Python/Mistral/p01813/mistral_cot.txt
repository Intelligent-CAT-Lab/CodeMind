 <<<Analysis>>>
The input is a string `1-(2+3-4+5)` which is a mathematical expression. The expression is evaluated using the `eval()` function in Python.
The `eval()` function is used to evaluate a string as an expression and return the result.
The expression is evaluated in the order of operations, which means that the parentheses are evaluated first, followed by the exponents, then multiplication and division, and finally addition and subtraction.
In this case, the expression `1-(2+3-4+5)` is evaluated as follows:
1. The expression inside the parentheses `(2+3-4+5)` is evaluated first.
2. The expression `2+3-4+5` is evaluated as follows:
* `2+3` is evaluated to 5
* `-4+5` is evaluated to 1
* `1+5` is evaluated to 6
3. The expression `1-(6)` is evaluated as follows:
* `1-6` is evaluated to -5
Therefore, the return value of the expression `1-(2+3-4+5)` is -5.
