The variable N, variable X, variable Y, and variable Z are initialized to 3, 5, 7, and 5, respectively.
The variable MOD is initialized to 10**9 + 7, which will be used to handle integer overflow.
The code then calculates the maximum value of L, which is 10, since the maximum possible sum of X, Y, and Z is 20.
The code initializes a 2D array dp of size 1 << L+1 x 1 << (L+1-i), where i ranges from 1 to 10.
The code then iterates through each number n from 1 to N (inclusive), and for each n, it updates the dp array.
For each n, the code first stores the previous dp array in the variable prev.
Then, it initializes a new dp array of size 1 << L+1 x 1 << (L+1-i), where i ranges from 1 to 10.
The code then iterates through each i from 1 to 10, and for each i, it updates the dp array using the formula:
dp[1::1<<i] += prev.reshape(1<<i, 1<<(L+1-i)).sum(axis = 0)
This formula calculates the sum of dp values in the range [1, 1<<i] by adding the sum of dp values in the range [1, 1<<(L+1-i)] multiplied by 2^i.
The code then sets the dp values in the bad range to 0.
Finally, the code calculates the answer by subtracting the sum of dp values from 10**N modulo MOD.
The condition is met when i is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of answer, which is 10.
