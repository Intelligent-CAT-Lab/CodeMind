 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input n from the user.
It then enters a nested loop that iterates from 1 to 3500 (inclusive).
For each iteration of the outer loop, it iterates from the current value of i to 3500 (inclusive).
For each iteration of the inner loop, it checks if the condition (4*i*j-n*(i+j))>0 and n*i*j%(4*i*j-n*(i+j))==0 is met.
If it is, it calculates the value of k using the formula k=n*i*j//(4*i*j-n*(i+j)) and breaks out of the inner loop.
If the condition is not met, it continues to the next iteration of the inner loop.
After the inner loop finishes, it checks if the value of k is greater than 0. If it is, it prints the values of i, j and k.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is not applicable as it does not return a value. Instead, it prints the values of i, j and k if the condition is met.
For the input n=2, the condition (4*i*j-n*(i+j))>0 and n*i*j%(4*i*j-n*(i+j))==0 is met when i=2 and j=1.
Therefore, the code prints the values of i, j and k as 2, 1 and 1, respectively.
