The return value of the code is not applicable as it does not return a value. Instead, it prints the values of i, j and k if the condition is met.
For the input n=2, the condition (4*i*j-n*(i+j))>0 and n*i*j%(4*i*j-n*(i+j))==0 is met when i=2 and j=1.
Therefore, the code prints the values of i, j and k as 2, 1 and 1, respectively.
