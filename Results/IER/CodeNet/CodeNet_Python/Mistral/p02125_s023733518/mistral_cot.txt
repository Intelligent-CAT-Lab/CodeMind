 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input from the user using the `input()` function and stores it in the variable `n`.
It then initializes a counter variable `cnt` to 0.
The code enters an infinite loop using a `while 1:` statement.
Inside the loop, it repeatedly divides `n` by 2 and increments the counter `cnt` by 1.
The loop continues until `n` becomes 1, at which point the loop breaks using a `break` statement.
Finally, the code prints the value of `cnt`, which is the number of times `n` was divided by 2 before it became 1.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is 3, as `n` is divided by 2 three times before it becomes 1.
