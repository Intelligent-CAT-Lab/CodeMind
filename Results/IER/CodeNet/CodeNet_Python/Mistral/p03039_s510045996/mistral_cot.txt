 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable M, and variable K are initialized to 2, 2, and 2, respectively.
The function e\_cell\_distance is called with these values.
The function first initializes a class called Combination, which is used to calculate the number of combinations of K elements from a set of N elements.
The class has three attributes: mod, factorial, and inverse.
The mod attribute is set to 10**9 + 7, which is used as the modulus for the arithmetic operations.
The factorial attribute is a list that stores the factorial of each number from 1 to N.
The inverse attribute is a list that stores the inverse of each number from 1 to N.
The class has a method called combination, which is used to calculate the number of combinations of K elements from a set of N elements.
The function then calculates the number of combinations of K elements from a set of N elements using the combination method of the Combination class.
It then calculates two terms t1 and t2, which are used to calculate the total number of ways to place K elements in an N x M grid.
The function then returns the product of the combination and the total number of ways to place K elements in an N x M grid.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the function is 12.
