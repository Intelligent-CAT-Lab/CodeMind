 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an input n, which is `12`.
It initializes a variable sn to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of digits of n.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to the length of n (inclusive), meaning it will consider each digit of n.
For each digit i in this range, it adds the digit to sn.
The code then checks if the remainder of n divided by sn is 0. If it is, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".
In this case, the remainder of 12 divided by 0 is 0, so the code prints "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
