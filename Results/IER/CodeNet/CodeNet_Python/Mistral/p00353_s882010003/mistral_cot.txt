 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input, m, f and b.
The first if statement checks if b is less than or equal to m. If this condition is true, the code prints 0.
The second if statement checks if b is less than or equal to m + f. If this condition is true, the code prints b - m.
The third if statement checks if b is greater than m + f. If this condition is true, the code prints "NA".
For the given input `1000 3000 3000`, the first if statement is false, the second if statement is true and the third if statement is false.
The code then prints `3000 - 1000 = 2000`.
<<<Output>>>
2000
