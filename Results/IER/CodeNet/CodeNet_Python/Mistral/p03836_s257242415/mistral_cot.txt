 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four integer inputs, sx, sy, tx, and ty, which represent the coordinates of a rectangle.
The function solve() takes these four inputs and returns a string that represents the four sides of the rectangle.
The function first calculates the first side of the rectangle by concatenating "U" (up) characters equal to the number of rows between the top and bottom of the rectangle, and "R" (right) characters equal to the number of columns between the left and right of the rectangle.
The function second calculates the second side of the rectangle by concatenating "D" (down) characters equal to the number of rows between the top and bottom of the rectangle, and "L" (left) characters equal to the number of columns between the left and right of the rectangle.
The function third calculates the third side of the rectangle by concatenating "L" (left) characters equal to the number of rows between the top and bottom of the rectangle, "U" (up) characters equal to the number of columns between the left and right of the rectangle, "R" (right) characters equal to the number of rows between the top and bottom of the rectangle, and "D" (down) characters equal to the number of columns between the left and right of the rectangle.
The function fourth calculates the fourth side of the rectangle by concatenating "R" (right) characters equal to the number of rows between the top and bottom of the rectangle, "D" (down) characters equal to the number of columns between the left and right of the rectangle, "L" (left) characters equal to the number of rows between the top and bottom of the rectangle, and "U" (up) characters equal to the number of columns between the left and right of the rectangle.
The function then prints the concatenation of the four sides of the rectangle.
