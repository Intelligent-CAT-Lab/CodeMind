 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input: n, m, and d.
It calculates the answer ans using the formula:
ans = 2 * (n - d) * (m - 1) / pow(n, 2)
If d is 0, it calculates the answer ans as (m - 1) / n.
The code then prints the value of ans.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code for the input `2 3 1` is 10.
