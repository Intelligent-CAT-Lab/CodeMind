 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, a and b, separated by a space.
The code then compares the two numbers using an if-elif-else statement.
If a is less than b, it prints 'a < b'.
If a is greater than b, it prints 'a > b'.
If a is equal to b, it prints 'a == b'.
In this case, a is 1 and b is 2, so the output would be 'a < b'.
<<<Output>>>
a < b
