 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module and sets the recursion limit to 2*10**5.
It then defines the question variable as 1, and the operators AND, OR, left and right as -1, -2, -3 and -4, respectively.
The tr dictionary maps each operator to its corresponding value.
The evalor function takes a list of integers as input and returns the result of the evaluation.
The push function takes a list of integers and a value, and returns the updated list.
The andeval function takes a list of integers and a value, and returns the result of the evaluation.
The code then reads the input from the user and stores it in the S list.
It then initializes an empty list f.
For each element in S, it checks if it is equal to the question variable. If it is, it pushes the element (question, question) to the f list.
If the element is AND or left, it pushes the element (AND, AND) to the f list.
If the element is right, it pops the top two elements from the f list, which should be (AND, AND), and pushes the result of the evalor function to the f list.
Finally, it evaluates the f list using the evalor function and prints the result.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code for the input `?&?|?&?|?&?` would be (1, 1).
This is because the evaluation of the expression is (AND, OR) = (1, 1).
