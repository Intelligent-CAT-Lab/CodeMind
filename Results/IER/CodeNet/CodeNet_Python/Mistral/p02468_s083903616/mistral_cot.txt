 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first defines a function `rep_pow` that takes three arguments: `a`, `k`, and `p`. The function calculates the exponentiation of `a` raised to the power of `k` modulo `p`.
The function uses a while loop to iterate until `k` is 0. If `k` is odd, it multiplies `ans` by `a` modulo `p`. Then, it squares `a` modulo `p` and shifts `k` to the right by 1.
The function returns the final value of `ans`.
The code then reads two integers `m` and `n` from the input and calls the `rep_pow` function with `m` as the first argument, `n` as the second argument, and `10**9+7` as the third argument.
The return value of the function is then printed to the console.
