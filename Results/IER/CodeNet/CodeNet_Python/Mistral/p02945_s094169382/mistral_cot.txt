<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, A and B, and stores them in the variables A and B.
It then uses the `max()` function to find the maximum of three expressions: A+B, A-B and A*B.
The three expressions are evaluated and compared to find the maximum value.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is 12, which is the maximum of the three expressions: 13+3, 13-3 and 13*3.
