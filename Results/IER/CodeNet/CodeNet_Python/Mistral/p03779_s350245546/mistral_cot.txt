 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first reads an integer input from the user and stores it in the variable X.
The variable t is initialized to 0 and curr is also initialized to 0.
The while loop runs as long as curr is less than X.
Inside the loop, t is incremented by 1 and curr is incremented by t.
The loop continues until curr is equal to X, which is 6 in this case.
When the loop finishes, the variable t is printed, which is 2.
