The return value of the code for the input `1 2 10 20 15 200` would be `100 15`.
This means that the best total amount of water that can be obtained is 100 * 1 + 100 * 2 + 100 * 10 + 100 * 20 + 100 * 15 + 100 * 200 = 1500, and the best amount of sugar that can be obtained is 1 + 2 + 10 + 20 + 15 + 200 = 251.
Therefore, the best total amount of water and sugar that can be obtained is 1500 and 251, respectively.
