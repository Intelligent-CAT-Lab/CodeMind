 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the necessary modules, sys and socket.
It then checks if the hostname of the computer is 'N551J'. If it is, it opens the file 'a1.in' and assigns it to sys.stdin.
The code then defines several functions to read input in different formats: read\_int\_list, read\_int, read\_str\_list, read\_str.
The solve function takes in the input and calculates the best sugar and total water that can be obtained by mixing the given ingredients. It does this by iterating through all possible combinations of water and sugar, and checking if they meet the given constraints.
The main function calls the solve function and prints the return value.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code for the input `1 2 10 20 15 200` would be `100 15`.
This means that the best total amount of water that can be obtained is 100 * 1 + 100 * 2 + 100 * 10 + 100 * 20 + 100 * 15 + 100 * 200 = 1500, and the best amount of sugar that can be obtained is 1 + 2 + 10 + 20 + 15 + 200 = 251.
Therefore, the best total amount of water and sugar that can be obtained is 1500 and 251, respectively.
