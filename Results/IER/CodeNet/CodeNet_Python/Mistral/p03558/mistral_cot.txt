 <<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by importing the deque module from the collections module.
It then initializes an empty deque called q.
The variable K is initialized to 6, which will be used to determine the remainder of the division of the numbers in the deque by 6.
The code then appends the tuple (1, 1) to the deque.
The while loop runs as long as the deque is not empty.
Inside the loop, the code removes the first element of the deque, which is a tuple (n, s).
If n is already in the m dictionary, the code skips to the next iteration of the loop.
Otherwise, the code adds n to the m dictionary with the value s.
The code then appends two new elements to the deque:
* The first element is the remainder of n multiplied by 10 and divided by 6, which is added to the deque with the value s.
* The second element is n plus 1, which is added to the deque with the value s plus 1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the value of m[0], which is the final result.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is 1.
