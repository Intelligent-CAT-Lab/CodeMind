 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input n, which is 3 in this case.
It then calculates the square root of n and rounds it up to the nearest integer, which is 1.8644877186448772.
The code then initializes a list isPrime with all elements set to True, including the elements 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4.
The code then iterates over all even numbers from 4 to n-1 (inclusive) and sets the corresponding element in isPrime to False.
The code then initializes a variable ans to 0 and a variable prePrime to -1.
The code then iterates over all odd numbers from 3 to n-1 (inclusive) and checks if the corresponding element in isPrime is True.
If it is, the code checks if prePrime + 2 is equal to the current number. If it is, the code adds 2 to ans.
The code then updates prePrime to the current number and checks if the current number is greater than the square root of n. If it is, the code continues to the next iteration.
If the current number is not greater than the square root of n, the code iterates over all multiples of the current number from the current number squared to n-1 (inclusive) and sets the corresponding elements in isPrime to False.
Finally, the code prints the value of ans, which is 2.

2
