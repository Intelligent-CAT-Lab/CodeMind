 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers n and m as input, separated by a space.
It then enters a loop that iterates n times.
For each iteration, it checks if the current iteration i is less than or equal to n/2. If it is, it prints a 0. Otherwise, it prints the value of m.
After the loop finishes, it prints a newline character.
The code is designed to print a string of zeros followed by a space, followed by the value of m, followed by n-1 spaces, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another space, followed by another
