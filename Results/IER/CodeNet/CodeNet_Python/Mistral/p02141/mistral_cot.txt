 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `inpl()` is called and returns a list of integers. The list contains the values `6000`, `5000`, `20`, `10`, `400`, and `300`.
The variables `W`, `H`, `w`, `h`, `x`, and `y` are assigned the values in the list.
The variable `a` is calculated by taking the minimum of `W//2` and `x + w//2`, adding the maximum of `-W//2` and `x-w//2`, and then dividing by 2.
The variable `b` is calculated in a similar way, but using `H//2` and `y + h//2`, `-H//2` and `y-h//2`.
Finally, the variable `b/a` is printed.
