 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input: n, m, and d.
The first if statement checks if d is greater than 0. If it is, the code calculates the return value as 2*(n-d)*(m-1)/n**2.
If d is not greater than 0, the code calculates the return value as (m-1)/n.
In this case, n is 2, m is 3 and d is 1.
Since d is not greater than 0, the code calculates the return value as (3-1)/2 = 1.
