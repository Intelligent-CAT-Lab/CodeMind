The code first checks if n is odd, if it is, it prints -1 and exits.
If n is even, it calls the function f(a,bin,n) with initial values of a=[], bin=0 and n=2.
The function f(a,bin,n) uses recursion to generate all the binary numbers less than or equal to n. It does this by adding the current binary number to the list a and calling itself with the new binary number multiplied by 10 and 2 or 8, and the remaining value of n.
After the recursion finishes, the function g(n,p) is called with n and p=0.
The function g(n,p) uses the bisect module to find the index x of the smallest binary number in a that is greater than or equal to n. If x is not equal to the length of a and the value at index x is equal to n, it sets m to 1.
If the square of the current binary number is greater than n, it returns -1.
If n is divisible by the current binary number, it calls itself with n divided by the current binary number and p+1.
If n is not divisible by the current binary number, it calls itself with n divided by the current binary number and p+1, and returns the maximum of m and the result of calling g(n,p+1).
Finally, the code prints the return value of g(n,p).
