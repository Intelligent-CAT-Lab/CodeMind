 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module, which is used to interact with the command line.
It then reads an integer N from the user using the input() function and stores it in the variable N.
The variable power is initialized to 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates N times.
For each iteration, it multiplies power by (i+1), where i is the current iteration number.
After each multiplication, it takes the modulo of the result with 10**9+7, which is used to avoid integer overflow.
The final value of power is printed.
<<<Output>>>
1
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
The return value of the code is 1, which is the final value of the variable power after the loop has finished.
