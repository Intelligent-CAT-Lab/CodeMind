 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 18.
The function prime\_factorization\_2 is called with n as its argument.
The function prime\_factorization\_2 first calculates the square root of n and then calls the make\_prime\_list\_2 function to generate a list of prime numbers up to the square root of n.
The function then performs prime factorization on n using the prime numbers in the list.
The function returns a dictionary where the keys are the prime factors of n and the values are the number of times each prime factor appears in the prime factorization of n.
The variable d is assigned the result of prime\_factorization\_2(n).
The variable val is initialized to 1.
The function then iterates over the values in the dictionary d and multiplies each value by (value+1) to calculate the product of all the prime factors of n.
Finally, the function prints the length of the dictionary d and the product of all the prime factors of n minus 1.
