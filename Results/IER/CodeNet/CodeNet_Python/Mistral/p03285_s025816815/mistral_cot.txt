 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input n, which is 11 in this case.
The variable p is initialized to 0 and the variable t is initialized to True.
The code enters a while loop that iterates until p is less than 26.
Inside the loop, it calculates the remainder r of n divided by 7, which is 4 in this case.
It then checks if r is greater than or equal to 0 and if its remainder when divided by 4 is 0.
If both conditions are met, it sets t to False and prints "Yes".
Since the remainder of 11 divided by 7 is 4, the loop will not iterate again and the code will exit the loop.
The final value of t is False, so the code will print "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
