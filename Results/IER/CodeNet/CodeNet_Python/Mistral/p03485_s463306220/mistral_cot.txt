 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the math module.
Then it takes two integers as input, a and b, and stores them in the variables a and b.
The mean of a and b is calculated by adding them together and dividing by 2, and stored in the variable mean.
The math.ceil() function is then used to round up the mean to the nearest integer, and the result is stored in the variable ans.
Finally, the code prints the value of ans.
