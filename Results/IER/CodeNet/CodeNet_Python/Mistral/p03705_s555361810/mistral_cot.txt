 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input, N, A and B. In this case, N is 4, A is 4 and B is 6.
The code first checks if N is equal to 1. Since it is not, it moves to the next condition.
The code then checks if A is equal to B. Since it is not, it moves to the next condition.
The code then checks if A is greater than B. Since it is not, it moves to the next condition.
The code then checks if A is equal to B or N is equal to 2. Since neither of these conditions is met, it moves to the next condition.
The code then calculates the difference between B and A, multiplies it by the difference between N and 2, and adds 1. This gives a result of 11.
The code then prints the result, which is 11.
<<<Output>>>
11
