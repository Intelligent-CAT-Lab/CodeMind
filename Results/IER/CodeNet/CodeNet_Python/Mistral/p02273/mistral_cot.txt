 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the math module, which provides mathematical functions.
Then it defines a Vector class, which has several methods for basic arithmetic operations and a rot method that rotates the vector by a given angle.
The koch function is defined, which recursively draws a Koch snowflake with a given number of iterations, starting from two points a and b.
The code then reads an integer N from the user, which represents the number of iterations for the Koch snowflake.
It then creates two Vector objects, a and b, with coordinates (0,0) and (100,0), respectively.
The code then prints the coordinates of vectors a and b, and calls the koch function with N iterations, passing in vectors a and b as arguments.
The koch function recursively calls itself with N-1 iterations, until it reaches the base case where N=0.
At each iteration, it calculates the coordinates of the three vertices of the Koch snowflake and prints them.
Finally, the code prints the coordinates of vector b again.
