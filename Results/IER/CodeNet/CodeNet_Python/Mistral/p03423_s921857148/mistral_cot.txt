<<<Analysis>>>
The code prompts the user to enter a number using the `input()` function and stores it in the variable `a`.
The `int()` function is used to convert the input string to an integer.
The code then performs integer division (// operator) of `a` by 3 and stores the result in the variable `a//3`.
The `print()` function is used to output the value of `a//3`.
<<<Output>>>
2

Therefore, the return value of the code based on the input `8` would be `2`.
