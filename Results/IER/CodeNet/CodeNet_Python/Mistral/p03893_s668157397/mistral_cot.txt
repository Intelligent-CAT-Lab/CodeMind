<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an input from the user using the `input()` function. The input is then converted to an integer using the `int()` function.
The input is then added 2 and the result is raised to the power of 2 using the `**` exponent operator.
Finally, the result is subtracted by 2 to get the final output.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code would be 16.
