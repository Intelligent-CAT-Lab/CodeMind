 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer N as input and initializes a variable ans to 0.
It then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 15.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is divisible by either 3 or 5, but not both. If it is not divisible by either, it adds the current number i to ans.
The condition is met when i is 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14 and 15.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 78.
<<<Output>>>
78
