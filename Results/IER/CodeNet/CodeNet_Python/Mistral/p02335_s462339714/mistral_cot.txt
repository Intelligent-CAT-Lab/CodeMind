 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, n and k. In this case, n = 3 and k = 5.
The function first checks if n is greater than k, which is not the case here.
It then initializes two lists, table_1 and table_2, to store the values of the binomial coefficients.
The function calculates the values of table_1 and table_2 using a loop and the formula for binomial coefficients.
The function then calculates the values of a, b and c using the values of table_1 and table_2.
Finally, the function calculates the result by multiplying a, b and c and taking the result modulo p.
The result is 100% which is 0 in Python.
<<<Output>>>
0
