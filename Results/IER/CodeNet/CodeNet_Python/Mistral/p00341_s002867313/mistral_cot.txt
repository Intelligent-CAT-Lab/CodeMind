 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes a list of integers as input, separated by spaces. The input is then split using the `split()` method and converted to a list of integers using the `map()` function. The resulting list is then sorted using the `sorted()` function.
The code then checks if the first element of the sorted list is equal to the fourth element, the fifth element is equal to the eighth element and the ninth element is equal to the twelfth element.
If all these conditions are met, the code prints "yes", otherwise it prints "no".
<<<Output>>>
no
