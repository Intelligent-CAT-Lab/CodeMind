 <<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes three variables: X, ans and memo.
X is assigned the input string "TSTTSS".
ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to store the final result.
memo is initialized to 0, which will be used to keep track of the number of T's encountered.
The code then enters a loop that iterates through each character in the input string X.
For each character, it checks if it is a T. If it is, it checks if memo is equal to 0. If it is, it does nothing. If it is not, it subtracts 1 from memo.
If the character is not a T, it adds 1 to memo.
After the loop finishes, the code calculates the final result by multiplying memo by 2.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is 10.
