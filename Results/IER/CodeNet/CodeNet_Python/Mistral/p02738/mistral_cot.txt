The code first imports the numpy library.
The variables n and M are initialized to 1 and 998244353, respectively.
The variable l is calculated as n*3+1, which is 10*3+1=31.
The variable d is initialized as a 2D array of size (31, 5*n), where n is the number of digits in the input number.
The first element of the first row of the array is set to 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to l-1.
For each i in this range, it calculates the value of d[i] using the formula:
d[i] = ((d[i-3]*k+roll(d[k],-1))*j+roll(d[j],1))%M
where k is the digit in the i-th position of the input number, j is the digit in the (i-1)-th position of the input number, and roll(d[k],-1) is the value of the k-th digit of the previous row of the array.
The condition is met when i is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the sum of the last row of the array, which is the final result.
