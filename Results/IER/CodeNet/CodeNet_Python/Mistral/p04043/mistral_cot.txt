 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes three integers as input, a, b and c, separated by spaces.
It then converts the input string into a list of integers using the `map()` function and the `int()` function.
The list is then sorted using the `sorted()` function and the `list()` function.
The sorted list is then compared to the list `[5,5,7]` using the `==` operator.
If the sorted list is equal to `[5,5,7]`, the code prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".
<<<Output>>>
NO
