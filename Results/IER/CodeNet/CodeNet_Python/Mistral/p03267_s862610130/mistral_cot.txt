 <<<Analysis>>>
The function `solve` takes an integer `l` as input.
It initializes a variable `n` to 0 and enters a while loop that continues until 2^n is greater than or equal to `l`. This means that the loop will continue until `l` is less than or equal to 31.
Inside the loop, the variable `n` is incremented by 1.
After the loop finishes, the function initializes an empty list `E`.
It then enters another loop that iterates from `n-1` to -1, with a step of -1. For each iteration, it calculates the value of `x` as 2^i, where `i` is the current iteration.
If `i` is not equal to `n-1`, it appends two tuples to the list `E`. The first tuple contains `(i, i+1, 0)`, which represents the fact that the current number `x` can be obtained by adding 0 to the previous number `x`. The second tuple contains `(i, i+1, x)`, which represents the fact that the current number `x` can be obtained by adding `x` to the previous number `x`.
If `l - x` is greater than or equal to 2^(n-1), it appends another tuple to the list `E`. The tuple contains `(i, n-1, l-x)`, which represents the fact that the current number `x` can be obtained by subtracting `x` from the previous number `x`.
After the second loop finishes, the function prints the values of `n` and the length of the list `E`.
It then enters another loop that iterates over the tuples in the list `E`. For each tuple, it prints the values of the three elements.

<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is not applicable, as the code does not return anything. It simply prints the values of `n` and the length of the list `E`, as well as the values of the tuples in the list `E`.

For the input `4`, the output would be:
```
4 2
1 2 0
2 2 2
```
This means that the number 4 can be obtained by adding 0 to the previous number 0, or by adding 2 to the previous number 2.
