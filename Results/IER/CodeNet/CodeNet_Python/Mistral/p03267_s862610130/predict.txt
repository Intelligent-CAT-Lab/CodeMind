The return value of the code is not applicable, as the code does not return anything. It simply prints the values of `n` and the length of the list `E`, as well as the values of the tuples in the list `E`.

For the input `4`, the output would be:
```
4 2
1 2 0
2 2 2
```
This means that the number 4 can be obtained by adding 0 to the previous number 0, or by adding 2 to the previous number 2.
