Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
x = list(map(int,list(input())))
n = len(x)
dp = [[0,1] for _ in range(n+1)]
for i in range(n):
    dp[i+1][0] = min(dp[i][0]+x[i],dp[i][1]+10-x[i])
    dp[i+1][1] = min(dp[i][0]+x[i]+1,dp[i][1]+9-x[i])
print(dp[n][0])

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
36

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable x is initialized to the list of integers obtained by inputting a string of integers separated by spaces.
The variable n is initialized to the length of the list x.
The variable dp is initialized to a list of lists of length n+1, where each sublist has two elements initialized to 0 and 1, respectively.
The first element of each sublist corresponds to the minimum number of moves required to reach the current position from the left end of the list, and the second element corresponds to the minimum number of moves required to reach the current position from the right end of the list.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n-1, meaning it will consider each position in the list.
For each position i, the code calculates the minimum number of moves required to reach the current position from the left end of the list and from the right end of the list, and stores them in the corresponding elements of the sublist dp[i+1].
The minimum number of moves required to reach the current position from the left end of the list is the sum of the current element of the list x and the minimum number of moves required to reach the previous position from the left end of the list, plus 1 if the sum is greater than or equal to 10, and 0 otherwise.
The minimum number of moves required to reach the current position from the right end of the list is the sum of the current element of the list x and the minimum number of moves required to reach the previous position from the right end of the list, plus 1 if the sum is greater than or equal to 10, and 0 otherwise.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of dp[n][0], which is the minimum number of moves required to reach the last position from the left end of the list.

The output of code execution is:
1
