Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
def getN():
    return int(input())
def getNM():
    return map(int, input().split())
def getList():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
def getArray(intn):
    return [int(input()) for i in range(intn)]
def input():
    return sys.stdin.readline().rstrip()

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
1 1

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The code defines several functions to read input from the standard input. The function getN() reads an integer from the input, the function getNM() reads two integers from the input, the function getList() reads a list of integers from the input, the function getArray(intn) reads an array of integers of length intn from the input, and the function input() reads a line of input from the standard input and strips the newline character from the end.

The code then imports several modules from the Python standard library, including itertools, which provides functions for working with iterators, including permutations, and math, which provides functions for mathematical operations.

The code defines two variables, N and M, which are initialized to the input values. The variable total is initialized to 1900 * M + 100 * (N - M), which is the total number of points that can be earned by the player.

The code then prints the total number of points multiplied by 2 raised to the power of M, which is the total number of possible combinations of the M most valuable cards.

The output of code execution is:

1900
