Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84

Consider the following code:

from collections import deque

sys.setrecursionlimit(10000000)

N, M, A, B = map(int, raw_input().split())

ans = [['.'] * M for i in range(N)]

    for i in range(0, N - 1, 2):
        if B > 0:
            B -= 1
            ans[i][M - 1], ans[i + 1][M - 1] = "^", "v"

print "YES"

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
3 4 4 2

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable N, variable M, variable A and variable B are initialized to 3, 4, 4 and 2, respectively.

The variable ans is initialized to a 2D list of size N x M, where each element is initialized to a period ".".

The code checks if M is odd or even. If it is odd, it sets the last column of the first row to "^" and the last column of the second row to "v".

The code checks if N is odd or even. If it is odd, it sets the last row of the last column to "<" and the last row of the second last column to ">".

The code checks if the number of black squares is equal to the number of white squares, and if the number of black squares is odd. If it is, it sets the last row of the second last column to "^" and the last column of the second last row to "v".

The code then enters a loop that iterates from N - 2 - N % 2 to 0 (inclusive), meaning it will consider rows from 0 to 1.

For each row i in this range, it enters another loop that iterates from 0 to M - 1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider columns from 0 to 3.

For each column j in this range, it checks if A is greater than or equal to 2. If it is, it sets the current square to "<" and decrements A by 2.

If A is greater than or equal to 1, it sets the current square to "<" and decrements A by 1.

If A is less than 1, it checks if B is greater than or equal to 2. If it is, it sets the current square to "^" and decrements B by 2.

If B is greater than or equal to 1, it sets the current square to "^" and decrements B by 1.

After the loop finishes, the code checks if A is greater than 0 or B is greater than 0. If it is, it prints "NO" and exits.

If A and B are both 0, it prints "YES" and prints the contents of the 2D list ans.

The output of code execution is:
YES
....
.v..
.v..
