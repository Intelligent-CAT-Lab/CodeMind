Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
n,m,k=map(int,input().split())
ans=0
def cmb(n, r, mod):
    if ( r<0 or r>n ):
        return 0
    r = min(r, n-r)
    return g1[n] * g2[r] * g2[n-r] % mod

mod = 998244353 #出力の制限
N = 2*10**5
g1 = [1, 1] # 元テーブル
g2 = [1, 1] #逆元テーブル
inverse = [0, 1] #逆元テーブル計算用テーブル

for i in range( 2, N + 1 ):
    g1.append( ( g1[-1] * i ) % mod )
    inverse.append( ( -inverse[mod % i] * (mod//i) ) % mod )
    g2.append( (g2[-1] * inverse[-1]) % mod )


  
kk=n-k
#print(kk)
color=m*(m-1)**(kk-1)%mod
#print(color)
while kk<=n:
  now=color
  color=color*(m-1)%mod
  now=now*(cmb((n-1),(n-kk),mod))%mod
  kk+=1
  ans+=now
  ans=ans%mod
  #print(kk)
  #print(now)
  #print("color",color,"com",com)
print(ans)
  
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
3 2 1

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable n, variable m, and variable k are initialized to 3, 2, and 1, respectively.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of the number of ways to color the m squares with k colors.

The code defines a function cmb(n, r, mod) that calculates the combination of n things taken r at a time, modulo mod.

The modulus is set to 998244353, which is the largest prime number less than 10^9.

The variables N and mod are used to define the variables g1, g2, and inverse, which are used to calculate the inverse of a number modulo mod.

The variables g1 and g2 are initialized to [1, 1], which are the first two terms of the Fibonacci sequence.

The variable inverse is initialized to [0, 1], which is used to calculate the inverse of a number modulo mod.

The code then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 2 to 2*10^5.

For each number i in this range, it calculates the next term of the Fibonacci sequence and appends it to g1.

It also calculates the inverse of i modulo mod and appends it to inverse.

It calculates the next term of the Fibonacci sequence raised to the power of mod-2 and appends it to g2.

After the loop finishes, the code defines a variable kk that is equal to n-k.

The variable color is initialized to m*(m-1)**(kk-1) modulo mod.

The code then enters a loop that iterates from kk to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from kk to n.

For each number kk in this range, it calculates the current value of color and stores it in now.

It then calculates the next value of color by multiplying it by (m-1) modulo mod.

It calculates the current value of color raised to the power of (n-kk) and multiplies it by the combination of (n-1) things taken (n-kk) at a time modulo mod.

It adds this value to ans modulo mod.

After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans modulo mod, which is 1.

The output of code execution is:
1
