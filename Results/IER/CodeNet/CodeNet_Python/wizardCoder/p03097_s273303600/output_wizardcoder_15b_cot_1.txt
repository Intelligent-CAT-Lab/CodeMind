Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
n, a, b = map(int, raw_input().split())

def doit(a, b, mask):
    differ = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if mask & (1 << i) == 0 and (a ^ b) & (1 << i)!= 0:
            differ = i
    same = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if mask & (1 << i) == 0 and i!= differ:
            same = i
    if same == -1:
        return [a, b]
    return (doit(a, a ^ (1 << same), mask | (1 << differ)) +
            doit(a ^ (1 << same) ^ (1 << differ), b, mask | (1 << differ)))

if bin(a ^ b).count('1') % 2!= 1:
    print "NO"
else:
    print "YES"
    ret = doit(a, b, 0)
    print " ".join(map(str, ret))
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
2 1 3

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable n, variable a and variable b are initialized to 2, 1 and 3, respectively.

The function doit(a, b, mask) takes three arguments: a, b and mask.

The function first calculates the index of the bit that differs between a and b. It does this by iterating over the bits of a and b using a for loop and checking if the bit is set in mask. If it is not set and the bit is set in a but not in b, then the differ index is set to the current bit index.

The function then calculates the index of the bit that is the same in both a and b. It does this by iterating over the bits of a and b using a for loop and checking if the bit is set in mask. If it is not set and the bit is not the differ index, then the same index is set to the current bit index.

If the same index is still -1, then the function returns [a, b].

If the same index is not -1, then the function recursively calls itself with the following arguments:

- a, a ^ (1 << same), mask | (1 << differ)
- a ^ (1 << same) ^ (1 << differ), b, mask | (1 << differ)

The function then concatenates the results of these recursive calls and returns them.

The main program checks if the number of set bits in a ^ b is odd. If it is, then the program prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES" and calls the doit function with the arguments a, b and 0. The doit function returns a list of two integers, which are printed as a space-separated string using the map function and the join method.

The output of code execution is:

YES
