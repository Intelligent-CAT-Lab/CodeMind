Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
# AOJ 2816: Alphabet Block
# Python3 2018.7.11 bal4u

dic = {}
S = list(input())
for s in S:
	if s not in dic: dic[s] = 1
	else: dic[s] += 1
ans = 0
for k in list(dic.keys()):
	if dic[k] & 1: ans += 1
print(ans>>1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
hcpc

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable S is initialized to the string "hcpc".
The dictionary dic is initialized to an empty dictionary.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each character s in the string S.
For each character s, the code checks if it is already a key in the dictionary dic. If it is not, the code adds it as a key with a value of 1. If it is already a key, the code increments its value by 1.
After the loop finishes, the dictionary dic contains the count of each character in the string S.
The code then enters another loop that iterates over each key k in the dictionary dic.
For each key k, the code checks if its value is odd. If it is, the code increments the variable ans by 1.
After the loop finishes, the variable ans contains the number of characters in the string S that have an odd count.
The code then divides ans by 2 and prints the result.

The output of code execution is:
1
END-OF-OUTPUT
