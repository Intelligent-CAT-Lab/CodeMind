The variable lst is initialized to a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and mapping each element to an integer using the map function. The sorted function is then applied to lst to sort it in ascending order.

The code then checks if the first element of lst is equal to the fourth element, the fifth element is equal to the eighth element, and the ninth element is equal to the tenth element. If all of these conditions are true, the code prints "yes". Otherwise, it prints "no".

The input string "1 1 3 4 8 9 7 3 4 5 5 5" is mapped to the list [1, 1, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 7, 8, 9, 3, 4], which is sorted to [1, 1, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 7, 8, 9]. The first element of this list is 1, which is not equal to the fourth element (3), so the code prints "no". The fifth element is 5, which is equal to the eighth element (5), so the code prints "yes".
