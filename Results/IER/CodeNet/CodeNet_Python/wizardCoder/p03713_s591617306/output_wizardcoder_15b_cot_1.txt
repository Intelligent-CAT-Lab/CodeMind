Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
def pat1(H,W):
    if H % 3 == 0:
        return 0
    else:
        return W

def pat2(H,W):
    if W % 3 == 0:
        return 0
    else:
        return H

def pat3(H,W):
    h1 = H // 2
    h2 = H - h1
    ans = 10**15 
    for w in range(1,W//2+1):
        s1 = h1 * (W-w)
        s2 = h2 * (W-w)
        s3 = H*w
        min1 = min(s1,s2,s3)
        max1 = max(s1,s2,s3)
        ans = min(ans,max1-min1)
    return ans

def pat4(H,W):
    w1 = W // 2
    w2 = W - w1
    ans = 10**15
    for h in range(1,H//2+1):
        s1 = w1*(H-h)
        s2 = w2*(H-h)
        s3 = W*h
        min1 = min(s1,s2,s3)
        max1 = max(s1,s2,s3)
        ans = min(ans,max1-min1)
    return ans

H,W = map(int,input().split())
ans = 10**15
ans = min(ans,pat1(H,W))
ans = min(ans,pat2(H,W))
ans = min(ans,pat3(H,W))
ans = min(ans,pat4(H,W))

print(ans)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
3 5

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The function pat1(H,W) is defined to return 0 if H is divisible by 3, otherwise it returns W.
The function pat2(H,W) is defined to return 0 if W is divisible by 3, otherwise it returns H.
The function pat3(H,W) is defined to calculate the minimum difference between the sum of the areas of the four patterns formed by the top and bottom halves of the rectangle with dimensions H and W.
The function pat4(H,W) is defined to calculate the minimum difference between the sum of the areas of the four patterns formed by the left and right halves of the rectangle with dimensions H and W.

The input H and W are read from the user.

The variable ans is initialized to 10^15, which is a very large number.

The four patterns are calculated using the four functions and the minimum of their results is stored in ans.

The final value of ans is printed as the output of the code execution.

The output of code execution is:
12
