Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
from math import sqrt, sin, cos, pi

a, b, C = map(float, input().split())

#度からラジアンへ変換する
C = (C * pi) / 180

#余弦定理を使って計算する
c = sqrt(a**2 + b**2 - 2*a*b*cos(C))
height = b * sin(C)
size = a * height * (1/2)
length = a + b + c

#出力する
print('{:.8f}'.format(size))
print('{:.8f}'.format(length))
print('{:.8f}'.format(height))

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
4 3 90

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable a, variable b and variable C are initialized to 4, 3 and 90, respectively.
The code then uses the math module to calculate the values of c, height, size and length.

First, the code converts the angle C from degrees to radians by multiplying it by pi/180.

Next, the code uses the cosine law to calculate the length of the triangle's third side, c.

The code then uses the sine law to calculate the height of the triangle, height.

Finally, the code calculates the size of the triangle by multiplying the area of the triangle by its perimeter.

The code then prints the values of size, length and height, rounded to 8 decimal places using the format() function.

The output of code execution is:
6.00000000
12.00000000
3.00000000
