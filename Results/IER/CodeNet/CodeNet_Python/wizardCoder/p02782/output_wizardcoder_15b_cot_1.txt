Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
mod = 10**9+7
rng = 2000100
fctr = [1]+[0]*(rng-1)
for i in range(1,rng):
  fctr[i] = fctr[i-1]*i%mod
def finv(x):
  return pow(fctr[x],mod-2,mod)
def cmb(n,k):
  if n<0 or k<0:
    return 0
  else:
    return fctr[n]*finv(n-k)*finv(k)%mod

x1,y1,x2,y2 = map(int,input().split())
print((cmb(x2+y2+2,x2+1)-cmb(x2+y1+1,y1)-cmb(x1+y2+1,x1)+cmb(x1+y1,x1))%mod)
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
1 1 2 2

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable mod is initialized to 10^9+7, which is the modulus used in the code.
The variable rng is initialized to 2000100, which is the upper limit of the range of numbers to consider.
The variable fctr is initialized to a list of length rng, with all elements initialized to 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to rng-1, meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 2000100.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the factorial of i and stores it in fctr[i].
The code defines two functions, finv and cmb, which are used in the main code.
The function finv takes an integer x as input and returns the inverse of x modulo mod.
The function cmb takes two integers n and k as input and returns the combination of n choose k modulo mod.
The code then reads the input values x1, y1, x2, y2 from the user.
The code calculates the value of the expression (cmb(x2+y2+2,x2+1)-cmb(x2+y1+1,y1)-cmb(x1+y2+1,x1)+cmb(x1+y1,x1))%mod, which is the number of ways to choose 2 points from a rectangle with dimensions x2+y2+2 and y2+x2+2, where the top-left corner is at (0,0) and the bottom-right corner is at (x2,y2).
The code prints the final value of this expression, which is 1.

The output of code execution is:
1
