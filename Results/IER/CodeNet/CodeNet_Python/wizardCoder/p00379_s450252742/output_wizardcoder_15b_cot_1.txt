Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
a, n, m = map(int, input().split())
ans = 0
for i in range(a, int(m ** (1 / 2)) + 1):
  x = i ** n
  if not 1 <= x <= m:
    continue
  y = i - a
  if sum(map(int, list(str(x)))) == y:
    ans += 1
print(ans)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
16 2 1000

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable a, n, and m are initialized to 16, 2, and 1000, respectively.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the number of integers that satisfy the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from a to the square root of m (inclusive), meaning it will consider integers from a to the square root of 1000.
For each integer i in this range, it calculates the integer x raised to the power of n, and checks if it is within the range [1, m]. If it is not, the code skips to the next iteration of the loop.
If x is within the range [1, m], the code calculates the integer y by subtracting a from i. It then checks if the sum of the digits of x is equal to y. If it is, the code increments ans by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 1.

The output of code execution is:
1
