Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
A,B,C,X,Y=map(int,input().split())
ans = 10**9+7
for i in range(10**5+1):
  if ans > (2*C*i + max(0,Y-i)*B + max(0,X-i)*A):
    ans = 2*C*i + max(0,Y-i)*B + max(0,X-i)*A
print(ans)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
1500 2000 1600 3 2

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variables A, B, C, X and Y are initialized to 1500, 2000, 1600, 3 and 2, respectively.
The variable ans is initialized to 10^9+7, which is a large number to ensure that the answer is not too small.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 10^5 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 10^5.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the maximum amount of money that can be earned by selling i tickets.
The formula used is:
ans = 2*C*i + max(0,Y-i)*B + max(0,X-i)*A
where C is the cost of a ticket, B is the revenue from selling a ticket for a price of B, A is the revenue from selling a ticket for a price of A, X is the maximum number of tickets that can be sold for a price of A, and Y is the maximum number of tickets that can be sold for a price of B.
The maximum amount of money that can be earned by selling i tickets is stored in ans.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 10^9+7.

The output of code execution is:
1000000007
