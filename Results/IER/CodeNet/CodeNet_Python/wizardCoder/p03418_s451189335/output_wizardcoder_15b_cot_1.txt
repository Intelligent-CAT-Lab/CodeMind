Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
def getN():
    return int(input())
def getNM():
    return map(int, input().split())
def getList():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
def getArray(intn):
    return [int(input()) for i in range(intn)]
def input():
    return sys.stdin.readline().rstrip()

from collections import defaultdict, deque, Counter
from sys import exit
import heapq
import math
import copy
from bisect import bisect_left, bisect_right

import sys
sys.setrecursionlimit(1000000000)
mod = 10 ** 9 + 7

N, K = getNM()
sum = 0
for b in range(1, N + 1):
    opt1 = (N // b) * max(0, (b - K))
    if K == 0:
        opt2 = N % b
    else:
        opt2 = max(0, (N % b) - K + 1)
    sum += (opt1 + opt2)
print(sum)
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
5 2

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The code defines several functions to read input from the user. The function getN() reads an integer input from the user, the function getNM() reads two integer inputs from the user, separated by a space, and returns them as a tuple. The function getList() reads a list of integers from the user, separated by a space, and returns it as a list. The function getArray(intn) reads an array of integers of length intn from the user, separated by a space, and returns it as a list. The function input() reads a string input from the user, strips the newline character at the end, and returns it as a string.

The code then imports several modules that are commonly used in competitive programming. The modules include collections, deque, Counter, heapq, math, copy, bisect, and sys. The sys module is used to set the recursion limit to a large value, which is necessary for some problems.

The code defines two variables N and K, which are initialized to the input values. The variable sum is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of the optimal values.

The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider values from 1 to N. For each value b in this range, it calculates two optimal values: opt1 and opt2. opt1 is the maximum number of times b can be used to divide N, multiplied by the maximum number of times b can be subtracted from N, and opt2 is the maximum number of times b can be subtracted from N, plus 1. If K is 0, opt2 is simply N % b. Otherwise, opt2 is the maximum number of times b can be subtracted from N, plus 1. The sum of these two values is added to the variable sum.

After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum, which is 10.

The output of code execution is:
10
