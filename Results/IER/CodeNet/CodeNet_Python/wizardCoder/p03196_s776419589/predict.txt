The variable N is initialized to 3, and the variable P is initialized to 24.
The function prime_factorize(n) is called with P as its argument.
The function prime_factorize(n) first initializes an empty list a to store the prime factors of n.
The function then enters a while loop that continues as long as n is divisible by 2. In each iteration, it appends 2 to the list a and divides n by 2.
The function then initializes a variable f to 3 and enters another while loop that continues as long as f squared is less than or equal to n. In each iteration, it checks if n is divisible by f. If it is, it appends f to the list a and divides n by f. If it is not, it increments f by 2 and continues with the next iteration.
If n is not equal to 1 at the end of the loop, it means that it is a prime number and it is appended to the list a.
The function returns the list a.

The function m() is called with N and P as its arguments.
The function m() first checks if N is equal to 1. If it is, it returns P.
If N is not equal to 1, the function calls prime_factorize(P) to get the prime factors of P.
The function then initializes a variable a to 1 and a Counter object c to count the occurrences of each prime factor in the list returned by prime_factorize(P).
The function then initializes an empty list ans to store the powers of each prime factor.
The function then enters a for loop that iterates over the items in the Counter object c. For each item, it calculates the quotient of the count of the prime factor and N, and stores it in a variable tmp.
If tmp is not equal to 0, it means that the prime factor appears at least once in P, and it appends the power of the prime factor raised to the quotient to the list ans.
The function then enters another for loop that iterates over the items in the list ans. For each item, it multiplies a by the item.
The function then returns a.

The function m() is called with N and P as its arguments.
The function m() first checks if N is equal to 1. If it is, it returns P.
If N is not equal to 1, the function calls prime_factorize(P) to get the prime factors of P.

The function then enters a for loop that iterates over the items in the Counter object c. For each item, it calculates the quotient of the count of the prime factor and N, and stores it in a variable tmp.
