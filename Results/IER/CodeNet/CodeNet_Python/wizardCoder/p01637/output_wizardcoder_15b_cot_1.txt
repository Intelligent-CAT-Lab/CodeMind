Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
def f(a,b,c):
    return a*b<100*c
m,rd,rr,cd,cr=map(int,input().split())
ex=cd*100//rd
if(f(ex,rd,cd)):ex+=1
ey=cr*100//rr
if(f(ey,rr,cr)):ey+=1
print(m-ex-ey if m-ex-ey>=0 else -1)
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
M r

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The code defines a function f that takes three arguments a, b, and c and returns True if a*b is less than 100*c, and False otherwise.

The input is read as m, rd, rr, cd, and cr, where m is the number of students, rd is the number of rolls in each row, rr is the number of rows, cd is the number of columns in each row, and cr is the number of columns.

The code then calculates the expected number of students in each row by dividing the number of columns in each row by the number of rolls in each row. If the expected number of students in each row is less than 1, the expected number of students in each row is incremented by 1.

The code then calculates the expected number of students in each column by dividing the number of rows in each column by the number of rolls in each row. If the expected number of students in each column is less than 1, the expected number of students in each column is incremented by 1.

Finally, the code calculates the number of students that are expected to be present in the exam room by subtracting the expected number of students in each row and column from the total number of students. If the result is negative, the code prints -1, otherwise it prints the result.

The output of code execution is:
-1
