Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

def lcm(a, b):
    return a // gcd (a, b) * b

def factorization(n):
    arr = []
    temp = n
    for i in range(2, int(-(-n**0.5//1))+1):
        if temp%i==0:
            cnt=0
            while temp%i==0:
                cnt+=1
                temp //= i
            arr.append([i, cnt])

    if temp!=1:
        arr.append([temp, 1])

    if arr==[]:
        arr.append([n, 1])

    return arr

n, m = map(int, input().split())
g = gcd(n,m)
if g == 1:
    print(1)
else:
    print(len(factorization(g))+1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
12 18

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The code defines two functions gcd and lcm. The gcd function takes two integers as input and returns their greatest common divisor. The lcm function takes two integers as input and returns their least common multiple.

The code then reads two integers n and m from the input. It calculates their greatest common divisor g using the gcd function.

If g is equal to 1, it means that n and m have no common factors other than 1, so the code prints 1.

Otherwise, the code calculates the factorization of g using the factorization function. The factorization function takes an integer n as input and returns a list of pairs [p, e] where p is a prime factor of n and e is the exponent of p in the factorization.

The code then counts the number of pairs in the factorization and adds 1 to get the number of prime factors of g. This is the number of prime factors of n and m that are also prime factors of g.

The code prints this number as the output.

The output of code execution is:
2
