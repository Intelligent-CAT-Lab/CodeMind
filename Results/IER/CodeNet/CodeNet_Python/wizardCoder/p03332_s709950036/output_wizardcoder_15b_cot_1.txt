Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
MOD = 998244353
n, a, b, k = map(int, input().split())
fac = [1] * (n + 1)
for i in range(n):
    fac[i + 1] = fac[i] * (i + 1) % MOD


def comb(n, k):
    return fac[n] * pow(fac[n - k], MOD - 2, MOD) * pow(fac[k], MOD - 2, MOD)


ans = 0
for x in range(n + 1):
    if k - x * a < 0 or (k - x * a) % b:
        continue
    y = (k - x * a) // b
    if n < y:
        continue
    ans += (comb(n, x) * comb(n, y)) % MOD
print(ans % MOD)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
4 1 2 5

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable MOD is initialized to 998244353.
The variables n, a, b, and k are initialized to 4, 1, 2, and 5, respectively.
The list fac is initialized to [1, 1, 2, 6].
The function comb(n, k) is defined to calculate the binomial coefficient C(n, k).
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the answer.

The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 3.
For each number x in this range, it calculates the number of ways to choose x elements from the set [0, 1, 2, 3] such that their sum is k.
The condition is met when k - x * a is divisible by b, which is true for x = 0 and x = 1.
The code then enters another loop that iterates from 0 to y (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 2.
For each number y in this range, it calculates the number of ways to choose y elements from the set [0, 1, 2, 3] such that their sum is k - x * a.
The condition is met when n is greater than or equal to y, which is true for y = 0 and y = 1.
The code then adds the product of the binomial coefficients C(n, x) and C(n, y) to ans.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans modulo MOD, which is 10.

The output of code execution is:
10
