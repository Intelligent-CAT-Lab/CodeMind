Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
N, K = map(int, input().split())
count = 0

for i in range(K + 1, N + 1):
    count += ((N + 1) // i) * (i - K) + max(0, (N + 1) % i - K)

if K == 0:
    count -= len(range(K + 1, N + 1))

print (count)
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
5 2

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable N and variable K are initialized to 5 and 2, respectively.
The variable count is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the count of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from K+1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 3 to 5.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the count of numbers that are divisible by i and are greater than or equal to K. It does this by dividing N+1 by i and rounding down to the nearest integer, which gives the number of times i divides N+1. It then multiplies this count by i minus K, and adds the maximum of 0 and (N+1) modulo i minus K. This is because if i divides N+1 exactly, then the count should be i minus K. If i does not divide N+1 exactly, then the count should be the maximum of 0 and (N+1) modulo i minus K.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if K is equal to 0. If it is, it subtracts the length of the range from K+1 to N from count. This is because if K is 0, then there are no numbers greater than or equal to K, so the count should be reduced by the number of numbers in this range.
Finally, the code prints the final value of count, which is 2.

The output of code execution is:
2
