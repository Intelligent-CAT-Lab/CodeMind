Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
r,g,b,n = map(int, raw_input().split())
mem = {}
def dfs(i, ais, tot):
	if tot < 0:
		return 0
	if i == len(ais):
		return 1 if tot == 0 else 0
	if i == len(ais) -1:
		return 1 if (tot >= 0 and tot % ais[i] == 0) else 0
	key = (i,tot)
	if key in mem:
		return mem[(i,tot)]
	nt = tot
	cumul = 0
	cumul += dfs(i + 1, ais, tot)
	while(tot>0):
		tot -= ais[i]
		cumul += dfs(i+1, ais, tot)
	mem[key] = cumul
	return cumul


print dfs(0,[r,g,b],n)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
1 2 3 4

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable r, g, b and n are initialized to 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively.
The variable mem is initialized as an empty dictionary, which will be used to store previously computed values.
The function dfs is defined, which takes three arguments: i, ais and tot.
The function first checks if the current sum tot is negative, in which case it returns 0.
If i is equal to the length of ais, it means we have considered all the numbers in ais and the sum is 0, so it returns 1.
If i is equal to the second last index of ais, it means we have considered all the numbers except the last one and the sum is divisible by the last number, so it returns 1.
Otherwise, it checks if the current state (i,tot) has been computed before, and if so, it returns the stored value.
Otherwise, it initializes a variable nt to tot, which will be used to accumulate the sum of all the possible combinations of numbers in ais.
It initializes a variable cumul to 0, which will be used to accumulate the number of possible combinations.
It then recursively calls the function dfs with i+1, ais and tot, and adds the result to cumul.
While tot is greater than 0, it subtracts the current number in ais from tot, and recursively calls the function dfs with i+1, ais and tot, and adds the result to cumul.
Finally, it stores the computed value in the dictionary mem and returns it.
The function dfs is called with i=0, ais=[r,g,b] and tot=n, which means we are considering all the numbers in ais and the sum is n.
The function returns the number of possible combinations of numbers in ais that add up to n.

The output of code execution is:
1
