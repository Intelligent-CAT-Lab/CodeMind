Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
n = int(raw_input()) + 1
n = bin(n)[3:]
ra = []
rb = []
c = 1
for i in n:
    ra.append(c)
    rb.append(c)
    c += 1
    if i == '1':
        ra = ra + [c]
        rb = [c] + rb
        c += 1
res = ra + rb
print len(res)
print''.join(map(str, res))

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
7

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable n is initialized to 7.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 6 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 6.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the binary representation of i and stores it in n.
The code then initializes two empty lists, ra and rb, which will be used to store the result.
The code also initializes a variable c to 1, which will be used to keep track of the current position in the result lists.
The code then enters another loop that iterates over the binary representation of i.
For each bit j in this loop, it appends c to both ra and rb.
If j is 1, it appends c to ra and [c] to rb, and increments c by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code appends the two lists ra and rb to each other, and stores the result in res.
The code then prints the length of res, which is 15.
Finally, the code prints the elements of res separated by spaces, which are: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15.

The output of code execution is:
15
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15
