Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84

Consider the following code: 

while True:
    n=int(input())
    if n == 0: break
    ss = [ input() for _ in range(n) ]
    ts = [ s for s in ss if all ( t.find(s) < 0 for t in ss if not (t == s)) ]
    m = len(ts)

    def overlap(c, d):
        sc = ts[c]
        sd = ts[d]
        s = len(sc)
        return max ( s - i for i in range(s+1) if sd.startswith(sc[i:]) )

    ov = [ [ overlap(c,d) for d in range(m) ] for c in range(m)]

    memo = [ [ -1 for _ in range(1<<m) ] for _ in range(m) ]
    # c : the tail city
    # cs : cities to be used (bit set)
    def rec(c, cs):
        if cs == 0: return 0
        if memo[c][cs] >= 0: return memo[c][cs]
        ans= max (ov[c][d] + rec(d, cs - (1<<d)) for d in range(n) if not (((1<<d) & cs) == 0))
        memo[c][cs] = ans
        return ans

    # naive version
    # c : the tail city
    # cs : cities to be used (set)
    # def rec(c, cs):
    #     if len(cs) == 0: return 0
    #     return max (overlap(c, d) + rec(d, cs - {d}) for d in cs)
    # maxov =  max ( rec(i, { j for j in range (m) if not (j == i) } ) for i in range (m) )

    maxov =  max ( rec(i, ((1<<m) - 1) - (1<<i) ) for i in range (m) )
    ans = sum (len(t) for t in ts) - maxov
    print(ans)


<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
3

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The code starts by initializing a while loop that will continue until the input is 0.

The first input is 3, which is the number of cities.

The next three inputs are:

```
1
123
456
789
```

These are the names of the cities.

The code then creates a list of strings `ss` containing the names of the cities.

The code then creates a list of strings `ts` containing the names of the cities that are not repeated.

In this case, `ts` contains only one city, which is "123".

The code then initializes a variable `m` to the length of `ts`, which is 1.

The code then creates a nested list `ov` of size `m` by `m`, where `ov[c][d]` is the length of the longest common substring of `ts[c]` and `ts[d]`.

In this case, `ov` is:

```
[[0]]
```

The code then initializes a nested list `memo` of size `m` by `1<<m`, where `memo[c][cs]` is the length of the longest path from `ts[c]` to a city in `ts` that uses only the cities in the bit set `cs`.

The code then defines a recursive function `rec` that takes two arguments: `c` and `cs`.

The function first checks if `cs` is empty, in which case it returns 0.

If `memo[c][cs]` is already computed, the function returns it.

Otherwise, the function computes the maximum length of the longest path from `ts[c]` to a city in `ts` that uses only the cities in the bit set `cs`.

To do this, the function iterates over all cities `d` in `ts` that are not in `cs`. For each city `d`, the function computes the length of the longest common substring of `ts[c]` and `ts[d]` using the `overlap` function, and adds it to the maximum length found so far.

The function then recursively calls itself with `d` and `cs - (1<<d)`, and adds the result to the maximum length found so far.

The function stores the result in `memo[c][cs]` and returns it.

The code then defines a naive version of the `rec` function, which takes two arguments: `c` and `cs`.

The function first checks if `cs` is empty, in which case it returns 0.

Otherwise, the function computes the maximum length of the longest path from `ts[c]` to a city in `ts` that uses only the cities in the set `cs`.

To do this, the function iterates over all cities `d` in `cs`, and for each city `d`, the function computes the length of the longest common substring of `ts[c]` and `ts[d]` using the `overlap` function, and adds it to the maximum length found so far.

The function then recursively calls itself with `d` and `cs - {d}`, and adds the result to the maximum length found so far.

The function returns the maximum length found so far.

The code then computes the maximum length of the longest path from each city in `ts` to any other city in `ts` that uses only the other cities in `ts`.

To do this, the code iterates over all cities `i` in `ts`, and for each city `i`, the code calls the `rec` function with `i` and `((1<<m) - 1) - (1<<i)`, which is a bit set containing all cities in `ts` except `i`.

The code then stores the maximum length of the longest path from each city in `ts` to any other city in `ts` that uses only the other cities in `ts` in a variable `maxov`.

The code then computes the answer by subtracting `maxov` from the sum of the lengths of all strings in `ts`, and prints it.

The output of code execution is:

```
6
```
