Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
def gcd(x, y):
	if y == 0:
		return x
	return gcd(y, x % y)
H,W,T=map(int, input().split())
gh, gw = gcd(H, T), gcd(W, T)
h, w = H // gh, W // gw
MOD = 1000000007
print(pow(pow(2, h, MOD) + pow(2, w, MOD) + pow(2, gcd(h, w), MOD) - 3, gh * gw, MOD))
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
2 2 1

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable H, W and T are initialized to 2, 2 and 1, respectively.
The function gcd(x, y) is defined to calculate the greatest common divisor of x and y using Euclid's algorithm.
The variables gh and gw are initialized to the greatest common divisor of H and T and the greatest common divisor of W and T, respectively.
The variables h and w are initialized to H divided by gh and W divided by gw, respectively.
The variable MOD is initialized to 1000000007.
The final value of the expression is calculated using the formula:

pow(pow(2, h, MOD) + pow(2, w, MOD) + pow(2, gcd(h, w), MOD) - 3, gh * gw, MOD)

The output of code execution is:
1
