The code imports the re module, which provides support for regular expressions.
The re.sub() function replaces all occurrences of "apple" or "peach" in the input string with the corresponding element of a list ["apple","peach"].
The lambda function takes a match object as input and returns the corresponding element of the list.
The input string is "the cost of one peach is higher than that of one apple."
The output of the code execution is:
the cost of one [peach] is higher than that of one [apple].
