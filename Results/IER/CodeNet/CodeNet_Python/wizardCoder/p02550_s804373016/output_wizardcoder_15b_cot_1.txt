Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
N,X,M = map(int,input().split())

List = [X]

for i in range(N-1):
    X = X**2 % M
    if X in List:
        #配列の何番目か
        num = i + 1
        #同じ数字
        key = List.index(X)
        break
    List.append(X)

ans = sum(List)
if len(List) == N:
    print(ans)

else:
    loop = (N - len(List)) // (num - key)
    add = (N - len(List)) % (num - key)

    ans += (N - len(List)) // (num - key) * sum(List[key:num])
    ans += sum(List[key:key+((N - len(List)) % (num - key))])

    print(ans)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
6 2 1001

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable N, variable X and variable M are initialized to 6, 2 and 1001, respectively.
The code creates a list called List and initializes it with the value of X.
The code then enters a loop that iterates N-1 times, meaning it will consider N-1 iterations.
For each iteration, the code calculates X to the power of 2 and takes the modulo M.
If X is already in the List, it means that X has already been seen before, and the loop breaks.
The code then calculates the number of iterations it took to get to the first occurrence of X in the List, which is num.
The code also calculates the index of the first occurrence of X in the List, which is key.
After the loop finishes, the code calculates the sum of all the elements in the List, which is ans.
If the length of the List is equal to N, it means that all the numbers in the range [1, N] have been seen before, and the code prints ans.
Otherwise, the code calculates the number of times it needs to loop to get to N, which is loop.
The code also calculates the number of additional elements to add to the sum, which is add.
The code then calculates the sum of the first add elements of the List, which is List[key:key+((N - len(List)) % (num - key))].
The code then calculates the sum of the remaining elements of the List, which is List[key:num].
The code then adds the two sums together and adds it to ans.
Finally, the code prints ans.

The output of code execution is:
10
