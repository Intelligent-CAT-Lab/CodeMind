The variable s is initialized to the input string "3776".
The variable is_good is initialized to True, which will be used to check if the string is good or not.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to len(s)-2 (inclusive), meaning it will consider all pairs of adjacent characters in the string.
For each pair of adjacent characters, it checks if they are equal. If they are, it sets is_good to False and breaks out of the loop.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if is_good is True or False. If it is True, it prints "Good". Otherwise, it prints "Bad".

The input string "3776" is not good because it contains adjacent equal characters. Therefore, the output of code execution is:
Bad
