Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
import sys
import heapq, math
from itertools import zip_longest, permutations, combinations, combinations_with_replacement
from itertools import accumulate, dropwhile, takewhile, groupby
from functools import lru_cache
from copy import deepcopy

W, A, B = map(int, input().split())

x = 0 if A <= B <= A + W or A <= B + W <= A + W or B <= A <= B + W or B <= A + W <= B + W else 1 << 28
y = abs(A - (B + W))
z = abs(B - (A + W))
print(min(x, y, z))
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
3 2 6

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable W, variable A and variable B are initialized to 3, 2 and 6, respectively.

The code then initializes three variables x, y and z to 0, abs(A - (B + W)), and abs(B - (A + W)), respectively.

The code then checks if any of the three variables x, y and z is less than or equal to 0. If any of them is, then the code prints 0.

If none of the three variables x, y and z is less than or equal to 0, then the code prints the minimum value among them, which is 0.

The output of code execution is:
0
END-OF-OUTPUT
