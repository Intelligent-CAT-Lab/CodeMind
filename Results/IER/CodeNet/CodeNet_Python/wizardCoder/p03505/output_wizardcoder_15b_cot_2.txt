Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
K, A, B = map(int, input().split())
if A <= B and K > A:
    print(-1)
elif A >= K:
    print(1)
else:
    print(1 - int(- (K-A) // (A-B))*2)
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
4000 2000 500

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable K, variable A and variable B are initialized to 4000, 2000 and 500, respectively.
The code checks if A is less than or equal to B and K is greater than A. If this condition is true, it prints -1.
If A is greater than or equal to K, it prints 1.
If neither of these conditions is true, it calculates the value of the expression 1 - int(- (K-A) // (A-B))*2.
The expression is calculated as follows:
- (K-A) // (A-B) is the number of times A can be subtracted from K without going below zero.
- int(- (K-A) // (A-B))*2 is the product of this number and 2.
- If this product is positive, it is added to 1 to get the final result.
- If this product is negative, it is subtracted from 1 to get the final result.

For example, if K=4000, A=2000, and B=500, the expression evaluates to -1.

The output of code execution is:
-1
