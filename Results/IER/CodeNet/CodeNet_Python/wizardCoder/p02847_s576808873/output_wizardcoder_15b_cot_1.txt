Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
i =input()

#SUN,MON,TUE,WED,THU,FRI,SAT 
  
if i == "SUN":
  print("7")
elif i == "MON":
  print("6")
elif i == "TUE":
  print("5")
elif i == "WED":
  print("4")
elif i == "THU":
  print("3")
elif i == "FRI":
  print("2")
else:
  print("1")

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
SAT

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable i is initialized to "SAT".
The code then checks if i is equal to "SUN". If it is, it prints "7".
If i is not equal to "SUN", the code checks if i is equal to "MON". If it is, it prints "6".
If i is not equal to "MON", the code checks if i is equal to "TUE". If it is, it prints "5".
If i is not equal to "TUE", the code checks if i is equal to "WED". If it is, it prints "4".
If i is not equal to "WED", the code checks if i is equal to "THU". If it is, it prints "3".
If i is not equal to "THU", the code checks if i is equal to "FRI". If it is, it prints "2".
If i is not equal to "FRI" or "SAT", the code prints "1".

The output of code execution is:
1
