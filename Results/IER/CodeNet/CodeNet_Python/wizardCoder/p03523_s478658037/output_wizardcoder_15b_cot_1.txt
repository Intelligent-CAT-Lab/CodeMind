Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
S = list(input())
N = len(S)
akiba = ['K','I','H','B','R']
flagA = True
i = 0
ia = 0
flag = True
while i < N:
    if i > 9:
        flag = False
        break
    if S[i] == 'A':
        if not(flagA) or (ia >= 1 and ia <= 2):
            flag = False
            break
        flagA = False
        i += 1
    else:
        flagA = True
        if ia > 4:
            flag = False
            break
        if S[i] == akiba[ia]:
            ia += 1
            i += 1
        else:
            flag = False
            break
if ia < 5:
    flag = False

if flag :
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')

    
    
#for i in range(2 ** 4):
    
    
    

 
    
    

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
KIHBR

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable S is initialized to the list of characters 'K', 'I', 'H', 'B', 'R'.
The variable N is initialized to the length of S, which is 5.
The variable akiba is initialized to the list of characters 'K', 'I', 'H', 'B', 'R'.
The variable flagA is initialized to True, which will be used to check if the previous character was 'A'.
The variable i is initialized to 0, which will be used as an index to iterate through S.
The variable ia is initialized to 0, which will be used to keep track of the number of 'A's encountered so far.
The variable flag is initialized to True, which will be used to check if the input is valid.

The code then enters a while loop that iterates while i is less than N.
Inside the loop, it checks if i is greater than 9. If it is, it sets flag to False and breaks out of the loop.
If i is less than or equal to 9, it checks if the current character is 'A'. If it is, it checks if flagA is False or if ia is between 1 and 2 (inclusive). If either of these conditions is true, it sets flag to False and breaks out of the loop. Otherwise, it sets flagA to False and increments i.
If the current character is not 'A', it sets flagA to True and checks if ia is greater than 4. If it is, it sets flag to False and breaks out of the loop.
If ia is less than or equal to 4, it checks if the current character is equal to the i-th character of akiba. If it is, it increments ia and i. If it is not, it sets flag to False and breaks out of the loop.
After the loop finishes, it checks if ia is less than 5. If it is, it sets flag to False.

Finally, if flag is True, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

The output of code execution is:
YES
