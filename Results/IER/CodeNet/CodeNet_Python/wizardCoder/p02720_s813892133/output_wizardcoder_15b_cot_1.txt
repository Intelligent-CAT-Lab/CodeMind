Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
K = int(input())
import sys
from queue import Queue
queue = Queue()
for i in range(1,10):
  queue.put(i)
if K <= 9:
  print(K)
  sys.exit()
count = 0
while True:
  j = queue.get()
  count += 1
  if count == K:
    print(j)
    break
  if j % 10!= 0:
    queue.put(10*j+(j%10)-1)
  queue.put(10*j+(j%10))
  if j % 10!= 9:
    queue.put(10*j+(j%10)+1)
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
15

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable K is initialized to 15.
The code imports the sys module and the queue module.
A queue is created and initialized with numbers from 1 to 9.
If K is less than or equal to 9, the code prints K and exits the program.
Otherwise, the code initializes a count variable to 0 and enters a while loop.
The loop continues until the count reaches K.
Inside the loop, the code retrieves the first number from the queue (which is 1) and increments the count.
If the count is equal to K, the code prints the retrieved number and exits the loop.
Otherwise, the code checks if the retrieved number has a digit other than 0 or 9. If it does, the code puts the number obtained by multiplying the retrieved number by 10, adding the digit minus 1, and adding it back to the queue.
The code then puts the number obtained by multiplying the retrieved number by 10, adding the digit, and adding it back to the queue.
If the retrieved number has a digit other than 9, the code puts the number obtained by multiplying the retrieved number by 10, adding the digit plus 1, and adding it back to the queue.
The loop continues until the count reaches K or the queue is empty.

The output of code execution is:
15
