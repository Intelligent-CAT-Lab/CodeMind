Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
2 2 2

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable N, M, and K are initialized to 2, 2, and 2, respectively.
The function e_cell_distance is called with these variables.
The function e_cell_distance defines a class Combination, which is used to calculate combinations.
The class Combination has a method combination, which calculates the number of combinations of N choose K.
The function e_cell_distance then calculates the sum of the distances of the cells from the center of the grid.
The function e_cell_distance returns the product of the number of combinations and the sum of distances.
The function e_cell_distance is called with N=2, M=2, and K=2.
The function e_cell_distance calculates the number of combinations of 2 choose 2, which is 2.
The function e_cell_distance calculates the sum of the distances of the cells from the center of the grid.
The sum of the distances of the cells from the center of the grid is 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 20.
The function e_cell_distance returns the product of the number of combinations and the sum of distances, which is 2 * 20 = 40.
The function e_cell_distance returns 40.
The output of code execution is:
40
