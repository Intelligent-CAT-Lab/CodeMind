The variable a and variable b are initialized to -13 and 3, respectively.
The code checks if the sum of a and b is greater than or equal to the difference between a and b, and if it is, it prints the sum of a and b.
The condition is met when a+b is 2, which is not the case for the given input.
The code then checks if the difference between a and b is greater than or equal to the sum of a and b, and if it is, it prints the difference between a and b.
The condition is met when a-b is 2, which is not the case for the given input.
Finally, the code checks if the product of a and b is greater than or equal to the sum of a and b and the difference between a and b, and if it is, it prints the product of a and b.
The condition is met when a*b is 2, which is not the case for the given input.
Therefore, the output of code execution is:
-13
