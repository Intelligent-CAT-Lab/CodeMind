Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
import math
A,B,H,M=map(int,input().split())
h=30*H+M/2
m=6*M
y=abs(h-m)
x_2=A*A+B*B-2*A*B*(math.cos(math.radians(y)))
x=x_2**(0.5)
print(x)
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
3 4 9 0

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable A, variable B, variable H and variable M are initialized to 3, 4, 9 and 0, respectively.
The variable h is calculated as 30*H+M/2, which is 270+0=270.
The variable m is calculated as 6*M, which is 6*0=0.
The variable y is calculated as the absolute difference between h and m, which is abs(270-0)=270.
The variable x_2 is calculated as A*A+B*B-2*A*B*(cos(radians(y))), where cos(radians(y)) is the cosine of y in radians.
The variable x is calculated as the square root of x_2, which is x_2**(0.5), which is 5.0.
The code then prints the final value of x, which is 5.0.

The output of code execution is:
5.0
