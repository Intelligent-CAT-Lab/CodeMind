Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
import sys
from math import log2, floor

L = int(sys.stdin.readline().rstrip())

def main():
    n = floor(log2(L)) + 1
    m = 2 * (n - 1)
    edges = []
    for i in range(1, n):
        edges.append((i, i+1, 0))
        edges.append((i, i+1, 2**(i-1)))
    
    cur = 2 ** (n - 1)
    q = L - cur
    for i in range(1, n):
        q, r = divmod(q, 2)
        if not r:
            continue
        else:
            edges.append((i, n, cur))
            cur += 2 ** (i - 1)
            m += 1
    
    yield (n, m)
    for e in edges:
        yield e

if __name__ == '__main__':
    ans = main()
    for i in ans:
        print(*i, sep=' ')
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
4

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable L is initialized to 4.
The code then imports the math module and the sys module.
The code defines a function called main().
The function first calculates the number of levels n and the number of edges m required to represent the binary tree.
The function then initializes an empty list called edges, which will be used to store the edges of the binary tree.
The function then adds the first two edges to the list, which are the root and the left child of the root.
The function then calculates the current level of the binary tree, which is 2^(n-1).
The function then calculates the number of nodes in the last level, which is L - cur.
The function then iterates over the levels of the binary tree, starting from the second level.
For each level, the function calculates the number of nodes in the level and the number of nodes in the previous level.
If the number of nodes in the current level is greater than 0, the function adds an edge to the list, which is the last node in the previous level and the first node in the current level.
The function then updates the current level to be the next level and the number of nodes in the last level to be the remainder of the division of q by 2.
If the remainder is 0, the function continues to the next level.
If the remainder is not 0, the function adds an edge to the list, which is the last node in the previous level and the last node in the binary tree.
The function then increments the number of edges m by 1.
The function then yields the number of levels and the number of edges.
The function then yields each edge in the list.
The code then checks if the code is being run as the main program.
If it is, the code calls the main function and stores the result in a variable called ans.
The code then iterates over the elements in ans and prints them separated by spaces.
The output of code execution is:
2 3 0 2
2 1 1 0
2 1 1 2
