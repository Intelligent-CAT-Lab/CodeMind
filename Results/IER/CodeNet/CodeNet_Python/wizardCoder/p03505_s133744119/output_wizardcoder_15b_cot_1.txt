Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
# coding:utf-8

K, A, B = map(int, raw_input().split())
if K <=A:
    print 1

elif A <= B:
    print -1
else:
    x = (K-B-1)/(A-B)+1
    print 2*x-1
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
4000 2000 500

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable K, variable A and variable B are initialized to 4000, 2000 and 500, respectively.
The code checks if K is less than or equal to A. Since K is 4000 and A is 2000, the condition is met and the code prints 1.

The code then checks if A is less than or equal to B. Since A is 2000 and B is 500, the condition is not met and the code proceeds to the next condition.

The code calculates the value of x as follows:

x = (K-B-1)/(A-B)+1

Since K is 4000, B is 500 and A is 2000, the value of x is calculated as follows:

x = (4000-500-1)/(2000-500)+1

x = 1000/500+1

x = 2

Therefore, the code prints 2.

The output of code execution is:
2
