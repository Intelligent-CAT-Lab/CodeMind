Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
n=[int(_) for _ in list(input())]
l=len(n)
if l==1:
    print(n[0])
elif n[0]!=9:
    if len(set(n[1:]))==1 and n[1]==9:
        print(n[0]+9*(l-1))
    else:
        print(n[0]-1+9*(l-1))
else:
    if len(set(n))==1:
        print(9*l)
    else:
        print(9*(l-1)+8)
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
100

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable n is initialized to a list of integers obtained by reading the input as a string and converting each character to an integer using a list comprehension.
The variable l is initialized to the length of the list n.

If l is equal to 1, then the code prints the only element of the list n.

Otherwise, if the first element of the list n is not equal to 9, then the code checks if the remaining elements of the list n have only one distinct element and if that element is equal to 9. If both conditions are met, then the code prints the sum of the first element and 9 multiplied by the length of the list n minus 1. Otherwise, the code prints the sum of the first element minus 1 and 9 multiplied by the length of the list n minus 1.

If the first element of the list n is equal to 9, then the code checks if all elements of the list n have the same value. If they do, then the code prints 9 multiplied by the length of the list n. Otherwise, the code prints 9 multiplied by the length of the list n minus 1 plus 8.

The output of code execution is:
100
