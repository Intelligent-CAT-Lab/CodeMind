The variable k is initialized to 101.
The code checks if k % 10 is equal to any of the values in the list [0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8]. Since k % 10 is 1, the code enters the first if statement.
The code calculates the value of tmp as k * 7, which is 707.
The code initializes the variable ans to 1, which will be used to count the number of iterations.
The code enters a while loop that will continue until the condition is met or the maximum number of iterations is reached.
The code checks if the string representation of tmp contains 7 as many times as its length. If it does, the code prints the value of ans plus the length of the string representation of tmp minus 1, which is 1 in this case.
