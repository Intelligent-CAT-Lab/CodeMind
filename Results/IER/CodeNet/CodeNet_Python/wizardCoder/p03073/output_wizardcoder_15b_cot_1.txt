Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
import sys
def LI(): return [int(x) for x in sys.stdin.readline().split()]
def II(): return int(sys.stdin.readline())
def LS(): return sys.stdin.readline().split()
sys.setrecursionlimit(10**7)
INF = 10 ** 18
MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7
def LI_(): return [int(x) - 1 for x in sys.stdin.readline().split()]
def LF(): return [float(x) for x in sys.stdin.readline().split()]
def SI(): return input()
YN = lambda b: print('YES') if b else print('NO')
yn = lambda b: print('Yes') if b else print('No')

S = SI().strip()

N = len(S)

zero_start = 0
zero_start_counter = 0
for i in range(N):
    if not zero_start == int(S[i]):
        zero_start_counter += 1
    zero_start = (zero_start+1)%2

one_start_counter = N - zero_start_counter

print(min(zero_start_counter, one_start_counter))

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
000

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable S is initialized to "000".

The variable N is initialized to the length of S, which is 3.

The variable zero_start is initialized to 0, which will be used to keep track of the current start of the zeros.

The variable zero_start_counter is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of zeros in the string.

The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to N-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider the first three characters of the string.

For each character i in this range, it checks if the current character is different from zero_start. If it is, it increments zero_start_counter by 1. It also updates zero_start to be the next character in the string (which is either 0 or 1).

After the loop finishes, the code calculates the number of zeros and ones in the string by subtracting zero_start_counter from N and adding one_start_counter.

The code then prints the minimum of these two values, which is 1 in this case.

The output of code execution is:
1
