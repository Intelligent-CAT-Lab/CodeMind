The code is a lambda function that takes an input string and returns the number of times the characters 'WB' and 'BW' appear in the string. The input string is 'BBBWW'.

The lambda function is defined as:

```python
(lambda x:x.count('WB')+x.count('BW'))
```

The lambda function takes an input string 'x' and returns the number of times the characters 'WB' and 'BW' appear in the string.

The lambda function is then called with the input string 'BBBWW' as an argument:

```python
(lambda x:x.count('WB')+x.count('BW'))('BBBWW')
```

The output of the lambda function is 2, which is the number of times the characters 'WB' and 'BW' appear in the input string 'BBBWW'.

The final output of the code execution is:

```python
2
```
