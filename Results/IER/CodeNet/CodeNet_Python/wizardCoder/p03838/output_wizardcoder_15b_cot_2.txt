Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
x, y = map(int, input().split())
abs_x = abs(x)
abs_y = abs(y)

if 0 <= x < y:
    print (y - x)
    exit()
if 0 < y < x:
    print (x - y + 2)
    exit()
if y == 0 and 0 < x:
    print (x + 1)
    exit()

if x < y <= 0:
    print (y - x)
    exit()
if y < x < 0:
    print (x - y + 2)
    exit()
if x == 0 and y < 0:
    print (abs_y + 1)
    
if x < 0  < y:
    print (abs(abs_y - abs_x) + 1)
    exit()
if y < 0 < x:
    print (abs(abs_y - abs_x) + 1)
    exit()



<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
10 20

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable x and variable y are initialized to 10 and 20, respectively.
The code then calculates the absolute values of x and y and stores them in abs_x and abs_y, respectively.

The code then checks the following conditions in order:
1. If 0 <= x < y, it prints (y - x) and exits the program.
2. If 0 < y < x, it prints (x - y + 2) and exits the program.
3. If y == 0 and 0 < x, it prints (x + 1) and exits the program.
4. If x < y <= 0, it prints (y - x) and exits the program.
5. If y < x < 0, it prints (x - y + 2) and exits the program.
6. If x == 0 and y < 0, it prints (abs_y + 1) and exits the program.
7. If x < 0  < y, it prints (abs(abs_y - abs_x) + 1) and exits the program.
8. If y < 0 < x, it prints (abs(abs_y - abs_x) + 1) and exits the program.

The first condition is met when x is 10 and y is 20, so the code prints (20 - 10) = 10 and exits.

The output of code execution is:
10
