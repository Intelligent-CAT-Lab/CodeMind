The variable N and variable L are initialized to 5 and 2, respectively.
The list A is initialized as an empty list.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 5.
For each number i in this range, it appends L+i-1 to the list A.
The code then checks the conditions for the list A.

If L < 0 and 0 not in A:
The condition is met because L is negative and 0 is not in A. Therefore, the last element of A is removed and the sum of the remaining elements is printed. In this case, the last element of A is 4, so the sum of the remaining elements is 1+2+3+4=10. Therefore, the output of code execution is:

10
