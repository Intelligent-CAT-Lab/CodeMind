Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
# https://qiita.com/_-_-_-_-_/items/34f933adc7be875e61d0
# abcde	s=input()	s='abcde'
# abcde	s=list(input())	s=['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
# 5(1つだけ)	a=int(input())	a=5
# 1 2	x,y = map(int,input().split())	x=1,y=2
# 1 2 3 4 5... n 　	li = input().split()	li=['1','2','3',...,'n']
# 1 2 3 4 5... n 　	li = list(map(int,input().split()))	li=[1,2,3,4,5,...,n]
# FFFTFTTFF 　	li = input().split('T')	li=['FFF', 'F', '', 'FF']

# INPUT
# 3
# hoge
# foo
# bar
# ANSWER
# n=int(input())
# string_list=[input() for i in range(n)]

def inpl(): return list(map(int, input().split()))

#### START
S = input()

new_S = ""
for s in S:
  if s == "9":
    new_S = new_S + "1"
  elif s == "1":
    new_S = new_S + "9"
  else:
    new_S = new_S + s

print(new_S)
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
119

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable S is initialized to "119".

The code then enters a loop that iterates over each character s in S.

If s is equal to "9", the code replaces it with "1" and appends it to the new string new_S.

If s is equal to "1", the code replaces it with "9" and appends it to the new string new_S.

If s is neither "9" nor "1", the code simply appends it to the new string new_S.

After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of new_S, which is "1991".

The output of code execution is:
1991
END-OF-OUTPUT
