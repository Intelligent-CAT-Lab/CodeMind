Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
n, m = list(map(int, input().split()))

MAX = 2*10**5+1
MOD = 10**9+7
fact = [0 for i in range(MAX)]
inv = [0 for i in range(MAX)]
invfact = [0 for i in range(MAX)]

def comb_build(n):
  fact[0] = inv[0] = invfact[0] = 1
  fact[1] = inv[1] = invfact[1] = 1
  for i in range(2, n):
    fact[i] = fact[i-1]*i%MOD
    inv[i] = inv[MOD%i]*(MOD-MOD//i)%MOD
    invfact[i] = invfact[i-1]*inv[i]%MOD

def nCk(n, k):
  if n<k or n<0 or k<0:
    return 0
  return (((fact[n]*invfact[k])%MOD)*invfact[n-k])%MOD

def prime_factor(n):
  from collections import defaultdict
  ret = defaultdict(int)
  for i in range(2, int(n**(1/2))+10):
    while n%i==0:
      ret[i] += 1
      n //= i
  if n!=1:
    ret[n] = 1
  return ret

comb_build(MAX)
ans = 1
for e in prime_factor(m).values():
  ans *= nCk(e+n-1, e)%MOD
print(ans%MOD)
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
2 6

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
