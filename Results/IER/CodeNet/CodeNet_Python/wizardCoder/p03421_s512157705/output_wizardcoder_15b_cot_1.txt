Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
def solve():
    if A + B - 1 <= N and N <= A * B:
        if A == 1:
            return [i for i in range(N, 0, -1)]
        s = []
        q = (N - B) // (A - 1)
        r = (N - B) % (A - 1)
        if r == 0:
            q -= 1
            r = A - 1
        for i in range(B - q - 1):
            s.append(N - i)
        for i in range(r + 1):
            s.append(A * q + 1 + i)
        for i in range(q - 1, -1, -1):
            for j in range(A):
                s.append(A * i + j + 1)
        return s
    else:
        return [-1]
print(" ".join(map(str, solve())))

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
5 3 2

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 5, 3 and 2, respectively.

The function solve() is defined to solve the problem.

The first condition checks if A + B - 1 <= N and N <= A * B. If this condition is not met, the function returns [-1].

If the first condition is met, the function proceeds to calculate the sequence of numbers that meet the condition.

The variable s is initialized to an empty list, which will be used to store the sequence of numbers.

The variable q is calculated as (N - B) // (A - 1), which is 1 in this case.

The variable r is calculated as (N - B) % (A - 1), which is 1 in this case.

If r is 0, the variable q is decremented by 1 and r is set to A - 1.

The function then appends the numbers from N to B - q - 1 to the list s.

The function then appends the numbers from A * q + 1 to A * q + r to the list s.

The function then appends the numbers from A * (q - 1) + 1 to A * 0 + r to the list s.

Finally, the function returns the list s as the output.

The code then calls the function solve() and prints the output as a space-separated string using the map() and join() functions.

The output of code execution is:
1 2 3 4 5
