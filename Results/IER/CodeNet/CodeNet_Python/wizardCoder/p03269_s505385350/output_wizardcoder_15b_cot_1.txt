Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
L=int(input())
s=bin(L)[2:]
l=len(s)-1
ans=[]
for i in range(l):
    ans.append([i+1,i+2,2**(l-i-1)])
    ans.append([i+1,i+2,0])
u=2**(l)
for k in range(1,l+1):
    if s[k]!='0':
        ans.append([1,k+1,u])
        u+=2**(l-k) 
        #print(k+1,l)
print(l+1,len(ans))
for a,b,c in ans:
    print(a,b,c)
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
4

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable L is initialized to 4.
The binary representation of L is obtained by converting L to a binary string using the bin() function and then slicing it to remove the '0b' prefix.
The length of the binary string is obtained by subtracting 1 from the length of the string.
The variable ans is initialized to an empty list.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to l-1, meaning it will consider all the bits of the binary string except the last one.
For each bit i, the code appends a tuple (i+1, i+2, 2**(l-i-1)) to ans, which means that the current bit is 1, the next bit is 0, and the value of the current bit is 2**(l-i-1).
The code also appends a tuple (i+1, i+2, 0) to ans, which means that the current bit is 1, the next bit is 0, and the value of the current bit is 0.
After the loop finishes, the code initializes the variable u to 2**(l), which is the maximum value that can be represented by the binary string.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to l, meaning it will consider all the bits of the binary string.
For each bit k, the code checks if the k-th bit of the binary string is 1. If it is, the code appends a tuple (1, k+1, u) to ans, which means that the current bit is 0, the next bit is 1, and the value of the current bit is u.
The code also updates the value of u by adding 2**(l-k) to it.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the length of the binary string plus 1 (to account for the extra bit), and the length of the list ans.
Finally, the code prints each tuple in ans on a separate line, separated by spaces.

The output of code execution is:
5 10
1 2 1
1 3 2
1 4 4
1 5 8
2 3 2
2 4 4
2 5 8
3 4 4
3 5 8
4 5 8
