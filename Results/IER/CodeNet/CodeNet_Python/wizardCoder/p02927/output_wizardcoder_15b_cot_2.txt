Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
m,d = map(int,input().split())
ans = 0
for i in range(22,d+1):
  d0 = i%10
  d1 = int(i/10)
  if d0 == 1 or d0 == 0:
    continue
  if m >= d0 * d1:
    ans += 1
    #print(i)
print(ans)
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
15 40

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable m and variable d are initialized to 15 and 40, respectively.
variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the number of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 22 to d (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 22 to 40.
For each number i in this range, it extracts the last digit d0 and the remaining digits d1.
The code checks if m is greater than or equal to d0 * d1. If it is, it increments ans by 1. The condition is met when i is 22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 10.

The output of code execution is:
10
END-OF-OUTPUT
