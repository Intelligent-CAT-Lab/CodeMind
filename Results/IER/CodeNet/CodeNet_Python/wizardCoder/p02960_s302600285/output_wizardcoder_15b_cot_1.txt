Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.readline

    mod = 10**9 + 7

    s = input().rstrip()
    n = len(s)
    dp = [[0]*13 for _ in range(n)]

    if s[-1]=='?':
        for i in range(10):
            dp[0][i] = 1
    else:
        a = int(s[-1])
        dp[0][a] = 1

    a = 1
    for i in range(1, n):
        a = 10 * a % 13
        if s[-(i+1)] == '?':
            for j in range(10):
                for k in range(13):
                    dp[i][(a*j+k)%13] += dp[i-1][k] % mod
        else:
            j = int(s[-(i+1)])
            for k in range(13):
                dp[i][(a*j+k)%13] += dp[i-1][k] % mod
    print(dp[-1][5]%mod)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
??2??5

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The code is a solution to the problem of finding the number of strings of length n that can be formed using the digits 0-9 and the characters '?' (which can represent any digit). The problem can be solved using dynamic programming.

The code first reads the input string s and its length n. It then initializes a 2D array dp of size (n x 13), where dp[i][j] represents the number of strings of length i that can be formed using the digits 0-9 and the characters '?' up to the j-th character of s.

The base case is when i=0, which means that we have to form a string of length 0 using the characters '?' up to the j-th character of s. In this case, we can only form a string of length 0 if the j-th character of s is '?'. Otherwise, we can only form a string of length 0 if the j-th character of s is a digit. In this case, we can only form a string of length 0 if j=5 (since we have to use the character '5' to form a string of length 0). Therefore, dp[0][5] = 1 if s[-1]=='?' else 0.

The recursive case is when i>0. We start by initializing a variable a to 1, which will be used to calculate the next digit of the string. We then iterate over the digits 0-9 and the characters '?' using a loop. For each digit or character, we calculate the next digit of the string by multiplying a by the current digit or character and taking the modulo 13. We then iterate over the previous digits or characters of the string using another loop and add the number of strings of length i-1 that can be formed using the previous digits or characters and the current digit or character to dp[i][(a*j+k)%13].

Finally, the code prints the number of strings of length n that can be formed using the digits 0-9 and the characters '?' up to the j-th character of s, which is dp[-1][5].

The input string is "??2??5", which means that we can form the following strings using the digits 0-9 and the characters '?' up to the j-th character of s:

- "5"
- "25"
- "225"
- "2225"
- "22225"
- "222225"
- "2222225"
- "22222225"
- "222222225"
- "2222222225"

Therefore, the output of code execution is:

10
