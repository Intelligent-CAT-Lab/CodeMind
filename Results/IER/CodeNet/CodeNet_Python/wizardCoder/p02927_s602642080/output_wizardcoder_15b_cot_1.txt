Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
def solve():
  M, D = map(int, input().split())
  ans = 0
  for i in range(12,D+1):
    a,b = int(str(i)[0]),int(str(i)[1])
    if a>1 and b>1:
      if a*b<=M:
        ans += 1
  return ans
print(solve())
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
15 40

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable M and variable D are initialized to 15 and 40, respectively.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the number of integers between 12 and D (inclusive) that satisfy the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 12 to D (inclusive), meaning it will consider integers from 12 to 40.
For each integer i in this range, it extracts the first and second digits of i and stores them in variables a and b.
The code checks if a and b are both greater than 1, which is the condition for integers that satisfy the condition.
If a and b are both greater than 1, the code checks if a*b is less than or equal to M, which is the condition for integers that satisfy the condition.
If a*b is less than or equal to M, the code increments ans by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of ans, which is 10.

The output of code execution is:
10
