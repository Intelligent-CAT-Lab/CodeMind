Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
i = list(map(int, input().split()))

if i[2] + i[4] <= i[0]:
    if i[2] - i[4] >= 0:
        if i[3] + i[4] <= i[1]:
            if i[3] - i[4] >= 0:
                print("Yes")
            else:
                print("No")
        else:
            print("No")
    else:
        print("No")
else:
    print("No")

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
5 4 2 2 1

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable i is initialized to a list of integers, which is obtained by splitting the input string by space and converting each substring to an integer using the map function.

The code then enters a series of if-else statements to check if the given conditions are met. The first condition checks if the sum of the third and fifth elements of the list is less than or equal to the first element. The second condition checks if the difference between the third and fifth elements is greater than or equal to zero. The third condition checks if the sum of the fourth and fifth elements is less than or equal to the second element. The fourth condition checks if the difference between the fourth and fifth elements is greater than or equal to zero.

If all four conditions are met, the code prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".

The input given is "5 4 2 2 1", which corresponds to the list [5, 4, 2, 2, 1].

The output of code execution is:
Yes
END-OF-OUTPUT
