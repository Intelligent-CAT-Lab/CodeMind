Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
n, a, b, k = map(int, input().split())
m = n // 2 + 1
mod = 998244353
comb = [1] * m
for i in range(1, m):
    comb[i] = comb[i - 1] * (n + 1 - i) * pow(i, mod - 2, mod)
    comb[i] %= mod
ans = 0
for i in range(n + 1):
    if a * i > k:
        break
    j = k - a * i
    if j % b == 0:
        j //= b
        if 0 <= j <= n:
            i, j = min(i, n - i), min(j, n - j)
            ans += comb[i] * comb[j]
            ans %= mod
print(ans)
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
4 1 2 5

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable n, variable a, variable b and variable k are initialized to 4, 1, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable m is initialized to n // 2 + 1, which is 3 in this case.
variable mod is initialized to 998244353.
variable comb is initialized to a list of length m, with all elements initialized to 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to m-1, meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 2.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the binomial coefficient (n+1-i) * i^mod-2 mod mod, and stores it in comb[i].
After the loop finishes, the code enters another loop that iterates from 0 to n, meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 3.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of the binomial coefficients of all pairs of numbers (j, k) such that j+k=i and j is even and k is odd.
The condition is met when j+k=i and j is even and k is odd, which is the case when j=0,2,4 and k=1,3,5.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 10.


The output of code execution is:
10
