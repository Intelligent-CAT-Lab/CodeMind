Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
def make_divisors(n):
    divisors = []
    for i in range(1, int(n**0.5)+1):
        if n % i == 0:
            divisors.append(i)
            if i!= n // i:
                divisors.append(n//i)

    # divisors.sort()
    return divisors

def main():
    N, M = map(int, input().split())
    MN = M/N
    divisor = make_divisors(M)
    max_gcd = 0
    for d in divisor:
        if (d<=MN) and (d>=max_gcd):
            max_gcd = d
    print(max_gcd)
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
3 14

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable N and variable M are initialized to 3 and 14, respectively.
The variable MN is calculated as M/N, which is 4.0.
The function make_divisors is called with M as its argument.
The function make_divisors creates a list of divisors of M, which are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 11, 14.
The function then loops through the list of divisors and checks if each divisor is less than or equal to MN and greater than or equal to the current maximum value of max_gcd. If it is, the current divisor becomes the new maximum value of max_gcd.
After the loop finishes, the function returns the final value of max_gcd, which is 4.

The main function is called with N and M as its arguments.
The main function calls the make_divisors function with M as its argument.
The main function then calculates the value of max_gcd as described above.
The main function prints the final value of max_gcd, which is 4.

The output of code execution is:
4
