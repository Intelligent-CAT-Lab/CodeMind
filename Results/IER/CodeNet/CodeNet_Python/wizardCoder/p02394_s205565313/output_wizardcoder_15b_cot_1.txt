Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
i = list(map(int, input().split()))
def in_retangle(w,h,x,y,r):
    if r<=y and y<=h-r and r<=x and x<=w-r:
        print("Yes")
    else:
        print("No")
    
in_retangle(i[0],i[1],i[2],i[3],i[4])

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
5 4 2 2 1

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable i is initialized to a list of integers, which is obtained by splitting the input string using the map function and the input() function. The list contains the values 5, 4, 2, 2, and 1.

The function in_retangle is defined that takes in the values of w, h, x, y, and r. The function checks if the point (x,y) is within a rectangle with width w, height h, and radius r. If the condition is met, the function prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".

The function is called with the values of i[0], i[1], i[2], i[3], and i[4]. The function is called with the values 5, 4, 2, 2, and 1, respectively.

The output of code execution is:
Yes
END-OF-OUTPUT
