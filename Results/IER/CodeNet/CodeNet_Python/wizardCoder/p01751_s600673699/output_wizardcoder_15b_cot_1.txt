Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
import sys
A,B,C = map(int,input().split())
time = 0
ss = set()
while True:
    if time%60 == C:
        print(time)
        sys.exit()
    for t in range(A):
        time += 1
        if time%60 == C:
            print(time)
            sys.exit()
    time += B
    if (time%60) in ss:
        break
    ss.add(time%60)
print(-1)
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
10 10 5

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable A, variable B and variable C are initialized to 10, 10 and 5, respectively.
variable time is initialized to 0, which will be used to keep track of the current time.
variable ss is initialized to an empty set, which will be used to keep track of the times that have already passed C.
The code enters an infinite loop, which will continue until the program is terminated.
Inside the loop, the code checks if the current time (time%60) is equal to C. If it is, the code prints the current time and exits the program.
The code then enters another loop that iterates A times, meaning it will wait for A minutes before checking if the current time is equal to C again.
Inside this loop, the code increments the current time by 1 minute. If the current time is equal to C, the code prints the current time and exits the program.
After the inner loop finishes, the code increments the current time by B minutes.
The code then checks if the current time (time%60) is already in the set ss. If it is, the code breaks out of the loop and prints -1.
If the current time is not in the set ss, the code adds it to the set and continues with the loop.

The output of code execution is:
55
END-OF-OUTPUT
