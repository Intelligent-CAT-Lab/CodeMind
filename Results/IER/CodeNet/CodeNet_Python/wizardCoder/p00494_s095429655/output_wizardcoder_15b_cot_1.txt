Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
S=raw_input()
N=len(S)
k=0
i=0
while i<N:
    cntj,cnto,cnti=0,0,0
    while i<N and S[i]=="J":
        cntj+=1
        i+=1
    while i<N and S[i]=="O":
        cnto+=1
        i+=1
    while i<N and S[i]=="I":
        cnti+=1
        i+=1
    if cntj>=cnto and cnti>=cnto:
        k=max(cnto,k)
print k
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
OJJOOIIOJOI

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable S is initialized to "OJJOOIIOJOI".
The variable N is initialized to the length of S, which is 12.
The variable k is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the maximum number of consecutive "O"s and "I"s.
The variable i is initialized to 0, which will be used to iterate through the string S.

The code enters a while loop that continues as long as i is less than N.
Inside the loop, three variables cntj, cnto, and cnti are initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of consecutive "J", "O", and "I"s, respectively.
The code enters three while loops that continue as long as i is less than N and the current character at position i is "J", "O", or "I", respectively.
Inside each of these loops, the corresponding count variable is incremented and i is incremented.
After the three while loops finish, the code checks if cntj is greater than or equal to cnto and cnti is greater than or equal to cnto. If this condition is met, it updates the value of k to the maximum of cnto and k.

After the while loop finishes, the code prints the final value of k, which is 3.

The output of code execution is:
3
END-OF-OUTPUT
