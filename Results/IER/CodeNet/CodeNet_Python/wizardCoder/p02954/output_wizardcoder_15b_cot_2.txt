Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
s = str(input())
n = len(s)
rc = 0
lc = 0
p = 0
state = 1 #1がR、0がL
ans = [0] * n
for i in range(n):
  #print(ans, rc, lc, p)
  if state:
    if s[i] == "R":
      rc += 1
      if s[i+1] == "L":
        ans[i] += (rc+1)//2
        ans[i+1] += rc//2
        state = 0
        p = i
        rc = 0
  else:
    if s[i] == "L":
      lc += 1
      if i == n-1 or s[i+1] == "R":
        ans[p+1] += (lc+1)//2
        ans[p] += lc//2
        state = 1
        lc = 0
print(" ".join(map(str,ans)))
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
RRLRL

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable s is initialized to "RRLRL".
The variable n is initialized to 5.
The variables rc and lc are initialized to 0.
The variable p is initialized to 0.
The variable state is initialized to 1.
The variable ans is initialized to a list of zeros with length n.

The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n-1.
For each index i in this range, it checks the current state of the string s.
If state is 1, it means that the current character is "R".
In this case, it increments rc by 1 and checks the next character.
If the next character is "L", it means that the current substring "RL" is balanced.
In this case, it calculates the number of pairs of "RL" and adds it to ans[i] and ans[i+1], respectively.
It then switches the state to 0 and sets p to i.
It also resets rc to 0.
If state is 0, it means that the current character is "L".
In this case, it increments lc by 1 and checks the next character.
If the next character is "R" or it is the last character of the string, it means that the current substring "LR" is balanced.
In this case, it calculates the number of pairs of "LR" and adds it to ans[p+1] and ans[p], respectively.
It then switches the state to 1 and sets lc to 0.

After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is "0 1 1 2 2".

The output of code execution is:
0 1 1 2 2
