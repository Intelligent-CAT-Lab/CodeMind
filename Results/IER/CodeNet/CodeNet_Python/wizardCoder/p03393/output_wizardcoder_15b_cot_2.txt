Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84

    for i in range(26):
        tmp = chr(i + ord('a'))
        if not tmp in s:
            print(s + tmp)
            exit()
else:
    for i in reversed(range(26)):
        for j in range(ord(s[i]) + 1, ord('z') + 1):
            if not chr(j) in s[:i]:
                print(s[:i] + chr(j))
                exit()
    print(-1)
    exit()
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
atcoder

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The code first imports the necessary modules and sets the recursion limit to 10^9.

The code then reads a string s from the input.

The code checks if the length of s is less than 26. If it is, it checks if each lowercase letter is present in s. If it is not, it appends the missing letter to s and prints it. If all 26 letters are present, it prints -1.

If the length of s is greater than or equal to 26, the code checks if each lowercase letter is present in s. If it is not, it checks if there is a letter that can be appended to s without violating the alphabetical order. If there is, it appends the missing letter to s and prints it. If there is no such letter, it prints -1.

The output of code execution is:
atcoder
END-OF-OUTPUT
