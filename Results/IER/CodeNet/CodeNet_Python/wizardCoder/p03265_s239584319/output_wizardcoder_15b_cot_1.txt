Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
import numpy as np
x1,y1,x2,y2=[int(a) for a in input().split()]
p1 = np.array([x1,y1])
p2 = np.array([x2,y2])
v1 = p2-p1
v2 = np.array([-v1[1],v1[0]])
p3 = p2+v2
p4 = p3+(-v1)
print(" ".join([str(v) for v in list(p3)+list(p4)]))
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
0 0 0 1

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable x1, y1, x2, y2 are initialized to 0, 0, 0 and 1, respectively.
The numpy library is imported and two numpy arrays p1 and p2 are created with the values of x1 and y1, and x2 and y2, respectively.
The vector v1 is calculated as the difference between p2 and p1, which gives the vector from p1 to p2.
The vector v2 is calculated as the perpendicular vector to v1, which is obtained by swapping the x and y components of v1.
The point p3 is calculated as the sum of p2 and v2, which gives the point on the line perpendicular to v1 that intersects p2.
The point p4 is calculated as the sum of p3 and the negative of v1, which gives the point on the line perpendicular to v1 that intersects p3.
The final output is a string that concatenates the coordinates of p3 and p4, separated by spaces.

The output of code execution is:
0 1 0 1
