Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
S = input()
l = len(S)
mod = 10**9+7
dp = [[0]*13 for _ in range(l+1)]
dp[0][0] = 1

for i,s in enumerate(S):
    for j in range(13):
        if(s=="?"):
            for k in range(10):
                dp[i+1][((j*10)+k)%13] += dp[i][j]
                dp[i+1][((j*10)+k)%13]%=mod
        else:
            dp[i+1][((j*10)+int(s))%13] += dp[i][j]
            dp[i+1][((j*10)+int(s))%13]%=mod
print(dp[l][5])
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
??2??5

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable S is initialized to "??2??5".
The variable l is initialized to the length of S, which is 6.
The variable mod is initialized to 10^9+7.
The variable dp is initialized to a 2D array of size (l+1)x13, where each element is initialized to 0.
The first row of dp is initialized to 1, since there is only one way to reach the first character of S with the first row of dp.

The code then enters a loop that iterates over each character s in S, and for each character, it enters another loop that iterates over each possible digit d (0-9) and each possible position j (0-12) in the current row of dp.

If the current character s is "?", it means that we need to consider all possible digits d (0-9) at this position j. Therefore, we add the number of ways to reach this position j with the previous row of dp multiplied by the number of possible digits d, and store the result in the current position j of the next row of dp.

If the current character s is not "?", it means that we need to consider only the digit d at this position j. Therefore, we add the number of ways to reach this position j with the previous row of dp multiplied by the number of possible digits d, and store the result in the current position j of the next row of dp.

After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of dp[l][5], which is 1.

The output of code execution is:
1
