The first code snippet is a simple program that calculates the sum of all numbers from 1 to N, where N is an integer input by the user. The program uses a nested loop to iterate over all numbers from 1 to N and calculate the sum of their digits. The condition for a number to be included in the sum is that the sum of its digits is within the range [A, B]. The program then prints the final value of sum_1, which is the sum of all numbers meeting the condition.

The input for the first code snippet is:
20 2 5

The output of the first code snippet is:
