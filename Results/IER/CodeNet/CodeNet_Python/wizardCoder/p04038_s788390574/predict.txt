The code defines a function called cmb(n, r, mod) that calculates the combination of n and r modulo mod. The function uses the fact that C(n,r) = C(n,n-r) and calculates C(n,r) using the formula C(n,r) = (n! * r! * (n-r)!) / (r! * (n-r)! * (n-r-1)!) using the fact that n! = (n-1)! * n.

The code also defines two tables g1 and g2 of size N+1, which are used to calculate the inverse of each number from 1 to N. The inverse of a number i is defined as -1/i modulo mod. The inverse of a number i is calculated using the formula -1/i = (mod/i) * (-inverse[mod % i]) modulo mod.

The code then reads the input values N and K. If K is 1, the code prints 1 and exits. Otherwise, it initializes a table dp of size N+1 to 0, and sets dp[N] to 1. The code then enters a loop that iterates from N to 0, and for each iteration, it calculates the number of ways to choose K elements from the remaining elements from i to N. The number of ways to choose K elements from i to N is calculated using the formula C(n,r) * C(n-r,K-1) * C(n-r-1,K-2) *... * C(n-r-K+1,1), where C(n,r) is the combination of n and r modulo mod. The code then updates the dp table by adding the product of the number of ways to choose K elements from i to N and the value of dp[j+1] for all j from i to N-K+1.

Finally, the code calculates the final answer by multiplying the value of dp[0] with the inverse of N modulo mod. The final answer is printed.

The input values are 2 and 2, which means that the code needs to calculate the number of ways to choose 2 elements from 1 to 2. The code starts by initializing dp[0] to 1, dp[1] to 1, dp[2] to 2, and dp[3] to 5. The code then calculates the number of ways to choose 2 elements from 1 to 2, which is 2. The code then calculates the final answer by multiplying dp[0] with the inverse of 2 modulo 10**9+7, which is 999999937. The final answer is 999999937, which is printed as the output.
