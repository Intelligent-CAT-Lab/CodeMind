Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
import sys
sys.setrecursionlimit(2147483647)
INF=float("inf")
MOD=10**9+7
input=lambda :sys.stdin.readline().rstrip()
def resolve():
    import re
    pattern="^A[a-z]+C[a-z]+$"
    print("AC" if re.match(pattern,input()) else "WA")
resolve()
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
AtCoder

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The code imports the sys module and sets the recursion limit to 2147483647. This is to avoid the maximum recursion depth error.
The code also defines the INF and MOD variables as float and integer, respectively.
The input function is defined to read input from the standard input and strip the newline character.
The resolve function is defined to solve the problem.

The code then imports the re module to use regular expressions.
The pattern variable is defined as a regular expression that matches strings that start with "A" followed by one or more lowercase letters, then "C" followed by one or more lowercase letters, and then ends with the end of the string.
The code then checks if the input matches the pattern using the re.match function. If it does, it prints "AC". Otherwise, it prints "WA".

The input is "AtCoder", which matches the pattern, so the output is "AC".

The output of code execution is:
AC
END-OF-OUTPUT
