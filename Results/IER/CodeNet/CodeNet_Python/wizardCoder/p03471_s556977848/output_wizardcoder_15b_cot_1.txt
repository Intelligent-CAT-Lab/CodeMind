Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
n, y = map(int, input().split())

flag = False
for i in range(n + 1):
    for j in range(n + 1 - i):
        res = y - 10000 * i - 5000 * j
        if res // 1000 == n - i - j:
            print(i, j, res // 1000)
            flag = True
            break
    if flag:
        break
else:
    print(-1, -1, -1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
9 45000

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable n and variable y are initialized to 9 and 45000, respectively.
The variable flag is initialized to False, which will be used to check if any valid combination of i, j and res is found.
The code then enters two nested loops that iterate from 0 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider all possible values of i and j.
For each combination of i and j, it calculates the value of res as y - 10000 * i - 5000 * j.
The code then checks if res is divisible by 1000 and if the quotient is equal to n - i - j. If it is, it prints the values of i, j and res // 1000, which are 0, 0, 4.
The flag is set to True and the loop is exited.
After the first loop finishes, the code enters the else block, which is executed if the loop is not exited normally (i.e., with a break statement). In this case, the flag is still False, so the code prints -1, -1, -1.

The output of code execution is:
0 0 4
END-OF-OUTPUT
