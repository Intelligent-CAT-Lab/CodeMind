Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84

Consider the following code: 
import bisect
import sys
sys.setrecursionlimit(10000)
a=[]
def f(a,bin,n):
    if bin>n:return
    if bin:a+=[bin]
    f(a,bin*10+2,n)
    f(a,bin*10+8,n)

def g(n,p):
    m=-1<<20
    x=bisect.bisect_left(a,n)
    if x!=len(a) and a[x]==n:m=1
    if a[p]**2>n:return m
    if n%a[p]==0:m=g(n//a[p],p)+1
    return max(m,g(n,p+1))

n=int(input())
if n&1:print(-1);exit()
f(a,0,n)
a=sorted(a)
b=g(n,0)
if b<0:b=-1
print(b)

### Response:
The code first imports the bisect module and sets the recursion limit to 10000. It then initializes an empty list a.

The function f(a,bin,n) takes a list a, a binary number bin, and a number n as input. It recursively adds bin to a if bin is less than or equal to n. It then calls itself with bin*10+2 and bin*10+8 as inputs.

The function g(n,p) takes a number n and an index p as input. It initializes a variable m to -1<<20, which is the smallest possible integer. It then uses the bisect_left function from the bisect module to find the index x in the list a such that a[x] is greater than or equal to n. If x is not equal to the length of a, and a[x] is equal to n, it sets m to 1. If n is not a perfect square, it returns m. If n is divisible by a[p], it sets m to g(n//a[p],p)+1. Otherwise, it sets m to the maximum of m and g(n,p+1).

The code then reads an integer n from input. If n is odd, it prints -1 and exits. Otherwise, it calls f(a,0,n) to generate all binary numbers less than or equal to n. It then sorts the list a in ascending order. Finally, it calls g(n,0) to find the maximum number of times n can be written as a product of two numbers in the list a. If the result is negative, it sets it to -1. It then prints the result.

The input is 1, so the code first checks if n is odd. Since it is, it prints -1 and exits.

If n is even, the code generates all binary numbers less than or equal to n using f(a,0,n). It then sorts the list a in ascending order. Finally, it calls g(n,0) to find the maximum number of times n can be written as a product of two numbers in the list a. Since n is 2, the only possible product is 2, and g(2,0) returns 1. It then prints 1.

The output of code execution is:
1
