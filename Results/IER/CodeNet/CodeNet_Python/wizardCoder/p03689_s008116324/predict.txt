The variable H, W, h, and w are initialized to 3, 3, 2, and 2, respectively.
The code checks if H is divisible by h and if W is divisible by w. If either of these conditions is not met, the code prints 'No' and exits.
If both conditions are met, the code prints 'Yes'.

The code then checks if W is divisible by w. If it is not, the code calculates the number of rows needed to fill the width of the image. It does this by calculating the number of times the image can be tiled horizontally, which is equal to W/w. It then calculates the number of tiles needed to fill the height of the image, which is equal to H/h.
