Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
import sys
def MI(): return map(int,sys.stdin.readline().rstrip().split())

N,K = MI()

if K > ((N-1)*(N-2))//2:
    print(-1)
    exit()

print(N-1+((N-1)*(N-2))//2-K)

for i in range(2,N+1):
    print(1,i)

a = 0
for i in range(2,N):
    for j in range(i+1,N+1):
        if a < ((N-1)*(N-2))//2-K:
            print(i,j)
            a += 1

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
5 3

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable N and variable K are initialized to 5 and 3, respectively.
The code checks if K is greater than the maximum number of pairs that can be formed from the given set of numbers. In this case, the maximum number of pairs that can be formed from the set of numbers [1,2,3,4,5] is 10, which is ((5-1)*(5-2))//2 = 10. Therefore, if K is greater than this value, the code prints -1 and exits.

If K is less than or equal to the maximum number of pairs that can be formed from the given set of numbers, the code calculates the number of pairs that can be formed from the set of numbers [1,2,3,4,5] by subtracting K from the maximum number of pairs. In this case, K = 3, so the number of pairs that can be formed from the set of numbers [1,2,3,4,5] is 10 - 3 = 7. Therefore, the code prints 7.

The code then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 2 to 5. For each number i in this range, it prints the pair (1,i).

The code then enters another loop that iterates from 2 to N-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider pairs of numbers from 2 to 4. For each pair (i,j) in this range, it checks if the number of pairs that can be formed from the set of numbers [1,2,3,4,5] is less than or equal to K. If it is, it prints the pair (i,j) and increments the count of pairs that can be formed by 1.

The output of code execution is:
7
1 2
1 3
1 4
1 5
2 3
2 4
2 5
3 4
3 5
4 5
