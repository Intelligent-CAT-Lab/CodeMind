Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
A, B, K = map(int, input().split())

A_th = B+1 if A+K > B+1 else A+K
A_l = list(range(A, A_th, 1))
#print(A_l)

B_th = B-K+1 if B-K > A-1 else A
B_l = list(range(B_th, B+1, 1))
#print(B_l)

X_l = sorted(set(A_l + B_l))

for x in X_l:
  print(x)
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
3 8 2

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable A, variable B and variable K are initialized to 3, 8 and 2, respectively.

The variable A_th is calculated as follows:

A_th = B+1 if A+K > B+1 else A+K

Since A+K is greater than B+1, the condition is true and A_th is assigned the value B+1.

The variable A_l is initialized as follows:

A_l = list(range(A, A_th, 1))

This creates a list of integers from A to A_th (inclusive) with a step size of 1.

The variable B_th is calculated as follows:

B_th = B-K+1 if B-K > A-1 else A

Since B-K is greater than A-1, the condition is true and B_th is assigned the value A.

The variable B_l is initialized as follows:

B_l = list(range(B_th, B+1, 1))

This creates a list of integers from B_th to B (inclusive) with a step size of 1.

The variable X_l is initialized as follows:

X_l = sorted(set(A_l + B_l))

This creates a sorted list of unique elements from A_l and B_l.

The code then enters a loop that iterates over each element x in X_l. For each element, it prints the value of x.

The output of code execution is:

3
4
5
6
7
8
