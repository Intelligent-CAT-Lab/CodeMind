Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
import sys

readline = sys.stdin.readline
MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7
INF = float('INF')
sys.setrecursionlimit(10 ** 5)


def main():
    s = input()

    if s == "RRR":
        print(3)
    elif "RR" in s:
        print(2)
    elif "R" in s:
        print(1)
    else:
        print(0)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
RRS

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The code first imports the sys module, which provides access to some variables used or maintained by the interpreter and to functions that interact strongly with the interpreter.

The code then defines a function called main() that takes no arguments.

The code then reads a line of input from the standard input using the readline() function, which reads a line of input from the standard input and returns it as a string.

The code then checks if the input string is equal to "RRR". If it is, the code prints 3 and exits.

The code then checks if the input string contains the substring "RR". If it does, the code prints 2 and exits.

The code then checks if the input string contains the character "R". If it does, the code prints 1 and exits.

The code then prints 0, which is the default case if none of the previous conditions are met.

The code then calls the main() function, which executes the code inside the function.

The code then exits, indicating that the program has finished executing.

The output of code execution is:

1
END-OF-OUTPUT
