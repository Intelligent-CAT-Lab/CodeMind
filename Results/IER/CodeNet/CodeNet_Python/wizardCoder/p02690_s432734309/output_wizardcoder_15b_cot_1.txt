Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
x = int(input())
if int(x**0.2)==int(x)**0.2:
  print(int(x**0.2),0)
  exit()
for i in range(1,10**5):
  b = i
  c = -i
  x1 = x + b**5
  x2 = x + c**5
  if x1>=0 and int(x1**0.2)**5==x1:
    print(int(x1**0.2),b)
    exit()
  if x2>=0 and int(x2**0.2)**5==x2:
    print(int(x2**0.2),c)
    exit()
  if x2<0:
    for j in range(1,10**3):
      v = -j
      if v**5==x2:
        print(v,c)
        exit()
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
33

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable x is initialized to 33.
The code checks if x**0.2 is an integer. Since 33**0.2 is approximately 12.09, it is not an integer.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 10^5 (inclusive).
For each value of i in this range, it calculates two values b and c, where b = i and c = -i.
It then calculates two values x1 and x2, where x1 = x + b^5 and x2 = x + c^5.
The code checks if x1 is an integer and if x1^0.2 is equal to x1. Since 33 + 33^5 = 1092, 1092^0.2 is approximately 32.0, which is an integer. Therefore, the code prints 32 and 33, and exits the loop.
The code then checks if x2 is an integer and if x2^0.2 is equal to x2. Since 33 + (-33)^5 = 1092, (-1092)^0.2 is approximately -32.0, which is an integer. Therefore, the code prints -32 and -33, and exits the loop.
The code then checks if x2 is negative. Since 33 is positive, the code skips this check.
The code then enters another loop that iterates from 1 to 10^3 (inclusive).
For each value of j in this range, it calculates a value v, where v = -j.
It then checks if v^5 is equal to x2. Since -33^5 = 2197, the code prints -33 and -33, and exits the loop.
The code then prints -33 and -33, which is the final output.

The output of code execution is:
-33 -33
