Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
from collections import deque

def solve(k):
    que = deque()
    que.append((1, 1))
    dp = {1: 1}
    while que:
        x, c = que.pop()
        y = (x + 1) % k
        if (not y in dp) or (dp[y] > c + 1):
            dp[y] = c + 1
            que.appendleft((y, c+1))
        z = (10 * x) % k
        if (not z in dp) or (dp[z] > c):
            dp[z] = c
            que.append((z, c))
    return dp[0]

k = int(input())
print(solve(k))
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
6

### Response:
The code defines a function called solve that takes an integer k as input. The function uses a deque to keep track of the current state of the queue, and a dictionary to keep track of the minimum number of moves required to reach each state.

The function starts by initializing the deque with the starting state (1, 1), and the dictionary with the starting state mapped to 1.

The function then enters a loop that continues until the deque is empty. In each iteration of the loop, the function pops the top state from the deque, and checks if the state (x+1) mod k is already in the dictionary. If it is, and the value of dp[y] is greater than c+1, then the function updates dp[y] to c+1 and appends the new state (y, c+1) to the front of the deque. This means that the function has found a shorter path to state y than the current path to state x, so it updates the value of dp[y] and adds the new state to the front of the deque.

The function also checks if the state (10*x) mod k is already in the dictionary. If it is, and the value of dp[z] is greater than c, then the function updates dp[z] to c and appends the new state (z, c) to the end of the deque. This means that the function has found a shorter path to state z than the current path to state x, so it updates the value of dp[z] and adds the new state to the end of the deque.

After the loop finishes, the function returns the value of dp[0], which is the minimum number of moves required to reach state 0.

The code then reads an integer k from standard input, and calls the solve function with k as input. The function returns the minimum number of moves required to reach state 0, which is 3 in this case.

The output of code execution is:
3
