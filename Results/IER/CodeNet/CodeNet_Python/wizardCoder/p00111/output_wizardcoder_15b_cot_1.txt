Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84

Consider the following code: 
def main():
    tableA,tableB = make_table()
    while True:
        try:
            s = "".join(map(lambda c: tableA[c],raw_input()))
        except:
            break
        tmp,ans = "",""
        for c in s:
            tmp += c
            if tmp in tableB:
                ans += tableB[tmp]
                tmp = ""
        print ans

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
?D-C'KOPUA

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The code defines a function called main() that creates two tables, tableA and tableB. The tableA maps each character to its binary representation, while the tableB maps each binary sequence to its corresponding character.

The main() function then enters an infinite loop that reads a string from the user and converts it to binary using the tableA. It then iterates over each character in the binary string, and for each character, it checks if the binary sequence formed by appending it to the current prefix (stored in tmp) is a key in tableB. If it is, it appends the corresponding character to ans, and resets tmp to an empty string. If it is not, it simply appends the current character to tmp.

After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is "Hello, World!".

The output of code execution is:
Hello, World!
