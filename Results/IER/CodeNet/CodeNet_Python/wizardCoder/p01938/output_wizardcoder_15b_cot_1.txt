Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
S = input()

alpha = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"
Now = 0
ans = 0
for s in S:
    Next = alpha.find(s)
    # print(s, Now, Next)

    if(Now < Next):
        pass
    else:
        ans += 1
    Now = Next
print(ans)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
AIZU

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable S is initialized to "AIZU".
The variable alpha is initialized to "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ".
The variable Now is initialized to 0, which will be used to keep track of the current position in the alphabet.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the number of times the alphabet is traversed in reverse order.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each character s in the string S.
For each character s, it finds its position in the alphabet using the find() method of the string alpha.
The code then checks if the current position Now is less than the position of the next character s. If it is, it means that the alphabet has been traversed in reverse order, so the code increments the variable ans.
Otherwise, it means that the alphabet has been traversed in the correct order, so the code does nothing.
Finally, the code updates the value of Now to be the position of the next character s, so that it can be used to check the next character in the next iteration of the loop.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 3.

The output of code execution is:
3
END-OF-OUTPUT
