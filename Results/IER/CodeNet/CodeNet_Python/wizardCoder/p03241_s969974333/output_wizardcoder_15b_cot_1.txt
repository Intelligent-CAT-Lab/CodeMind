Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
import sys
def input(): return sys.stdin.readline().strip()
def mapint(): return map(int, input().split())
sys.setrecursionlimit(10**9)

N, M = mapint()
from bisect import bisect_left
def make_divisors(n):
    lower_divisors, upper_divisors = [], []
    i = 1
    while i*i <= n:
        if n % i == 0:
            lower_divisors.append(i)
            if i!= n // i:
                upper_divisors.append(n//i)
        i += 1
    return lower_divisors + upper_divisors[::-1]

div = [1]+make_divisors(M)
div.sort()
g = div[bisect_left(div, N)]
print(M//g)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
3 14

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable N and variable M are initialized to 3 and 14, respectively.
The code then imports the input function from the sys module and defines a new input function that reads input from stdin and strips any leading or trailing whitespace.
The code also imports the mapint function from the sys module and defines a new mapint function that maps the input to integers using the input function.
The code sets the recursion limit to 10^9, which is the maximum allowed recursion depth.
The code then creates a list of divisors of M using the make_divisors function, which returns a list of all divisors of M, including 1 and M itself.
The code then sorts the list of divisors in ascending order.
The code then uses the bisect_left function from the bisect module to find the index of the first element in the sorted list of divisors that is greater than or equal to N.
The code then calculates the greatest common divisor of M and the divisor at the index found by bisect_left, which is g.
The code then prints the quotient of M and g, which is 4.

The output of code execution is:
4
