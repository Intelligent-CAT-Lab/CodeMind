Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
L = int(input())

xs = []

for m in range(21):
    if (2 << m) > L:
        break
    xs.append((m+1, m+2, 0))
    xs.append((m+1, m+2, 1 << m))

b = 1 << m
x = L - b

for i in range(m - 1, -1, -1):
    c = 1 << i
    if x >= c:
        xs.append((i+1, m+1, b))
        x -= c
        b += c

print(m + 1, len(xs))

for x in xs:
    print(*x)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
4

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable L is initialized to 4.

The list xs is initialized to an empty list.

The code enters a loop that iterates from 21 to infinity, meaning it will consider all possible values of m.

For each value of m, the code checks if 2 raised to the power of m is greater than L. If it is, the loop breaks.

If the loop continues, the code appends two tuples to xs, one for each possible value of x. The first tuple contains the values (m+1, m+2, 0), and the second tuple contains the values (m+1, m+2, 2^m).

The variable b is initialized to 2^m.

The variable x is initialized to L - b.

The code enters another loop that iterates from m-1 to 0, meaning it will consider all possible values of i.

For each value of i, the code calculates the value of c as 2^i. If x is greater than or equal to c, the code appends a tuple to xs containing the values (i+1, m+1, b), and subtracts c from x and adds c to b.

The code then prints the values of m+1 and the length of xs.

Finally, the code prints each tuple in xs on a separate line.

The output of code execution is:

3 10
1 2 0
1 2 4
1 3 0
1 3 8
1 4 0
1 4 16
2 3 0
2 3 16
2 4 0
2 4 32
