Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
def main():
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    a = [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12]
    b = [4, 6, 9, 11]
    if x == 2 or y == 2:
        print('No')
    elif (x in a and y in a) or (x in b and y in b):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
main()
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
1 3

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable x and variable y are initialized to 1 and 3, respectively.
The list a is initialized to [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12], and the list b is initialized to [4, 6, 9, 11].
The code checks if either x or y is equal to 2. If it is, it prints 'No'.
If neither x nor y is equal to 2, the code checks if either x or y is in the list a or the list b. If it is, it prints 'Yes'.
If neither x nor y is equal to 2 and neither x nor y is in the list a or the list b, it prints 'No'.

The output of code execution is:
No
END-OF-OUTPUT
