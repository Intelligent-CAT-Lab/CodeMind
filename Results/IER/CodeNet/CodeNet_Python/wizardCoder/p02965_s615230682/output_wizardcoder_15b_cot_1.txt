Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
o,f=998244353,[1]
for i in range(1,2500100):f.append(f[-1]*i%o)
c=lambda n,k:f[n]*pow(f[n-k],o-2,o)*pow(f[k],o-2,o)
n,m=map(int,input().split())
w,u=3*m,n-1
a=c(w+u,u)-n*c(n+m-2,u)
if u>m:
 for i in range(m+1,min(w,n)+1):
  if w-i+1&1:a-=c(n,i)*c((w-i)//2+u,u) 
print(a%o)
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
2 2

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable o and variable f are initialized to 998244353 and [1], respectively.
The variable f is a list that stores the factorials of numbers from 1 to 2500100.
The variable c is a lambda function that takes two arguments n and k and returns the coefficient of x^n * y^k in the polynomial x^w * y^u, where w+u=n and u<=m.
The variable n and variable m are initialized to 2 and 2, respectively.
The variable w and variable u are initialized to 3*m and n-1, respectively.
The variable a is initialized to the coefficient of x^w * y^u in the polynomial x^w * y^u, where w+u=n and u<=m.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from m+1 to min(w,n), meaning it will consider numbers from m+1 to min(w,n).
For each number i in this range, it checks if w-i+1 is odd. If it is, it subtracts the coefficient of x^n * y^i * x^((w-i)//2+u) * y^u in the polynomial x^w * y^u, where w+u=n and u<=m from a. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of a modulo o, which is 1.

The output of code execution is:
1
