Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
x = int(input())
h = x // 3600
m = x % 3600//60
s = x % 60
print("{0}:{1}:{2}".format(h,m,s))
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
46979

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable x is initialized to 46979.
The code calculates the number of hours by dividing x by 3600 and stores the result in variable h.
The code calculates the number of minutes by taking the remainder of x divided by 3600 (which gives the number of hours) and dividing it by 60. The result is stored in variable m.
The code calculates the number of seconds by taking the remainder of x divided by 60 (which gives the number of minutes) and stores it in variable s.
The code then prints the value of h, m and s in the format "hh:mm:ss", where hh is the number of hours, mm is the number of minutes and ss is the number of seconds.

The output of code execution is:
1:1:39
END-OF-OUTPUT
