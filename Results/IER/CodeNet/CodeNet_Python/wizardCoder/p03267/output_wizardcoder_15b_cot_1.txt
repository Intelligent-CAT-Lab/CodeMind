Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
# coding: utf-8
import sys

sr = lambda: sys.stdin.readline().rstrip()
ir = lambda: int(sr())
lr = lambda: list(map(int, sr().split()))

L = ir()
edges = []
length = L.bit_length()
for i in range(1, length):
    edges.append((i, i+1, 2**(i-1)))
    edges.append((i, i+1, 0))

# 2**(length-1)-1までの数は完了
# Lに近い切れ端から処理していく
for i in range(length-1):
    if L >> i & 1:
        L -= 2 ** i
        edges.append((i+1, length, L))

print(length, len(edges))
for x in edges:
    print(*x)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
4

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The code first reads an integer L from standard input.

The code then initializes an empty list called edges.

The code calculates the length of L in binary representation using the bit_length() method of integers.

The code then iterates over the range [1, length) and adds two edges to the edges list for each value of i. The first edge has the form (i, i+1, 2**(i-1)), and the second edge has the form (i, i+1, 0).

The code then checks if the i-th bit of L is set to 1. If it is, it subtracts 2**i from L and adds an edge to the edges list with the form (i+1, length, L).

Finally, the code prints the length of the edges list and the edges themselves.

The output of code execution is:

4 4
0 1 2
1 2 2
2 3 2
3 4 2
