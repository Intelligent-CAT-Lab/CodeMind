Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
import sys
input = sys.stdin.readline
sys.setrecursionlimit(10 ** 7)

import numpy as np

N,M,L,R = map(int,input().split())

MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7

U = 6*10**5 + 100
fact = [1] * (U+1)
for n in range(1,U+1):
    fact[n] = fact[n-1]*n%MOD
fact_inv = [1] * (U+1)
fact_inv[U] = pow(fact[U],MOD-2,MOD)
for n in range(U,0,-1):
    fact_inv[n-1] = fact_inv[n] * n % MOD

fact = np.array(fact,dtype=np.int64)
fact_inv = np.array(fact_inv,dtype=np.int64)


U = N - M
comb = fact[U] * fact_inv[:U+1] % MOD * fact_inv[U::-1] % MOD
comb[1::2] *= (-1)

P = np.zeros(R+1,dtype=np.int64)
for i,x in enumerate(comb,M):
    P[::i] += x


P[M:] -= P.copy()[:-M]
P %= MOD

# (1-x)^{N+1}で割る
Q = fact[N:N+R+1] * fact_inv[:R+1] % MOD * fact_inv[N] % MOD

def f(R):
    total = fact[R+N] * fact_inv[R] % MOD * fact_inv[N] % MOD
    x = (Q[R::-1] * P[:R+1] % MOD).sum() % MOD
    coef = fact[N] * fact_inv[M] % MOD * fact_inv[N-M] % MOD
    return (total - x*coef)%MOD

answer = (f(R) - f(L-1))%MOD
print(answer)
