Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
a, b, k= map(int, input().split())

for i in range(k):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        if a % 2 == 1:
            a -= 1
        a //= 2
        b += a
    else:
        if b % 2 == 1:
            b -= 1
        b //= 2
        a += b

print(a, b)
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
5 4 2

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable a, b and k are initialized to 5, 4 and 2, respectively.
The code enters a loop that iterates k times.
For each iteration, the code checks if the current iteration is even or odd.
If it is even, the code checks if a is odd. If it is, it subtracts 1 from a.
It then divides a by 2, which effectively halves a.
The code then adds a to b.
If the current iteration is odd, the code checks if b is odd. If it is, it subtracts 1 from b.
It then divides b by 2, which effectively halves b.
The code then adds b to a.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final values of a and b, which are 1 and 2, respectively.

The output of code execution is:
1 2
