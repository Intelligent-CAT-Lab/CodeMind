Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
from sys import stdin
S = str(stdin.readline().rstrip())
#l = list(map(int, stdin.readline().rstrip().split()))
#A, B, C = map(int, stdin.readline().rstrip().split())
#S = [list(map(int, stdin.readline().rstrip().split())) for _ in range(h)]#hの定義を忘れずに

n = len(S)+1
sho = [0]*n
dai = [0]*n

for i,s in enumerate(S):
    i += 1
    if s ==">":
        sho[i] = 0
    else:
        sho[i] = sho[i-1] + 1

for i,s in enumerate(S[::-1]):
    i = n-i-2
    if s == "<":
        dai[i]=0
    else:
        dai[i] = dai[i+1] +1

seq = [max(x,y) for x,y in zip(sho,dai)]

print(sum(seq))

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
<>>

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable S is initialized to the input string "<>>".
The variable n is initialized to the length of S plus 1, which is 4.
The variables sho and dai are initialized to lists of zeros of length n.

The code then enters a loop that iterates over the characters in S. For each character s, it calculates the corresponding index i and updates the corresponding sho or dai list accordingly. If s is ">", sho[i] is set to 0, otherwise sho[i] is set to sho[i-1] plus 1. If s is "<", dai[i] is set to 0, otherwise dai[i] is set to dai[i+1] plus 1.

After the loop finishes, the code calculates the sequence of maximum values between sho and dai using a list comprehension. The sequence is stored in the variable seq.

Finally, the code calculates the sum of the elements in seq using the built-in sum function and prints the result, which is 2.

The output of code execution is:
2
