Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
n, m = map(int, input().split())
ans1 = 1
ans2 = 1
mod = 10**9 + 7

if abs(n-m) >= 2:
    print(0)
    exit()


for i in range(1, n+1):
    ans1 *= i
    ans1 %= mod
for j in range(1, m+1):
    ans2 *= j
    ans2 %= mod

if abs(m-n) == 1:
    print(ans1 * ans2 % mod)
else:
    print(2 * ans1 * ans2 % mod)
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
2 2

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable n and m are initialized to 2, 2, respectively.
The variables ans1 and ans2 are initialized to 1, which will be used to accumulate the product of numbers.
The variable mod is initialized to 10^9 + 7, which is used to perform the modulo operation.

The code checks if the absolute difference between n and m is greater than or equal to 2. If it is, the code prints 0 and exits.

The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 2.
For each number i in this range, it multiplies ans1 by i and stores the result in ans1.
The modulo operation is performed on ans1 after each iteration to avoid integer overflow.

The code then enters another loop that iterates from 1 to m (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 2.
For each number j in this range, it multiplies ans2 by j and stores the result in ans2.
The modulo operation is performed on ans2 after each iteration to avoid integer overflow.

The code then checks if the absolute difference between m and n is equal to 1. If it is, the code prints the product of ans1 and ans2 modulo mod.
If the absolute difference is greater than 1, the code prints 2 times the product of ans1 and ans2 modulo mod.

The output of code execution is:
4
