The code starts by importing the necessary modules. It then sets the recursion limit to 10^7 and defines some constants.

The main function is defined, which reads input until a 0 is encountered. For each input string, it calculates the number of times the string contains the substring "RRRR". This is done using the f function, which iterates over each character in the string and keeps track of the number of consecutive 'R's. If a 'R' is encountered, the count is incremented. If a 'L' is encountered, the count is decremented. If the count reaches 4, a 'R' is counted as a match and the count is reset to 0. If the count reaches -4, the count is reset to 0.

The main function then returns the list of results as a string, separated by newlines.

The code then calls the main function and prints the result.

The input is "RRRRLLLLRRRR", which meets the condition of having 4 consecutive 'R's. 
The output of the code execution is:
