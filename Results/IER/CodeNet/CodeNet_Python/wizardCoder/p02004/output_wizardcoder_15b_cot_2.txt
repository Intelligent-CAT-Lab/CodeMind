Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84

            else:

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
RRRRLLLLRRRR

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The code starts by importing the necessary modules. It then sets the recursion limit to 10^7 and defines some constants.

The main function is defined, which reads input until a 0 is encountered. For each input string, it calculates the number of times the string contains the substring "RRRR". This is done using the f function, which iterates over each character in the string and keeps track of the number of consecutive 'R's. If a 'R' is encountered, the count is incremented. If a 'L' is encountered, the count is decremented. If the count reaches 4, a 'R' is counted as a match and the count is reset to 0. If the count reaches -4, the count is reset to 0.

The main function then returns the list of results as a string, separated by newlines.

The code then calls the main function and prints the result.

The input is "RRRRLLLLRRRR", which meets the condition of having 4 consecutive 'R's. The output of the code execution is:

1
