Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
N = int(input())
def num2alpha(num):
    if num<=26:
        return chr(64+num)
    elif num%26==0:
        return num2alpha(num//26-1)+chr(90)
    else:
        return num2alpha(num//26)+chr(64+num%26)
print(num2alpha(N).lower())
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
2

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable N is initialized to 2.

The function num2alpha takes an integer num as input and returns its corresponding alphabetical representation.

The function first checks if num is less than or equal to 26. If it is, it returns the corresponding alphabet using the ASCII code.

If num is greater than 26, the function recursively calls itself with num//26 as input, which gives the number of times 26 can be divided by num. This gives the number of times 26 can be subtracted from num to get a number less than or equal to 26.

The function then checks if the remainder of num divided by 26 is 0. If it is, it means that num is divisible by 26, so it returns the result of calling itself with num//26-1 as input, followed by the letter 'Z'.

If the remainder is not 0, it means that num is not divisible by 26, so it returns the result of calling itself with num//26 as input, followed by the letter corresponding to the remainder of num divided by 26.

The function then converts the resulting string to lowercase using the lower() method and returns it.

The function is then called with N as input and the resulting string is printed.

The output of code execution is:
BC
