Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

import sys

def input(): return sys.stdin.readline().strip()
def list2d(a, b, c): return [[c] * b for i in range(a)]
def list3d(a, b, c, d): return [[[d] * c for j in range(b)] for i in range(a)]
def list4d(a, b, c, d, e): return [[[[e] * d for j in range(c)] for j in range(b)] for i in range(a)]
def ceil(x, y=1): return int(-(-x // y))
def INT(): return int(input())
def MAP(): return map(int, input().split())
def LIST(N=None): return list(MAP()) if N is None else [INT() for i in range(N)]
def Yes(): print('Yes')
def No(): print('No')
def YES(): print('YES')
def NO(): print('NO')
sys.setrecursionlimit(10 ** 9)
INF = 10 ** 18
MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7

S = input()
N = len(S)
S = '0' + S
 
if S[1] == '0' or S[N] == '1' or S!= S[::-1]:
    print(-1)
    exit()

edges = []
base = 1
for i in range(1, N):
    edges.append((base, i+1))
    if S[i] == '1':
        base = i + 1
[print(*edge) for edge in  edges]

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
1111

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The code first reads the input string S. It then checks if S is a valid binary number. A binary number is a number that consists of only 0's and 1's. To check if S is a valid binary number, we need to check if S[1] is 0, S[N] is 1, and S is equal to its reverse. If any of these conditions are not met, we print -1 and exit the program.

If S is a valid binary number, we create a list of edges, where each edge represents a 1 in S. We start with a base of 1 and add each index i such that S[i] is 1 to the base. We then print each edge in the list.

The output of code execution is:
1 2
3 4
5 6
7 8
9 10
