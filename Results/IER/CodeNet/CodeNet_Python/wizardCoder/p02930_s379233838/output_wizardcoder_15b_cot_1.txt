Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
N=input()

E=[ [ "" for j in range(N+1) ] for i in range(N+1) ]

for K in range(10):
	if N<=2**K:
		break

for i in range(1,N+1):
	for j in range(i+1,N+1):
			for k in range(K):
				if (i>>k)&1!=(j>>k)&1:
						E[i][j]=k+1
						break
	
for i in range(1,N):
	s=""
	for j in range(i+1,N+1):
		s+=str(E[i][j])+" "
	print s
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
3

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable N is initialized to 3.

The variable E is initialized to a 2D list of size N+1 x N+1, where each element is initialized to an empty string.

The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 9, where K is the current power of 2.

The loop breaks when N is less than or equal to 2^K.

The code then enters a nested loop that iterates over all pairs of numbers from 1 to N.

For each pair of numbers (i,j), the code enters another loop that iterates from 0 to K-1.

For each iteration of this loop, the code checks if the i-th bit of i and the j-th bit of j are different. If they are, the code sets the value of E[i][j] to k+1, where k is the current iteration of the loop. This means that the distance between i and j is k+1.

After the nested loop finishes, the code enters another loop that iterates over all numbers from 1 to N-1.

For each number i, the code enters another loop that iterates over all numbers from i+1 to N.

For each pair of numbers (i,j) that have a distance of k+1, the code appends the value of E[i][j] to a string s, separated by a space.

After the loop finishes, the code prints the string s.

The output of code execution is:

1 1 1 
1 2 
1 3 
2 2 
3 3
