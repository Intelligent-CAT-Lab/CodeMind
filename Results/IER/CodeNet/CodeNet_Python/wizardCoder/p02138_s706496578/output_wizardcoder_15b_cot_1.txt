Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
N,M = map(int,input().split())

ah = N*2
bh = M*2
ans1 = 0
while True:
    ap = min(N,ah)
    bh -= ap
    if bh <= 0:
        break
    ans1 += 1
    #print('ans1,ah,bh,ap',ans1,ah,bh,ap)
    bp = (bh+1)//2
    ah -= bp
    if ah <= 0:
        break
    ans1 += 1
    #print('ans1,ah,bh,bp',ans1,ah,bh,bp)

#print(ans1)

ah = N*2
bh = M*2
ans2 = 0
while True:
    ap = (ah+1)//2
    bh -= ap
    if bh <= 0:
        break
    ans2 += 1
    bp = min(M,bh)
    ah -= bp
    if ah <= 0:
        break
    ans2 += 1

#print(ans2)

print(min(ans1,ans2))


<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 10

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable N and variable M are initialized to 20 and 10, respectively.

The variable ah is initialized to N*2, which is 40.
The variable bh is initialized to M*2, which is 20.
The variable ans1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the number of times the loop is executed.

The code enters a while loop that continues until the variable bh becomes less than or equal to 0.
Inside the loop, the variable ap is set to the minimum of N and ah.
The variable bh is then decremented by ap.
If bh becomes less than or equal to 0, the loop is terminated.
Otherwise, the variable ans1 is incremented by 1.

The variable bp is set to (bh+1)//2, which is (20+1)//2, which is 11.
The variable ah is then decremented by bp.
If ah becomes less than or equal to 0, the loop is terminated.
Otherwise, the variable ans1 is incremented by 1.

The code then enters another while loop that continues until the variable bh becomes less than or equal to 0.
Inside the loop, the variable ap is set to (ah+1)//2, which is (40+1)//2, which is 21.
The variable bh is then decremented by ap.
If bh becomes less than or equal to 0, the loop is terminated.
Otherwise, the variable ans1 is incremented by 1.

The variable bp is set to the minimum of M and bh, which is 10.
The variable ah is then decremented by bp.
If ah becomes less than or equal to 0, the loop is terminated.
Otherwise, the variable ans1 is incremented by 1.

The code then enters another while loop that continues until the variable bh becomes less than or equal to 0.
Inside the loop, the variable ap is set to (ah+1)//2, which is (21+1)//2, which is 11.
The variable bh is then decremented by ap.
If bh becomes less than or equal to 0, the loop is terminated.
Otherwise, the variable ans1 is incremented by 1.

The variable bp is set to the minimum of M and bh, which is 10.
The variable ah is then decremented by bp.
If ah becomes less than or equal to 0, the loop is terminated.
Otherwise, the variable ans1 is incremented by 1.

The code then prints the final value of ans1, which is 4.

The variable ah is initialized to N*2, which is 40.
The variable bh is initialized to M*2, which is 20.
The variable ans2 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the number of times the loop is executed.

The code enters a while loop that continues until the variable bh becomes less than or equal to 0.
Inside the loop, the variable ap is set to (ah+1)//2, which is (40+1)//2, which is 21.
The variable bh is then decremented by ap.
If bh becomes less than or equal to 0, the loop is terminated.
Otherwise, the variable ans2 is incremented by 1.

The variable bp is set to the minimum of M and bh, which is 10.
The variable ah is then decremented by bp.
If ah becomes less than or equal to 0, the loop is terminated.
Otherwise, the variable ans2 is incremented by 1.

The code then enters another while loop that continues until the variable bh becomes less than or equal to 0.
Inside the loop, the variable ap is set to (ah+1)//2, which is (21+1)//2, which is 11.
The variable bh is then decremented by ap.
If bh becomes less than or equal to 0, the loop is terminated.
Otherwise, the variable ans2 is incremented by 1.

The variable bp is set to the minimum of M and bh, which is 10.
The variable ah is then decremented by bp.
If ah becomes less than or equal to 0, the loop is terminated.
Otherwise, the variable ans2 is incremented by 1.

The code then prints the final value of ans2, which is 3.

The code then prints the minimum of ans1 and ans2, which is 3.

The output of code execution is:
3
