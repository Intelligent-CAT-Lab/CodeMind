The code defines two functions: sub and checkEqual. The sub function takes two strings as input and returns the difference between their maximum and minimum values. The checkEqual function takes a string S as input and returns the minimum difference between any two substrings of S that have the same length as S.

The checkEqual function first initializes ans to 8, which is the minimum possible difference between any two substrings of S that have the same length as S. It then loops through all possible values of k, which is the length of the substrings of S to consider. If k is not a factor of the length of S, the loop skips to the next value of k. Otherwise, it initializes two strings, maxs and mins, to the first k characters of S. It then loops through all possible starting positions of the substrings of S of length k, and updates maxs and mins to the maximum and minimum values of the current substring. Finally, it calls the sub function with maxs and mins as arguments, and updates ans to the minimum of the current value of ans and the result of the sub function.

The check12 function takes a string S as input and returns the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the digits in S. It initializes maxv and minv to 0 and 10, respectively, and p to 0. It then loops through all the characters in S, and updates maxv and minv to the maximum and minimum values of the current digit, respectively. If the current character is '1' and there is a subsequent character, it adds 10 to the current digit and increments p. Finally, it returns maxv - minv.

The main function takes a string S as input and calls the checkEqual and check12 functions with S as argument. It then prints the minimum of the two results.

For the given input, the output of the code execution is:
