Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
def sub(maxs, mins):
    for i in range(len(maxs)):
        if maxs[i]!= mins[i]:
            if i == len(maxs)-1:
                return int(maxs[i]) - int(mins[i])
            if i == len(maxs)-2:
                return int(maxs[i:i+2]) - int(mins[i:i+2])
            return 10
    return 0

def checkEqual(S):
    ans = 8
    for k in range(1, len(S)):
        if len(S)%k!= 0: continue
        mins = maxs = S[0:k]
        for s in range(0, len(S), k):
            maxs = max(maxs, S[s:s+k])
            mins = min(mins, S[s:s+k])
        ans = min(ans, sub(maxs, mins))

    return ans

def check12(S):
    maxv = 0
    minv = 10
    p = 0
    while p < len(S):
        v = int(S[p])
        if  S[p] == '1' and p+1 < len(S):
            v = 10 + int(S[p+1])
            p += 1
        maxv = max(maxv, v)
        minv = min(minv, v)
        p += 1
    return maxv - minv

S = input()
print(min(checkEqual(S), check12(S)))
                                                                                                                        

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
11121314

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The code defines two functions: sub and checkEqual. The sub function takes two strings as input and returns the difference between their maximum and minimum values. The checkEqual function takes a string S as input and returns the minimum difference between any two substrings of S that have the same length as S.

The checkEqual function first initializes ans to 8, which is the minimum possible difference between any two substrings of S that have the same length as S. It then loops through all possible values of k, which is the length of the substrings of S to consider. If k is not a factor of the length of S, the loop skips to the next value of k. Otherwise, it initializes two strings, maxs and mins, to the first k characters of S. It then loops through all possible starting positions of the substrings of S of length k, and updates maxs and mins to the maximum and minimum values of the current substring. Finally, it calls the sub function with maxs and mins as arguments, and updates ans to the minimum of the current value of ans and the result of the sub function.

The check12 function takes a string S as input and returns the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the digits in S. It initializes maxv and minv to 0 and 10, respectively, and p to 0. It then loops through all the characters in S, and updates maxv and minv to the maximum and minimum values of the current digit, respectively. If the current character is '1' and there is a subsequent character, it adds 10 to the current digit and increments p. Finally, it returns maxv - minv.

The main function takes a string S as input and calls the checkEqual and check12 functions with S as argument. It then prints the minimum of the two results.

For the given input, the output of the code execution is:
1
