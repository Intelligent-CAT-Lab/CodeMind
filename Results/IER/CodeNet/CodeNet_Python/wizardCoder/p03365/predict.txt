The code is a Python program that uses the built-in module "decimal" to set the precision to 50 and the built-in module "sys" to set the recursion limit to 10000. It also defines a constant MOD with a value of 10^9 + 7.

The program reads an integer n from standard input. It then initializes two arrays, fact and ifact, of length n+1, where fact[i] is the i-th factorial and ifact[i] is the inverse of the i-th factorial modulo MOD.

The program then defines a function nCk(n, k) that calculates the binomial coefficient C(n, k) modulo MOD. This function uses the fact and ifact arrays to calculate the values.

The program then initializes a variable ans to 0 and a variable c0 to 0. It then iterates over the range [n/2, n], where i is the index of the current number. For each i, it calculates the value of c1 using the formula c1 = (C(i-1, n-1-i)*fact[i]*fact[n-i-1] - c0 + MOD) % MOD, where C(i-1, n-1-i) is the binomial coefficient C(i-1, n-1-i) modulo MOD. It then adds c1*i to ans modulo MOD and updates c0 to (c0 + c1) modulo MOD.

Finally, the program returns the value of ans modulo MOD.

The program reads an integer n from standard input and then calls the solve function with the file object f as an argument. If f is not None, it reads the input for each case and prints the output for each case. If f is None, it reads the input for a single case and prints the output for that case.

The input for the first case is:
4

The output for the first case is:
Case #1
10

The input for the second case is:
10

The output for the second case is:
Case #2
1000000000

The input for the third case is:
1000000000

The output for the third case is:
Case #3
100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
