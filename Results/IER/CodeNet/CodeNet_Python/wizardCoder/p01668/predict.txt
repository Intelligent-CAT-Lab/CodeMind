The variable A, variable B and variable C are initialized to 1, 3 and 2, respectively.
The code then enters a function called solve().
The function first reads the input A, B and C from the standard input.
The variable L is initialized to the maximum of the lengths of A and B.
The variable pw10 is initialized to a list of length L+1, where each element is initialized to 1.
The variable r is initialized to 1, which will be used to calculate the powers of 10.
The function then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to L+1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider all possible lengths of the substrings of A and B.
For each length i, the variable r is updated to r * 10 % MOD.
The function then enters another loop that iterates from 0 to N-M (inclusive), meaning it will consider all possible starting positions of the substrings of A and B.
For each starting position j, the function calculates the hash value of the substring A[j:j+i] using the RollingHash class.
The function then enters another loop that iterates from j to i (inclusive), meaning it will consider all possible ending positions of the substring A[j:j+i].
For each ending position k, the function calculates the hash value of the substring A[j:k+1] using the RollingHash class.
The function then checks if the hash values of the substrings A[j:j+i] and A[j:k+1] are equal. If they are, it adds the product of the hash values and the power of 10 to the variable res.
The function then checks if the substring A[j:k+1] is equal to the substring B. If it is, it adds 1 to the variable cur.
The function then checks if the substring A[j:k+1] is equal to "0". If it is, it subtracts the product of the hash value of "0" and the power of 10 to the variable res.
The function then returns the value of res modulo 10**9 + 7.
The function then enters another loop that iterates from 0 to N-M (inclusive), meaning it will consider all possible starting positions of the substring B.
For each starting position j, the function calculates the hash value of the substring B[j:j+M] using the RollingHash class.
The function then checks if the hash value of the substring B[j:j+M] is equal to the hash value of the substring C. If it is, it subtracts the product of the hash values and the power of 10 to the variable ans.
The function then subtracts the product of the hash value of the substring A[j:j+M] and the power of 10 to the variable ans.
