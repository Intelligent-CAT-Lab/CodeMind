The code defines a function called cmb(n, r, mod) that calculates the combination of n things taken r at a time modulo mod.

The input X and Y are read from the user and stored in variables x and y. If X is greater than Y, the variables are swapped.

The code then initializes the variable ans to -1, which will be used to store the answer.

The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to y (inclusive). For each value of i, it calculates the number of times 1 can be used to reach i and the number of times 2 can be used to reach N-i. It stores these values in variables n1 and n2.

If n1 and n2 are both positive and n2 is a multiple of n1, the loop breaks and the variables are stored in variables n1 and n2.

If n1 and n2 are both positive and n2 is not a multiple of n1, the loop breaks and the variable ans is set to 0.

If n1 and n2 are both negative, the loop breaks and the variable ans is set to 0.

If n1 and n2 are both positive and n2 is a multiple of n1, the code calculates the combination of N things taken r at a time using the cmb function and stores the result in the variable ans.

If x+y is not divisible by 3, the variable ans is set to 0.

The final value of ans is printed modulo 10^9+7 and "
