Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
n =int(input())
yes = True
primesand10=[10,11,13,17,19,23,29,31,37,41,43,47,53,59,61,67,71,73,79,83,89,97]
if n <= 10:
  yes = True
elif n <= 81:
  for prime in primesand10:
    if n%prime == 0:
      yes = False
      break
else:
  yes = False

if yes:print("Yes")
else: print("No")
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
10

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable n is initialized to 10.
The variable yes is initialized to True.
The list primesand10 is initialized to [10,11,13,17,19,23,29,31,37,41,43,47,53,59,61,67,71,73,79,83,89,97].

The code checks if n is less than or equal to 10. Since n is 10, the condition is met and yes is set to True.

The code then checks if n is greater than 10 and less than or equal to 81. Since n is 10, the condition is not met and the code enters the else block.

The code checks if n is greater than 81. Since n is 10, the condition is not met and yes is set to False.

The code then checks if yes is True. Since yes is True, the code prints "Yes".

The output of code execution is:
Yes
END-OF-OUTPUT
