Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
import math
n, p = map(int, input().split())
if n==1:
	print(p)
else:
	ans = 1
	limit = math.ceil(p**(1/n))
	while(limit>1):
		cnt = 0
		a = p
		while(a!=0):
			if a%limit == 0:
				cnt += 1
				a = a // limit
			else:
				break
		if cnt >= n:
			ans = limit
			break
		limit -= 1
	print(ans)
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
3 24

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable n is initialized to 3 and variable p is initialized to 24.
The code checks if n is equal to 1. If it is, it prints the value of p and exits.
If n is not equal to 1, the code initializes the variable ans to 1 and the variable limit to the smallest integer greater than or equal to the square root of p.
The code then enters a while loop that continues until limit is less than or equal to 1.
Inside the while loop, the code initializes the variable cnt to 0 and the variable a to p.
The code then enters another while loop that continues until a is equal to 0.
Inside the while loop, the code checks if a is divisible by limit. If it is, it increments cnt by 1 and sets a to a divided by limit.
If a is not divisible by limit, the code exits the while loop.
If cnt is greater than or equal to n, the code sets ans to limit and exits the while loop.
If cnt is less than n, the code decrements limit by 1 and continues the while loop.
After the while loop finishes, the code prints the value of ans, which is 6.

The output of code execution is:
6
