The code defines a function d_XorSum that takes an integer N as input and returns the number of distinct pairs of integers (u,v) such that 0<=u,v<=N and u xor v = N.

The function uses dynamic programming to compute the answer in O(NlogN) time complexity. The memo dictionary is used to store previously computed values of f(k), where k is the input integer N.

The base cases are f(0) = 1 and f(1) = 2, since there is only one way to form a pair of integers (u,v) with u xor v = 0 and there are two ways to form a pair of integers with u xor v = 1.

The recursive case is f(k) = (f(k/2) + f((k-1)/2) + f((k-2)/2)) % MOD, where k is even. This is because there are three ways to form a pair of integers (u,v) with u xor v = k: (u,v), (u+v,v), and (u,v+u).

The function returns f(N) as the answer.

The input integer N is read from the standard input and passed to the d_XorSum function. The output of the function is printed to the standard output.

The input is:
3

The output is:
3

The output is 3, which is the correct answer for the given input.
