Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
def inpl(): return list(map(int, input().split()))
N, M = inpl()

n2 = N * 1
n1 = N * 1
m1 = M * 1
mall = M * 2

# うくをほろぼす
ans1 = 0
while True:
    mall -= n1
    m1 = -(-mall//2)
    
    if mall <= 0:
        break
    ans1 += 1
    
    if n2 - m1 >= 0:
        n2 -= m1
    else:
        n1 = n1 + n2 - m1
        n2 = 0
    if n1 <= 0:

        break
    ans1 += 1

# ushiを滅ぼす

ans2 = 0
n2 = N * 1
n1 = N * 1
m1 = M * 1
m2 = M * 1
mall = M * 2
nall = N * 2

while True:
    if m2 - n1 >= 0:
        m2 -= n1
    else:
        m1 = m1 + m2 - n1
        m2 = 0
    if m1 <= 0:

        break
    ans2 += 1

    nall -= m1
    n1 = -(-nall//2)
    
    if nall <= 0:
        break
    ans2 += 1

print(min(ans1, ans2))

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 10

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable N and variable M are initialized to 20 and 10, respectively.

The function inpl() is defined to read input as a list of integers.

The variables n2, n1, m1, mall, ans1, ans2, nall are initialized to N, N, M, M*2, 0, 0, N*2.

The code then enters a while loop that continues until the condition is met.

In the first while loop, the variable mall is decremented by n1. This means that the number of mall is reduced by the number of n1.

The variable m1 is then calculated as -(-mall//2). This means that m1 is set to the largest integer that is less than or equal to mall/2.

If mall is less than or equal to 0, the loop breaks.

The variable ans1 is incremented by 1. This means that the number of times the first while loop is executed is counted.

If n2 - m1 is greater than or equal to 0, n2 is decremented by m1. This means that the number of n2 is reduced by the number of m1.

If n2 - m1 is less than 0, n1 is incremented by n2 - m1. This means that the number of n1 is increased by the difference between n2 and m1.

If n1 is less than or equal to 0, the loop breaks.

The variable ans1 is incremented by 1. This means that the number of times the first while loop is executed is counted.

In the second while loop, the variable m2 is decremented by n1. This means that the number of m2 is reduced by the number of n1.

If m2 - n1 is greater than or equal to 0, m2 is decremented by n1. This means that the number of m2 is reduced by the number of n1.

If m2 - n1 is less than 0, m1 is incremented by m2 - n1. This means that the number of m1 is increased by the difference between m2 and n1.

If m1 is less than or equal to 0, the loop breaks.

The variable ans2 is incremented by 1. This means that the number of times the second while loop is executed is counted.

The variable nall is decremented by m1. This means that the number of nall is reduced by the number of m1.

The variable n1 is then calculated as -(-nall//2). This means that n1 is set to the largest integer that is less than or equal to nall/2.

If nall is less than or equal to 0, the loop breaks.

The variable ans2 is incremented by 1. This means that the number of times the second while loop is executed is counted.

Finally, the code prints the minimum value of ans1 and ans2, which is 1.

The output of code execution is:
1
