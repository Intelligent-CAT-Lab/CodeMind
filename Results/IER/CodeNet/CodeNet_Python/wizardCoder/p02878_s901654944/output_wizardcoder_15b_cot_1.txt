Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
MOD = 998244353

if B == 0:
    print(1)
    exit()

f = 1
F = [1] * (N + 1)
for i in range(1, N + 1):
    F[i] = f = f * i % MOD

FI = [1] * (N + 1)
FI[N] = fi = pow(f, MOD - 2, MOD)
for i in range(N, 1, -1):
    FI[i - 1] = fi = fi * i % MOD

z = 0
for k in range(min(A + 1, N - B) if N - B - A else A + 1):
    x = (B - k) * F[B + k - 1] * FI[B] * FI[k] % MOD
    y = F[N + A - B - 2 * k - 1] * FI[N - B - k - 1] * FI[A - k] % MOD
    z = (z + x * y) % MOD

print(z)
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
5 1 3

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 5, 1 and 3, respectively.
The variable MOD is initialized to 998244353.

The code checks if B is equal to 0. If it is, it prints 1 and exits the program.

If B is not equal to 0, the code initializes two arrays F and FI.
The array F is initialized to 1, and the array FI is initialized to 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 5.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the product of all previous numbers in the array F and stores it in F[i].
The code also calculates the product of all previous numbers in the array FI and stores it in FI[i].

After the loop finishes, the code initializes a variable z to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to min(A + 1, N - B) if N - B - A is greater than 0, otherwise it iterates from 0 to A + 1.
For each value of k in this range, it calculates the value of x and y using the formula given in the problem statement.
The code then adds the product of x and y to z.

After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of z, which is 1.

The output of code execution is:
1
