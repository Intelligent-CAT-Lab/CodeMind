Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
def examC():
    St = S()
    t = ["dream", "dreamer", "erase", "eraser"]
    i = len(St)-1
    cur = ""
    while i>=0:
#        print(cur)
        cur = St[i] + cur
        i -=1
        if cur in t:
            cur = ""
    if len(cur)==0:
        ans = "YES"
    else:
        ans = "NO"
    print(ans)


import sys
def I(): return int(sys.stdin.readline())
def LI(): return list(map(int,sys.stdin.readline().split()))
def LS(): return sys.stdin.readline().split()
def S(): return sys.stdin.readline().strip()
mod = 10**9 + 7
inf = float('inf')

examC()

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
erasedream

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The code defines a function examC that takes no arguments.

The function first creates an instance of the class S, which is not defined in the code. It is assumed that S is a class that takes no arguments and returns a string.

The function then initializes a list t with four strings "dream", "dreamer", "erase", "eraser".

The function then initializes a variable i to the length of the string returned by S minus 1.

The function then initializes a variable cur to an empty string.

The function then enters a while loop that continues as long as i is greater than or equal to 0.

Inside the while loop, the function concatenates the character at index i of the string returned by S with the current value of cur, and stores the result back in cur.

The function then decrements i by 1.

The function then checks if the current value of cur is in the list t. If it is, the function sets cur to an empty string.

After the while loop finishes, the function checks if the length of cur is 0. If it is, the function sets ans to "YES". Otherwise, it sets ans to "NO".

Finally, the function prints the value of ans.

The code then calls the examC function.

The input "erasedream" is passed to the standard input of the program.

The output of the program is:
YES
END-OF-OUTPUT
