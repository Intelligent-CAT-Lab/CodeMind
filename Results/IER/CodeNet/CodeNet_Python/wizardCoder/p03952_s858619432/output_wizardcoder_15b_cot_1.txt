Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
n, x = (int(x) for x in input().split())
if x == 1 or x == 2 * n - 1:
    print("No")
    exit()

if n == 2:
    print("Yes")
    print(1)
    print(2)
    print(3)
    exit()

if x == 2:
    y = [3, 2, 1, 4]
else:
    y = [x - 1, x, x + 1, x - 2]

ANS = []
i = 1
while i < 2 * n:
    if len(ANS) == 2 * n - 1:
        break
    if i in y:
        i += 4
    if len(ANS) == n - 3:
        ANS += y
        if len(ANS) == 2 * n - 1:
            break
    ANS.append(i)
    i += 1

print("Yes")
for ans in ANS:
    print(ans)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
4 4

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable n and variable x are initialized to 4 and 4, respectively.
The code checks if x is equal to 1 or 2 * n - 1. If it is, it prints "No" and exits the program.
If n is equal to 2, it prints "Yes" and prints the numbers 1, 2, and 3 and exits the program.
If x is equal to 2, it initializes the list y to [3, 2, 1, 4].
Otherwise, it initializes y to [x - 1, x, x + 1, x - 2].
The variable ANS is initialized to an empty list.
The variable i is initialized to 1.
The code enters a while loop that continues until i is less than 2 * n.
Inside the loop, it checks if i is in y. If it is, it increments i by 4.
If the length of ANS is equal to n - 3, it appends the elements of y to ANS.
If the length of ANS is equal to 2 * n - 1, it breaks out of the loop.
Otherwise, it appends i to ANS and increments i by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints "Yes" and then prints each element of ANS on a new line.

The output of code execution is:
