Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
a=raw_input()
l=len(a)
i=ans=0
while i<l:
	lenj=leno=leni=0
	while i<l and a[i]=="J":
		lenj+=1
		i+=1
	while i<l and a[i]=="O":
		leno+=1
		i+=1
	while i<l and a[i]=="I":
		leni+=1
		i+=1
	if lenj>=leno and leni>=leno:
		ans=max(ans,leno)
print ans
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
OJJOOIIOJOI

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable a is initialized to "OJJOOIIOJOI".
The variable l is initialized to the length of a, which is 14.
The variable i is initialized to 0, which will be used to iterate through the string a.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to store the maximum length of consecutive "O"s that end with "I".
The code then enters a while loop that continues as long as i is less than l.
Inside the while loop, three variables lenj, leno, and leni are initialized to 0, which will be used to store the lengths of consecutive "J", "O", and "I"s, respectively.
The code then enters three while loops that continue as long as i is less than l and the current character a[i] is "J", "O", or "I", respectively.
Inside each of these while loops, the length of the current character is incremented and i is incremented.
After the three while loops finish, the code checks if lenj is greater than or equal to leno and leni is greater than or equal to leno. If this condition is met, the code updates ans to be the maximum of its current value and leno.
After the while loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 4.

The output of code execution is:
4
END-OF-OUTPUT
