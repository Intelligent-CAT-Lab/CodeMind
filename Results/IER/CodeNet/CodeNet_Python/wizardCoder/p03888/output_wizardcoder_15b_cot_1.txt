Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
import math
import sys

def getinputdata():

    # 配列初期化
    array_result = []
    
    data = input()
    
    array_result.append(data.split(" "))

    flg = 1

    try:
        while flg:

            data = input()

            array_temp = []

            if(data!= ""):
                
                array_result.append(data.split(" "))

                flg = 1

            else:

                flg = 0
    finally:


        return array_result

arr_data = getinputdata()

r1 = int(arr_data[0][0])
r2 = int(arr_data[0][1])


print(1/((r2+r1) /(r1*r2)))
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
2 3

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The code first imports the math and sys modules. It then defines a function called getinputdata(). This function reads input data from the standard input and returns it as an array. The function uses a flag variable to keep track of whether there is more input to be read. If there is, it reads the input and appends it to the array. If there is no more input, it sets the flag to 0 and returns the array.

The main program then reads the input data from the standard input using the getinputdata() function. It reads the first two integers, r1 and r2, from the first line of input.

The program then calculates the value of 1/((r2+r1) /(r1*r2)) and prints it to the standard output.

The output of code execution is:
0.5
END-OF-OUTPUT
