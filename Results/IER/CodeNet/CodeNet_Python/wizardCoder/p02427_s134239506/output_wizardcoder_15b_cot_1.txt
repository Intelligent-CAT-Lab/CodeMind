Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
n=int(input())
m=2**n
for i in range(m):
    temp=[0 for i in range(n)]
    j=i
    count=0
    while j>0:
        if j%2==1:
            temp[count]=1
            #print(count,temp[count])
        j//=2
        count+=1

    temp2=[]
    for k in range(n):
        if temp[k]==1:
            temp2.append(k)
    print(i,end="")
    if i!=0:
        print(":",end=" " )
        print(*temp2)
    else:
        print(":")


<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
4

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable n is initialized to 4.
The variable m is initialized to 2^n, which is 16.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to m-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 15.
For each number i in this range, it creates a temporary list temp of length n, initialized to 0.
It then converts the number i to binary and iterates through each bit of the binary representation. If the bit is 1, it sets the corresponding element of temp to 1.
It also keeps track of the current position in the binary representation using the variable count.
After the loop finishes, the code creates a new list temp2, which contains the indices of the 1's in temp.
It then prints the current number i and the indices of the 1's in temp2, separated by a colon. If i is 0, it prints a newline character instead of a colon.

The output of code execution is:
0: 0
1: 1
2: 2
3: 3
4: 4
5: 5
6: 6
7: 7
8: 8
9: 9
10: 10
11: 11
12: 12
13: 13
14: 14
15: 15
