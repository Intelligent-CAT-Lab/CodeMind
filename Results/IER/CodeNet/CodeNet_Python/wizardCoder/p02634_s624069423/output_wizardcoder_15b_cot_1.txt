Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
a,b,c,d=map(int,input().split())

#ここまでのパテーン
#dp[y][x]=dp[y][x-1]*y +dp[y-1][x]*x

dp=[[0]*(d) for _ in range(c)]
dp[a-1][b-1]=1
mod=998244353

if a==c and b==d:
    print(1)
    exit()

if a==c:
    print((a**(d-b))%mod)
    exit()
if b==d:
    print((b**(c-a))%mod)
    exit()


for y in range(a-1,c):
    for x in range(b-1,d):
        
        dp[y][x]+=dp[y][x-1]*(y+1)+dp[y-1][x]*(x+1)-dp[y-1][x-1]*x*y
        dp[y][x]=dp[y][x]%mod
        #print(y,x,dp[y][x])

print(dp[-1][-1]%mod)

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
1 1 2 2

### Response:
The variable a, variable b, variable c, and variable d are initialized to 1, 1, 2, and 2, respectively.

The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to c-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider columns from 0 to 1 (inclusive).
