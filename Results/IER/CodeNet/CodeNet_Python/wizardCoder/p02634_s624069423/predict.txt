The variable a, variable b, variable c, and variable d are initialized to 1, 1, 2, and 2, respectively.

The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to c-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider columns from 0 to 1 (inclusive).
For each column x in this range, it calculates the sum of the values in the corresponding row y, which is 0 in this case.
