Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
a,b,k = map(int,input().split())

ans = []
for val in range(1,min(a,b)+1):
    #print(val)
    if a % val == 0 and b % val ==0:
        ans.append(val)
        #print(val)

print(ans[-k])
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
8 12 2

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable a, variable b and variable k are initialized to 8, 12 and 2, respectively.

The variable ans is initialized as an empty list, which will be used to store the values of the factors of a and b.

The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to the minimum of a and b (inclusive), meaning it will consider values from 1 to 8.

For each value val in this range, it checks if a is divisible by val and b is divisible by val. If it is, it adds val to the list ans.

After the loop finishes, the code prints the k-th last element of the list ans, which is 2.

The output of code execution is:
2
END-OF-OUTPUT
