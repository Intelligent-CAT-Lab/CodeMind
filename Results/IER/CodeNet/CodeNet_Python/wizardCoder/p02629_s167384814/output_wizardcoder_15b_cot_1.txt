Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
L=[26**i for i in range(13)]
#print(L)
gun=[sum(L[1:i])for i in range(2,13)]
#print(gun)
N=int(input())
i=0
while N > gun[i]:
  i += 1
#print(i)
if i!= 0:
  N = N - gun[i-1] #これを26進法
N -= 1
#print(N)
L=[]
for k in range(1,i+2):
   L.append(N//(26**(i+1-k)))
   N = N % (26**(i+1-k))
#print(L)
L=[chr(i+97) for i in L]
#print(L)
print(''.join(L))

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
2

### Response:
The variable L is initialized to a list of 13 powers of 26, which is [26, 676, 17576, 456976, 11881376, 308915776, 790599168, 20326393024, 514229687296, 13292279957824, 343597383689024, 8796093022208000, 230584300813995264].
The variable gun is initialized to a list of the cumulative sums of the first 12 elements of L, which is [26, 193, 11213, 576485, 24414069, 976562501, 4194304001, 157286400013, 5872025600005, 2063912320000013, 7922816251426433, 302231454903657293].
The variable N is initialized to 2.
The variable i is initialized to 0, which will be used to keep track of the index of the last gun element that is less than or equal to N.
The code enters a while loop that continues as long as N is greater than gun[i].
The code increments i by 1 in each iteration of the loop.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if i is not equal to 0. If it is not, it subtracts the cumulative sum of the last i-1 elements of gun from N. This is because the last i-1 elements of gun represent the digits of N in base 26, and we need to convert N to base 26 before we can extract the digits.
The code then subtracts 1 from N to convert it to base 10.
The code initializes an empty list L.
The code enters a for loop that iterates from 1 to i+1 (inclusive).
For each value of k in this range, the code calculates the value of L[k-1] as the floor division of N by 26 raised to the power of i+1-k. This is because the i+1-k-th power of 26 is the base of the number represented by the i+1-k elements of gun.
The code then updates N to be the remainder of N divided by 26 raised to the power of i+1-k.
After the loop finishes, the code initializes a new list L to be a list of the characters corresponding to the values of L.
The code then joins the characters in L into a single string and prints it.

The output of code execution is:
bc
