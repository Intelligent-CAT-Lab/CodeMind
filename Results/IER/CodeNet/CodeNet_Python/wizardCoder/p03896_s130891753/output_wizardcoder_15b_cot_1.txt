Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
N = int(input())
if N == 2:
    print(-1)
    exit()

ans = [[0 for j in range(N-1)] for i in range(N)]
for i in range(N):
    for j in range(N-1):
        ans[i][j] = (i+j+1)%N + 1

if N%2 == 0:
    m = N//2
    for i in range(m,N):
        ans[i][m],ans[i][m-1] = ans[i][m-1],ans[i][m]

for row in ans:
    print(' '.join(map(str,row)))

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
7

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable N is initialized to 7.
The code checks if N is equal to 2. If it is, it prints -1 and exits the program.
The variable ans is initialized to a 2D list of size N x (N-1), where each element is initialized to 0.
The code then enters a nested loop that iterates over all possible pairs of indices (i,j) such that 0 <= i < j < N.
For each pair (i,j), the code sets ans[i][j] to the sum of (i+j+1) modulo N plus 1.
The code then checks if N is even. If it is, it sets the variable m to N divided by 2.
The code then enters another nested loop that iterates over all indices i such that m <= i < N.
For each index i, the code swaps the elements ans[i][m] and ans[i][m-1].
The code then prints each row of ans as a space-separated string using the map function and the join method.

The output of code execution is:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7
2 1 4 3 6 5 7
3 4 1 2 7 6 5
4 3 6 1 5 7 2
5 6 7 4 1 2 3
6 5 2 7 3 1 4
7 7 5 6 4 3 1
