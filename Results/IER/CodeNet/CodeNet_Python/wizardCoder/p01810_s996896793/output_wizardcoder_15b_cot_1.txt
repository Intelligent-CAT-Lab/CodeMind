Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
# coding: utf-8
# Here your code!

def main(N,k):
    p = 0
    p2 = 0
    memo = 0
    for i in range(N-1):
        p, p2 = p2, k*(p2+1)//(k-1) - 2
        while p2-1-p2//k!= p:
            p2+=1
    return p2

if __name__ == '__main__':
    N,k=input().split()
    print(main(int(N),int(k)))
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
4 2

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable N is initialized to 4 and variable k is initialized to 2.
The function main() is defined with two parameters N and k.
The variables p and p2 are initialized to 0, which will be used to store the values of the sequence.
The variable memo is initialized to 0, which will be used to store the value of the last term of the sequence.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to N-2 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 3.
For each iteration, the values of p and p2 are updated using the formula p2, k*(p2+1)//(k-1) - 2.
The code then enters a while loop that continues until the condition p2-1-p2//k!= p is not met.
Inside the while loop, the value of p2 is incremented by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the value of p2, which is 11.

The output of code execution is:
11
