Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import sys
import math
from bisect import bisect_right as br
from bisect import bisect_left as bl
sys.setrecursionlimit(2147483647)
from heapq import heappush, heappop,heappushpop
from collections import defaultdict
from itertools import accumulate
from collections import Counter
from collections import deque
from operator import itemgetter
from itertools import permutations
mod = 10**9 + 7
inf = float('inf')
def I(): return int(sys.stdin.readline())
def LI(): return list(map(int,sys.stdin.readline().split()))

t = input()
n = len(t)
ans = []
for i in range(n):
    if t[i] == '?':
        ans.append('D')
    else:
        ans.append(t[i])
print(''.join(ans))
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
PD?D??P

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The code takes a string as input and replaces all the '?' characters with 'D' characters. The output is the modified string.

The code first reads the input string 't' from the user.

The variable 'n' is initialized to the length of the input string 't'.

The variable 'ans' is initialized to an empty list.

The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n-1.

For each index i in the loop, if the character at index i in the input string 't' is '?', then the code appends 'D' to the list 'ans'. Otherwise, the code appends the character at index i in the input string 't' to the list 'ans'.

After the loop finishes, the code joins the list 'ans' into a string using the join() method and prints the modified string.

The output of code execution is:
PDDDDPP
END-OF-OUTPUT
