The code starts by importing the Counter and sys modules. The Counter module is used to count the occurrences of each character in the input string S. The sys module is used to set the recursion limit to 10^6, which is the maximum allowed value.

The input string S is read from the standard input and converted to a list of integers using the ABC function. This function takes a character and returns its index in the string "abc".

The length of the input string S is stored in the variable N.

The bruteforce function is defined. This function takes a list of integers S and returns the number of distinct permutations of S. The function uses a set to keep track of the permutations that have already been used. The function defines a nested function dfs that takes a list of integers s and recursively generates all permutations of s. The function checks if the current permutation has already been used by converting it to a tuple and checking if it is in the set of used permutations. If it has not been used, the function adds it to the set of used permutations and swaps the characters at indices i and i+1 of s. It then recursively calls dfs with the modified s. Finally, the function returns the number of distinct permutations of s.

If the length of S is less than or equal to 3, the function bruteforce is called with S as its argument. Otherwise, the code initializes a 3x3x2 array P and a 3x3x2 array Q. The array P is used to store the number of permutations of S that end in each of the three possible characters. The array Q is used to store the number of permutations of S that end in each of the three possible characters, but with the characters at indices i and i+1 swapped.

The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to N-2. For each index i, the code initializes the values of P and Q to 0. The code then enters another loop that iterates from 0 to 2.
