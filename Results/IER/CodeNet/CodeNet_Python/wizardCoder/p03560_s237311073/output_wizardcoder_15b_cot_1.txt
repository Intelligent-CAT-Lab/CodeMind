Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
from collections import deque


def calc(k):
    if k == 1:
        return 1
    d = {1: 1}
    q = deque([[1, 1]])
    while q:
        n, c = q.popleft()
        a = (n * 10) % k
        if a not in d or c < d[a]:
            d[a] = c
            q.appendleft([a, c])
        b = (n + 1) % k
        if b not in d or c + 1 < d[b]:
            d[b] = c + 1
            q.append([b, c + 1])
    return d[0]


print(calc(int(input())))
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
6

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The code defines a function called calc that takes an integer k as input. The function returns the minimum number of moves required to reach the target state (i.e., state 0) from any state in the k-state space.

The function uses a breadth-first search algorithm to find the minimum number of moves required to reach the target state from any state in the k-state space. The algorithm uses a dictionary to keep track of the minimum number of moves required to reach each state from the current state. The algorithm starts with the initial state (i.e., state 1) and adds it to a queue. The algorithm then iterates over the queue, processing each state in the queue in turn. For each state, the algorithm calculates the two possible next states (i.e., state a and state b) and adds them to the queue if they have not already been processed and if they are not already in the queue. The algorithm updates the dictionary with the minimum number of moves required to reach each state from the current state.

The function returns the minimum number of moves required to reach the target state from any state in the k-state space.

The code then calls the calc function with the input integer k (i.e., 6) and prints the result, which is 3.

The output of code execution is:
3
