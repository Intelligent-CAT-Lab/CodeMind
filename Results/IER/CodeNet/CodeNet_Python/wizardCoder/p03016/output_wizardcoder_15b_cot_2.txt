Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
import numpy as np


def exp_np(a, e, m):
    r = np.identity(a.shape[0], dtype=np.int64)
    t = a.copy()
    while e:
        if e % 2:
            r = np.dot(r, t) % m
        t = np.dot(t, t) % m
        e >>= 1
    return r


l, a, b, m = map(int, input().split())

first_d = len(str(a))
tail = a + b * (l - 1)

lo = -1
state = np.array([[0, a % m, 1]])

for d in range(first_d, 19):
    hi = min((10 ** d - 1 - a) // b, l - 1)
    cnt = hi - lo
    coe = np.array([
        [pow(10, d, m), 0, 0],
        [1, 1, 0],
        [0, b % m, 1]
    ], dtype=np.int64)

    coe = exp_np(coe, cnt, m)
    state = np.dot(state, coe) % m

    lo = hi
    if hi == l - 1:
        break

print(state[0][0])

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
5 3 4 10007

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable l, variable a, variable b and variable m are initialized to 5, 3, 4 and 10007, respectively.

The function exp_np(a, e, m) is defined to calculate the modular exponentiation of a matrix a raised to the power e modulo m.

The variable first_d is initialized to the length of the string representation of a, which is 1.

The variable tail is initialized to the sum of a and b multiplied by l-1, which is 12.

The variable lo is initialized to -1, which is the lower bound of the range of values for d.

The variable state is initialized to a 2x3 matrix with the first row as [0, a % m, 1].

The loop iterates over the values of d from first_d to 18 (inclusive).

For each value of d, the variable hi is initialized to the minimum of (10^d - 1 - a) // b and l-1.

The variable cnt is initialized to hi - lo, which is 4 in this case.

The variable coe is initialized to a 3x3 matrix with the first row as [10^d % m, 0, 0], the second row as [1, 1, 0] and the third row as [0, b % m, 1].

The matrix coe is raised to the power cnt modulo m using the function exp_np(a, e, m).

The variable state is updated by multiplying it with the matrix coe modulo m.

The variable lo is updated to hi.

If hi is equal to l-1, the loop breaks.

Finally, the code prints the first element of the matrix state, which is 12.

The output of code execution is:
12
