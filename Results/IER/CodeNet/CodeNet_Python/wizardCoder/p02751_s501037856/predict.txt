The variable N and variable M are initialized to 1 and 2, respectively.
The code imports the necessary modules, including numpy.
The code defines a function solve(N,M) that takes in two parameters, N and M, and returns a numpy array H.
The function first checks if N is greater than M. If it is, it calls the function recursively with M and N swapped, and transposes the resulting array.
The function then initializes H to a 1x1 array of value 0.
The function then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to M-1. For each iteration, it creates a new array H by tiling the previous array H by 2x2.
The function then sets the bottom-right quadrant of H to 1, effectively flipping the bits of the previous array H.
The function then sets the top-right and bottom-left quadrants of H to 0, effectively removing the top and left borders of the previous array H.
The function then sets the top-left and bottom-right quadrants of H to 1, effectively removing the bottom and right borders of the previous array H.
The function then sets the top-left and bottom-right quadrants of H to 0, effectively removing the top and right borders of the previous array H.
