Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
import sys
read = sys.stdin.buffer.read
readline = sys.stdin.buffer.readline
readlines = sys.stdin.buffer.readlines

import numpy as np

N,M = map(int,read().split())

def solve(N,M):
    if N > M:
        return solve(M,N).T
    H = np.array([[0]], np.int8)
    for i in range(M):
        H = np.tile(H, (2,2))
        H[1<<i:,1<<i:] ^= 1
    H = np.diff(H, axis=0)
    H = np.diff(H, axis=1)
    return (H % 2)[:(1<<N) - 1]

H = solve(N,M)
size = 0
for row in H:
    word = ''.join(row.astype(str))
    print(word)

### Response:
The variable N and variable M are initialized to 1 and 2, respectively.
The code imports the necessary modules, including numpy.
The code defines a function solve(N,M) that takes in two parameters, N and M, and returns a numpy array H.
The function first checks if N is greater than M. If it is, it calls the function recursively with M and N swapped, and transposes the resulting array.
The function then initializes H to a 1x1 array of value 0.
The function then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to M-1. For each iteration, it creates a new array H by tiling the previous array H by 2x2.
The function then sets the bottom-right quadrant of H to 1, effectively flipping the bits of the previous array H.
The function then sets the top-right and bottom-left quadrants of H to 0, effectively removing the top and left borders of the previous array H.
The function then sets the top-left and bottom-right quadrants of H to 1, effectively removing the bottom and right borders of the previous array H.
The function then sets the top-left and bottom-right quadrants of H to 0, effectively removing the top and right borders of the previous array H.
