Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
def contains3(n):
    x = n
    while x > 0:
        if x % 10 == 3:
            return True
        else:
            x //= 10
    return False

x = int(input())
out = ""
for i in range(x):
    n = i + 1
    if n % 3 == 0 or contains3(n):
        out += (" %d" % n)
print(out)
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
30

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The function contains3 takes an integer n as input and returns True if n contains the digit 3, and False otherwise. It does this by repeatedly dividing n by 10 and checking if the remainder is 3. If it is, the function returns True. If n becomes 0, the function returns False.

The input x is read as an integer from the user.

The variable out is initialized to an empty string, which will be used to accumulate the output.

The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to x-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 29.

For each number i in this range, it calculates the current number n as i+1.

If n is divisible by 3, or if it contains the digit 3 using the contains3 function, it adds the current number n to the output string out using the %d format specifier.

After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of out, which is " 3 6 9 12 15 18 21 24 27".

The output of code execution is:

3 6 9 12 15 18 21 24 27
END-OF-OUTPUT
