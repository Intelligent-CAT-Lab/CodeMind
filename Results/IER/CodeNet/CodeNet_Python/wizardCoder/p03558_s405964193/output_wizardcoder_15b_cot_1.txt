Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
import queue


def bfs01(s: int, t: int, V: int, graph: list)->int:
    INF = float('inf')

    q = queue.deque([])
    qc = 0
    l = [INF] * V

    q.append(s)
    qc += 1
    l[s] = 0

    while qc > 0:
        u = q.popleft()
        qc -= 1
        for v, c in graph[u]:
            if l[u] + c < l[v]:
                l[v] = l[u] + c
                qc += 1
                if c == 0:
                    q.appendleft(v)
                else:
                    q.append(v)

    return l[t]


def small_multiple(K: int)->int:
    graph = []
    for k in range(K):
        graph.append([])
        v1 = k+1 if k+1 < K else 0
        v10 = (k*10) % K

        graph[k].append((v1, 1))
        if v10!= k:
            graph[k].append((v10, 0))

    return bfs01(1, 0, K, graph) + 1


if __name__ == "__main__":
    K = int(input())
    ans = small_multiple(K)
    print(ans)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
6

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable K is initialized to 6.
The function small_multiple is called with K as an argument.
The function creates a graph of K nodes and adds edges between nodes based on the rules of the problem.
The function calls the bfs01 function to find the shortest path from node 1 to node 0.
The function returns the length of the shortest path plus 1, which is 3 in this case.
The main function prints the value of ans, which is 3.

The output of code execution is:
3
