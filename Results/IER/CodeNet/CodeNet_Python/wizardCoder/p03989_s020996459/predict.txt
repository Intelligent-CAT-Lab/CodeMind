The variable n and k are initialized to 3 and 1, respectively.

The variable fac is initialized to a list of length n+1, where each element is initialized to 1.

The variable dp is initialized to a list of length n+1, where each element is initialized to a list of length 2, where each element is initialized to 0.

The variable last is initialized to 0.

The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to min(n,2*k), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 2.

For each number i in this range, it enters a while loop that iterates from i to n, meaning it will consider numbers from i to n.

Inside the while loop, it calculates the variable idx as the current index i.
