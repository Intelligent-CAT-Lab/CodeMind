Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
import sys
readline = sys.stdin.readline
readlines = sys.stdin.readlines

import numpy as np

N = int(readline())

grid = np.zeros((N,N),np.int8)

grid[::2,::2] = 1
grid[1::2,1::2] = 1

grid[::6,1::6] = 1
grid[::6,5::6] = 1
grid[2::6,1::6] = 1
grid[2::6,3::6] = 1
grid[4::6,3::6] = 1
grid[4::6,5::6] = 1

grid[0,:] = 1
grid[-1,:] = 1
grid[:,0] = 1
grid[:,-1] = 1

grid[::2,::2] = 0
grid[1::2,1::2] = 0

x,y = np.where(grid==1)

print(len(x))
for cell in zip(x,y):
    print(*cell)


<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
2

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The code first imports the necessary modules, including the sys module for reading input from standard input and the numpy module for working with arrays.

The code then reads the input integer N from standard input using the readline() function.

The code then creates a 2D numpy array of zeros with shape (N,N) and dtype np.int8.

The code then sets the values of the array to 1 in every other row and column, effectively creating a checkerboard pattern.

The code then sets the values of the array to 1 in every sixth row and column, effectively creating a cross pattern.

The code then sets the values of the array to 1 in the first and last rows and columns, effectively creating a border around the grid.

The code then sets the values of the array to 0 in every other row and column, effectively removing the checkerboard pattern.

The code then uses the numpy where() function to find all the indices where the array has a value of 1.

The code then prints the length of the list of indices, which is the number of cells in the grid that are filled with a cross pattern.

The code then loops through the list of indices and prints each index as a tuple of two integers separated by a space.

The output of code execution is:
1
0 0
