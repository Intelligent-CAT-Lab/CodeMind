Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84

Consider the following code: 
S = input()

max0 = 0
max1 = 0
amax0 = []
amax1 = []
mi0 = 0
mi1 = 0
h0 = 0
h1 = 0
for i, c in enumerate(S):
    if c=="1":
        h1 += 1
        if h1-mi1 > max1:
            max1 = h1-mi1
            amax1 = [i]
        elif h1-mi1 == max1:
            amax1.append(i)
        h0 -= 1
        if h0 < mi0:
            mi0 = h0
    elif c=="0":
        h1 -= 1
        if h1 < mi1:
            mi1 = h1
        h0 += 1
        if h0-mi0 > max0:
            max0 = h0-mi0
            amax0 = [i]
        elif h0-mi0 == max0:
            amax0.append(i)
    else:
        h1 -= 1
        if h1 < mi1:
            mi1 = h1
        h0 -= 1
        if h0 < mi0:
            mi0 = h0
if max0 < max1:
    if len(set([i%2 for i in amax1]))==1:
        print(max1)
    else:
        print(max1+1)
elif max0 > max1:
    if len(set([i%2 for i in amax0]))==1:
        print(max0)
    else:
        print(max0+1)
else:
    if len(set([i%2 for i in amax1]+[(max0+i)%2 for i in amax0]))==1:
        print(max0)
    else:
        print(max0+1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
0??

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable S is initialized to "0??".

The variables max0, max1, amax0, amax1, mi0, mi1, h0, and h1 are initialized to 0, 0, [], [], 0, 0, 0, and 0, respectively.

The code then enters a loop that iterates over each character c in S.

If c is "1", then h1 is incremented by 1, and the code checks if h1-mi1 is greater than max1. If it is, then max1 is updated to h1-mi1, and amax1 is updated to [i], where i is the index of the current "1". If h1-mi1 is equal to max1, then amax1 is updated to amax1+[i].

If c is "0", then h1 is decremented by 1, and the code checks if h1 is less than mi1. If it is, then mi1 is updated to h1.

If c is "?", then h1 is decremented by 1, and the code checks if h0 is less than mi0. If it is, then mi0 is updated to h0.

After the loop finishes, the code checks if max0 is less than max1. If it is, then the code checks if the parity of all indices in amax1 is the same. If it is, then the code prints max1. Otherwise, the code prints max1+1.

If max0 is greater than max1, then the code checks if the parity of all indices in amax0 is the same. If it is, then the code prints max0. Otherwise, the code prints max0+1.

If max0 is equal to max1, then the code checks if the parity of all indices in amax1 and the parity of all indices in amax0 (shifted by max0) is the same. If it is, then the code prints max0. Otherwise, the code prints max0+1.

The output of code execution is:
1
