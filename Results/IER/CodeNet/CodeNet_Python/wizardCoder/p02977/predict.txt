The code first imports the sys module and sets the standard input to the file "data.txt". It then defines a lambda function mii that reads input as integers separated by spaces and returns them as a list.

The code then defines a function get that takes an integer n as input and returns a list of edges that form a line graph for the complete graph on n vertices. The line graph is formed by connecting each vertex to its two neighbors, except for the last two vertices, which are connected to the first and second vertices, respectively.

The function first initializes an empty list e and a variable p to 1. It then enters a loop that continues as long as p*2 is less than or equal to n. The loop sets p to p*2.

If n is not equal to p, the function enters another loop that iterates from 1 to m, where m is the largest multiple of 4 that is less than or equal to n. The loop adds edges to e that connect each vertex to its two neighbors, except for the last two vertices, which are connected to the first and second vertices, respectively.

If n is a power of 2, the function adds edges to e that connect the last two vertices to the first and second vertices, respectively.

If n is not a power of 2, the function adds edges to e that connect the last two vertices to the first and second vertices, respectively.

The function then returns the list e.

The code then defines a variable n and initializes it to the integer input. It then calls the get function with n as input and stores the result in a variable e.

If e is not empty, the code prints "Yes" and then iterates over the edges in e and prints each edge as a pair of integers separated by a space.

If e is empty, the code prints "No".

The code then defines a function dfs that takes an integer u as input and performs a depth-first search on the graph g starting at vertex u. The function sets the root of vertex u to the bitwise XOR of u-1 and n, modulo n+1. The function then iterates over the neighbors of u in g and recursively calls dfs on each neighbor.

The code then defines a loop that iterates over the integers 1 to 50. For each integer n, the code calls the get function with n as input and stores the result in a variable e. If e is empty, the code continues to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the code initializes a list g of length 2*n+1, where each element is initially an empty list. The code then iterates over the edges in e and adds each edge to the corresponding lists in g.

The code then enters a loop that iterates over the integers 1 to n. For each integer i, the code initializes a list vis of length 2*n+1, where each element is initially 0, and a list root of length 2*n+1, where each element is initially 0. The code then calls the dfs function with i as input and stores the result in a variable root. The code then checks that the root of vertex n+i is equal to i.

The code then defines a loop that iterates over the integers 1 to n. For each integer i, the code initializes a list vis of length 2*n+1, where each element is initially 0, and a list root of length 2*n+1, where each element is initially 0. The code then calls the dfs function with i as input and stores the result in a variable root. The code then checks that the root of vertex n+i is equal to i.
