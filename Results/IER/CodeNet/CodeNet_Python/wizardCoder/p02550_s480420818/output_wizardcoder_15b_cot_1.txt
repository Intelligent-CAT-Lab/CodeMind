Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
'''
Doubling

nxt[i][r] = the value of r mod M after 2 ** i squaring
dp[i][r] = the sum of sequence of lenght 2 ** i starting from r

We split sequence A into multiple disjoint parts, 
where the lengths of each parts are the binary decomposition of N.

e.g.
N = 11 = 1 + 2 + 8
A = A[0:1], A[1:3], A[3:11]
Sum of each parts are:
sum(A[0:1]) = dp[0][A[0] % M]
sum(A[1:3]) = dp[1][A[1] % M]
sum(A[3:11]) = dp[3][A[3] % M]
'''

import math

N, X, M = map(int, input().split())

H = math.ceil(math.log2(N)) + 1

nxt = [[0] * M for _ in range(H)]
dp = [[0] * M for _ in range(H)]
nxt[0] = [r ** 2 % M for r in range(M)]
dp[0] = list(range(M))

for i in range(1, H):
    for r in range(M):
        nxt[i][r] = nxt[i - 1][nxt[i - 1][r]]
        dp[i][r] = dp[i - 1][r] + dp[i - 1][nxt[i - 1][r]]

ans = 0
r = X % M
for i in range(H):
    if N & (1 << i):
        ans += dp[i][r]
        r = nxt[i][r]
print(ans)


<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
6 2 1001

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable N, variable X and variable M are initialized to 6, 2 and 1001, respectively.

The variable H is calculated as ceil(log2(N)) + 1, which is 4 in this case.

The variable nxt is initialized as a 2D list of size H x M, where each element is initialized to 0.
The variable dp is initialized as a 2D list of size H x M, where each element is initialized to 0.

The first row of nxt is initialized as [r ** 2 % M for r in range(M)], where r is a number from 0 to M-1.
The first row of dp is initialized as [r for r in range(M)].

The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to H-1, meaning it will consider the first 4 binary digits of N.
For each binary digit i in this range, it calculates the next row of nxt and dp using the formula nxt[i][r] = nxt[i - 1][nxt[i - 1][r]] and dp[i][r] = dp[i - 1][r] + dp[i - 1][nxt[i - 1][r]], respectively.

The code then enters another loop that iterates from 0 to H-1, meaning it will consider all binary digits of N.
For each binary digit i in this range, it checks if the i-th bit of N is set to 1. If it is, it adds the value of dp[i][X % M] to ans.
It then updates the value of r to nxt[i][r] using the formula r = nxt[i][r].

The code then prints the final value of ans, which is 10.

The output of code execution is:
10
