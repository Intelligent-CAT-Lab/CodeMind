Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
"""
Bitset I - Bit Operation I

"""
x = int(input())
print(f'{x:032b}')
print(f'{x:032b}'.translate(str.maketrans('01', '10')))
print(f'{x<<1:032b}'[-32:])
print(f'{x>>1:032b}')


<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
8

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable x is initialized to 8.

The first print statement prints the binary representation of x with a width of 32 characters. The format specifier ':032b' means that the number should be padded with zeros on the left to a total width of 32 characters, and the 'b' specifies that the number should be printed in binary format.

The output of the first print statement is:

0000000000000000000000000000000

The second print statement prints the binary representation of x with a width of 32 characters, but with the digits reversed. The 'translate' method is used to create a translation table that maps each '0' to a '1' and each '1' to a '0'. The'maketrans' method is used to create the translation table. The format specifier ':032b' is used again to ensure that the number is printed with a width of 32 characters.

The output of the second print statement is:

10000000000000000000000000000000

The third print statement shifts the binary representation of x to the left by one bit position, and then prints the last 32 bits of the result. The format specifier ':032b' is used again to ensure that the number is printed with a width of 32 characters.

The output of the third print statement is:

00000000000000000000000000000000

The fourth print statement shifts the binary representation of x to the right by one bit position, and then prints the result. The format specifier ':032b' is used again to ensure that the number is printed with a width of 32 characters.

The output of the fourth print statement is:

00000000000000000000000000000001

Therefore, the output of the code execution is:

00000000000000000000000000000000
10000000000000000000000000000000
00000000000000000000000000000000
00000000000000000000000000000001
END-OF-OUTPUT
