The variable x is initialized to 8.

The first print statement prints the binary representation of x with a width of 32 characters. The format specifier ':032b' means that the number should be padded with zeros on the left to a total width of 32 characters, and the 'b' specifies that the number should be printed in binary format.

The output of the first print statement is:

0000000000000000000000000000000

The second print statement prints the binary representation of x with a width of 32 characters, but with the digits reversed. The 'translate' method is used to create a translation table that maps each '0' to a '1' and each '1' to a '0'. The'maketrans' method is used to create the translation table. The format specifier ':032b' is used again to ensure that the number is printed with a width of 32 characters.

The output of the second print statement is:

10000000000000000000000000000000

The third print statement shifts the binary representation of x to the left by one bit position, and then prints the last 32 bits of the result. The format specifier ':032b' is used again to ensure that the number is printed with a width of 32 characters.

The output of the third print statement is:

00000000000000000000000000000000

The fourth print statement shifts the binary representation of x to the right by one bit position, and then prints the result. The format specifier ':032b' is used again to ensure that the number is printed with a width of 32 characters.

The output of the fourth print statement is:

00000000000000000000000000000001

Therefore, the output of the code execution is:

00000000000000000000000000000000
10000000000000000000000000000000
00000000000000000000000000000000
00000000000000000000000000000001
