Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT

Consider the following code: 
from collections import deque
R,C,ay,ax,by,bx = map(int,input().split())

MOD = INF = 10**9+7
dists = [[INF]*C for i in range(R)]
dists[ay][ax] = 0
ptns = [[0]*C for i in range(R)]
ptns[ay][ax] = 1
q = deque([(0,ax,ay)])
dxs = [1,0,-1,0]
dys = [0,1,0,-1]
ans_d = None
while q:
    d,x,y = q.popleft()
    if ans_d is not None and d > ans_d:
        break
    if (x,y) == (bx,by):
        ans_d = d
    if d > dists[y][x]: continue
    dists[y][x] = d
    for dx,dy in zip(dxs,dys):
        nx,ny = x+dx, y+dy
        if not(0 <= nx < C) or not(0 <= ny < R): continue
        if d+1 > dists[ny][nx]: continue
        if dists[ny][nx] == INF:
            q.append((d+1,nx,ny))
            dists[ny][nx] = d+1
        ptns[ny][nx] += ptns[y][x]
        ptns[ny][nx] %= MOD
    for nx,ny in ((x,0),(x,R-1),(0,y),(C-1,y)):
        if d+1 > dists[ny][nx]: continue
        if dists[ny][nx] == INF:
            q.append((d+1,nx,ny))
            dists[ny][nx] = d+1
        ptns[ny][nx] += ptns[y][x]
        ptns[ny][nx] %= MOD

print(ans_d, ptns[by][bx] % MOD)


<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
2 2 0 0 1 1

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable R, C, ay, ax, by, bx are initialized to 2, 2, 0, 0, 1, 1, respectively.

The variable MOD is initialized to 10^9+7.

The variable dists is initialized to a 2x2 matrix with all values set to INF.

The variable ptns is initialized to a 2x2 matrix with all values set to 0.

The variable q is initialized to a deque with a tuple (0,ax,ay).

The variable dxs is initialized to a list [1,0,-1,0].

The variable dys is initialized to a list [0,1,0,-1].

The variable ans_d is initialized to None.

The code then enters a loop that continues until q is empty.

For each tuple (d,x,y) in q, the code checks if ans_d is not None and d > ans_d. If it is, it breaks out of the loop.

If the tuple (x,y) is equal to (bx,by), the code sets ans_d to d.

If d > dists[y][x], the code continues to the next tuple in q.

Otherwise, the code sets dists[y][x] to d and ptns[y][x] to 1.

The code then enters a nested loop that iterates over the four directions (dx,dy) in the list dxs and dys.

For each direction, the code calculates the new position (nx,ny) by adding dx and dy to the current position (x,y).

If the new position is outside the grid, the code continues to the next direction.

If dists[ny][nx] is INF, the code appends a tuple (d+1,nx,ny) to q, sets dists[ny][nx] to d+1, and ptns[ny][nx] to 1.

Otherwise, the code increments ptns[ny][nx] by ptns[y][x] and sets ptns[ny][nx] to ptns[ny][nx] % MOD.

The code then enters another nested loop that iterates over the four corners of the grid (nx,0),(nx,R-1),(0,ny),(C-1,ny).

For each corner, the code calculates the new position (nx,ny) by setting one of the coordinates to 0 or C-1.

If dists[ny][nx] is INF, the code appends a tuple (d+1,nx,ny) to q, sets dists[ny][nx] to d+1, and ptns[ny][nx] to 1.

Otherwise, the code increments ptns[ny][nx] by ptns[y][x] and sets ptns[ny][nx] to ptns[ny][nx] % MOD.

After the loop finishes, the code checks if ans_d is None. If it is, the code prints "No Path" and ends the output.

Otherwise, the code prints ans_d and ptns[by][bx] % MOD, which is 1 in this case.

The output of code execution is:
1 1
