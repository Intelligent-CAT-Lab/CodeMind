Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
import sys
def main():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    K=int(input())
    N=max(2,min(50,K))
    ans=[i+K//N for i in range(N)]
    m=K%N
    for i in range(m):
        for j in range(N):
            if i==j: ans[j]+=N
            else: ans[j]-=1
    print(N)
    print(*ans)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
0

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable K is initialized to 0.
The variable N is initialized to the minimum of 50 and the maximum of 2 and the value of K. In this case, N is initialized to 2.
The variable ans is initialized to a list of length N, where each element is equal to i+K//N, where i ranges from 0 to N-1.
The variable m is initialized to the remainder of K divided by N.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to m-1.
For each iteration, the code enters another loop that iterates from 0 to N-1.
For each j in this range, the code checks if i is equal to j. If it is, the code increments ans[j] by N. Otherwise, it decrements ans[j] by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the value of N followed by the elements of ans separated by spaces.

The output of code execution is:
2
0 1
END-OF-OUTPUT
