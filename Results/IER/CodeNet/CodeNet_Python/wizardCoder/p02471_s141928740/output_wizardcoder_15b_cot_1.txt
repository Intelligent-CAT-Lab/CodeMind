Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
def ex_euclid(x,y):
    c0,c1 = x,y
    a0,a1 = 1,0
    b0,b1 = 0,1
    while c1:
        a0,a1 = a1,a0-c0//c1*a1
        b0,b1 = b1,b0-c0//c1*b1
        c0,c1 = c1,c0%c1
    return c0,a0,b0

x,y = map(int,input().split())
c,a,b = ex_euclid(x,y)
print(a,b)


<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
4 12

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The function ex_euclid takes two integers x and y as input and returns three integers c, a, and b. The function implements the extended Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of x and y.

The input x and y are read from the user using the map function and split method.

The function ex_euclid is called with x and y as arguments and the three integers c, a, and b are assigned to the returned values.

The integers a and b are printed to the console separated by a space.

The output of code execution is:
1 1
