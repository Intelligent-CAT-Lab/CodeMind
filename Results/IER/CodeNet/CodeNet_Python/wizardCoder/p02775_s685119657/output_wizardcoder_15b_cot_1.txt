Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84

[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
n = str(input().rstrip())

def solve1(n):
    ans = 0

    a = list(map(int, list(n)))
    a = a[::-1]
    a.append(0)
    for i in range(len(a) - 1):
        c = a[i]
        if c < 5:
            ans += c
        else:
            if c == 5 and a[i+1] < 5:
                ans += 5
            else:
                a[i+1] += 1
                ans += 10 - c
    ans += n_list[-1]

    print(ans)

def solve2(n):
    INF = 10**9
    n = n[::-1]
    n += '0'
    n_len = len(n)
    dp = [[INF for _ in range(2)] for _ in range(n_len+1)]
    dp[0][0] = 0

    for i in range(n_len):
        for j in range(2):
            x = int(n[i])
            x += j
            if x < 10:
                dp[i+1][0] = min(dp[i+1][0], dp[i][j]+x)
            if x > 0:
                dp[i+1][1] = min(dp[i+1][1], dp[i][j]+(10-x))

    print(dp[n_len][0])
solve2(n)
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
36

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable n is initialized to the input string "36" (without the newline character).

The function solve1(n) is defined. It takes a string n as input and returns the minimum number of coins required to make up the value of n.

The function solve2(n) is defined. It takes a string n as input and returns the minimum number of coins required to make up the value of n.

The function solve1(n) is called with n as input.

The variable a is initialized to a list of integers representing the digits of n in reverse order. For example, if n is "36", then a is [6, 3].

The variable a is reversed and a 0 is appended to the end. This is done to simplify the code for handling the last digit of n.

The variable ans is initialized to 0. This variable will be used to accumulate the number of coins required to make up the value of n.

The code then enters a loop that iterates over the digits of n in reverse order. For each digit c, it checks if c is less than 5. If it is, then c coins are required to make up the value of c. Otherwise, the code checks if c is equal to 5 and the next digit is less than 5. If both conditions are true, then 5 coins are required to make up the value of 5. Otherwise, 10 coins are required to make up the value of c.

The variable ans is updated to include the number of coins required to make up the value of c.

The code then adds the value of the last digit of n to ans.

The function solve1(n) returns the value of ans.

The function solve2(n) is called with n as input.

The variable n is reversed and a 0 is appended to the end. This is done to simplify the code for handling the last digit of n.

The variable n_len is initialized to the length of n.

The variable dp is initialized to a 2D list of size (n_len+1) x 2, where each element is initialized to INF. This variable will be used to store the minimum number of coins required to make up the value of n using 0 or 1 coin for each digit.

The first row of dp is initialized to 0, since the minimum number of coins required to make up the value of 0 using 0 coins is 0.

The code then enters a loop that iterates over the digits of n. For each digit x, it adds x coins using 0 or 1 coin for each digit. If x is less than 10, then the minimum number of coins required to make up the value of x using 0 coins is updated to dp[i+1][0], where i is the index of the current digit. If x is greater than 0, then the minimum number of coins required to make up the value of x using 1 coin is updated to dp[i+1][1], where i is the index of the current digit.

The function solve2(n) returns the value of dp[n_len][0].

The output of code execution is:
1
