Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
n = input()
op_cnt = len(n) - 1
for i in range(2 ** op_cnt):
  op = ['-'] * op_cnt#['-', '-', '-']
  for j in range(op_cnt):
    if ((i >> j) & 1):
      op[-1-j] = '+'
  formula = ''
  for p_n, p_o in zip(n, op + ['']):#(1,+),(2,+),(3,+),(4,'')
    formula += (p_n + p_o)
  if eval(formula) == 7:#'1+2+3+4'
    print(formula + '=7')
    break
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
1222

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable n is initialized to the input value "1222".
The variable op_cnt is initialized to the length of n minus 1, which is 3 in this case.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 7 (inclusive), meaning it will consider all possible combinations of operators.
For each combination of operators, the code initializes a list op with 3 elements, all set to '-'.
The code then iterates over the range of op_cnt, and for each index j, it checks if the j-th bit of the current number i is set to 1. If it is, it sets the j-th element of op to '+'.
The code then constructs a formula by concatenating the elements of n and op, with the last element of op repeated twice.
The formula is then evaluated using the eval() function, and if the result is equal to 7, the code prints the formula and breaks out of the loop.

The output of code execution is:
1+2+2+2=7
