Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
M, D = map(int, input().split())

count = 0
for a in range(1, M+1):
    for b in range(22, D+1):
        d10, d1 = int(str(b)[0]), int(str(b)[1])
        if d10 >= 2 and d1 >= 2 and d10*d1 == a:
            count += 1
            
    
    
print(count)              
    

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
15 40

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable M and variable D are initialized to 15 and 40, respectively.
The variable count is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the number of pairs of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters two nested loops that iterate from 1 to M (inclusive) and from 22 to D (inclusive), respectively.
For each pair of numbers (a, b), the code extracts the last two digits of b and checks if they form a number that is divisible by a.
The condition is met when b is a multiple of a, which is the case when b is a multiple of 10 and a is a multiple of 10.
If the condition is met, the code increments the count variable.
After the loops finish, the code prints the final value of count, which is 1.

The output of code execution is:
1
