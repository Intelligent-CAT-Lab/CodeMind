Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
a,b,c,d,e,f=map(int,input().split())
maxsugar=0
maxwater=100*a
for i in range(31):
    for j in range(31):
        for k in range(3001):
            water=100*a*i+100*b*j
            sugar=c*k
            if water+sugar>f:
                continue
            if sugar>(a*i+b*j)*e:
                continue
            sugar+=min((f-(water+sugar))//d*d,((a*i+b*j)*e-c*k)//d*d)
            if 100*maxsugar*(water+sugar)<100*sugar*(maxsugar+maxwater):
                maxsugar=sugar
                maxwater=water
print(maxsugar+maxwater,maxsugar)
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
1 2 10 20 15 200

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variables a, b, c, d, e, f are initialized to 1, 2, 10, 20, 15, 200, respectively.
The variable maxsugar is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the maximum sugar that can be made.
The variable maxwater is initialized to 100*a, which is the maximum amount of water that can be used.
The code then enters three nested loops that iterate from 0 to 30 for each of the variables i, j, and k.
For each combination of i, j, and k, the code calculates the amount of water and sugar needed to make the drink.
If the amount of water plus the amount of sugar exceeds the maximum amount of sugar that can be made (f), the code skips to the next iteration of the loop.
If the amount of sugar exceeds the maximum amount of sugar that can be made (a*i+b*j)*e, the code skips to the next iteration of the loop.
The code then adds the minimum amount of sugar that can be added to the current amount of sugar to make it within the maximum amount of sugar that can be made (f).
If the current amount of sugar times the maximum amount of water plus the current amount of sugar is less than the current amount of sugar times the maximum amount of sugar plus the maximum amount of water, the code updates the maximum amount of sugar and the maximum amount of water.
After the three loops finish, the code prints the final values of the maximum amount of sugar and the maximum amount of water, which are 200 and 1000, respectively.

The output of code execution is:
1000 200
