Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
n = int(input())
s = []

for i in range(1 << n):
    s.append(f'{i}:')
    for j in range(n):
        if i & 1 << j:
            s.append(f' {j}')
    s.append('\n')

print(''.join(s), end='')


<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
4

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable n is initialized to 4.
The list s is initialized to an empty list.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 2^n-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider all possible binary numbers of length n.
For each binary number i, the code appends a string to the list s that represents the binary number i in the format "i: j1 j2 j3...", where i is the binary number, and j1, j2, j3,... are the indices of the set bits in the binary number.
The code then prints the list s as a single string, separated by newlines.

The output of code execution is:
0: 0
1: 1
2: 0 1
3: 1 0
4: 0 2
5: 1 1
6: 2 0
7: 3 1
8: 0 3
9: 1 2
10: 2 1
11: 3 0
12: 0 4
13: 1 3
14: 2 2
15: 3 1 0
16: 0 5
17: 1 4
18: 2 3
19: 3 2 0
20: 4 0
21: 5 1
22: 6 0
23: 7 1
24: 4 1
25: 5 2
