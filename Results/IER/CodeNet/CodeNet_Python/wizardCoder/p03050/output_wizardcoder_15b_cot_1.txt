Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
#D問題
#D問題
import math
N=int(input())
n=int(math.sqrt(N))
plist=[]
for i in range(1,n+1):
    if N%i == 0:
        plist.append(i)
        if i!= int(N/i):
            plist.append(int(N/i))
ans=0
for i in range(len(plist)):
    x=plist[i]
    kari=int(N/x)-1
    if kari == 0:
        pass
    else:
        q=int(N/kari)
        r=N%kari
        if q == r:
            ans+=kari
print(ans)
            

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
8

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable N is initialized to 8.
The code imports the math module to use the square root function.
The code initializes an empty list called plist.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to the square root of N (inclusive).
For each number i in this range, it checks if N is divisible by i. If it is, it appends i and N/i to the plist.
The code then enters another loop that iterates over the elements of the plist.
For each element x in the plist, it calculates the largest integer k such that x*k <= N.
If k is 1, the code skips to the next element of the plist.
Otherwise, it calculates the quotient q and remainder r of N divided by k.
If q is equal to r, it adds k to the variable ans.
After the second loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 10.

The output of code execution is:
10
