Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
def main():
    n = int(input())

    A = [0] * (10 ** 6)
    for x in range(1, 10 ** 2 + 1):
        for y in range(1, 10 ** 2 + 1):
            for z in range(1, 10 ** 2 + 1):
                i = x ** 2 + y ** 2 + z ** 2 + x*y + y*z + z*x
                A[i] += 1

    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        print(A[i])


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable n is initialized to 20.

The code then initializes an array A of size 10^6, which will be used to count the number of times each number i appears in the sequence.

The code then enters a nested loop that iterates over all possible values of x, y, and z, and calculates the value of i for each combination of x, y, and z. It then increments the value of A[i] by 1.

After the nested loop finishes, the code enters another loop that iterates over the values of i from 1 to n, and prints the value of A[i].

The output of code execution is:
