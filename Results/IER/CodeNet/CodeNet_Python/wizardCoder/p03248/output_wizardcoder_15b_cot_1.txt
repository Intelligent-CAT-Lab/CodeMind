Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
import bisect
s = input()
if s[-1] == "1" or s[0] == "0":
    print(-1)
    exit()

for i in range((len(s) - 1) // 2):
    # print(i,len(s)- i - 2)
    if s[i]!= s[len(s) - i -2]:
        print(-1)
        exit()

sd = s[:-1] + '1'
plist = [i for i, v in enumerate(sd) if v == '1']
# print(plist)
for i,v in enumerate(s[:-1]):
    r = bisect.bisect(plist,i)
    print(i+1,plist[r] + 1)


<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
1111

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable s is initialized to "1111".
The code checks if s ends with "1" or if s starts with "0". If either of these conditions is true, the code prints -1 and exits.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to half the length of s minus 2 (since we are checking pairs of characters).
For each iteration, the code checks if the i-th character of s is equal to the (len(s)-i-2)-th character of s. If they are not equal, the code prints -1 and exits.
After the loop finishes, the code creates a new string sd by appending "1" to the end of s.
The code then creates a list of indices where the characters of sd are equal to "1".
The code then enters another loop that iterates over the characters of s (excluding the last character) and for each character, it finds the index of the next occurrence of "1" in plist using bisect.bisect. It then prints the index of the current character plus 1 and the index of the next occurrence of "1" in plist plus 1.

The output of code execution is:
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
