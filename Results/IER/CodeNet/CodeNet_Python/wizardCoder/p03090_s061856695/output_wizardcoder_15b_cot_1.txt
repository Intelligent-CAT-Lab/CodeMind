Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
num = int(input())
check_list = [0] * num * num

def make_bridge(island1, island2):
    if(island1 < island2):
        check_list[(island1-1)*num + (island2-1)]=1;
    else:
        check_list[(island2-1)*num + (island1-1)]=1;

if num%2==0:
    sum_pair = num+1
else:
    sum_pair = num

for i in range(num):
    for j in range(i):
        if (i+1 + j+1!= sum_pair):
            check_list[j*num + i]=1;

bridge_num=0;

for i in range(num*num):
    if(check_list[i]==1):
        bridge_num+=1;

print(bridge_num);

for i in range(num*num):
    if(check_list[i]==1):
        left = i // num
        right = i % num
        print(str(left+1)+" "+str(right+1));

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
3

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable num is initialized to 3.
The variable check_list is initialized to a list of size 9, which is the square of 3.
The function make_bridge takes two parameters, island1 and island2, and sets the corresponding element in check_list to 1.
The variable sum_pair is initialized to num+1 if num is even, and num if num is odd.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to num-1, meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 2.
For each number i in this range, it enters another loop that iterates from 0 to i-1, meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to i-1.
If the sum of i+1 and j+1 is not equal to sum_pair, it sets the corresponding element in check_list to 1.
The code then enters another loop that iterates from 0 to num*num-1, meaning it will consider all possible pairs of islands.
For each pair of islands, it checks if the corresponding element in check_list is 1. If it is, it increments the variable bridge_num.
The code then enters another loop that iterates from 0 to num*num-1, meaning it will consider all possible pairs of islands.
For each pair of islands, it checks if the corresponding element in check_list is 1. If it is, it calculates the left and right islands of the bridge and prints them.

The output of code execution is:
2
1 2
2 1
