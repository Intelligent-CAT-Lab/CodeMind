Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
a,b,c=map(int,input().split())
d=0
while a%2==0 and b%2==0 and c%2==0:
    if a==b==c:
        print(-1)
        break
    d+=1
    ha=a//2
    hb=b//2
    hc=c//2
    a=hb+hc
    b=ha+hc
    c=ha+hb
else:print(d)
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
4 12 20

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable a, b, and c are initialized to 4, 12, and 20, respectively.
The variable d is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of odd numbers in the sequence.
The code enters a while loop that continues as long as all three variables a, b, and c are even.
Inside the loop, the code checks if all three variables are equal. If they are, the code prints -1 and breaks out of the loop.
If the condition is not met, the code increments d by 1 and updates the values of a, b, and c by dividing them by 2 and adding the result to the next variable.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of d, which is 2.

The output of code execution is:
2
