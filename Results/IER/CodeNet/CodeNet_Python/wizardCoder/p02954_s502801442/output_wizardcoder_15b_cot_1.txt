Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
S = input() + 'O'
N = len(S)
n = [0] * (N - 1)
t = []
i = 0
j =  0
while S[i]!= 'O':
    count = 0
    if S[i] == 'R':
        while S[i] == 'R':
            count += 1
            i += 1
    elif S[i] == 'L':
        while S[i] == 'L':
            count += 1
            i += 1
    t.append(count)
T = int(len(t)/2)  # len(t)は必ず偶数
for i in range(T):
    j += t[2*i]
    if t[2*i] % 2 == 0:
        if t[2*i + 1] % 2 == 0:
            n[j - 1] = int((t[2*i] + t[2*i + 1])/2)
            n[j] = n[j - 1]
        elif t[2*i + 1] % 2 == 1:
            n[j - 1] = int((t[2*i] + t[2*i + 1] - 1)/2)
            n[j] = n[j - 1] + 1
    elif t[2*i] % 2 == 1:
        if t[2*i + 1] % 2 == 0:
            n[j - 1] = int((t[2*i] + t[2*i + 1] + 1)/2)
            n[j] = n[j - 1] - 1
        elif t[2*i + 1] % 2 == 1:
            n[j - 1] = int((t[2*i] + t[2*i + 1])/2)
            n[j] = n[j - 1]
    j += t[2*i+1]
print(' '.join(map(str, n)))

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
RRLRL

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable S is initialized to 'RRLRLO', which is the input string.
The variable N is initialized to the length of S, which is 6.
The variable n is initialized to a list of length N-1, which will be used to store the output.
The variable t is initialized to an empty list, which will be used to store the counts of 'R' and 'L' in S.
The variable i is initialized to 0, which will be used as an index for iterating over S.
The variable j is initialized to 0, which will be used as an index for iterating over n.
The code enters a while loop that continues until i reaches the end of S.
Inside the loop, the code initializes a variable count to 0, which will be used to count the number of consecutive 'R' or 'L' characters.
The code then checks if the current character is 'R' or 'L'. If it is, it enters a while loop that continues until the current character is no longer 'R' or 'L'. The count variable is incremented by the number of times the loop iterates.
The code then appends the count variable to the t list.
The code then checks if the length of t is even. If it is, it means that there are an even number of 'R' and 'L' characters in S. In this case, the code proceeds to the next step.
Otherwise, the code raises an exception, since the input is invalid.
The code then initializes a variable T to the length of t divided by 2, which is the number of pairs of 'R' and 'L' characters in S.
The code enters a for loop that iterates from 0 to T-1.
Inside the loop, the code initializes a variable j to the current value of j plus the count of the ith pair of 'R' and 'L' characters in t.
The code then checks if the count of the ith pair of 'R' and 'L' characters in t is even. If it is, it means that the ith pair of 'R' and 'L' characters is balanced. In this case, the code proceeds to the next step.
Otherwise, the code raises an exception, since the input is invalid.
The code then initializes two variables, n[j-1] and n[j], to the average of the count of the ith pair of 'R' and 'L' characters in t.
The code then checks if the count of the ith pair of 'R' and 'L' characters in t is even. If it is, it means that the ith pair of 'R' and 'L' characters is balanced. In this case, the code proceeds to the next step.
Otherwise, the code raises an exception, since the input is invalid.
The code then initializes two variables, n[j-1] and n[j], to the average of the count of the ith pair of 'R' and 'L' characters in t, rounded down to the nearest integer.
The code then checks if the count of the ith pair of 'R' and 'L' characters in t is even. If it is, it means that the ith pair of 'R' and 'L' characters is balanced. In this case, the code proceeds to the next step.
Otherwise, the code raises an exception, since the input is invalid.
The code then initializes two variables, n[j-1] and n[j], to the average of the count of the ith pair of 'R' and 'L' characters in t, rounded up to the nearest integer.
The code then increments j by the count of the ith pair of 'R' and 'L' characters in t.
The code then increments j by the count of the (i+1)th pair of 'R' and 'L' characters in t.
The code then prints the values of n separated by spaces.

The output of code execution is:
