Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
N = int(input())

if N % 2 == 0:
    edge = []
    for s in range(1, N + 1):
        ng = N - s + 1
        for t in range(1, N + 1):
            if s >= t or t == ng:
                continue
            edge.append((s, t))
else:
    edge = []
    for s in range(1, N + 1):
        ng = N - s
        for t in range(1, N + 1):
            if s >= t or t == ng:
                continue
            edge.append((s, t))

print(len(edge))
for s, t in edge:
    print(s, t)
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
3

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable N is initialized to 3.
The code checks if N is even or odd. If it is even, it initializes an empty list edge to store the edges of the graph.
If N is even, it enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider all possible pairs of nodes.
For each pair of nodes (s,t), it calculates the number of nodes that are not connected to s and t, which is N-s+1 for s even and N-s for s odd.
It then adds the pair (s,t) to the list edge if s is less than or equal to t and t is not equal to the calculated value.
If N is odd, it initializes an empty list edge to store the edges of the graph.
If N is odd, it enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider all possible pairs of nodes.
For each pair of nodes (s,t), it calculates the number of nodes that are not connected to s and t, which is N-s for s odd and N-s+1 for s even.
It then adds the pair (s,t) to the list edge if s is less than or equal to t and t is not equal to the calculated value.
The code then prints the length of the list edge, which is 6 for N=3.
Finally, the code prints the list of edges, which are (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4) for N=3.

The output of code execution is:
6
1 2
1 3
2 3
1 4
2 4
3 4
