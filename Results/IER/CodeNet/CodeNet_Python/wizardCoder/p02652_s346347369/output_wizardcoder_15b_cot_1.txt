Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
from itertools import accumulate

S = input()
N = len(S)

A = [0] + list(accumulate(1 if s == "1" else -1 for s in S))

ma = max(A)
cur = A[-1]
C = [ma - cur]
for a in reversed(A):
    cur = max(a, cur)
    C.append(ma - cur)

d, e = 0, 0
D, E = A[:], A[:]
for i, (s, c) in enumerate(zip(S, reversed(C[:-1])), 1):
    if s == '?' and c >= d + 2:
        d += 2
    if s == '?' and c >= e + 1:
        e += 2
    D[i] += d
    E[i] += e

print(min(max(D) - min(D), max(E) - min(E)))
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
0??

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable S is initialized to "0??".
The variable N is initialized to 3.
The variable A is initialized to [0, 1, -1, 0].
The variable ma is initialized to 1.
The variable cur is initialized to 0.
The variable C is initialized to [1].
The variable d is initialized to 0.
The variable e is initialized to 0.
The variable D is initialized to [0, 1, 0, 0].
The variable E is initialized to [0, 1, 0, 0].

The code then enters a loop that iterates over the characters in S, starting from the second character (index 1).
For each character s, it calculates the difference between the current value of cur and the maximum of the previous value of cur and the current value of A[i]. This difference is stored in C[i].
If s is '?' and C[i] is greater than or equal to d + 2, it increments d by 2.
If s is '?' and C[i] is greater than or equal to e + 1, it increments e by 2.
The values of D and E are updated accordingly.

After the loop finishes, the code calculates the minimum of the absolute values of the differences between the maximum and minimum values of D and E. This value is printed as the output of the code execution.

The output of code execution is:
2
END-OF-OUTPUT
