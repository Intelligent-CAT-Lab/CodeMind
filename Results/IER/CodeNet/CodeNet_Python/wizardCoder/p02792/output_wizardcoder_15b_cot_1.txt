Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
N=int(raw_input())

num = [[0 for i in range(10)] for j in range(10)]

for i in range(1,N+1):
    if i % 10 > 0:
        num[int(str(i)[0])][i % 10] += 1

#print num

c = 0
for i in range(1,10):
    for j in range(1,10):
        c += num[i][j]*num[j][i]
print c

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
25

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable N is initialized to 25.

The code creates a 10x10 matrix called num, which will be used to store the count of numbers that start with each digit.

The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 25.

For each number i in this range, it extracts the first digit (as an integer) and the last digit (as an integer) and increments the corresponding element in num.

After the loop finishes, the code enters another loop that iterates over the elements of num. For each pair of elements (i,j), it multiplies the count of i by the count of j and adds the result to a running total called c.

Finally, the code prints the final value of c, which is 120.

The output of code execution is:
120
