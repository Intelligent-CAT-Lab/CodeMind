Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT

Consider the following code: 
#!/usr/bin/env python3
#ABC83 D

sys.setrecursionlimit(1000000000)

from collections import Counter
from collections import deque
from operator import itemgetter
from itertools import permutations
mod = 10**9 + 7
inf = float('inf')
def I(): return int(sys.stdin.readline())
def LI(): return list(map(int,sys.stdin.readline().split()))

s = input()
n = len(s)
res = inf
for i in range(n-1):
    if s[i]!= s[i+1]:
        res = min(res,max(n-i-1,i+1))
if res == inf:
    print(n)
else:
    print(res)

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
010

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The code reads a string s from the input. It then calculates the length of the string n.

The variable res is initialized to infinity, which will be used to store the minimum length of the substring that contains only distinct characters.

The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n-2 (inclusive), meaning it will consider all pairs of adjacent characters in the string.

For each pair of adjacent characters (s[i], s[i+1]), the code checks if they are equal. If they are, it skips to the next pair.

If the characters are not equal, the code calculates the maximum length of the substring that contains only distinct characters. This is done by taking the minimum of the lengths of the two substrings that contain s[i] and s[i+1] respectively, and subtracting 1 from the length of the substring that contains both s[i] and s[i+1].

The code then updates the value of res to the minimum of its current value and the maximum length calculated in the previous step.

After the loop finishes, the code checks if res is still infinity. If it is, it means that there is no substring that contains only distinct characters, so the code prints n.

If res is not infinity, the code prints the value of res, which is the minimum length of the substring that contains only distinct characters.

The output of code execution is:
2
