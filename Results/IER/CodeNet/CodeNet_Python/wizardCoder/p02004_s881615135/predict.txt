The code takes a string as input and counts the number of times the string contains "RRRRLLLLRRRR".

The variable s is initialized to "RRRRLLLLRRRR".

The variable i is initialized to 0, which will be used to iterate through the string.

The variable now is initialized to 0, which will be used to keep track of the current state of the string.

The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the number of times the string contains "RRRRLLLLRRRR".

The code then enters a loop that iterates through the string until i reaches the end of the string.

For each character c in the string, the code checks if c is "R". If it is, the code increments the value of now by 1.

If now is already greater than 0, the code increments the value of now by 1.
