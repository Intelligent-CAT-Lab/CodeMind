Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
import sys
import math
from  collections import defaultdict

# sys.stdin = open('input.txt', 'r')
# sys.stdout = open('output.txt', 'w')

def solve(test):
	h1, m1, h2, m2, k = map(int, input().split())
	r1 = h1 * 60 + m1
	r2 = h2 * 60 + m2
	ans = max(0, r2 - r1 - k)
	print(ans)

if __name__ == "__main__":
	test_cases = 1
	for t in range(1, test_cases + 1):
		solve(t)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
10 0 15 0 30

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The code is a solution to the problem of finding the time taken by a train to reach a destination. The input consists of four integers h1, m1, h2, m2, and k, where h1, m1 represent the time of departure, h2, m2 represent the time of arrival, and k represents the maximum time allowed for the train to reach the destination.

The code first reads the input values and calculates the total time taken by the train to reach the destination. It does this by converting the time of departure (h1, m1) and time of arrival (h2, m2) into minutes (r1 and r2, respectively), and subtracting r1 from r2 to get the total time taken.

The code then subtracts k from the total time taken to get the actual time taken by the train. If the actual time taken is negative, it sets it to zero.

Finally, the code prints the actual time taken by the train to reach the destination.

The output of code execution is:
15
