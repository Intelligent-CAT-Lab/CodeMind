Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
N = int(input().split()[0])

def make_divisors(n):
    divisors = []
    for i in range(1, int(n**0.5)+1):
        if n % i == 0:
            divisors.append(i)
            if i!= n // i:
                divisors.append(n//i)

    # divisors.sort()
    return divisors

Nod = make_divisors(N-1)
divs = make_divisors(N)

for d in divs:
    c = N
    while True:
        if d == 1:
            break
        if c%d == 1:
            Nod.append(d)
            break
        elif c%d == 0:
            c = c//d;
            continue
        else:
            break

print(len(Nod)-1)
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
6

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable N is initialized to 6.

The function make_divisors(n) is defined to return a list of all divisors of n. It does this by iterating from 1 to the square root of n and checking if each number is a divisor of n. If it is, it adds it to the list of divisors. If it is not, it checks if the quotient of n divided by the current number is also a divisor of n. If it is, it adds the quotient to the list of divisors.

The function is called twice, once with N-1 and once with N. The results are stored in variables Nod and divs, respectively.

The loop then iterates over all divisors of N, and for each one, it checks if it is a divisor of N-1. If it is, it adds it to the list of divisors Nod. If it is not, it checks if it is a divisor of N. If it is, it divides N by that divisor and continues the loop. If it is not, it breaks out of the loop.

Finally, the length of the list Nod is subtracted by 1 to get the number of pairs of distinct divisors of N.

The output of code execution is:
2
