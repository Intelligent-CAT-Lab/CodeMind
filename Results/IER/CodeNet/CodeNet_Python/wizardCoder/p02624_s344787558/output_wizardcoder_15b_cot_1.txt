Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 

def main():
    n = int(input())
    nums = list(range(1,n+1))
    ans = 0
    for num in nums:
        cnt = n//num
        curr_sum = cnt*(2*num+(cnt-1)*num)//2
        ans += curr_sum
    print(ans)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
4

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable n is initialized to 4.
The variable nums is initialized to a list of numbers from 1 to 4.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of the sequence.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each number in the nums list.
For each number num in the loop, it calculates the number of times num can be divided by n without a remainder. This is denoted by cnt.
It then calculates the sum of the sequence of numbers from 1 to num, which is denoted by curr_sum.
The formula used to calculate curr_sum is:
curr_sum = cnt*(2*num+(cnt-1)*num)//2
For example, if num is 2 and n is 4, then cnt is 2 and curr_sum is 2*(2+1*2)/2 = 4.
The code then adds curr_sum to ans.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 10.

The output of code execution is:
10
