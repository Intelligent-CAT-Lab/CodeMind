The variable H, W, and K are initialized to 1, 3, and 2, respectively.
The variable P is initialized to 10^9 + 7.
The variable M is initialized to W + 100.
The variable fib is initialized to a list of length M, where each element is initialized to 0.
The first two elements of fib are initialized to 1.
The loop iterates from 0 to M-2, and for each index i, it calculates the next element of fib by adding the previous two elements.
The loop finishes, and the variable fib is now a list of length M, where each element is the i-th Fibonacci number modulo P.

The function solve(h, k) takes two arguments, h and k, and returns the number of ways to choose k elements from a set of h elements, modulo P.
The base cases are when h is 0 and k is 1, in which case there is only one way to choose 1 element from an empty set, and when h is 0 and k is 2, in which case there is no way to choose 2 elements from an empty set.
The recursive cases are when k is 1 or W, in which case there is only one way to choose k elements from a set of h elements, and when k is 1 or W-1, in which case there is only one way to choose k-1 elements from a set of h-1 elements, and when k is 2 or W-2, in which case there is only one way to choose k-2 elements from a set of h-2 elements.
