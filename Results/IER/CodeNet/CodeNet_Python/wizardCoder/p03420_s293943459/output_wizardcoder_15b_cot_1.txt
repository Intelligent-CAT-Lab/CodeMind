Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
import sys
input = lambda : sys.stdin.readline().rstrip()
sys.setrecursionlimit(max(1000, 10**9))
write = lambda x: sys.stdout.write(x+"\n")


n,k = list(map(int, input().split()))
ans = 0
for b in range(k+1, n+1):
    val = (b-k) * (n//b) + max(0, (n%b)-k+1)
    if k==0:
        val -= 1
    ans += val
#     print(b,val)
print(ans)
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
5 2

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The code first imports the sys module and sets the recursion limit to 1000 or 10^9, whichever is greater. It then defines a lambda function input() that reads input from stdin and strips any trailing whitespace. It also defines a lambda function write() that writes output to stdout with a newline character.

The code then reads two integers n and k from input, which are the number of students and the number of students who need to be paired.

The code initializes a variable ans to 0, which will be used to accumulate the number of valid pairs.

The code then enters a loop that iterates from k+1 to n, meaning it will consider all possible values of b.

For each value of b, the code calculates a value val as follows:

val = (b-k) * (n//b) + max(0, (n%b)-k+1)

This formula calculates the maximum number of pairs that can be formed with b students, given that k students are already paired. The first term (b-k) * (n//b) calculates the number of full groups of b students that can be formed, and the second term calculates the number of students that are left over after dividing n by b. The max() function ensures that the number of students left over is at least 0, and the second term subtracts k from it to ensure that at least k students are left over.

If k is 0, the formula is simplified to val = (b-k) * (n//b).

The code then adds val to ans.

After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 10.

The output of code execution is:

10
