Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
#131_E
n,k=map(int,input().split())
edges=[[1,i] for i in range(2,n+1)]
cnt=(n-1)*(n-2)//2
ans=n-1
if cnt<k:
    print(-1)
else:
    for i in range(2,n):
        for j in range(i+1,n+1):
            if cnt>k:
                cnt-=1
                ans+=1
                edges.append([i,j])
            else:
                break
    print(ans)
    for edge in edges:
        print(*edge)
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
5 3

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable n and k are initialized to 5 and 3, respectively.
The variable edges is initialized to a list of all possible edges in the graph, which is [[1,2],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5]].
The variable cnt is initialized to the number of possible edges in the graph, which is (n-1)*(n-2)//2, which is 10.
The variable ans is initialized to n-1, which is the number of nodes in the graph.

The code then checks if cnt is less than k. If it is, the code prints -1 and exits.

If cnt is greater than or equal to k, the code enters a loop that iterates from 2 to n (exclusive). For each i in this range, the code enters another loop that iterates from i+1 to n (exclusive). For each j in this range, the code checks if cnt is greater than k. If it is, the code decrements cnt, increments ans, and adds the edge [i,j] to the list of edges. If cnt is less than or equal to k, the loop breaks.

After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 4.

The code then prints the list of edges, which is [[1,2],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5],[3,4],[3,5],[4,5]].

The output of code execution is:
4
1 2
1 3
1 4
1 5
2 3
2 4
2 5
3 4
3 5
4 5
