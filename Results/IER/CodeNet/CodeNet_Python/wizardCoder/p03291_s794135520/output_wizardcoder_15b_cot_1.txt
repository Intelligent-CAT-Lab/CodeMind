Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
s = input()
count = 0
a = 0
q = s.count('?')
c = 3 * s.count('C') + q
p = pow(3, q-3)
for i in range(len(s)):
    if s[i] == 'A':
        a += 3
    elif s[i] == 'C':
        c -= 3
    elif s[i] == 'B':
        count += 3*a*c
    else:
        c -= 1
        count += a*c
        a += 1
print(int(count*p) % 1000000007)
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
A??C

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable s is initialized to "A??C".
The variable count is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the number of times the pattern "ABC" appears in s.
The variable a is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the number of 'A's in s.
The variable q is initialized to the number of '?' in s.
The variable c is initialized to 3 times the number of 'C's in s plus the number of '?' in s.
The variable p is initialized to the value of 3 raised to the power of q-3.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each character in s.
If the current character is 'A', it adds 3 to a.
If the current character is 'C', it subtracts 3 from c.
If the current character is 'B', it adds 3 times a times c to count.
If the current character is '?', it subtracts 1 from c and adds a times c to count.
After the loop finishes, the code calculates the final value of count by multiplying it by p and taking the modulo of 1000000007.
The final value of count is 1, which is the correct output.

The output of code execution is:
1
