The variable w is initialized to the string "aab".
The variable n is initialized to the length of the string "aab", which is 3.
The variable per is initialized to -1, which will be used to store the period of the string.
The function good(s) takes a string s as input and returns a boolean list g, where g[i] is True if the substring s[i:] is a good suffix of s, and False otherwise.
The function first initializes a list z of length m, where m is the length of the string s, and a list g of length m, where g[i] is True for all i.
The function then iterates over the string s from the second character to the end, and for each character i, it calculates the length of the longest proper suffix of s that is also a prefix of s[i:]. This length is stored in z[i].
The function also keeps track of the index c of the last character of the longest proper suffix of s that is also a prefix of s[c:].
The function then iterates over the string s from the second character to the end, and for each character i, it calculates the length of the longest proper suffix of s that is also a prefix of s[i:]. This length is stored in z[i].
