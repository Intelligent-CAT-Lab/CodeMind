Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
P = list(input())
xi = P.index('?')
Q =[6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2]

pqsum = 0
for i in range(11):
    if P[i]=='?':
        pass
    else:
        pqsum += int(P[i])*Q[i]

if xi<11:
    Pxi = []
    for i in range(10):
        PQS = pqsum + i*Q[xi]
        if PQS%11<=1:
            P0 = 0
        if 1<PQS%11:
            P0 = 11-(PQS%11)
        if P0==int(P[11]):
            Pxi.append(i)

    if len(Pxi)==1:
        print(Pxi[0])
    else:
        print('MULTIPLE')

if xi==11:
    if pqsum%11<=1:
        P0 = 0
    if 1<pqsum%11:
        P0 = 11-(pqsum%11)
    print(P0)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
?12345678901

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable P is initialized to the list of characters '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', '0', '1'.
The variable xi is initialized to the index of the character '?' in the list P.
The variable Q is initialized to the list of weights [6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2].

The variable pqsum is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of the products of the weights and the digits of the list P.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 10 (inclusive), meaning it will consider the first 11 characters of the list P.
For each character in this range, if it is '?', it skips the character and moves on to the next one. If it is not '?', it multiplies the digit by the corresponding weight and adds it to pqsum.

After the loop finishes, the code checks if xi is less than 11. If it is, it initializes an empty list Pxi.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 9 (inclusive), meaning it will consider the digits from 0 to 9.
For each digit i in this range, it calculates the sum of the products of the weights and the digits of the list P, plus i times the weight of the character '?' in the list P.
If the sum is divisible by 11, the code checks if the remainder is less than or equal to 1. If it is, it sets P0 to 0. If it is greater than 1, it sets P0 to 11 minus the remainder.
If the remainder is equal to the first digit of the list P, the code appends i to the list Pxi.

After the loop finishes, the code checks if the length of the list Pxi is equal to 1. If it is, it prints the only element of the list Pxi. If it is not, it prints 'MULTIPLE'.

If xi is equal to 11, the code calculates the remainder of the sum of the products of the weights and the digits of the list P by 11. If the remainder is less than or equal to 1, it sets P0 to 0. If it is greater than 1, it sets P0 to 11 minus the remainder.

The code then prints the value of P0.

The output of code execution is:
0
