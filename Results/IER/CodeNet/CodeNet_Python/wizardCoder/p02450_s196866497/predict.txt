The variable n is initialized to 2.
The itertools module is imported to generate all possible permutations of numbers from 1 to n.
The permutations function is used to generate all possible permutations of numbers from 1 to n.
The for loop is used to iterate over all the permutations generated by the permutations function.
For each permutation, the map function is used to convert each element of the permutation to a string and then join them with a space separator.
The final output of the code is:
1 2
1 2
2 1
2 1
