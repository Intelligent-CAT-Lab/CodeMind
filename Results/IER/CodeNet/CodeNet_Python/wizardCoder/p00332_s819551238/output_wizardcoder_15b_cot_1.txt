Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
E, Y = map(int, input().split())
if E == 0 :
    if 1868 <= Y <= 1911 :
        print('M', Y-1867, sep='')
    elif 1912 <= Y <= 1925 :
        print('T', Y-1911, sep='')
    elif 1926 <= Y <= 1988 :
        print('S', Y-1925, sep='')
    else :
        print('H', Y-1988, sep='')

elif E == 1 :
    print(Y+1867)
elif E == 2 :
    print(Y+1911)
elif E == 3 :
    print(Y+1925)
else :
    print(Y+1988)
    

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
0 2015

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable E and variable Y are initialized to 0 and 2015, respectively.
The code checks if E is equal to 0. If it is, the code checks if Y is within the range [1868, 1911], [1912, 1925], [1926, 1988], or [1989, 2015]. If Y is within the range of a century, the code prints the corresponding letter and the difference between Y and the start of the century. For example, if Y is 2015 and the century starts at 1868, the code prints 'M', 27. If Y is 2015 and the century starts at 1912, the code prints 'T', 5. If Y is 2015 and the century starts at 1926, the code prints 'S', 19. If Y is 2015 and the century starts at 1989, the code prints 'H', 63.

If E is not equal to 0, the code checks if E is equal to 1, 2, 3, or 4. If it is, the code prints Y+1867, Y+1911, Y+1925, or Y+1988, respectively.

The output of code execution is:
M 27
