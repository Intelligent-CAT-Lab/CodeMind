Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
def CheckDisit(a) :
    tmp = 0
    for i in range(11) :
        if i <= 4 :
            tmp += int(a[i]) * (6-i)
        else :
            tmp += int(a[i]) * (12-i)
    tmp = tmp % 11
    if tmp <= 1 :
        return 0
    else :
        return (11 - tmp)
        
        
m = list(input())
if m[11] == '?' :
    print(CheckDisit(m))
else :
    ans = []
    x = m.index('?')
    for i in range(10) :
        m[x] = str(i)
        if int(m[11]) == CheckDisit(m) :
            ans.append(i)
    if len(ans) == 1 :
        print(ans[0])
    else :
        print("MULTIPLE")
        


<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
?12345678901

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The code defines a function CheckDisit that takes a string as input and returns the check digit for the string. The check digit is calculated as follows:

- The first 5 digits of the string are multiplied by the weights 6, 5, 4, 3, and 2, respectively, and the results are added together.
- The next 6 digits of the string are multiplied by the weights 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, and 7, respectively, and the results are added together.
- The sum is taken modulo 11, and the result is subtracted from 11 to get the check digit.

The function is called with the input string "12345678901". The check digit for this string is 0, so the function returns 0.

The code then checks if the 12th character of the input string is a question mark. If it is, the code calls the CheckDisit function with the input string and prints the result.

If the 12th character is not a question mark, the code creates a list of possible values for the question mark. It replaces the question mark with each of the digits 0 to 9, and calls the CheckDisit function with each modified string. If the check digit for each modified string is equal to the 12th character of the original string, the digit is added to the list of possible values.

After the loop finishes, the code checks the length of the list of possible values. If it is 1, the code prints the only value in the list. If it is greater than 1, the code prints "MULTIPLE".

The output of code execution is:

0
