The variable A and variable B are initialized to -13 and 3, respectively.
The code then calculates the maximum of the three possible values that can be obtained by adding, subtracting or multiplying A and B.
The maximum value is obtained by adding A and B, which is 10, and then subtracting the minimum value between A and B, which is -10.
Therefore, the output of the code execution is:
10
