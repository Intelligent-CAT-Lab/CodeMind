Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
H,W,h,w=[int(i) for i in input().split()]

if H%h==0 and W%w==0:
        print("No")
elif W%w!=0:
        print("Yes")
        for y in range(H):
                for x in range(W):
                        if x!=0:
                                print(" ",end="")
                        if (x%w)!=(w-1):
                                print(100000,end="")
                        else:
                                print(-100000*(w-1)-1,end="")
                print()
else:
        print("Yes")
        for y in range(H):
                for x in range(W):
                        if x!=0:
                                print(" ",end="")
                        if (y%h)!=(h-1):
                                print(100000,end="")
                        else:
                                print(-100000*(h-1)-1,end="")
                print()
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
3 3 2 2

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable H, W, h, and w are initialized to 3, 3, 2, and 2, respectively.

The first if statement checks if H is divisible by h and W is divisible by w. If it is, then it prints "No".

The second if statement checks if W is divisible by w. If it is not, then it prints "Yes" and enters a loop that iterates over all the rows of the grid. For each row, it prints a row of the grid with the specified pattern.

The third if statement checks if H is divisible by h. If it is not, then it prints "Yes" and enters a loop that iterates over all the columns of the grid. For each column, it prints a column of the grid with the specified pattern.

The output of code execution is:
No
