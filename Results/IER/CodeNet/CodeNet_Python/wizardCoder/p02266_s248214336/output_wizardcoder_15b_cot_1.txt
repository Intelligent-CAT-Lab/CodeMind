Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
A = 0
left = []
Lake = []
s = input()
for i in range(len(s)):
    if s[i] == "\\":
        left.append(i)
    elif s[i] == "/":
        if len(left) > 0:
            w = left.pop()
            goukei = i - w
            A += goukei
            for i in range(len(Lake)-1,-1,-1):
                if Lake[i][0] > w:
                    x = Lake.pop()
                    goukei += x[1]
            Lake.append([w, goukei])
print(A)
if len(Lake) == 0:
    print(0)
else:
    print(len(Lake),end=" ")
for i in range(len(Lake)):
    if i == len(Lake) - 1:
        print(Lake[i][1])
    else:
        print(Lake[i][1],end=" ")
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
\\//

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable A is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the total length of the lakes.
The variables left and Lake are initialized as empty lists, which will be used to store the indices of the left and right slashes, respectively.
The input string s is read from the user.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each character in the input string s.
If the character is a left slash (\\), the current index i is appended to the left list.
If the character is a right slash (/), the code checks if the left list is not empty. If it is, the code pops the last index from the left list and calculates the length of the lake as i - w, where w is the popped index. The length of the lake is added to A. The code then iterates over the Lake list in reverse order, starting from the last element, and subtracts the length of each lake from A. The Lake list is then updated with the current lake, represented as a list [w, goukei], where w is the index of the left slash and goukei is the length of the lake.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of A, which is 4.
The code then checks if the Lake list is empty. If it is, it prints 0. Otherwise, it prints the length of the Lake list and the lengths of each lake in the list, separated by spaces.

The output of code execution is:
4
