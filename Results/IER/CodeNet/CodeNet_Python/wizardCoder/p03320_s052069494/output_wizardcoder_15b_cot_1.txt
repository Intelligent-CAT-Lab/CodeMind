Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
LEN = 0

SNK = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
#SNK.append("SUNUKE!:"+str(1))
LEN +=1

for i in range(1,10): SNK.append(i*10+9)
#SNK.append("SUNUKE!:"+str(2))
LEN +=1

#for i in range(1,10): SNK.append(i*100+99)
#SNK.append("SUNUKE!:"+str(3))
LEN +=1

for loop in range(2):
    SNK_sub = list(range(pow(10,loop),pow(10,loop+1)))
    SNK += list(map(lambda x:(x*pow(10,LEN-1))+(pow(10,LEN-1)-1),SNK_sub))
    LEN += len(str(max(SNK_sub)))-1
    for d in SNK_sub: #loop=0のとき，d=1-9
        SNK += [(i*pow(10,LEN-1))+(pow(10,LEN-1)-1) for i in range(10,10*(d+1))]
        SNK += list(map(lambda x:(x*pow(10,LEN))+(pow(10,LEN)-1),SNK_sub[SNK_sub.index(d)+1:]))
        #SNK.append("SUNUKE!:"+str(LEN+3))
        LEN += 1+loop
        if LEN>20:break

print("\n".join(str(i) for i in SNK[:int(input())]))
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
10

### Response:
The variable LEN is initialized to 0.
The list SNK is initialized to [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9].
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 10 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 10.
For each number i in this range, it appends i*10+9 to SNK.
The code then enters another loop that iterates from 1 to 10 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 100.
For each number i in this range, it appends i*100+99 to SNK.
The code then enters another loop that iterates twice, meaning it will consider numbers from 100 to 999.
For each number i in this range, it appends i*1000+999 to SNK.
The code then enters another loop that iterates twice, meaning it will consider numbers from 1000 to 9999.
