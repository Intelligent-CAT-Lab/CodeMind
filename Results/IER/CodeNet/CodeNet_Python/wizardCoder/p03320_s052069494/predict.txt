The variable LEN is initialized to 0.
The list SNK is initialized to [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9].
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 10 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 10.
For each number i in this range, it appends i*10+9 to SNK.
The code then enters another loop that iterates from 1 to 10 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 100.
For each number i in this range, it appends i*100+99 to SNK.
The code then enters another loop that iterates twice, meaning it will consider numbers from 100 to 999.
For each number i in this range, it appends i*1000+999 to SNK.
The code then enters another loop that iterates twice, meaning it will consider numbers from 1000 to 9999.
