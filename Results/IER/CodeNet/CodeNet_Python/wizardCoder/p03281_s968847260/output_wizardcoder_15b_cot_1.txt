Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
N = int(input())


## 約数の列挙O(√N)
def divisor(n): #nの約数を全て求める
    i = 1
    table = []
    while i * i <= n:
        if n%i == 0:
            table.append(i)
            table.append(n//i)
        i += 1
    table = list(set(table))
    return len(table)
  
i = 1
answer = 0
while i <= N:
  if divisor(i) == 8:
    answer += 1
  i += 2
print(answer)
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
105

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable N is initialized to 105.

The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 105.

For each number i in this range, it calls the function divisor(i) to count the number of divisors of i. The function uses a loop to check all the numbers from 1 to √i, and if i is divisible by any of them, it adds both i and i/√i to a list. The list is then converted to a set to remove duplicates, and the length of the set is returned as the number of divisors of i.

The code then checks if the number of divisors of i is equal to 8. If it is, it increments the answer variable.

After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of answer, which is 1.

The output of code execution is:
1
