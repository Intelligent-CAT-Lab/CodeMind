Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
import sys
input = sys.stdin.readline
import numpy as np

N,X,Y,Z = map(int,input().split())

MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7

# ダメなやつを数える
L = max(10,X + Y + Z)
dp = np.zeros(1 << L+1, dtype = np.int64) # 右から見て部分和として踏む場所
rng = np.arange(1 << L+1, dtype=np.int64)
x575 = (1 << Z) + (1 << (Y+Z)) + (1 << (X+Y+Z))
bad = ((x575 & rng) == x575)
dp[1] = 1

for n in range(N):
    prev = dp
    dp = np.zeros_like(prev)
    for i in range(1, 11):
        dp[1::1<<i] += prev.reshape(1<<i, 1<<(L+1-i)).sum(axis = 0)
    dp[bad] = 0
    dp %= MOD

answer = pow(10,N,MOD) - dp.sum()
answer %= MOD
print(answer)
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
3 5 7 5

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable N, variable X, variable Y, and variable Z are initialized to 3, 5, 7, and 5, respectively.

The variable MOD is initialized to 10^9 + 7.

The variable L is initialized to max(10, X + Y + Z).

The variable dp is initialized to a numpy array of size 2^(L+1), which is a bitset of size 2^L.

The variable rng is initialized to a numpy array of size 2^(L+1), which is a bitset of size 2^L.

The variable x575 is initialized to (1 << Z) + (1 << (Y+Z)) + (1 << (X+Y+Z)).

The variable bad is initialized to a numpy array of size 2^(L+1), which is a bitset of size 2^L.

The variable answer is initialized to 0.

The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to N-1.

For each iteration, the code initializes a new numpy array prev to dp.

The code then initializes a new numpy array dp of the same size as prev, which is a bitset of size 2^L.

The code then iterates from 1 to 10, and for each i, it accumulates the sum of the previous dp array by shifting it to the right by i bits and summing the resulting subarrays along the first axis.

The code then sets dp[bad] to 0, which means that any position in dp that corresponds to a bad number is set to 0.

The code then sets dp to the modulo of dp by MOD.

The code then calculates the answer by taking the modulo of 10^N to MOD and subtracting the sum of dp.

The code then sets answer to the modulo of answer by MOD.

The code then prints the final value of answer, which is 1.

The output of code execution is:
1
