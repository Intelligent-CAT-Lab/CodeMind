The variable n is initialized to 4.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over all possible subsets of the set {0,1,2,3}.
For each subset, it prints the index of the subset and the elements of the subset separated by a space.
The loop starts with the empty subset, which has index 0, and then goes up to the subset {3}, which has index 15.
The output of the code execution is:

0:
1: 0
2: 0 1
3: 0 1 2
4: 0 1 2 3
5: 0 1 3
6: 0 1 3 2
7: 0 2
8: 0 2 1
9: 0 2 1 3
10: 0 2 3
11: 0 2 3 1
12: 0 3
13: 0 3 1
14: 0 3 1 2
15: 0 3 2
