Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
import sys

s = input()
n = len(s)
if s[0] == "0" or s[-1] == "1":
	print(-1)
	sys.exit()

possible = []
for i in range(n // 2):
	if s[i]!= s[n - i - 2]:
		print(-1)
		sys.exit()

	if i > 0 and s[i] == "1":
		possible.append(i+1)

#print(possible)
l = len(possible)

edges = []

cnt = 0
for i in range(l):
	for j in range(cnt + 1, possible[i]):
		edges.append([j, possible[i]])
	if i!= l - 1:
		edges.append([possible[i], possible[i+1]])
	else:
		edges.append([possible[i], possible[i] + 1])

	cnt = possible[i]

for i in range(cnt + 2, n + 1):
	edges.append([cnt + 1, i])

for e in edges:
	print(*e)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
1111

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable s is initialized to "1111".
The variable n is initialized to the length of s, which is 4.
The code checks if s[0] is equal to "0" or s[-1] is equal to "1". If either of these conditions is true, the code prints -1 and exits the program using sys.exit().

The code then initializes an empty list called possible.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n // 2 (inclusive), meaning it will consider the first half of s.
For each index i in this range, it checks if s[i] is equal to s[n - i - 2]. If it is not, the code prints -1 and exits the program using sys.exit().

If s[i] is equal to "1", the code appends i+1 to the possible list.

After the loop finishes, the code initializes an empty list called edges.
The code initializes a variable cnt to 0, which will be used to keep track of the current position in s.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to l-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider all the indices in the possible list.
For each index i in this range, it enters another loop that iterates from cnt+1 to possible[i]-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider all the positions between cnt and possible[i]-1.
For each position j in this range, it appends [j, possible[i]] to the edges list.
If i is not equal to l-1, it appends [possible[i], possible[i+1]] to the edges list. Otherwise, it appends [possible[i], possible[i]+1] to the edges list.

After the inner loop finishes, the code updates the value of cnt to possible[i].

After the outer loop finishes, the code enters another loop that iterates from cnt+2 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider all the positions between cnt and n.
For each position i in this range, it appends [cnt+1, i] to the edges list.

Finally, the code prints each edge in the edges list, separated by a space.

The output of code execution is:
0 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
