Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
a, b = map(int, input().split())
cnt = 0

# 偶数
#if a!= 0:
#    if a % 2!= 0:
#        a = a - 1

# 奇数


# 組み合わせ
nCr = {}

def cmb(n, r):
    if r == 0 or r == n: return 1
    if r == 1: return n
    if (n, r) in nCr: return nCr[(n, r)]
    nCr[(n, r)] = cmb(n - 1, r) + cmb(n - 1, r - 1)
    return nCr[(n, r)]


#
if a > 1:
    cnt = cnt + cmb(a, 2)

if b > 1:
    cnt = cnt + cmb(b, 2)
print(cnt)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
2 1

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable a and variable b are initialized to 2 and 1, respectively.
variable cnt is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the number of combinations meeting the condition.

The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to a (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 2.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the number of combinations of i and 2, which is the same as the number of combinations of i and i-1. The code adds this value to cnt. The condition is met when i is 1 and 2.

After the loop finishes, the code enters another loop that iterates from 1 to b (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 1.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the number of combinations of i and 2, which is the same as the number of combinations of i and i-1. The code adds this value to cnt. The condition is met when i is 1 and 2.

After the second loop finishes, the code prints the final value of cnt, which is 2.

The output of code execution is:
2
