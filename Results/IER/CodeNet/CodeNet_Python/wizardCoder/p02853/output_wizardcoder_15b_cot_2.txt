Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
# A - DDCC Finals
x,y = map(int, input().split())
X = 0
Y = 0


if x == 3:
    X = 100000
elif x == 2:
    X = 200000
elif x == 1:
    X = 300000
else :
    X = 0

if y == 3:
    Y = 100000
elif y == 2:
    Y = 200000
elif y == 1:
    Y = 300000
else:
    Y = 0

if x == 1 and y == 1:
    print(X+Y+400000)
else:
    print(X +Y)
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
1 1

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable x and variable y are initialized to 1 and 1, respectively.
The variables X and Y are initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the final amount.
The code then checks the value of x and y. If x is equal to 3, X is set to 100000. If x is equal to 2, X is set to 200000. If x is equal to 1, X is set to 300000. If x is not equal to 3, 2, or 1, X is set to 0.
Similarly, if y is equal to 3, Y is set to 100000. If y is equal to 2, Y is set to 200000. If y is equal to 1, Y is set to 300000. If y is not equal to 3, 2, or 1, Y is set to 0.
If x is equal to 1 and y is equal to 1, the code adds 400000 to the final amount. Otherwise, it only adds the values of X and Y to the final amount.
The final amount is printed as 300000.

The output of code execution is:
300000
