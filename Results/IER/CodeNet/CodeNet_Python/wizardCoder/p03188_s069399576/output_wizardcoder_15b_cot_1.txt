Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
k = int(input())

if k == 1:
    print(1)
    print(1)
    exit()

n = (k + 3) // 4 * 2
l = 2 * n - k
print(n)
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(n):
        if j % 2 == 0 or (i + j) % n >= n - l:
            print((i + j) % n + 1, end ='')
        else:
            print(n + (i + j) % n + 1, end ='')
    print("")
            

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
2

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable k is initialized to 2.
The code checks if k is equal to 1. If it is, it prints 1 and 1 and exits the program.
If k is not equal to 1, the code calculates the value of n as follows:
n = (k + 3) // 4 * 2
l = 2 * n - k
The value of n is 4 and the value of l is 2.
The code then prints the value of n, which is 4.
The code then enters a nested loop that iterates over all possible pairs of indices (i,j) such that 0 <= i < n and 0 <= j < n.
For each pair (i,j), the code checks if j is even or if (i + j) % n is greater than or equal to n - l. If either of these conditions is true, the code prints (i + j) % n + 1, which is the corresponding number in the sequence. Otherwise, the code prints n + (i + j) % n + 1, which is the corresponding number in the sequence.
After the nested loop finishes, the code prints a newline character to move to the next line.

The output of code execution is:

4
1 2 3 4 
5 6 7 8 
9 10 11 12 
13 14 15 16
