Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
n = list(map(int, input().split()))
check = sum(x==1 for x in n) * sum(x==9 for x in n) * sum(x==7 for x in n) * sum(x==4 for x in n)
if check == 1:
  print("YES")
else:
  print("NO")
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
1 7 9 4

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable n is initialized to the list [1, 7, 9, 4].
The variable check is initialized to the sum of the following conditions:
- The number of elements in n that are equal to 1. This is done using the expression "x==1 for x in n", which returns a generator object that yields True for each element in n that is equal to 1, and False otherwise. The sum of this generator object is then multiplied by the number of elements in n that are equal to 1.
- The number of elements in n that are equal to 9. This is done using the expression "x==9 for x in n", which returns a generator object that yields True for each element in n that is equal to 9, and False otherwise. The sum of this generator object is then multiplied by the number of elements in n that are equal to 9.
- The number of elements in n that are equal to 7. This is done using the expression "x==7 for x in n", which returns a generator object that yields True for each element in n that is equal to 7, and False otherwise. The sum of this generator object is then multiplied by the number of elements in n that are equal to 7.
- The number of elements in n that are equal to 4. This is done using the expression "x==4 for x in n", which returns a generator object that yields True for each element in n that is equal to 4, and False otherwise. The sum of this generator object is then multiplied by the number of elements in n that are equal to 4.

Since the sum of the conditions is equal to 1, the code prints "YES".

The output of code execution is:
YES
END-OF-OUTPUT
