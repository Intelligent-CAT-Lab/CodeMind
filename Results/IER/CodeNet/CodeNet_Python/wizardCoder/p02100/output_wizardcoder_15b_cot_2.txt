Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
S = input()
L = len(S)

cur = 0
P = [0]*6
def expr():
    global cur
    op = "+"
    while 1:
        term(op)
        if cur == L:
            break
        op = S[cur]
        cur += 1 # "+"/"-"

def num():
    global cur
    v = 0
    while cur < L and S[cur] in "0123456789":
        v = 10*v + int(S[cur])
        cur += 1
    return v

def term(op):
    global cur
    k = 1
    if S[cur]!= 'x':
        k = num()
    d = 0
    if cur < L and S[cur] == "x":
        cur += 1 # "x"
        d = 1
        if cur < L and S[cur] == '^':
            cur += 1 # "^"
            d = num()
    P[d] = k if op == '+' else -k
expr()

def f(P, x):
    res = 0
    for i in range(6):
        res += P[i]*(x**i)
    return res

d = 5
while P[d] == 0:
    d -= 1

R = []
for x in range(2000, -2001, -1):
    if f(P, x) == 0:
        R.append(x)

print("".join("(x%+d)" % -x for x in R))


<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
x^2+3x+2

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable S is initialized to "x^2+3x+2".
The variable L is initialized to the length of S, which is 11.
The variable cur is initialized to 0, which will be used to keep track of the current position in the string.
The variable P is initialized to a list of 6 zeros, which will be used to store the coefficients of the polynomial.

The function expr() is defined to parse the polynomial expression. It enters a loop that parses each term in the expression.
The function term() is defined to parse a term in the expression. It enters a loop that parses the coefficient of the term.
The function num() is defined to parse a number in the expression. It enters a loop that parses the digits of the number.

The function expr() is called to parse the polynomial expression.

The variable d is initialized to 5, which is the degree of the polynomial.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 2000 to -2001 (inclusive) in steps of -1.
For each value of x, it checks if the value of the polynomial at that point is zero. If it is, it adds the value of x to the list R.

The code then prints the values of x in R, which are -2, -1, 0, 1, 2.

The output of code execution is:
-2x^2-x-1
-x^2-x-1
x^2+x+1
x^2+x+1
