Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
if __name__ == "__main__":
    inputStrings = str(input())
    outputStrings = []
    isNextA = True
    for i in inputStrings:
        if isNextA == True and i == "A":
            outputStrings.append(i)
            isNextA = False
        elif isNextA == False and i == "Z":
            outputStrings.append(i)
            isNextA = True

    if outputStrings!= []:
        if outputStrings[-1] == "A":
            outputStrings.pop(-1)

    output = str()
    for i in outputStrings:
        output += i
    
    if len(output) > 1:
        print(output)
    else:
        print("-1")
        


<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
AIZUNYANPEROPERO

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable inputStrings is initialized to "AIZUNYANPEROPERO".
The variable outputStrings is initialized to an empty list.
The variable isNextA is initialized to True, which means the next character to be added to outputStrings will be an "A".
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each character in inputStrings.
For each character i in inputStrings, the code checks if isNextA is True and i is "A". If it is, it adds "A" to outputStrings and sets isNextA to False.
If isNextA is False and i is "Z", it adds "Z" to outputStrings and sets isNextA to True.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if outputStrings is not empty. If it is not empty, it checks if the last element of outputStrings is "A". If it is, it removes it from outputStrings.
The code then creates a new string output by concatenating each element of outputStrings.
If the length of output is greater than 1, it prints output. Otherwise, it prints "-1".

The output of code execution is:
-1
END-OF-OUTPUT
