Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
s = input();n = len(s)
dp = [[0 for i in range(4)] for j in range(len(s)+1)]
dp[0][0] = 1;string = ["A","B","C"];num = 10**9+7
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(4):
        m = 0;b = 1
        if '?' == s[i]:b = 3
        if j == 0:
            if '?' == s[i]:dp[i+1][j] = (dp[i][j] * 3)%num
            else:dp[i+1][j] = (dp[i][j])%num
            continue
        if s[i] == string[j-1]or s[i] == '?':m = 1
        dp[i+1][j] = (m*dp[i][j-1] + b*dp[i][j])%num
print(dp[-1][3])
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
A??C

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable s is initialized to "A??C".
The variable n is initialized to the length of s, which is 4.
The variable dp is initialized to a 2D list of size (n+1)x4, where each element is initialized to 0.
The variable string is initialized to a list of strings ["A","B","C"].
The variable num is initialized to 10^9+7.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n-1.
For each index i, the code enters another loop that iterates from 0 to 3.
For each index j, the code initializes two variables m and b to 0 and 1, respectively.
If the character at index i is '?', then b is set to 3.
If the character at index i is equal to the string at index j-1 or '?', then m is set to 1.
The code then updates the value of dp[i+1][j] as follows:
dp[i+1][j] = (m*dp[i][j-1] + b*dp[i][j])%num
The code calculates the value of dp[i+1][j] by multiplying the value of dp[i][j-1] by m and adding the value of dp[i][j] multiplied by b. The modulo operator is used to prevent integer overflow.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of dp[-1][3], which is 1.

The output of code execution is:
1
