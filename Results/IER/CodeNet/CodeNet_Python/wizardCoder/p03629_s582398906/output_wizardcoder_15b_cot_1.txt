Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
import sys
input = sys.stdin.readline
from collections import *
from bisect import *

A = input()[:-1]
K = [0]*(len(A)) #K[i]: A[i+1:]の部分列に含まれない最小の文字列の長さ
s = set()
cnt = 1

for i in range(len(A)-1, -1, -1):
    K[i] = cnt
    s.add(A[i])
    
    if len(s)==26:
        cnt += 1
        s = set()

d = defaultdict(list)

for i in range(len(A)):
    d[A[i]].append(i)

ans = []
now = -1

for i in range(cnt):
    for alpha in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':
        idx = bisect_right(d[alpha], now)
        
        if idx==len(d[alpha]):
            ans.append(alpha)
            break
        
        nex = d[alpha][idx]
        
        if K[nex]==cnt-i-1:
            now = nex
            ans.append(alpha)
            break

print(''.join(ans))
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
atcoderregularcontest

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable A is initialized to "atcoderregularcontest".

The code then initializes a list K of length len(A) to 0. K[i] will be used to store the length of the smallest string that does not contain A[i+1:] as a substring.

The code also initializes a set s to store the characters of A in reverse order.

The code enters a loop that iterates from len(A)-1 to 0 (inclusive), meaning it will consider the characters of A in reverse order.

For each character c in A, the code adds c to s and checks if s contains all the characters of the alphabet. If it does, it increments cnt and resets s to an empty set.

The code then initializes a defaultdict d to store the indices of each character in A.

The code enters another loop that iterates from 0 to len(A)-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider the characters of A in order.

For each character c in A, the code adds the index i to the list d[c].

The code then initializes an empty list ans to store the characters of the answer in order.

The code initializes a variable now to -1, which will be used to keep track of the current position in A.

The code enters another loop that iterates from 0 to cnt-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider each length of the smallest string that does not contain A[i+1:] as a substring.

For each length j in the range [0, cnt-i-1], the code initializes a variable alpha to the j-th character of the alphabet.

The code then uses bisect_right to find the index of the first character in A that is greater than or equal to alpha.

If this index is equal to len(d[alpha]), it means that alpha is not in A, so the code appends alpha to ans and breaks out of the loop.

Otherwise, the code sets nex to the index of the first character in A that is greater than or equal to alpha.

If K[nex]==cnt-i-1, it means that the length of the smallest string that does not contain A[i+1:] as a substring is j, so the code sets now to nex and appends alpha to ans.

After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is "atcoder".

The output of code execution is:
atcoder
END-OF-OUTPUT
