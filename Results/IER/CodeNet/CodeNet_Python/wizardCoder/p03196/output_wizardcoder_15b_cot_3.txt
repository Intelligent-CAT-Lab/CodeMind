Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
n,p=map(int,input().split())

def factorization(n):
    arr = []
    temp = n
    for i in range(2, int(-(-n**0.5//1))+1):
        if temp%i==0:
            cnt=0
            while temp%i==0:
                cnt+=1
                temp //= i
            arr.append([i, cnt])

    if temp!=1:
        arr.append([temp, 1])

    if arr==[]:
        arr.append([n, 1])

    return arr

l=factorization(p)
ans=1
for i in range(len(l)):
    if l[i][1]>=n:
        ans*=l[i][0]**(l[i][1]//n)
print(ans)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
3 24

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable n and variable p are initialized to 3 and 24, respectively.

The function factorization(n) is defined to find the prime factorization of a given number n. It takes a number n as input and returns a list of prime factors and their corresponding exponents.

The function first initializes an empty list arr to store the prime factors and their corresponding exponents. It then initializes a temporary variable temp to n.

The function then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to the square root of n (inclusive). For each value of i in this range, it checks if i is a factor of temp. If it is, it calculates the number of times i divides temp and appends the pair [i, cnt] to arr. It then updates temp by dividing it by i.

After the loop finishes, if temp is not equal to 1, it means that it is a prime factor of n and it is appended to arr as [temp, 1].

If arr is empty, it means that n is prime and it is appended to arr as [n, 1].

The function then returns the list arr.

The variable l is initialized to the result of calling factorization(p), which is [[2, 3]].

The variable ans is initialized to 1.

The function then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to the length of l-1. For each value of i in this range, it checks if the exponent of the i-th prime factor in l is greater than or equal to n. If it is, it multiplies the i-th prime factor raised to the ceiling of the exponent divided by n to ans.

After the loop finishes, the function prints the final value of ans, which is 8.

The output of code execution is:
8
