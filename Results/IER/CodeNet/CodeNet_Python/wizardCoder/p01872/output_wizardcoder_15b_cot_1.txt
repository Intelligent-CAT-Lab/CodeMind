Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
def is_collect(fixed_number):
  score = 0
  for i in range(1, 7):
    score += int(fixed_number[i]) * (i + 1)
  for i in range(7, 12):
    score += int(fixed_number[i]) * (i - 5)
  last = 11 - score % 11
  if str(last) == fixed_number[0] or (last >= 10 and fixed_number[0] == "0"):
    return True
  else:
    return False

def check(s):
  index = s.index("?")
  cnt = 0
  for i in range(10):
    c = str(i)
    fixed_number = s[:index] + c + s[index + 1:]
    if is_collect(fixed_number):
      cnt += 1
      ret = i
  if cnt == 1:return ret
  else:return None

ans = check(input()[::-1])
print(ans if ans!= None else "MULTIPLE")


<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
?12345678901

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The code defines two functions: is_collect and check.

The is_collect function takes a string as input and returns True if the string is a valid credit card number according to the Luhn algorithm, and False otherwise. The Luhn algorithm is a checksum formula used to validate a variety of identification numbers, such as credit card numbers.

The check function takes a string as input and returns the digit that can be inserted at the? position to make the string a valid credit card number. If there are multiple valid digits, the function returns "MULTIPLE".

The code first reverses the input string to make it easier to work with.

The code then calls the check function with the reversed input string.

If the check function returns a digit, the code prints the digit.

If the check function returns "MULTIPLE", the code prints "MULTIPLE".

The output of code execution is:
8
