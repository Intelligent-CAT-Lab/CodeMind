Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
s = input()
def solve(s):
    n = len(s)
    for i in range(1,n):
        if s[i-1] == s[i]:
            print(i,i+1)
            return
    for i in range(2,n):
        if s[i-2] == s[i]:
            print(i-1,i+1)
            return
    print(-1,-1)
    return
solve(s)
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
needed

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable s is initialized to "needed".
The function solve(s) is defined.
The length of the string s is stored in the variable n.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider all pairs of adjacent characters in the string.
If the characters at positions i-1 and i are the same, it prints the indices i and i+1 and returns.
If the loop finishes without finding such a pair, the code enters another loop that iterates from 2 to n-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider all pairs of non-adjacent characters in the string.
If the characters at positions i-2 and i are the same, it prints the indices i-1 and i+1 and returns.
If the loop finishes without finding such a pair, the code prints -1 and -1 and returns.

The function solve(s) is called with the input "needed".
The code enters the first loop, which considers pairs of adjacent characters.
The loop finds the pair (e, e) at position 1, and prints 1 2.
The function returns and the code prints -1 -1.
The output of code execution is:
-1 -1
END-OF-OUTPUT
