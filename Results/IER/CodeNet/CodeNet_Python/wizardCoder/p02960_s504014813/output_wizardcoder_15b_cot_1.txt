Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
S = input()
N = len(S)
mod = 10**9 + 7

p = 1

dp = [[0]*13 for _ in range(N+1)]
dp[0][0] = 1

for i in range(1,N+1):
  if S[-i] == '?':
    for k in range(10):
      a = (k * p) % 13
      for j in range(13):
        dp[i][j] += dp[i-1][j-a] % mod
        dp[i][j] %= mod
  else:
    a = (int(S[-i]) * p) % 13
    for j in range(13):
      dp[i][j] += dp[i-1][j-a] % mod
  p = (p * 10) % 13

print(dp[N][5])
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
??2??5

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable S is initialized to "??2??5".
The variable N is initialized to the length of S, which is 6.
The variable mod is initialized to 10^9 + 7.
The variable p is initialized to 1.
The variable dp is initialized to a 2D array of size (N+1) x 13, where each element is initialized to 0.
The first row of dp is initialized to 1, since there is only one way to form an empty string.

The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider all possible substrings of S.
For each substring S[0:i], the code checks if the last character is '?', which means it can be any digit.
If the last character is '?', the code enters another loop that iterates from 0 to 9, and for each digit k, it calculates the value of a = (k * p) % 13, where p is the current power of 10.
The code then enters another loop that iterates from 0 to 12, and for each value of j, it adds dp[i-1][j-a] to dp[i][j], modulo mod.
If the last character is not '?', the code calculates the value of a = (int(S[-i]) * p) % 13, where p is the current power of 10.
The code then enters another loop that iterates from 0 to 12, and for each value of j, it adds dp[i-1][j-a] to dp[i][j], modulo mod.
The code then updates p to (p * 10) % 13, which is the next power of 10.

After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of dp[N][5], which is 1.

The output of code execution is:
1
