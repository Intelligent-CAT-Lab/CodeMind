Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
import sys

readline = sys.stdin.readline
MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7
INF = float('INF')
sys.setrecursionlimit(10 ** 5)


def main():
    a, b = input().split()
    x = int(a + b)

    def judge():
        for i in range(10001):
            if i ** 2 == x:
                return True
        return False

    if judge():
        print("Yes")
    else:
        print("No")


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
1 21

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The code first imports the sys module, which provides access to some variables used or maintained by the interpreter and to functions that interact strongly with the interpreter.

The code then defines a function called main() that reads input from the standard input using the readline() function, which reads a line from the standard input and returns it with the trailing newline character removed.

The code then reads two integers a and b from the input using the input() function, which reads a string from the standard input and returns it with the trailing newline character removed.

The code then calculates the sum of a and b and stores it in the variable x.

The code then defines a nested function called judge() that checks if x is a perfect square. The function uses a loop to iterate from 1 to 10000, and for each value of i, it checks if i squared is equal to x. If it finds a value of i that satisfies this condition, it returns True. If the loop finishes without finding such a value, it returns False.

The code then calls the judge() function and prints "Yes" if it returns True, and "No" otherwise.

The code then checks if the main() function is being executed directly, as opposed to being imported as a module. If it is being executed directly, it calls the main() function to execute the code.

The output of code execution is:
No
END-OF-OUTPUT
