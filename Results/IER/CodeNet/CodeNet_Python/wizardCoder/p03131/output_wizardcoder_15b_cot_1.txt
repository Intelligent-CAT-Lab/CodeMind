Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
K, A, B = [int(elem) for elem in input().split()]

if B - A <= 2:
    print(K + 1)
else:
    first_num_exchanges = A + 1
    rest_num_exchanges = K - first_num_exchanges
    gain_per_two_manipulation = B - A
    num_cookies = rest_num_exchanges // 2 * gain_per_two_manipulation + B
    if rest_num_exchanges % 2 == 1:
        num_cookies += 1
    print(num_cookies)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
4 2 6

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable K, variable A and variable B are initialized to 4, 2 and 6, respectively.

The code checks if B - A is less than or equal to 2. If it is, it means that we can only exchange one cookie for two cookies, so we need to add 1 to K to get the final number of cookies. Therefore, the code prints K + 1, which is 5.

If B - A is greater than 2, we need to calculate the number of exchanges needed to get the desired range of cookies. We can do this by exchanging the first cookie for two cookies, and then exchanging the remaining cookies for two cookies at a time. We can calculate the gain per two exchanges by subtracting A from B and dividing by 2. We can then calculate the number of cookies by multiplying the number of remaining exchanges by the gain per two exchanges, adding B to get the final number of cookies. If there is an odd number of remaining exchanges, we need to add 1 to the final number of cookies.

In this case, we need to exchange the first cookie for two cookies, so we set first_num_exchanges to A + 1, which is 3. We then calculate the number of remaining exchanges by subtracting first_num_exchanges from K, which is 1. We can then calculate the gain per two exchanges by subtracting A from B and dividing by 2, which is 2. We can then calculate the number of cookies by multiplying the number of remaining exchanges by the gain per two exchanges, adding B to get the final number of cookies, which is 10. Since there is an odd number of remaining exchanges, we add 1 to the final number of cookies, which is 11.

Therefore, the code prints 11.

The output of code execution is:
11
