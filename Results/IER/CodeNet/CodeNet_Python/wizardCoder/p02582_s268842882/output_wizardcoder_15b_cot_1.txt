Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
S = input()

cur_l, max_l = 0, 0

for s in S:
  if s == 'R':
    cur_l += 1
  else: # s == 'R'
    if cur_l > max_l:
      max_l = cur_l
    cur_l = 0

if cur_l > max_l:
  max_l = cur_l

print(max_l) 


<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
RRS

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable S is initialized to "RRS".

The variables cur_l and max_l are initialized to 0 and 0, respectively.

The code enters a loop that iterates over each character s in S.

If s is 'R', cur_l is incremented by 1.

If s is not 'R', it means that the current run of 'R's has ended, so the code checks if cur_l is greater than max_l. If it is, max_l is updated to cur_l.

Finally, the code checks if cur_l is greater than max_l, and if it is, max_l is updated to cur_l.

After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of max_l, which is 2.

The output of code execution is:
2
END-OF-OUTPUT
