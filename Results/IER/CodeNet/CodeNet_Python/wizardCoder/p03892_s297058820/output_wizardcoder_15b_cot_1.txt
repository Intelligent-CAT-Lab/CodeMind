Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
a,b,c,d = map(int, raw_input().split())

x = abs(c-a)
y = abs(d-b)

if x == 0 or y == 0:
	print 0
	import sys
	sys.exit(0)

def gcd(a,b):
	return a if b == 0 else gcd(b, a % b)

e = gcd(x,y)
x /= e
y /= e

print (x+y-1) * e
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
1 1 3 4

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable a, b, c, and d are initialized to 1, 1, 3, and 4, respectively.

The variables x and y are initialized to the absolute difference between c and a and the absolute difference between d and b, respectively.

The code checks if either x or y is equal to 0. If either of them is 0, the code prints 0 and exits the program using the sys.exit() function.

The gcd() function is defined to calculate the greatest common divisor of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.

The code then divides x and y by their gcd to get the reduced fractions of the original fractions.

Finally, the code calculates the sum of the reduced fractions minus 1 and multiplies it by the gcd to get the final answer.

The output of code execution is:

2
