Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
l = int(input())

d = max([d for d in range(30) if 2**d <= l])
n = d+1
m = 2*d
ans = []
for i in range(1, n):
    ans.append((i, i+1, 0))
    ans.append((i, i+1, 2**(i-1)))

while l > 2**d:
    for i in range(n-1, 0, -1):
        if l-2**(i-1) > 2**d-1:
            ans.append((i, n, l-2**(i-1)))
            m += 1
            l -= 2**(i-1)
            break

print(n, m)
for a in ans:
    print(*a)
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
4

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable l is initialized to 4.

The code then calculates the maximum value of d such that 2^d is less than or equal to l. In this case, d is 2.

The variable n is initialized to d+1, which is 3.

The variable m is initialized to 2*d, which is 6.

The variable ans is initialized to an empty list.

The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider values of i from 1 to 2.

For each value of i, the code appends a tuple (i, i+1, 0) to ans, which represents the base case of the sequence.

For each value of i, the code appends a tuple (i, i+1, 2^(i-1)) to ans, which represents the recursive case of the sequence.

After the loop finishes, the code enters another loop that continues until l is less than or equal to 2^d.

For each value of i, the code checks if l-2^(i-1) is greater than or equal to 2^d-1. If it is, the code appends a tuple (i, n, l-2^(i-1)) to ans, which represents the recursive case of the sequence.

The variable m is incremented by 1, and the variable l is decremented by 2^(i-1).

After the loop finishes, the code prints the values of n and m, which are 3 and 6, respectively.

The code then prints each tuple in ans on a separate line, which are:

(1, 2, 2)
