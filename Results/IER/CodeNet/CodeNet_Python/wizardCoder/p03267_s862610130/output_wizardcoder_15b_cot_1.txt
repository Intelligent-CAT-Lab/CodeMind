Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
def solve(l):
    n = 0
    while 2**n <= l:
        n += 1
    E = []
    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):
        x = 2**i
        if i!= n-1:
            E.append((i, i+1, 0))
            E.append((i, i+1, x))
        if l - x >= 2**(n-1):
            E.append((i, n-1, l-x))
            l -= x
    print(n, len(E))
    for u, v, x in E:
        print(u+1, v+1, x)

l = int(input())
solve(l)
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
4

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable l is initialized to 4.
The function solve(l) is called with l as its argument.
The function initializes the variable n to 0 and the empty list E.
The function enters a while loop that continues as long as 2**n is less than or equal to l.
Inside the loop, the function increments n by 1.
The function then enters another loop that iterates from n-1 to 0 (inclusive) in reverse order.
For each value of i, the function calculates the value x as 2**i and checks if l is greater than or equal to x.
If it is, the function appends a tuple (i, i+1, 0) to E and a tuple (i, i+1, x) to E.
If l is greater than or equal to x, the function appends a tuple (i, n-1, l-x) to E and subtracts x from l.
After the loop finishes, the function prints the values of n and the length of E.
Finally, the function prints each tuple (u, v, x) in E, where u and v are the indices of the endpoints of the edge and x is the length of the edge.

The output of code execution is:
2 3
1 2 0
2 2 2
