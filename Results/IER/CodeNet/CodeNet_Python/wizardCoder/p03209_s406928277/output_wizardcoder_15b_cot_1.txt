Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
n,x = map(int,input().split())
size = [1]
pati = [1]
for i in range(n):
    size.append(size[i]*2 + 3)
    pati.append(pati[i]*2 + 1)
ans = 0
for i in range(n):
    if x == 1:
        x -= 1
        break
    elif x == size[n-i]:
        ans += pati[n-i]
        break
    elif x == size[n-i-1]+2:
        ans += pati[n-i-1]+1
        break
    elif x > size[n-i-1] + 2:
        ans += pati[n-i-1]+1
        x -= size[n-i-1] + 2
    else:
        x -= 1
if x == 1:
    ans += 1
print(ans)
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
2 7

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable n and variable x are initialized to 2 and 7, respectively.
The variable size is initialized to [1], which will be used to store the size of each pattern.
The variable pati is initialized to [1], which will be used to store the number of patterns of each size.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the number of patterns that can be formed.

The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider sizes from 1 to 2.
For each size i, it calculates the size of the next pattern as size[i]*2 + 3 and stores it in size[i+1].
It also calculates the number of patterns of size i as pati[i]*2 + 1 and stores it in pati[i+1].

The code then enters another loop that iterates from 0 to n-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider sizes from 1 to 2.
For each size i, it checks if x is equal to 1, which means there is only one pattern of size 1 that can be formed. If it is, it breaks out of the loop.
If x is equal to size[n-i], it means there is only one pattern of size i that can be formed. It adds pati[n-i] to ans and breaks out of the loop.
If x is equal to size[n-i-1]+2, it means there are two patterns of size i-1 and i that can be formed. It adds pati[n-i-1]+1 to ans and breaks out of the loop.
If x is greater than size[n-i-1] + 2, it means there are two patterns of size i-1 and i that can be formed, and there are additional patterns of size i that can be formed. It adds pati[n-i-1]+1 to ans and subtracts size[n-i-1] + 2 from x.
If x is less than or equal to size[n-i-1] + 2, it means there are two patterns of size i-1 and i that can be formed, and there are no additional patterns of size i that can be formed. It subtracts 1 from x.

After the second loop finishes, the code checks if x is equal to 1, which means there is only one pattern of size 1 that can be formed. If it is, it adds 1 to ans.

Finally, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 2.

The output of code execution is:
2
