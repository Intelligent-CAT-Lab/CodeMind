Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
n,x = map(int,input().split())

def f(N,X):
    if N == 0:
        return 0 if X <= 0 else 1
    elif X <= 4*(2**(N-1))-2:
        return f(N-1,X-1)
    elif X == 4*(2**(N-1))-1:
        return 2**N
    elif X <= 4*2**N - 3:
        return 2**N + f(N-1,X - 4*(2**(N-1)) + 1)
    else:
        return 2**(N+1) - 1

print(f(n,x))
            
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
2 7

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable n and variable x are initialized to 2 and 7, respectively.

The function f(N,X) is defined to calculate the number of ways to choose X items from a set of N items. The function uses recursion to calculate the answer.

The base case is when N is 0, in which case there is only one way to choose 0 items, which is to not choose any item. If X is less than or equal to 0, then there is only one way to choose 0 items, which is to not choose any item.

If N is greater than 0 and X is less than or equal to 4*(2**(N-1))-2, then there are only two ways to choose X items from N items: either choose X-1 items from the remaining N-1 items, or choose X items from the remaining N-1 items and discard the last item. Therefore, the function returns f(N-1,X-1) + f(N-1,X).

If N is greater than 0 and X is equal to 4*(2**(N-1))-1, then there are only two ways to choose X items from N items: either choose X-1 items from the remaining N-1 items, or choose X items from the remaining N-1 items and discard the last item. Therefore, the function returns 2**N.

If N is greater than 0 and X is greater than 4*(2**(N-1))-2 and less than or equal to 4*2**N - 3, then there are three ways to choose X items from N items: either choose X-4*(2**(N-1))+1 items from the remaining N-1 items, or choose X-4*(2**(N-1)) items from the remaining N-1 items and discard the last item, or choose X-4*(2**(N-1))-1 items from the remaining N-1 items and discard the last two items. Therefore, the function returns 2**N + f(N-1,X - 4*(2**(N-1)) + 1).

If N is greater than 0 and X is greater than 4*2**N - 3, then there are only two ways to choose X items from N items: either choose X-4*(2**(N-1))+1 items from the remaining N-1 items, or choose X-4*(2**(N-1)) items from the remaining N-1 items and discard the last item. Therefore, the function returns 2**(N+1) - 1.

The function f(n,x) is called with the values of n and x. The function returns the number of ways to choose x items from a set of n items.

The output of code execution is:
1
