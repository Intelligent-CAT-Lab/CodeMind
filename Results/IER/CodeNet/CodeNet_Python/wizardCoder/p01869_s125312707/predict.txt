The code first imports the bisect module and sets the recursion limit to 10000. It then initializes an empty list a.

The function f(a,bin,n) takes a list a, a binary number bin, and a number n as input. It recursively adds bin to a if bin is less than or equal to n. It then calls itself with bin*10+2 and bin*10+8 as inputs.

The function g(n,p) takes a number n and an index p as input. It initializes a variable m to -1<<20, which is the smallest possible integer. It then uses the bisect_left function from the bisect module to find the index x in the sorted list a such that a[x] is greater than or equal to n. If x is not equal to the length of a, and a[x] is equal to n, it sets m to 1. If n is greater than or equal to a[p]**2, it returns m. If n is divisible by a[p], it sets m to g(n//a[p],p)+1. Otherwise, it sets m to the maximum of m and g(n,p+1).

The code then reads an integer n from input. If n is odd, it prints -1 and exits. Otherwise, it calls f(a,0,n) to generate the list a. It then sorts a and appends 10**20 to the end of it. It then calls g(n,0) to calculate the maximum number of times 2 can be used to divide n. If the result is negative, it sets it to -1. Finally, it prints the result.

The input is 1, so the output is:
1
