Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
import sys
for n in sys.stdin:
	n = int(n.split()[0])
	print(n ** 3)
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
2

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The code imports the sys module, which provides access to some variables used or maintained by the interpreter and to functions that interact strongly with the interpreter. One of these variables is sys.stdin, which is a file-like object that represents the standard input stream. This object allows us to read data from the standard input, which in this case is the input given to the program.

The code then enters a loop that reads a line of input from the standard input and converts it to an integer using the int() function. It then prints the cube of this integer using the ** operator.

For the given input, the code reads "2" from the standard input, converts it to an integer using the int() function, and then prints the cube of 2, which is 8.

The output of code execution is:
8
END-OF-OUTPUT
