Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
def calc(n, mod):
	f = 1
	fac = [1]
	for i in range(1, n + 1):
		f *= i
		f %= mod
		fac.append(f)
	inv = pow(f, mod - 2, mod)
	invs = [1] * (n + 1)
	invs[n] = inv
	for i in range(n, 1, -1):
		inv *= i
		inv %= mod
		invs[i - 1] = inv
	return fac, invs

def cnk(n, r, mod, fac, inv):
	return fac[n] * inv[n - r] * inv[r] % mod


n = int(input())

mod = 998244353

f, inv = calc(n + 10, mod)
ans = pow(3, n, mod)
p = [1]

for i in range(n // 2 + 10):
	p.append(p[-1] * 2 % mod)
for k in range(n // 2 + 1, n + 1):
	cur = 2 * cnk(n, k, mod, f, inv) * p[n - k]
	ans -= cur
	ans %= mod
print(ans)
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
2

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The code defines a function `calc` that calculates the factorial and inverse factorial of a number n modulo a given modulus. It also defines a function `cnk` that calculates the binomial coefficient C(n, r) modulo a given modulus.

The input n is read from the user and the modulus is set to 998244353.

The factorial and inverse factorial of n+10 are calculated using the `calc` function.

The answer is calculated as the sum of the first n//2+10 powers of 3 modulo modulus. This is done using the formula:

ans = 3^n - 3^(n-2) -... - 3^0

where the sum is taken modulo modulus.

The powers of 3 are calculated using the binomial coefficient formula C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n-k)!) and the `cnk` function.

The final answer is printed.

The output of code execution is:

1
