Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
s = input()
odd = ["R", "U", "D"]
even = ["L", "U", "D"]

for i in range(0,len(s),2):
	if s[i] not in odd:
		print("No")
		exit()
		
for j in range(1,len(s),2):
	if s[j] not in even:
		print("No")
		exit()
		
print("Yes")	
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
RUDLUDR

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable s is initialized to "RUDLUDR".
The variables odd and even are initialized to lists containing the characters "R", "U", "D" and "L", respectively.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the string s in steps of 2, meaning it will consider the characters at even indices.
For each character at an even index i, the code checks if it is in the odd list. If it is not, the code prints "No" and exits the loop.
The code then enters another loop that iterates over the string s in steps of 2, meaning it will consider the characters at odd indices.
For each character at an odd index j, the code checks if it is in the even list. If it is not, the code prints "No" and exits the loop.
If the code has not exited the loop, it means that all characters in the string s are valid, so it prints "Yes".

The output of code execution is:
Yes
END-OF-OUTPUT
