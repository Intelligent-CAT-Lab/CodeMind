Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
n = int(input())
for i in range(1, n + 1):
  if i % 3 == 0:
    print(" {}".format(i), end = "")
  else:
    x = i
    while x:
      if x % 10 == 3:
        print(" {}".format(i), end = "")
        break
      x //= 10
print()

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
30

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable n is initialized to 30.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 30.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is divisible by 3 using the modulo operator (%). If it is, it prints the number i followed by a space using the print() function and the end parameter set to an empty string. If i is not divisible by 3, it calculates the last digit of i using integer division (//) and stores it in the variable x. It then enters another loop that iterates from x down to 0, checking each digit of x for the value 3 using the modulo operator. If it finds a digit equal to 3, it prints the number i followed by a space using the print() function and the end parameter set to an empty string and breaks out of the loop. If it reaches the end of the loop without finding a digit equal to 3, it does not print anything.
After the loop finishes, the code prints a newline character using the print() function.

The output of code execution is:

3 13 23 30
END-OF-OUTPUT
