Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
s = input()
ans = ""
flag = False
for c in s:
  if c == "A" and not flag:flag = True
  if c == "Z" and flag:
    ans += "AZ"
    flag = False
if ans == "":
  print(-1)
else:
  print(ans)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
AIZUNYANPEROPERO

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable s is initialized to "AIZUNYANPEROPERO".
The variable ans is initialized to an empty string, which will be used to accumulate the output.
The variable flag is initialized to False, which will be used to keep track of whether the current character is an "A".
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each character c in the string s.
If c is "A" and flag is False, it sets flag to True.
If c is "Z" and flag is True, it appends "AZ" to ans and sets flag to False.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if ans is empty. If it is, it prints -1. Otherwise, it prints ans.

The output of code execution is:
AZ
END-OF-OUTPUT
