Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
from functools import reduce
from fractions import gcd
import math
import bisect
import itertools
import sys
sys.setrecursionlimit(10**7)
input = sys.stdin.readline
INF = float("inf")


def main():
    N, K, S = map(int, input().split())
    
    A = [S]*N
    if S == 10**9:
        for i in range(N-K):
            A[i] = S - 1
    else:
        for i in range(N-K):
            A[i] = 10**9

    print(' '.join(map(str, A)))


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
4 2 3

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable N, variable K and variable S are initialized to 4, 2 and 3, respectively.

The variable A is initialized to a list of length N, where each element is equal to S.

If S is equal to 10^9, then the first K elements of A are initialized to S-1, and the remaining N-K elements are initialized to 10^9.

If S is not equal to 10^9, then the first K elements of A are initialized to 10^9, and the remaining N-K elements are initialized to 10^9.

The code then prints the elements of A separated by spaces.

The output of code execution is:
3 3 3 3
END-OF-OUTPUT
