Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
import sys
input = sys.stdin.readline
sys.setrecursionlimit(1000000)
from collections import deque, Counter
def getN():
    return int(input())
def getList():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
import math


INF = 10 ** 20

def main():
    n = getN()
    if n == 1:
        print(1)
        print(1)
        return
    if n == 2:
        print(2)
        print(0)
        print("11")
        return

    print(n-1)
    print("11")
    for i in range(1, n-1):
        print("1" + "0" * i + "1")

    return
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
2

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The code is a solution to the problem of generating all binary numbers of length n-1. The problem is to generate all binary numbers of length n-1, where the first and last digits are 1. The first and last digits are 1 because the binary numbers of length n-1 start and end with 1.

The code first reads the input n, which is 2 in this case. It then checks if n is equal to 1 or 2. If it is, it prints the appropriate output and returns.

If n is greater than 2, the code prints n-1, which is 1 in this case. It then prints "11", which is the first binary number of length n-1.

Finally, the code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n-2 (inclusive). For each iteration, it generates a binary number of length i by concatenating "1" with "0" i-1 times and "1". It then prints this binary number.

The output of code execution is:
1
11
101
