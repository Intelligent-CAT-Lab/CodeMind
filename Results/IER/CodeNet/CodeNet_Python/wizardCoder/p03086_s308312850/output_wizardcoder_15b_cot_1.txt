Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
S = input()
ls = list(S)
ans = 0
for i in range(len(ls)):
    cnt = 0
    for j in range(i,len(ls)):
        if S[j] in ['A','T','C','G']:
            cnt += 1
            if j == len(ls) - 1:
                ans = max(ans,cnt)
        else:
            ans = max(ans,cnt)
            break
print(ans)
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
ATCODER

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable S is initialized to "ATCODER".
The variable ls is initialized to a list of characters in S.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the maximum length of consecutive nucleotide sequences.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the indices of ls.
For each index i in this range, it initializes a variable cnt to 0, which will be used to accumulate the length of consecutive nucleotide sequences starting at i.
The code then enters another loop that iterates over the indices of ls starting from i.
For each index j in this range, it checks if the character at index j is a nucleotide sequence (A, T, C, or G). If it is, it increments cnt by 1. If j is the last index of ls, it updates ans to the maximum of its current value and cnt.
If the character at index j is not a nucleotide sequence, it updates ans to the maximum of its current value and cnt. It then breaks out of the inner loop.
After the outer loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 3.

The output of code execution is:
3
END-OF-OUTPUT
