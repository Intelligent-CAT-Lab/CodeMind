Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
import sys
input = sys.stdin.readline
A, B, C, D, E, F = map(int, input().split())
wdp = [0] * (F + 1)
sdp = [0] * (F + 1)
wdp[0] = 1
sdp[0] = 1
resa = 100 * A
resb = 0
for i in range(F + 1):
  if i + A * 100 <= F: wdp[i + A * 100] += wdp[i]
  if i + B * 100 <= F: wdp[i + B * 100] += wdp[i]
for i in range(F + 1):
  if i + C <= F: sdp[i + C] += sdp[i]
  if i + D <= F: sdp[i + D] += sdp[i]
for i in range(1, F + 1):
  if sdp[i] == 0: continue
  w = 0
  for j in range(1, F + 1):
    if i + j > F: break
    if wdp[j] == 0: continue
    if i <= j * E // 100:
      w = j
      break
  if w == 0: continue
  #print(i, i + w)
  #print(float(i) / float(i + w))
  if resb / resa < float(i) / float(i + w):
    resb = i
    resa = i + w
print(resa, resb)
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
1 2 10 20 15 200

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable A, B, C, D, E, and F are initialized to 1, 2, 10, 20, 15, and 200, respectively.

The variables wdp and sdp are initialized to a list of length F+1, with all elements set to 0.

The variable resa is initialized to 100 * A, which is 100 in this case.

The variable resb is initialized to 0.

The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to F (inclusive), meaning it will consider all possible values of F.

For each value of F, the code calculates the number of ways to reach that value using the following rules:

- If i + A * 100 <= F, then there is one way to reach i + A * 100 using 1 coin of value A.
- If i + B * 100 <= F, then there is one way to reach i + B * 100 using 1 coin of value B.

The code accumulates these values in the wdp list.

Similarly, the code calculates the number of ways to reach each value of F using the following rules:

- If i + C <= F, then there is one way to reach i + C using 1 coin of value C.
- If i + D <= F, then there is one way to reach i + D using 1 coin of value D.

The code accumulates these values in the sdp list.

After the loop finishes, the code enters another loop that iterates from 1 to F (inclusive), meaning it will consider all possible values of F.

For each value of F, the code calculates the number of ways to reach that value using the following rules:

- If sdp[i] == 0, then there are no ways to reach i using any combination of coins.
- If i + j > F, then there are no more ways to reach i using any combination of coins.
- If wdp[j] == 0, then there are no ways to reach i using any combination of coins.
- If i <= j * E // 100, then there is one way to reach i using 1 coin of value j * E // 100.
