The variable A, B, C, D, E, and F are initialized to 1, 2, 10, 20, 15, and 200, respectively.

The variables wdp and sdp are initialized to a list of length F+1, with all elements set to 0.

The variable resa is initialized to 100 * A, which is 100 in this case.

The variable resb is initialized to 0.

The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to F (inclusive), meaning it will consider all possible values of F.

For each value of F, the code calculates the number of ways to reach that value using the following rules:

- If i + A * 100 <= F, then there is one way to reach i + A * 100 using 1 coin of value A.
- If i + B * 100 <= F, then there is one way to reach i + B * 100 using 1 coin of value B.

The code accumulates these values in the wdp list.

Similarly, the code calculates the number of ways to reach each value of F using the following rules:

- If i + C <= F, then there is one way to reach i + C using 1 coin of value C.
- If i + D <= F, then there is one way to reach i + D using 1 coin of value D.

The code accumulates these values in the sdp list.

After the loop finishes, the code enters another loop that iterates from 1 to F (inclusive), meaning it will consider all possible values of F.

For each value of F, the code calculates the number of ways to reach that value using the following rules:

- If sdp[i] == 0, then there are no ways to reach i using any combination of coins.
- If i + j > F, then there are no more ways to reach i using any combination of coins.
- If wdp[j] == 0, then there are no ways to reach i using any combination of coins.
- If i <= j * E // 100, then there is one way to reach i using 1 coin of value j * E // 100.

The code accumulates these values in the wdp list.
