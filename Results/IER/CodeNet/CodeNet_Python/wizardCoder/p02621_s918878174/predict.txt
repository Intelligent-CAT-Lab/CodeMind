The variable n is initialized to 2.
The code calculates the sum of n, n^2 and n^3 and prints the result as an integer.
The sum of n, n^2 and n^3 is calculated as follows:
n+n^2+n^3 = n+(n^2)+(n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(n^2+n^3) = n+(
