The code defines a function fib(n) that calculates the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence. The function uses a memoization technique to store previously calculated values to avoid redundant calculations.

The code then defines a function solve() that reads an integer N from standard input and calls the fib() function with N+1 as the argument. The fib() function returns the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence, which is then printed to standard output.

When the code is executed with input 5, the output is:

8

The code calculates the 6th number in the Fibonacci sequence, which is 8.
