Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
N = int(input())

res = 'Yes'

k = 0

while 2 ** (k + 1) - 1 <= N:
    k += 1

K = 2 ** k - 1


if N == 1:
    res = 'No'
if N == K + 1:
    res = 'No'
# print(N, K)

if N % 2 == 0:
    M = N - 1
else:
    M = N
if (M - K) % 4 == 0 and M > K:
    L = M - 2
else:
    L = M

P = N - K
if P % 2 == 0:
    P = 2

print(res)

if res == 'Yes':
    line = list(range(1, K + 1))
    line.remove(P)
    line = [1, P] + line[1:]
    
    for i in range(K - 1):
        print(line[i], line[i + 1])
    print(line[-1], N + 1)
    for i in range(K - 1):
        print(N + line[i], N + line[i + 1])
    if L > K:
        print(1, K + 1)
        for i in range(K + 1, L):
            print(i, i + 1)
        for i in range(K + 1, L):
            print(N + i, N + i + 1)
        print(N + L, 1)
    if M > L:
        print(N + 1, M - 1)
        print(M - 1, M)
        print(N + M - 1, N + M)
        print(N + M, N + 1)
    if N > M:
        print(N, K + 1)
        print(N + N, P)


<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
3

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable N is initialized to 3.

The variable res is initialized to 'Yes'.

The variable k is initialized to 0.

The while loop runs until 2^(k+1)-1 is greater than or equal to N. In this case, 2^(k+1)-1 is 7, which is greater than or equal to N. Therefore, the loop will run for k=1.

The variable K is initialized to 2^k-1, which is 3.

The if statement checks if N is equal to 1 or K+1. Since N is 3, neither of these conditions are met. Therefore, the variable res remains 'Yes'.

The if statement checks if N is even. Since N is 3, it is even. Therefore, the variable M is initialized to N-1, which is 2.

The if statement checks if (M-K) is divisible by 4 and if M is greater than K. Since (M-K) is 1 and M is 2, neither of these conditions are met. Therefore, the variable L is initialized to M.

The variable P is initialized to N-K, which is 1.

The if statement checks if P is even. Since P is 1, it is even. Therefore, the variable P is set to 2.

The code prints 'Yes'.

The if statement checks if res is equal to 'Yes'. Since res is 'Yes', the code prints the following lines:
1 2
2 3
3 1

The if statement checks if L is greater than K. Since L is 2 and K is 3, L is greater than K. Therefore, the code prints the following lines:
1 3
3 1

The if statement checks if M is greater than L. Since M is 2 and L is 2, M is greater than L. Therefore, the code prints the following lines:
1 3
3 1
2 3
3 1

The if statement checks if N is greater than M. Since N is 3 and M is 2, N is greater than M. Therefore, the code prints the following lines:
3 1
1 3
3 1
1 3

The if statement checks if N is greater than K. Since N is 3 and K is 3, N is greater than K. Therefore, the code prints the following lines:
3 1
1 3
3 1
1 3
3 1
1 3

The code prints the final line:
1 3

The output of code execution is:
1 2
2 3
3 1
1 3
3 1
1 3
1 3
