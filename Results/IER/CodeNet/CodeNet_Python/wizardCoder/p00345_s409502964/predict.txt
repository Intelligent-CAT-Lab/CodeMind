The code given in the problem statement is a Python code that calculates the fractional part of a decimal number. The input is a string representing a decimal number with an optional fractional part. The output is the fractional part of the decimal number.

The code first checks if the input string contains a fractional part. If it does, it extracts the fractional part and converts it to a float. If it doesn't, it sets the float value to 0.0.

The code then calculates the fractional part of the decimal number by dividing the float value by 10.0 and taking the remainder.

The code then prints the fractional part of the decimal number.

The output of code execution for the input "0.(3)" is:

0.3
