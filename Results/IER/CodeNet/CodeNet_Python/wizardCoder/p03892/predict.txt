The function gcd(a,b) is defined to calculate the greatest common divisor of a and b using recursion. The function takes two arguments a and b and returns their gcd.

The function main() is defined to take input from the user and calculate the area of a rectangle. The function takes four arguments a, b, c and d, which represent the coordinates of the top-left and bottom-right corners of the rectangle.

The function first calculates the height and width of the rectangle using the formula abs(b-d) and abs(c-a), respectively. If either of these values is zero, the function returns 0, since a rectangle with zero height or width cannot have an area.

The function then calculates the gcd of the height and width using the gcd() function. This is done to ensure that the area of the rectangle is always an integer.

Finally, the function returns the area of the rectangle, which is the sum of the height and width minus the gcd.

The main() function is called with the input 1 1 3 4, which represents the coordinates of the top-left and bottom-right corners of a rectangle with height 2 and width 3.

The function calculates the height and width of the rectangle to be 2 and 3, respectively. It then calculates the gcd of 2 and 3 to be 1, since 1 is the gcd of both.

The function then returns the area of the rectangle, which is 2+3-1, or 5.

The output of the code execution is:
5
