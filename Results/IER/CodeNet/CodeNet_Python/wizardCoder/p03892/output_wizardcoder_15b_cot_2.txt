Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
def gcd(a,b): return b if a%b==0 else gcd(b,a%b)
def main():
    a,b,c,d = map(int,input().split())
    h = abs(b-d)
    w = abs(c-a)
    if h==0 or w==0 : return 0
    m = gcd(max(h,w),min(h,w))
    return h+w-m

print(main())

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
1 1 3 4

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The function gcd(a,b) is defined to calculate the greatest common divisor of a and b using recursion. The function takes two arguments a and b and returns their gcd.

The function main() is defined to take input from the user and calculate the area of a rectangle. The function takes four arguments a, b, c and d, which represent the coordinates of the top-left and bottom-right corners of the rectangle.

The function first calculates the height and width of the rectangle using the formula abs(b-d) and abs(c-a), respectively. If either of these values is zero, the function returns 0, since a rectangle with zero height or width cannot have an area.

The function then calculates the gcd of the height and width using the gcd() function. This is done to ensure that the area of the rectangle is always an integer.

Finally, the function returns the area of the rectangle, which is the sum of the height and width minus the gcd.

The main() function is called with the input 1 1 3 4, which represents the coordinates of the top-left and bottom-right corners of a rectangle with height 2 and width 3.

The function calculates the height and width of the rectangle to be 2 and 3, respectively. It then calculates the gcd of 2 and 3 to be 1, since 1 is the gcd of both.

The function then returns the area of the rectangle, which is 2+3-1, or 5.

The output of the code execution is:
5
