Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
def INT():
    return int(input())

def MI():
    return map(int, input().split())

def LI():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))

N, M = MI()

if 2 * N <= M:
    ans = N + (M - 2 * N) // 4
    
else:
    ans = M // 2
    
print(ans)
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
1 6

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The code defines four functions: INT(), MI(), LI(), and main(). The INT() function reads an integer from input, the MI() function reads two integers from input and returns them as a tuple, and the LI() function reads a list of integers from input and returns it as a list. The main() function reads two integers N and M from input, and then checks if 2N is less than or equal to M. If it is, the code calculates the answer as N + (M - 2N) // 4, which is the sum of N and the number of integers between 2N and M that are divisible by 4. If 2N is greater than M, the code calculates the answer as M // 2, which is the largest integer between M and 0 that is divisible by 2. Finally, the code prints the answer.

The input is:
1 6

The code first reads the input as two integers N and M. It then checks if 2N is less than or equal to M. Since 2N is 2 and M is 6, 2N is less than or equal to M, so the code calculates the answer as N + (M - 2N) // 4, which is 1 + (6 - 2) // 4 = 1 + 4 = 5. The code then prints the answer, which is 5.

The output of code execution is:
5
