The variable N is initialized to 2.

The variable nn is initialized to N+10.

The variable P is initialized to 998244353.

The list fa is initialized to [1] * (nn+1), which means that all elements of fa are set to 1.

The list fainv is initialized to [1] * (nn+1), which means that all elements of fainv are set to 1.

The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to nn-1, meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to nn-1.

For each number i in this range, it calculates the value of the i-th Fibonacci number using the formula fa[i+1] = fa[i] * (i+1) % P.

It also calculates the inverse of the i-th Fibonacci number using the formula fainv[i] = fainv[i+1] * (i+1) % P.

The code then enters another loop that iterates from nn-1 to 0, meaning it will consider numbers from nn-1 to 0.
