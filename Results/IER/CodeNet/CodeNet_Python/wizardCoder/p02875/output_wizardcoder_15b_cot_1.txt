Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
N = int(input())

nn = N + 10
P = 998244353

fa = [1] * (nn+1)
fainv = [1] * (nn+1)
for i in range(nn):
    fa[i+1] = fa[i] * (i+1) % P
fainv[-1] = pow(fa[-1], P-2, P)
for i in range(nn)[::-1]:
    fainv[i] = fainv[i+1] * (i+1) % P
C = lambda a, b: fa[a] * fainv[b] % P * fainv[a-b] % P if 0 <= b <= a else 0

ans = pow(3, N, P)
for i in range(N//2 + 1, N + 1):
    ans = (ans - 2 * C(N, i) * pow(2, N - i, P)) % P

print(ans)
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:

### Response:
The variable N is initialized to 2.

The variable nn is initialized to N+10.

The variable P is initialized to 998244353.

The list fa is initialized to [1] * (nn+1), which means that all elements of fa are set to 1.

The list fainv is initialized to [1] * (nn+1), which means that all elements of fainv are set to 1.

The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to nn-1, meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to nn-1.

It also calculates the inverse of the i-th Fibonacci number using the formula fainv[i] = fainv[i+1] * (i+1) % P.
