The variable N is initialized to 10.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 10 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 10.
For each number i in this range, it enters a nested loop that iterates from 1 to 10 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 10.
For each number j in this range, it checks if i*j is equal to N. If it is, it prints "Yes" and exits the inner loop.
If the inner loop finishes, the code prints "No" and exits the outer loop.
<<<Output>>>
No

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
N=int(input())
for i in range(1,10):
    for j in range(1,10):
        if(i*j==N):
            print('Yes')
            exit()
print('No')
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
