The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 5, 2 and 4, respectively.
The code checks if the difference between A and B is even or odd. If it is even, it prints the middle number of the range [A, B]. If it is odd, it prints the middle number of the range [A, B] plus 1.
The code then prints the output.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
N,A,B = map(int,input().split())
if (A-B)%2==0:
  print((B-A)//2)
else:
  print(min(A-1,N-B)+1+(B-A)//2)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 2 4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
