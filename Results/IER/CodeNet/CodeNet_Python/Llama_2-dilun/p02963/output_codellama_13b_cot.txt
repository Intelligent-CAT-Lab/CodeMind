The variable S is initialized to 3.
The code calculates the square root of S, which is 1.7320508075688772.
The code checks if the square of the square root is greater than or equal to S.
If it is, it sets X1 and Y1 to the square root and X2 and Y2 to the square root plus 1.
Otherwise, it sets X1 and Y1 to the square root and X2 and Y2 to the square root plus 1.

The code calculates the remainder of S divided by X2 squared, which is 0.
If the remainder is 0, it sets X3 and Y3 to 0.
Otherwise, it checks if the remainder is less than 10^9.
If it is, it sets X3 to 1 and Y3 to the remainder.
Otherwise, it sets X3 to 1 and Y3 to the remainder.

The code prints the values of X1, Y1, X2, Y2, X3 and Y3.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())

A = [0]*N

for i in range(N):
    A[i] = int(input())

for i in range(N):
    for j in range(N):
        if A[i] == A[j]:
            A[i] = 0

for i in range(N):
    print(A[i])
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 1 2 3 4 5```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The variable N is initialized to 3.
The code creates an array A with length N.
It then iterates over the array and sets each element to 0.
It then iterates over the array and sets each element to the input.
It then iterates over the array and checks if each element is equal to another element.
If it is, it sets the element to 0.
It then iterates over the array and prints each element.
