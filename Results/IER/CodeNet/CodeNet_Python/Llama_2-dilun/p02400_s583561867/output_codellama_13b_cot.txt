    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import math


def mennseki(r):
    S = r ** 2 * math.pi
    return S


def ennsyuu(r):
    R = 2 * r * math.pi
    return R


r = float(input())
print(mennseki(r), ennsyuu(r))


<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
