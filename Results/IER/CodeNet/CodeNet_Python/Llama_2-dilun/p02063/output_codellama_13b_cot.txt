The variable A and variable B are initialized to 4 and 6, respectively.
The code checks if B is divisible by A. If it is, it prints -1 and exits.
The code calculates the value of _k, which is -(-B//A).
The code then iterates from _k to _k+10**7, which is from -(-B//A) to -(-B//A)+10**7.
For each k in this range, it calculates the value of bn, rem, an and n.
It then checks if n is greater than k. If it is, it prints k*A and exits.
The code then prints -1.
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
A,B = map(int,input().split())

if B%A == 0:
    print(-1)
    exit()

_k = -(-B//A)

for k in range(_k, _k+10**7):
    bn, rem = divmod(k*A, B)
    an, rem = divmod(rem, A)
    n = bn + an + rem
    if n > k:
        print(k*A)
        exit()
print(-1)

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4 6
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
