The code first checks if the input is 'ani'. If it is, it prints'square1001'. Otherwise, it prints 'e869120'.
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
print('square1001' if input()=='ani' else 'e869120')


<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```ani
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
