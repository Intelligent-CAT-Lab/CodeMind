The variable a, variable b and variable k are initialized to 2, 3 and 3, respectively.
The code checks if a is less than or equal to k. If it is, it subtracts a from k and sets a to 0.
Otherwise, it prints the value of a minus k and b, and exits the program.
The code then prints 0 and the maximum value of b minus k, which is 0.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
a, b, k = map(int, input().split())
if a <= k:
    k -= a
    a = 0
else:
    print(a - k, b)
    exit()
print(0, max(b - k, 0))

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 3 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
