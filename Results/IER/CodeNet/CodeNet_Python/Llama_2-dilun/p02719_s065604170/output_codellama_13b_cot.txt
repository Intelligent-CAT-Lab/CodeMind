The variable n and variable m are initialized to 7 and 4, respectively.
The code then prints the minimum of n % m and -n % m, which is -1.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
n, m = map(int, input().split())
print(min(n % m, -n % m))
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10 5
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
