The code first imports the re module, which provides regular expression functionality.
The code then uses the re.sub function to replace all occurrences of the regular expression "(apple|peach)" with a function that takes a match object as an argument.
The function returns a list containing either "apple" or "peach" depending on whether the match object is "apple" or "peach".
The regular expression "(apple|peach)" matches either "apple" or "peach".
The code then prints the result of the re.sub function, which replaces all occurrences of "(apple|peach)" with either "apple" or "peach" depending on the match object.
In this case, the input is "the cost of one peach is higher than that of one apple.", so the output is "the cost of one apple is higher than that of one peach."
<<<Output>>>
the cost of one apple is higher than that of one peach.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import re
print(re.sub(r"(apple|peach)", lambda m: ["apple","peach"][m.group(0)=="apple"], input()))

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```the cost of one peach is higher than that of one apple.
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
