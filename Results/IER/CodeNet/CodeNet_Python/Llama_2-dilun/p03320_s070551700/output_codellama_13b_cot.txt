The code first initializes k to 10.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to k (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 10.
For each number no in this range, it prints the number.
The code then checks if Check(no + st, no + st * 10) is True. If it is, it multiplies st by 10.
The code then increments no by st.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of no, which is 100.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def Ask(x):
    ans = 0
    while (x):
        ans += x % 10
        x //= 10
    return ans

def Check(x, y):
    return x * Ask(y) > y * Ask(x)


k = int(input())
no = st = 1
while (k):
    k -= 1
    print(no)
    if (Check(no + st, no + st * 10)): st *= 10
    no += st

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
