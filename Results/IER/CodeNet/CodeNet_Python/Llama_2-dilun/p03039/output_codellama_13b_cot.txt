The variable n, variable m and variable k are initialized to 2, 2 and 2, respectively.
The code then calculates the value of M and Ms.
M is the sum of the first n numbers, which is 1+2+3+...+n.
Ms is the sum of the first n numbers squared, which is 1^2+2^2+3^2+...+n^2.
The code then calculates the value of ans.
ans is the sum of the first n numbers multiplied by the first m numbers, which is 1*1+2*2+3*3+...+n*n.
The code then calculates the value of ans.
