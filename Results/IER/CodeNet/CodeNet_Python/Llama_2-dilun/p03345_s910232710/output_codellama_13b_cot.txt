The variable A, B, C and K are initialized to 1, 2, 3 and 1, respectively.
The code then calls the function main() to start the execution.
The function main() first reads the input from the standard input stream and stores it in the variables A, B, C and K.
The variable A is initialized to 1, the variable B is initialized to 2, the variable C is initialized to 3 and the variable K is initialized to 1.
The code then calculates the difference between A and B, which is 1.
If K is even, the code prints 1. Otherwise, it prints -1.
The code then terminates.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import sys

sys.setrecursionlimit(10 ** 8)

input = sys.stdin.readline


def main():
    A, B, C, K = [int(x) for x in input().split()]

    ans = A - B
    if K % 2 == 0:
        print(ans)
    else:
        print(-ans)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()


<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 2 3 1
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
