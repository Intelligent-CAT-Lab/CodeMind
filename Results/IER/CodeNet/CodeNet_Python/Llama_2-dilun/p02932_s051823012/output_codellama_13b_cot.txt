Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    return n * f(n-1)

def g(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    return n * g(n-1)

def h(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    return n * h(n-1)

def main():
    n = int(input())
    print(f(n))
    print(g(n))
    print(h(n))

main()
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
