The variable s is initialized to the string "internationalization".
The code then prints the first character of s, which is "i".
The code then prints the length of the substring s[1:-1], which is 11.
The code then prints the last character of s, which is "n".

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
s = input()
print(s[0] + str(len(s[1:-1])) + s[-1])
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```internationalization
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
