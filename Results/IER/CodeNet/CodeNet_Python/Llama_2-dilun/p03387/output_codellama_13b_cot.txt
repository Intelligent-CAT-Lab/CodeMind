The variable a, b and c are initialized to 2, 5 and 4, respectively.
The variable x is initialized to the maximum of a, b and c, which is 5.
The variable y is initialized to the minimum of a, b and c, which is 2.
The variable z is initialized to a+b+c-x-y, which is 11.
The code checks if (z-y)%2==0, which is true.
The code then prints x-z+(z-y)//2, which is 5-11+5=1.
The code checks if (z-y)%2==0, which is false.
The code then prints x-z+1+(z-y+1)//2, which is 5-11+1+5=1.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b,c=map(int,input().split())
x=max(a,b,c)
y=min(a,b,c)
z=a+b+c-x-y
if (z-y)%2==0:
  print(x-z+(z-y)//2)
else:
  print(x-z+1+(z-y+1)//2)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 5 4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
