The variable s is initialized to 46979.
The code then prints the value of s divided by 3600, the value of s divided by 60 and the value of s modulo 60, separated by a colon.
The output is 12:46:979.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
s = int(input())
print(s // 3600, (s // 60) % 60, s % 60, sep = ':')

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```46979
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
