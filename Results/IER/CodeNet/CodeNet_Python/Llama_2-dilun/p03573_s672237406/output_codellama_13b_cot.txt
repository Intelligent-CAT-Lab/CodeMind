The variable a, b and c are initialized to 5, 7 and 5, respectively.
The code checks if a equals b. Since a and b are both 5, the code prints c, which is 5.
The code then checks if a equals c. Since a and c are both 5, the code prints b, which is 7.
The code then checks if a equals b. Since a and b are not equal, the code prints a, which is 5.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
if a == b:
    print(c)
elif a == c:
    print(b)
else:
    print(a)

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 7 5
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
