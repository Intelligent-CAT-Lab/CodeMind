The input is a string.
The code converts the string to a list of characters.
The code then prints the character with the highest count and the character with the longest length.
The character with the highest count is 'o', which appears 3 times.
The character with the longest length is 'l', which has a length of 1.
The output is 'o' and 'l'.
<<<Output>>>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
a = list(input().split())
print(max(a, key=a.count), max(a, key=len))

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```Thank you for your mail and your lectures
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
