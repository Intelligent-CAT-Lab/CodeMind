The variable s is initialized to the input string "oxxoxoo".
The code then checks if the first and last characters of s are both 'x'. If it is, it prints 'x'. Otherwise, it prints 'o'.
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
s = raw_input()
print 'x' if s[0]=='x' and s[-1]=='x' else 'o'
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```oxxoxoo
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
