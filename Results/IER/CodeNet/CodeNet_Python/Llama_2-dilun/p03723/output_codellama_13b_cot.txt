The variable a, b and c are initialized to 4, 12 and 20, respectively.
The function rem() checks if the three numbers are divisible by 2.
The function isDouble() checks if the three numbers are integers.
The variable cnt is initialized to 0.
The variable fa, fb and fc are initialized to a, b and c, respectively.
The while loop iterates until the condition is not met.
The condition is met when the three numbers are divisible by 2 and integers.
The variable tmp1, tmp2 and tmp3 are initialized to a / 2, b / 2 and c / 2, respectively.
The variable a, b and c are initialized to tmp2 + tmp3, tmp1 + tmp3 and tmp1 + tmp2, respectively.
The variable cnt is incremented by 1.
The condition is met when the three numbers are not divisible by 2.
The code prints the value of cnt, which is 1.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import math
import sys


def rem(a, b, c):
    if a % 2!= 0 or b % 2!= 0 or c % 2!= 0:
        return False
    else:

def isDouble(a, b, c):
    if (a%1!=0 or b%1!=0 or c%1!=0):
        return False
    else:
        return True
a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
cnt = 0
fa = a
fb = b
fc=c
while True:
    if (cnt!= 0 and fa == a and fb == b and fc == c):
        print(-1)
        sys.exit()
    tmp1 = a / 2
    tmp2 = b / 2
    tmp3 = c / 2
    if (not isDouble(tmp1, tmp2, tmp3)):
        break
    cnt += 1
    a = tmp2 + tmp3
    b = tmp1 + tmp3
    c = tmp1 + tmp2
    if (not rem(a, b, c)):
        break
print(cnt)

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4 12 20
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
