    Consider the following code:
<Code>
# coding: utf-8
# Your code here!

n=input().upper()
print(n)

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```this is a pen.
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
