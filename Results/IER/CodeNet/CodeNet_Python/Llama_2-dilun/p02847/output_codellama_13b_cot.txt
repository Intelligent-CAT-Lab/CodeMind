The variable a is initialized to the string "SAT".
The variable week is initialized to a dictionary with the keys "SUN", "MON", "TUE", "WED", "THU", "FRI" and "SAT" and the values 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, respectively.
The variable week.get(a) returns the value 6, which is the value of the key "SAT" in the dictionary week.
The variable 7-int(week.get(a)) returns the value 1, which is the difference between 7 and 6.
The code prints the value 1.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
from sys import stdin

a = stdin.readline().rstrip()

week = {'SUN':0,'MON':1,'TUE':2,'WED':3,'THU':4,'FRI':5,'SAT':6}

print(7-int(week.get(a)))
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```SAT
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
