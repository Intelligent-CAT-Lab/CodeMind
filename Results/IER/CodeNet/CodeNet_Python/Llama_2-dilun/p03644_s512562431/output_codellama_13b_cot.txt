The variable N is initialized to 7.
The variable n is initialized to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates while 2**n is less than or equal to N.
The code increments n by 1 each time the loop is entered.
The code prints 2**(n-1), which is 2**(-1) = 1/2.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = input()
N = int(N)
n = 0
while 2**n<=N:
    n=n+1
print(2**(n-1))
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```7
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
