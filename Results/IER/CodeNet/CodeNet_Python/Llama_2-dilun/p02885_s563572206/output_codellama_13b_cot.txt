The variable a and variable b are initialized to 12 and 4, respectively.
The variable c is initialized to b+b, which is 8.
The code checks if a-c is not equal to 0 and is greater than or equal to 0.
If this condition is met, the code prints the value of a-c, which is 4.
Otherwise, it prints 0.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b=[int(a)for a in input().split()]

c=b+b
if(a-c!=0)and(a-c>=0):
    print(a-c)
else:
    print(0)

#print(type(c))
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```12 4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
