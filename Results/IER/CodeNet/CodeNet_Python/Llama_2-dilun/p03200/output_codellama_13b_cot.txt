The variable s is initialized to "BBW".
The variable cnt is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the number of Ws.
The variable l is initialized to 0, which will be used to keep track of the index of the first W.

The code then enters a loop that iterates over the characters in s.
For each character i in the string, if it is a W, it adds the index of the first W to the current index of the W.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of cnt, which is 2.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
s = input()

cnt = 0
l = 0

for i in range(len(s)):
    if s[i] == 'W':
        cnt += i-l
        l += 1

print(cnt)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```BBW
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
