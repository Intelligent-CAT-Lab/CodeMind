The variable s and variable w are initialized to 4 and 5, respectively.
The code then checks if w is greater than or equal to s. If it is, it prints "unsafe". Otherwise, it prints "safe".
<<<Output>>>
safe

Consider the following code:
<Code>
s, w = map(int, input().split())

if w >= s :
    print("unsafe")
else:
    print("safe")
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4 5
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
