<<<Analysis>>>
The variable a and variable b are initialized to 3 and 1, respectively.
The code then checks if a is in the set {1,3} and b is in the set {1,3}.
If the condition is met, it prints 'Yes'. Otherwise, it prints 'No'.
<<<Output>>>
Yes

Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b = (int(_) for _ in input().split())

print('Yes') if (a in (1,3) and b in (1,3)) \
    else print('No')
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 1
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
