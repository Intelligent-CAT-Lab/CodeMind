The variable s is initialized to the input string "3 9".
The variables n and m are initialized to 3 and 9, respectively.
The variable n is converted to an integer.
The variable m is converted to an integer.

If n is equal to 1, the code prints the remainder of m divided by 1000000007.
Otherwise, the variable d is initialized to m divided by (n - 1).

The variable A is initialized to m minus d times (n - 1) plus 1.
The variable B is initialized to m minus (n - 1) plus 1.
The variable ans is initialized to the sum of A and B times d plus m plus 1.
The variable ans is then modulo 1000000007.
The code prints the value of ans.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
s = input()
n, m = s.split()
n = int(n)
m = int(m)

if n==1:
    print((m+1)%1000000007)
else:

    d = m // (n - 1)


    A = m - d * (n-1) + 1
    B = m - (n-1) + 1
    ans = (A+B)*d + (m+1)
    # ans = 2*(d*m+d)-(n-1)*(d+1)*d+m+1
    ans %= 1000000007
    print(ans)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 9
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
