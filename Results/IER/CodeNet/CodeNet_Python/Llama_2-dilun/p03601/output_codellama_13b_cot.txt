The code first splits the input into a list of numbers.
The code then calculates the sum of the first 4 numbers and stores it in variable e.
The code also calculates the sum of the last 5 numbers and stores it in variable f.

The code then initializes a list called listx to store the values of x that can be obtained.
The code then initializes a list called listy to store the values of y that can be obtained.

The code then iterates through the list of numbers, starting from the first number.
For each number i, the code calculates the product of i and a, and stores it in variable a.
The code then iterates through the list of numbers, starting from the second number.
For each number j, the code calculates the product of j and b, and stores it in variable b.

The code then initializes a variable called i to 0.
The code then iterates through the list of numbers, starting from the first number.
For each number i, the code calculates the product of i, a, and 100, and stores it in variable x.
The code then checks if x is greater than f.
If it is, the code breaks out of the loop.
The code then initializes a variable called j to 0.
The code then iterates through the list of numbers, starting from the second number.
For each number j, the code calculates the product of j, b, and 100, and stores it in variable y.
The code then checks if y is greater than f.
If it is, the code breaks out of the loop.
The code then checks if x is not in listx.
If it is, the code adds x to listx.
The code then increments j by 1 and continues the loop.
The code then increments i by 1 and continues the loop.

The code then initializes a variable called i to 0.
The code then iterates through the list of numbers, starting from the first number.
For each number i, the code calculates the product of i, c, and 100, and stores it in variable x.
The code then checks if x is greater than f2.
If it is, the code breaks out of the loop.
The code then initializes a variable called j to 0.
The code then iterates through the list of numbers, starting from the second number.
For each number j, the code calculates the product of j, d, and 100, and stores it in variable y.
The code then checks if y is greater than f2.
If it is, the code breaks out of the loop.
The code then checks if y is not in listy.
If it is, the code adds y to listy.
The code then increments j by 1 and continues the loop.
The code then increments i by 1 and continues the loop.

The code then initializes a variable called lengthx to the length of listx.
The code then initializes a variable called lengthy to the length of listy.

The code then initializes a variable called xy_max to 0.
The code then initializes a variable called y_max to 0.
The code then initializes a variable called noudo_max to 0.

The code then iterates through the list of numbers, starting from the first number.
For each number i, the code iterates through the list of numbers, starting from the second number.
For each number j, the code calculates the sum of x and y, and stores it in variable xy_max.
The code then checks if xy_max is greater than f.
If it is, the code breaks out of the loop.
The code then checks if y is not in listy.
If it is, the code adds y to listy.
The code then checks if float(y) * 100 / float(x) is less than or equal to e.
If it is, the code calculates the value of noudo as float(y) / (x + y) and stores it in variable noudo.
The code then checks if noudo is greater than noudo_max.
If it is, the code sets noudo_max to noudo and sets xy_max to x + y.
The code then sets y_max to y.

The code then prints the value of xy_max and y_max.
