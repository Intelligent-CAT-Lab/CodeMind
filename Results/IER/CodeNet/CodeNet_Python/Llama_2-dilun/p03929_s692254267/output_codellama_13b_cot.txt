The variable mod is initialized to 11.
The variables n and k are initialized to 7 and 7, respectively.
The variable k is then calculated as k = (k - 8) % mod, which is k = 7 % 11 = 4.
The variable last is calculated as last = 7 * n - 7 * 2 - 2, which is last = 7 * 7 - 7 * 2 - 2 = 49.
The variable idx is initialized to -1.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to last + 1 (inclusive), which is 1 to 49 + 1 = 50.
For each number i in this range, the code checks if 3 * (i + i + 1 + i + 2) % mod == k, which is 3 * (i + i + 1 + i + 2) % 11 == 4.
This condition is met when i is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49.
If the condition is met, the variable idx is set to i and the loop is exited.
The variable r2idx is initialized to -1.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n + 1 (inclusive), which is 1 to 7 + 1 = 8.
For each number i in this range, the code checks if (7 * i - 1 - idx) % 11 == 0, which is (7 * i - 1 - 1) % 11 == 0.
This condition is met when i is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
If the condition is met, the variable r2idx is set to 7 * i - 1 and the loop is exited.
The variable r1idx is initialized to -1.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n + 1 (inclusive), which is 1 to 7 + 1 = 8.
For each number i in this range, the code checks if (7 * i - idx) % 11 == 0, which is (7 * i - 1) % 11 == 0.
This condition is met when i is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
If the condition is met, the variable r1idx is set to 7 * i and the loop is exited.
If the variable idx is -1, the code prints 0 and exits.
If the variable r1idx is -1, the code checks if r2idx is -1.
If r2idx is -1, the code prints ((last - idx) / 11 + 1).
If r2idx is not -1, the code prints ((last - idx) / 11 + 1) - (last - r2idx) / (7 * 11) - 1).
If the variable r1idx is -1, the code checks if r2idx is -1.
If r2idx is -1, the code prints ((last - idx) / 11 + 1) - (last - r1idx) / (7 * 11) - 1).
If r2idx is not -1, the code prints ((last - idx) / 11 + 1) - (last - r2idx) / (7 * 11) - 1) - (last - r1idx) / (7 * 11) - 1).
