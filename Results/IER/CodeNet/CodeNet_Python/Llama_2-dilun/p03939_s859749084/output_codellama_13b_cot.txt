The input is 1 3 3.
The function solve takes three parameters: n, d and x.
n is initialized to 1, d is initialized to 3 and x is initialized to 3.
The function solve iterates while n is not 0.
In each iteration, it adds d to ans and multiplies x by (n + 2) / n.
It then updates d and x.
After the loop finishes, the function returns ans.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def solve(n, d, x):
    ans = 0
    while n:
        ans += d + (2 * n - 1) * x / 2
        d = ((n + 1) * d + 5 * x / 2) / n
        x *= (n + 2) / n
        n -= 1
    return ans


print('{:.10f}'.format(solve(*map(float, input().split()))))

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 3 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
