The variable n and variable k are initialized to 7 and 3, respectively.
The code prints 0 if n%k == 0, which is true in this case.
The code prints 1 if n%k!= 0, which is false in this case.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
n,k = map(int,input().split(" "))
print(0) if n%k == 0 else print(1)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```7 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
