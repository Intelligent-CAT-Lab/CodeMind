The variable s is initialized to "xabxa".
The variable i is initialized to 0 and the variable j is initialized to the length of s minus 1.
The variable ans is initialized to 0.
The code enters a loop that iterates from i to j (inclusive), meaning it will consider the characters from 0 to 3.
The code checks if the characters at i and j are equal to "x". If they are, it increments i and decrements j.
If i is greater than j, the loop breaks.
The code checks if the character at i is equal to "x". If it is, it increments i and adds 1 to ans.
If i is greater than j, the loop breaks.
The code checks if the character at j is equal to "x". If it is, it decrements j and adds 1 to ans.
If i is greater than j, the loop breaks.
The code checks if the characters at i and j are not equal. If they are not, it sets ans to -1 and breaks the loop.
The code increments i and decrements j.
If i is greater than j, the loop breaks.
The code checks if the character at i is equal to the character at j. If they are, it increments i and decrements j.

The code checks if the character at j is equal to the character at i. If they are, it decrements j and increments i.
If i is greater than j, the loop breaks.
If the characters at i and j are not equal, the code sets ans to -1 and breaks the loop.
The code increments i and decrements j.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
s=input()
i=0
j=len(s)-1
ans=0
while i<j:
    while s[i]==s[j]=="x":
        i+=1
        j-=1
        if i>j:break
    if i>j:break    
    while s[i]=="x":
        i+=1
        ans+=1
        if i>j:break
    if i>j:break
    while s[j]=="x":
        j-=1
        ans+=1
        if i>j:break
    if i>j:break
    if s[i]!=s[j]:
        ans=-1
        break
    i+=1

print(ans)

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```xabxa
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
