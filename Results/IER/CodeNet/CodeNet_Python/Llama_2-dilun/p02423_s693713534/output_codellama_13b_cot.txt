The variable n is initialized to 8.
The variable m is initialized to 2^32-1, which is 4294967295.
The code prints the binary representation of n, which is 00000000000000000000000000000008.
The code prints the binary representation of ~n&m, which is 111111111111111111111111111111111.
The code prints the binary representation of n<<1&m, which is 000000000000000000000000000000000.
The code prints the binary representation of n>>1, which is 000000000000000000000000000000000.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
n=int(input())
m=(1<<32)-1

print("{:032b}".format(n))
print("{:032b}".format(~n&m))
print("{:032b}".format(n<<1&m))
print("{:032b}".format(n>>1))

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
