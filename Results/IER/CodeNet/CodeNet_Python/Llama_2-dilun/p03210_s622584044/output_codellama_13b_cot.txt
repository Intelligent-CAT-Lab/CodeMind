The variable x is initialized to 5.
The code then checks if x is equal to 3, 5 or 7. If it is, it prints YES. Otherwise, it prints NO.
<<<Output>>>
YES

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
x = int(input())

if x==3 or x==5 or x==7:
  print('YES')
else:
  print('NO')
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
