The variable n is initialized to 10.
The code then calculates the square root of n, which is 3.1622776601683794.
The code then calculates the square of the square root of n, which is 9.84442665640664.
The code then prints the square of the square root of n, which is 9.84442665640664.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import math
n = int(input())
x = int(math.sqrt(n))
print(x**2)

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
