The variable n, m and k are initialized to 2, 2 and 2, respectively.
The variable ans is initialized to "No".
The code enters a loop that iterates from n//2+1 to n, which is from 1 to 2 in this case.
For each number i in this range, it enters another loop that iterates from 0 to m, which is from 0 to 2 in this case.
For each number j in this range, it calculates the product of i and j, and the sum of (m-j)*(n-i).
It then checks if the product is equal to k or the sum is equal to k. If it is, it sets ans to "Yes".
The condition is met when i is 1 and j is 2, or when i is 2 and j is 0.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
n,m,k=map(int,input().split())
ans="No"
for i in range(n//2+1):
  for j in range(m):
    o=i*j+(m-j)*(n-i)
    x=n*m-o
    if o==k or x==k:
      ans="Yes"
print(ans)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 2 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
