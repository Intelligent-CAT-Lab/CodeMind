The variable a and variable b are initialized to "H H".
The code then prints "H" if the condition is met.
The condition is met when a == "H" and b == "H" or a == "D" and b == "D".
The code prints "H" in this case.
<<<Output>>>
H

Consider the following code:
<Code>
a, b = raw_input().split()
print "H" if (a == "H" and b == "H") or (a == "D" and b == "D") else "D"
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```H H
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
