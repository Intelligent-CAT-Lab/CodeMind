The code starts with a while loop that will run forever.
The condition of the loop is that n is not 0.
The code then asks for n numbers, which will be stored in the list S.
The code then initializes a list dup with all 0s.
The code then iterates through the list S and checks if the current number si is a substring of the next number sj.
If it is, the code sets dup[j] to 1.
The code then iterates through the list S again and checks if the current number si is a substring of the next number sj.
If it is, the code sets dup[i] to 1.
The code then iterates through the list S again and removes all numbers that are substrings of other numbers.
The code then initializes a list P with all 0s.
The code then iterates through the list S again and calculates the length of the longest substring of sj that is a substring of si.
The code then initializes a list ALL with all 0s.
The code then iterates through the list S again and calculates the length of the longest substring of sj that is a substring of si.
The code then initializes a dictionary memo with all 0s.
