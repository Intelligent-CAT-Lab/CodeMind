The variable x is initialized to 2.
The variable j is initialized to 2.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to x (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 2.
For each number i in this range, it multiplies j by 2 and adds 2 to j.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of j, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
x=int(input())
j=2
for i in range(x):
	j*=2
	j+=2
print(j)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
