The code first reads the input N and M.
The code then calls the function solve(N,M) to calculate the output.
The function solve(N,M) first checks if N is greater than M. If it is, it returns the transpose of the output of solve(M,N).
Otherwise, it creates a 2x2 array H, where the first element is [0].
For each element in the array, it calculates the difference between the element and the element to its left and right.
The difference is then calculated between the rows and columns of the array.
The output is then returned.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import sys
read = sys.stdin.buffer.read
readline = sys.stdin.buffer.readline
readlines = sys.stdin.buffer.readlines

import numpy as np

N,M = map(int,read().split())

def solve(N,M):
    if N > M:
        return solve(M,N).T
    H = np.array([[0]], np.int8)
    for i in range(M):
        H = np.tile(H, (2,2))
        H[1<<i:,1<<i:] ^= 1
    H = np.diff(H, axis=0)
    H = np.diff(H, axis=1)
    return (H % 2)[:(1<<N) - 1]

H = solve(N,M)
size = 0
for row in H:
    word = ''.join(row.astype(str))
    print(word)

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
