The variable S is initialized to aabbaa.
The variable l is initialized to a list of zeros with length equal to the length of S plus 1.
The first element of l is initialized to 1.
If the first two characters of S are the same, the second element of l is initialized to 1. Otherwise, it is initialized to 2.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 3 to the length of S plus 1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider the third, fourth, fifth, etc. characters of S.
If the current character is different from the previous two, the current element of l is initialized to the previous element of l plus 1. Otherwise, it is initialized to the previous element of l plus 2.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the last element of l, which is 3.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
S = input()

l = [0] * (len(S) + 1)
l[1] = 1
if S[0] == S[1]:
    l[2] = 1
else:
    l[2] = 2

for i in range(3, len(S)+1):
    if S[i-1]!= S[i-2]:
        l[i] = l[i-1] + 1
    else:
        l[i] = l[i-3] + 2

print(l[-1])

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```aabbaa
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
