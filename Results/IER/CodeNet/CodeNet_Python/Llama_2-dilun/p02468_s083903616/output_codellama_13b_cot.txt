The variable m and variable n are initialized to 2 and 3, respectively.
The function rep_pow is called with the arguments m, n and p.
The function rep_pow calculates the exponentiation of m to the power of n modulo p.
The function rep_pow first initializes the variable ans to 1.
Then it iterates while k is greater than 0.
If the bitwise AND of k and 1 is 1, it multiplies ans by m and stores the result in ans.
Then it multiplies a by a and stores the result in a.
It then shifts k right by 1.
It repeats the above steps until k is 0.
Finally, it returns ans.

The function rep_pow returns 16.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def rep_pow(a, k, p=10**9+7):
    # calculate exponentiation: a^k mod p
    ans = 1
    while k > 0:
        if k & 1:
            ans = ans * a % p
        a = a * a % p
        k >>= 1
    return ans

m, n = map(int, input().split())
print(rep_pow(m, n))

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
