The variable n and k are initialized to 11 and 2, respectively.
The code then enters a loop that iterates while n//k**i is not equal to 0.
The variable i is initialized to 0.
The code then checks if n//k**i is equal to 0. If it is, the loop terminates.
Otherwise, the code increments i by 1 and checks again.
The loop terminates when i is 5.
The code then prints the final value of i, which is 5.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
n,k = map(int, input().split())
i = 0

while n//k**i!= 0:
    i += 1

print(i)

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```11 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
