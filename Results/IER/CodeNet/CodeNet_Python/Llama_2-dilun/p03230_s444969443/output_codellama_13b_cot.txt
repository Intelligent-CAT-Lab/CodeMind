The variable n is initialized to 3.
The variable l is initialized to an empty list.
The variable i is initialized to 1.
The while loop iterates while n is greater than 0.
The variable t is initialized to i * (i - 1) // 2.
The variable l is appended with a list of integers from t + 1 to t + i + 1.
The variable i is incremented by 1.
The if statement checks if n is less than 0.
If n is less than 0, the code prints "No" and exits.
Otherwise, the code prints "Yes".
The variable i is decremented by 1.
The variable ans is initialized to a list containing i + 1.
The variable ans is appended with i.
The variable ans is appended with l[j][-1] for j in range(i).
The variable i is decremented by 1.
The variable ans is appended with i.
The variable ans is appended with l[j] for j in range(i).
The variable ans is appended with l[k][j] for k in range(j + 1, i).
The variable ans is printed.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def main():
	n = int(input())
	l = []
	i = 1
	while n > 0:
		n -= i
		t = i * (i - 1) // 2
		l += [list(range(t + 1, t + i + 1))]
		i += 1
	if n < 0:
		print("No")
		exit()
	print("Yes")
	i -= 1
	ans = [i + 1] + [i] + [l[j][-1] for j in range(i)]
	for j in range(i):
		ans += [i] + l[j] + [l[k][j] for k in range(j + 1, i)]
	print(" ".join(map(str, ans)))
	
if __name__=="__main__":

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
