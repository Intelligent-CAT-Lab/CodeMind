The input is "aba".
The code checks if the first and last characters are the same and if the length of the string is even or odd.
If the condition is met, it prints "First".
If the condition is not met, it prints "Second".
<<<Output>>>
First

Consider the following code:
<Code>
s=input()
if (s[0]==s[-1] and len(s)%2==0) or (s[0]!=s[-1] and len(s)%2==1):
 print("First")
else:
 print("Second")
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```aba
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
