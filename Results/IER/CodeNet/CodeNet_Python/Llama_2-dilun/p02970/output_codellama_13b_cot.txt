The variable n and variable d are initialized to 6 and 2, respectively.
The function solve() is called.
The function solve() calculates the value of n//(2*d+1) and prints the value of -(-n//(2*d+1)).
The value of n//(2*d+1) is 3, and the value of -(-n//(2*d+1)) is -(-3), which is 3.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def solve():
    n, d = map(int, input().split())
    print(-(-n//(2*d+1)))


if __name__ == '__main__':
    solve()

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```6 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
