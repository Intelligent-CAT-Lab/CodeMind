The input is 9 12.
The first line of code converts the input to a list of integers.
The second line of code calculates the sum of the first two elements of the list, which is 21.
The second line of code then calculates the remainder of 21 modulo 24, which is 3.
The second line of code then prints the result, which is 3.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
print(int((a[0] + a[1]) % 24))
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```9 12
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
