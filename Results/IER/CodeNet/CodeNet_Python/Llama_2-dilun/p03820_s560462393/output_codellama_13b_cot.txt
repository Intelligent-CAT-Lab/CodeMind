The code first initializes the modulo to 10^9+7.
Then it initializes the tables g1 and g2.
The table g1 is initialized to [1, 1] and the table g2 is initialized to [1, 1].
The table inverse is initialized to [0, 1].

The code then iterates from 2 to N (inclusive), which is 5000 in this case.
For each number i in this range, it appends the value of g1[-1] * i to the table g1.
It also appends the value of -inverse[mod % i] * (mod//i) to the table inverse.
It appends the value of g2[-1] * inverse[-1] to the table g2.

The code then asks for the input N and K.
If N is 1, it prints 1.
If K is 1, it prints pow(2,N-2,mod).
If K is N, it calculates the value of dp[0][K] and imos[K] and prints dp[0][K].

If N is not 1 and K is not N, the code initializes the table dp to [[0 for i in range(K+1)] for j in range(K)].
It also initializes the table imos to [0]*(K+1).
It initializes dp[0][K] to 1 and imos[K] to 1.

The code then iterates from 1 to K (inclusive), which is 4999 in this case.
For each number i in this range, it iterates from K-i to K+1 (inclusive), which is 4998 to 5000 in this case.
If j is K-i, it calculates the value of dp[i][j] and imos[j] and prints dp[i][j].
If j is not K-i, it calculates the value of dp[i-1][j] + imos[K] - imos[j] and prints dp[i][j].
It also iterates from 1 to K+1 (inclusive), which is 5000 in this case.
For each number j in this range, it calculates the value of imos[j] and prints imos[j].

The code then iterates from 1 to K (inclusive), which is 4999 in this case.
For each number i in this range, it iterates from K-i to K+1 (inclusive), which is 4998 to 5000 in this case.
It calculates the value of dp[i][j] and imos[j] and stores them in dp[i][j] and imos[j], respectively.
It also iterates from 1 to K+1 (inclusive), which is 5000 in this case.
For each number j in this range, it calculates the value of imos[j] and stores it in imos[j].

The code then iterates from 1 to N-K+1 (inclusive), which is 4999 in this case.
For each number M in this range, it calculates the value of dp[K-1][M] and the value of cmb(M-2,N-K-1,mod).
It then calculates the value of ans by multiplying dp[K-1][M] and cmb(M-2,N-K-1,mod).
It also calculates the value of ans by multiplying pow(2,N-K-1,mod).
It prints the value of ans.

The code then prints the value of ans % mod.
