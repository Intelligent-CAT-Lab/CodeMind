The variable L is initialized to 4.
The variable xs is initialized to an empty list.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 21 to 0 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 21 to 0.
For each number m in this range, the code checks if (2 << m) is greater than L. If it is, the loop breaks.
The code then appends two elements to the list xs. The first element is a tuple containing the values (m+1, m+2, 0). The second element is a tuple containing the values (m+1, m+2, 1 << m).
The code then checks if (2 << m) is greater than L. If it is, the loop breaks.
