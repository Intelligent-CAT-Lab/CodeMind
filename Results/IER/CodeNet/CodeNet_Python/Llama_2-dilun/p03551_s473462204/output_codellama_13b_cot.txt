The variable n and variable m are initialized to 1 and 1, respectively.
The code calculates the sum of n and m, which is 2.
The code then calculates the product of 2 and 2^m, which is 2^2.
The code then prints the product of 2^2 and 1900, which is 3800.
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
n,m=map(int,input().split())
submit=m*1900+(n-m)*100
print(submit*2**m)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 1
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
