The variable a and variable b are initialized to 2 and 5, respectively.
The code checks if a is between 1 and 9 and b is between 1 and 9.
If it is, it prints the product of a and b, which is 10.
If it is not, it prints -1.
<<<Output>>>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b=map(int,input().split())

if 1<=a<=9 and 1<=b<=9:
    print(a*b)
else:
    print(-1)

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 5
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
