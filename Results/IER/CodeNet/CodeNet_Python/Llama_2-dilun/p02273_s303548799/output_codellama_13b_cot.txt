The code first initializes n to 1.
It then initializes p1 to [0,0] and p2 to [100,0].
The code then calls f(n, p1, p2) to calculate the output.
The function f(n, p1, p2) is called recursively.
The first call of f(n, p1, p2) is f(1, [0,0], [100,0]).
The function f(1, [0,0], [100,0]) is called recursively.
The first call of f(1, [0,0], [100,0]) is f(0, [0,0], [100,0]).
The function f(0, [0,0], [100,0]) is called recursively.
The first call of f(0, [0,0], [100,0]) is f(0, [0,0], [100,0]).
The function f(0, [0,0], [100,0]) is called recursively.
