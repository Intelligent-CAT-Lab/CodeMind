The variable ref is initialized to the string "AADINNUY".
The variable aizu is initialized to the string "AIZUNYAN".
The variable inp is initialized to the input string.
The code checks if the length of inp is less than 8. If it is, it prints the input string. Otherwise, it sets the variable ans to the empty string.
The variable l is initialized to the length of inp.
The variable i is initialized to 0.
The code enters a while loop that iterates while i is less than l.
Inside the loop, the code checks if i is less than l - 8 and the sorted subsequence of inp starting from i is equal to ref. If it is, it appends aizu to ans and increments i by 8. Otherwise, it appends inp[i] to ans and increments i by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints ans.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(x):
    return x**2

def g(x):
    return x**3

def h(x):
    return x**4

def main():
    x = 2
    y = 3
    z = 4
    print f(x)
    print g(y)
    print h(z)

main()

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 3 4```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
