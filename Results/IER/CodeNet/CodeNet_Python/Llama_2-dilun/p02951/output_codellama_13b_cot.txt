The variable A, B and C are initialized to 6, 4 and 3, respectively.
The code calculates the difference between A and B, which is 2.
The code then calculates the difference between C and 2, which is 1.
The code checks if the result is less than 0. Since 1 is less than 0, the code sets the result to 0.
The code prints the result, which is 0.
<<<Output>>>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
A, B, C = map(int, input().split())

get = A - B

i = C - get

if i < 0:
    i = 0
     
print(i)

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```6 4 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
