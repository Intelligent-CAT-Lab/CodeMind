The variable N is initialized to 10000.
The function function(a,b) returns the length of the longest string representation of a and b.
The variable mini is initialized to the length of the string representation of N.
The variable lim is initialized to the length of the string representation of N**(0.5).
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to the square root of N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 2 to 100.
For each number i in this range, it checks if N is divisible by i. If it is, it checks if the length of the string representation of i is longer than the length of the string representation of N//i (i.e. the length of the string representation of the integer part of N divided by i). If it is, it sets mini to the length of the string representation of i.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the value of mini, which is 5.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
N=int(input())
def function(a,b):
    return max(len(str(a)), len(str(b)))
mini=len(str(N))
lim=len(str(int(N**(0.5))))
for i in range(2,int(N**(0.5)+1)):
    if mini==lim:
        break
    if N%i==0:
        if mini>function(i,N//i):
            mini=function(i,N//i)
print(mini)

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10000
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
