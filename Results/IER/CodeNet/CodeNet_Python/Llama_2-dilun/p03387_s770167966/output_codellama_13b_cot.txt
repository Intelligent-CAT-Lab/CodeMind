The variable A, B and C are initialized to 2, 5 and 4, respectively.
The variable m is initialized to the maximum of A, B and C, which is 5.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the final answer.
The variable A is incremented by (m-A)//2*2, which is 2.
The variable B is incremented by (m-B)//2*2, which is 2.
The variable C is incremented by (m-C)//2*2, which is 2.
The variable s is initialized to the number of elements in the list (A, B, C) that are equal to m, which is 3.
If s is equal to 3, the code does nothing.
If s is equal to 1, the variable ans is incremented by 1.
Otherwise, the variable ans is incremented by 2.
The final value of ans is 2.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
A, B, C = map(int, input().split())

m = max(A, B, C)
ans = 0
ans += (m-A)//2
A += (m-A)//2*2
ans += (m-B)//2
B += (m-B)//2*2
ans += (m-C)//2
C += (m-C)//2*2


s = sum([a == m for a in (A, B, C)])
if s == 3:
    pass
elif s == 1:
    ans += 1
else:
    ans += 2
print(ans)

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 5 4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
