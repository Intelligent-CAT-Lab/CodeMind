The variable N is initialized to 7.
The code checks if N is equal to 2. If it is, it prints -1 and exits the program.
The code then initializes a 2D array ans with the following format:
ans = [[0 for j in range(N-1)] for i in range(N)]

The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to N-1, meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 6.
For each number i in this range, it enters another loop that iterates from 0 to N-1, meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 6.
For each number j in this range, it sets ans[i][j] to (i+j+1)%N + 1.

The code then checks if N is even. If it is, it enters another loop that iterates from m to N, meaning it will consider numbers from 3 to 7.
For each number i in this range, it enters another loop that iterates from m to N-1, meaning it will consider numbers from 3 to 7.
For each number j in this range, it sets ans[i][m], ans[i][m-1] to ans[i][m-1], ans[i][m].

The code then prints the 2D array ans.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())
if N == 2:
    print(-1)
    exit()

ans = [[0 for j in range(N-1)] for i in range(N)]
for i in range(N):
    for j in range(N-1):
        ans[i][j] = (i+j+1)%N + 1

if N%2 == 0:
    m = N//2
    for i in range(m,N):
        ans[i][m],ans[i][m-1] = ans[i][m-1],ans[i][m]

for row in ans:
    print(' '.join(map(str,row)))

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```7
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
