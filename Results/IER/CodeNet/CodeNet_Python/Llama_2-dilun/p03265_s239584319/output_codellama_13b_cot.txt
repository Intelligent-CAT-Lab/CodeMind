The input is 0 0 0 1.
The code first creates two arrays, p1 and p2, which are initialized to [0,0] and [0,1], respectively.
The code then calculates the vector v1, which is [1,0].
The code then calculates the vector v2, which is [-1,1].
The code then calculates the vector p3, which is [1,0].
The code then calculates the vector p4, which is [-1,1].
The code then prints the output, which is [-1 1].

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import numpy as np
x1,y1,x2,y2=[int(a) for a in input().split()]
p1 = np.array([x1,y1])
p2 = np.array([x2,y2])
v1 = p2-p1
v2 = np.array([-v1[1],v1[0]])
p3 = p2+v2
p4 = p3+(-v1)
print(" ".join([str(v) for v in list(p3)+list(p4)]))
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```0 0 0 1
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
