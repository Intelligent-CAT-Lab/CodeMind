The variable L, A, B, M are initialized to 5, 3, 4, 10007, respectively.
The function matpow is called to calculate the power of a matrix.
The function matpow takes 3 arguments: X, n, mod.
X is a matrix, n is the power of the matrix and mod is the modulus.
The function matpow returns the matrix raised to the power n.
The function matpow is called with the following arguments:
X = np.matrix([[10**d,0,0],[1,1,0],[0,1,1]])
n = right-left+1
mod = M

The function matpow returns the matrix raised to the power n.
The matrix is raised to the power n, which is 10007-3+1 = 10004.
The matrix is then multiplied by the vector [a, A+B*left, B]%M.
The vector is multiplied by the matrix, which results in the following vector:
[10004*a, 10004*(A+B*left), 10004*B]%M
The vector is then multiplied by the vector [a, A+B*left, B]%M.
The vector is multiplied by the matrix, which results in the following vector:
[10004*a, 10004*(A+B*left), 10004*B]%M
