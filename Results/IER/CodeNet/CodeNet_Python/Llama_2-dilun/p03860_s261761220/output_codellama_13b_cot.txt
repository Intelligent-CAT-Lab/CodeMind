The input is ```AtCoder Beginner Contest```
The code splits the input into a list of strings.
The code then iterates over the list of strings and extracts the first character of each string.
The code then joins the list of extracted characters into a single string.
The output is ```AtCoder```

Consider the following code:
<Code>
s=input().split()
s=[s[i][0] for i in range(len(s))]
print("".join(s))
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```AtCoder Beginner Contest
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
