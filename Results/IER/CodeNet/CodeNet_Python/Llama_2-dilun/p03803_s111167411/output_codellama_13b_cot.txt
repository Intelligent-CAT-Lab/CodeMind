The variable A and variable B are initialized to 8 and 6, respectively.
The code checks if A is 1. If it is, it sets A to 14.
The code checks if B is 1. If it is, it sets B to 14.
The code checks if A is greater than B. If it is, it prints "Alice".
The code checks if B is greater than A. If it is, it prints "Bob".
The code checks if A is equal to B. If it is, it prints "Draw".
<<<Output>>>
Alice

Consider the following code:
<Code>
A,B = map(int,input().split())

if A == 1:
    A = 14

if B == 1:
    B = 14
    
if A>B:
    print('Alice')
elif B>A:
    print('Bob')
else:
    print('Draw')
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```8 6
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
