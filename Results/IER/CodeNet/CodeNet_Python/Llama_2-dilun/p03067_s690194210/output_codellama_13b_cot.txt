The variable a, b and c are initialized to 3, 8 and 5, respectively.
The code checks if a is less than c and c is less than b or a is greater than c and c is greater than b.
In this case, a is less than c and c is less than b, so the code prints 'Yes'.
<<<Output>>>
Yes

Consider the following code:
<Code>
a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
if a<c<b or a>c>b:
    print('Yes')
else:
    print('No')
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 8 5
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
