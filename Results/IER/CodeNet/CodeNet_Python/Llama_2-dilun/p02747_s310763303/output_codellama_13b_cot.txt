The variable s is initialized to the input string "hihi".
The code checks if s is equal to any of the following strings:
"hi"
"hihi"
"hihihi"
"hihihihi"
"hihihihihi"
If it is, it prints "Yes".
If it is not, it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
Yes

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
s = input()

if s == 'hi' or s == 'hihi' or s == 'hihihi' or s == 'hihihihi' or s == 'hihihihihi':
  print('Yes')
else:
  print('No')

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```hihi
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
