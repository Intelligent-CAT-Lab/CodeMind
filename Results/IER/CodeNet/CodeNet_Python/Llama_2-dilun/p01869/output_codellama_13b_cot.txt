The code first initializes a list a to an empty list.
Then it calls the function f, which takes a list a and two integers bin and n as input.
The function f first checks if bin is greater than n. If it is, it returns.
Otherwise, it adds bin to the list a.
Then it calls the function f recursively with a, bin*10+2 and n as input.
It also calls the function f recursively with a, bin*10+8 and n as input.

The function g takes two integers n and p as input.
It first initializes a variable m to -1<<20.
It then uses the function bisect.bisect_left to find the index x of the first occurrence of n in the list a.
If x is not equal to the length of a and a[x] is equal to n, then m is set to 1.
If a[p]**2 is greater than n, then m is set to the maximum of g(n//a[p],p)+1 and -1.
Otherwise, m is set to the maximum of g(n,p+1) and -1.

The function g is then called with n and 0 as input.
The function f is called with a, 0 and n as input.
The list a is then sorted.
The function g is called with n and 0 as input.
If the output of g is less than 0, then -1 is printed.
Otherwise, the output of g is printed.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import bisect
import sys
sys.setrecursionlimit(10000)
a=[]
def f(a,bin,n):
    if bin>n:return
    if bin:a+=[bin]
    f(a,bin*10+2,n)
    f(a,bin*10+8,n)

def g(n,p):
    m=-1<<20
    x=bisect.bisect_left(a,n)
    if x!=len(a) and a[x]==n:m=1
    if a[p]**2>n:return m
    if n%a[p]==0:m=g(n//a[p],p)+1
    return max(m,g(n,p+1))

n=int(input())
if n&1:print(-1);exit()
f(a,0,n)
a=sorted(a)
b=g(n,0)
if b<0:b=-1
print(b)

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
