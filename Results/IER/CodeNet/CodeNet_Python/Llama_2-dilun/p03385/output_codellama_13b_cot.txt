The variable S is initialized to the string "bac".
The code checks if the string contains the letters "a", "b" and "c".
Since it does, the code prints "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
S=input()
if 'a' in S and 'b' in S and 'c' in S:
    print('Yes')
else:
    print('No')
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```bac
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
