The variable n and variable k are initialized to 3 and 2, respectively.
The code checks if k is odd, which is true in this case.
It then calculates the value of ans, which is (3//2)**3 + ((3+2//2)//2)**3.
The value of ans is 16.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import sys
from fractions import gcd


def main():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())

    ans = 0

    if k % 2 == 1:
        ans = (n // k)**3
    else:
        ans = (n // k)**3 + ((n + k // 2) // k)**3
    
    print(ans)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
