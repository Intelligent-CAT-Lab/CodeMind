The variable n and variable k are initialized to 2 and 3, respectively.
The code then prints the output, which is 1.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
#!/usr/bin/env python

import sys
import math
import itertools as it
from collections import deque

sys.setrecursionlimit(10000000)

MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7

n, k = map(int, raw_input().split())

print k ** n % MOD

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
