The code starts with an empty deque que.
It then appends the first pair (1, 1) to the deque.
The code then initializes a dictionary dp to store the results of the computation.
The dictionary is initialized with the value 1 for the key 1.
The code then iterates through the deque.
For each pair (x, c) in the deque, it calculates the value of y = (x + 1) % k.
If y is not in the dictionary or the value of dp[y] is less than c + 1, it updates the value of dp[y] to c + 1.
It then adds the pair (y, c + 1) to the front of the deque.
The code then calculates the value of z = (10 * x) % k.
If z is not in the dictionary or the value of dp[z] is less than c, it updates the value of dp[z] to c.
It then adds the pair (z, c) to the deque.
The code then returns the value of dp[0].

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def solve(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return solve(n-1) + solve(n-2)

n = int(input())
print(solve(n))
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The code starts with the value of n = 10.
It then checks if n is equal to 1.
If it is, it returns 1.
Otherwise, it returns the sum of solve(n-1) and solve(n-2).
The code then iterates through the range [10, 1].
For each value of n in this range, it returns the sum of solve(n-1) and solve(n-2).
The code then returns the value of solve(1).
