The variable n is initialized to 1.
The code checks if n is equal to 1. If it is, it prints "Hello World" and exits the program.
The code then initializes the variables a and b to the input values.
The code prints the sum of a and b.
<<<Output>>>
Hello World
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

[INST]
    Consider the following code:
<Code>
n = int(input())
if n==1:
    print('Hello World')
    exit()
a = int(input())
b = int(input())
print(a+b)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
