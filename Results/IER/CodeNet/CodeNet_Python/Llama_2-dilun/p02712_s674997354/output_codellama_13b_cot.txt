The variable N is initialized to 15.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 15.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is divisible by 3 and 5. If it is, it adds i to sum.
The condition is met when i is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum, which is 105.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())
sum=0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    if (i%3!=0)&(i%5!=0):
        sum = sum + i
print(sum)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```15
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
