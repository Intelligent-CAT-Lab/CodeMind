The variable n and m are initialized to 3 and 14, respectively.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to m (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 14.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i*i is greater than m+10. If it is, the loop breaks.
If m is divisible by i, the code checks if m//i is greater than or equal to n. If it is, it sets ans to the maximum of ans and i.
If i is greater than or equal to n, the code sets ans to the maximum of ans and m//i.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 10.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import sys
input = lambda : sys.stdin.readline().rstrip()
sys.setrecursionlimit(max(1000, 10**9))
write = lambda x: sys.stdout.write(x+"\n")


n,m = list(map(int, input().split()))
ans = -1
for i in range(1,m+1):
    if i*i>m+10:
        break
    if m%i==0:
        if m//i>=n:
            ans = max(ans, i)
        if i>=n:
            ans = max(ans, m//i)
print(ans)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 14
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
