The code takes the input as a string s.
The code then initializes t to 0 and d to a dictionary.
The code then iterates over the ordinal values of each character in s.
For each character, it calculates the bitwise exclusive-or of t and 1 << i, where i is the ordinal value of the character.
The code then checks if t is in d, which is false.
The code then sets d[t] to the minimum of d[t] and 1000000, which is 1000000.
The code then iterates over all values of j in range(26), which is 0 to 25.
For each value of j, the code calculates the bitwise exclusive-or of t^(1<<j) and t, which is t^(1<<j).
The code then checks if t^(1<<j) is in d, which is true.
The code then sets d[t^(1<<j)] to the minimum of d[t^(1<<j)] and 1000000+1, which is 1000001.
The code then prints the value of d[t] if d[t] is not None, which is 1000000.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
#!/usr/bin/env python3
s = input()
t = 0
d = {t:0}
for i in (ord(x)-ord('a') for x in s) :
	t ^= 1 << i
	d[t] = min(d[t] if t in d else 1000000, min((d[t^(1<<j)] for j in range(26) if t^(1<<j) in d))+1)
print(d[t] if d[t] else 1)

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```aabxyyzz
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
