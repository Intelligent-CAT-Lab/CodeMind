The variable a and variable b are initialized to 54 and 20, respectively.
The function gcd(a,b) is called, which calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a and b.
The GCD of 54 and 20 is 2, which is printed as the output.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
a, b = map(int, input().split())

def gcd(a,b):
    if b>a:
        a, b = b, a
    
    while b>0:
        mod = a%b
        a = b
        b = mod
    
    return a

print(gcd(a,b))

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```54 20
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
