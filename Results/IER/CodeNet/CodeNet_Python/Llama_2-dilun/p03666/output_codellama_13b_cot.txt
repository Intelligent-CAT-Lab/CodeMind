The variable N, variable A, variable B, variable C and variable D are initialized to 5, 1, 5, 2 and 4, respectively.
The function inpl() is called to get the input.
The input is split into a list of integers.
The variables N, A, B, C and D are assigned to the list elements.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 5.
For each number k in this range, the code calculates the difference between D*k and C*j, where j is N-1-k.
If the difference is within the range [B-A, C*k - D*j], the code prints "YES" and breaks out of the loop.
If the difference is not within the range, the code prints "NO" and continues to the next number k.
After the loop finishes, the code prints "NO" since the difference is not within the range for any number k.
<<<Output>>>
NO

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def inpl(): return [int(i) for i in input().split()]
N, A, B, C, D = inpl()
for k in range(N+1):
    j = N-1-k
    if D*k - C*j >= B-A >= C*k - D*j:
        print('YES')
        break
else:
    print('NO')
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 1 5 2 4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
