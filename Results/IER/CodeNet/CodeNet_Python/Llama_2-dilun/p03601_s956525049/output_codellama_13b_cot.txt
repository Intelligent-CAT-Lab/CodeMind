The variable A, B, C, D, E, F are initialized to 1, 2, 10, 20, 15, 200, respectively.
The code then initializes the array wdp to [0] * (F + 1), which is [0] * 201.
The array sdp is initialized to [0] * (F + 1), which is [0] * 201.
The variable wdp[0] is initialized to 1, and the variable sdp[0] is initialized to 1.
The variable resa is initialized to 100 * A, which is 100 * 1, and the variable resb is initialized to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to F + 1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 201.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in wdp[i].
The code then enters another loop that iterates from 1 to F + 1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 201.
For each number j in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in wdp[j].
