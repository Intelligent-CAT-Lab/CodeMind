The variable s is initialized to the string "sippuu".
The variable sList is initialized to a list containing the characters of s.
The code checks if the third and fourth characters of s are the same and if the fifth and sixth characters of s are the same.
If they are, it prints "Yes".
If they are not, it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
s = str(input())
sList = list(s)
if s[2] == s[3] and s[4] == s[5]:
	print("Yes")
else:
	print("No")
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```sippuu
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
