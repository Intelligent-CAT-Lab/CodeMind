The variable a, variable b and variable x are initialized to 3, 1 and 5, respectively.
The code then calculates the difference between a and b, which is 2.
The code then calculates the maximum value of x - b, which is 4.
The code then calculates the value of n, which is 1.
The code then calculates the value of ans, which is 10.
The code then calculates the remainder of ans modulo 1000000007, which is 3.

Consider the following code:
<Code>


a,b,x = [int(i) for i in input().split()]

d = a - b
n = max(0,(x - b)) // d
ans = x + n * b
print(ans % 1000000007)


<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 1 5
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
