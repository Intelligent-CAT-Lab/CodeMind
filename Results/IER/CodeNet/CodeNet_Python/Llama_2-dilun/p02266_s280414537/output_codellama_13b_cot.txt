The code first reverses the input string.
Then it iterates over the reversed string and checks if the current character is "\\" or "/".
If it is, it calls the function partialSqu to calculate the square of the current character.
The function partialSqu takes the current character and the previous character as input and returns the square of the current character and the previous character.
The function also updates the variables h and totalSqu.

The variable h is used to keep track of the height of the current character.
The variable totalSqu is used to keep track of the total square of all the characters.

The code then iterates over the reversed string again and checks if the current character is "\\" or "/".
If it is, it calls the function partialSqu again to calculate the square of the current character and the previous character.
The function also updates the variables h and totalSqu.
