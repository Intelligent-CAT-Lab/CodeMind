The variable s is initialized to the input string "01B0".
The variable a is initialized to an empty string.
The code then iterates over the characters in s.
For each character i in s, it checks if i is "B". If it is, it checks if the string a is not empty. If it is not empty, it removes the last character from a.
Otherwise, it appends i to a.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of a, which is "01".

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
s = input()
a = ""
for i in s:
  if i == "B":
    if not(a == ""):
      a = a[:-1]
  else:
    a += i
print(a)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```01B0
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
