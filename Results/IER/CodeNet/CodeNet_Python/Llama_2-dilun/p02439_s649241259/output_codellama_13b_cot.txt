The variable num is initialized to a list containing the numbers 4, 5 and 3.
The code then prints the minimum and maximum numbers in the list.
The minimum number is 3 and the maximum number is 5.
<<<Output>>>
3 5

Consider the following code:
<Code>
num=list(map(int,input().split()))
print(str(min(num))+" "+str(max(num)))


<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4 5 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
