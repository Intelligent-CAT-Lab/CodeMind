The variables A, B, C and D are initialized to 10, 9, 10 and 10, respectively.
The code enters a while loop that iterates while A and C are both greater than 0.
The code then checks if C is less than or equal to 0. If it is, it prints "Yes" and breaks out of the loop.
The code then checks if A is less than or equal to 0. If it is, it prints "No" and breaks out of the loop.
