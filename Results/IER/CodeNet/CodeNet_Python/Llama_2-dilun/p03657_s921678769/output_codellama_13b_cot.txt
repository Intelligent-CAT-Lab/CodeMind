The variable A and variable B are initialized to 4 and 5, respectively.
The code then checks if A is divisible by 3, B is divisible by 3 or (A + B) is divisible by 3.
If any of these conditions is met, the code prints "Possible".
Otherwise, it prints "Impossible".
<<<Output>>>
Impossible

Consider the following code:
<Code>
A,B = (int(i) for i in input().split())

if A % 3 == 0 or B % 3 == 0 or (A + B) % 3 == 0:
    print('Possible')
    
else:
    print('Impossible')
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4 5
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
