The variable a, variable b and variable k are initialized to 5, 4 and 2, respectively.
The code then enters a loop that iterates k times, which is 2 times in this case.
In the first iteration, the code checks if i is even. If it is, it checks if a is odd. If it is, it subtracts 1 from a and divides it by 2. It then adds a to b.
In the second iteration, the code checks if i is odd. If it is, it checks if b is odd. If it is, it subtracts 1 from b and divides it by 2. It then adds b to a.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of a and b, which is 1 and 3.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
a, b, k= map(int, input().split())

for i in range(k):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        if a % 2 == 1:
            a -= 1
        a //= 2
        b += a
    else:
        if b % 2 == 1:
            b -= 1
        b //= 2
        a += b

print(a, b)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 4 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
