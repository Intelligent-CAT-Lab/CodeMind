The variable i is initialized to 11.
The variable n is initialized to the value of i, which is 11.
The variable len is initialized to the length of i, which is 2.

The code checks if len is equal to 1. If it is, it prints the value of n, which is 11.
The code checks if len is equal to 2. If it is, it prints 9.
The code checks if len is equal to 3. If it is, it prints the value of n minus 90, which is 11 - 90 = 21.
The code checks if len is equal to 4. If it is, it prints 909.
The code checks if len is equal to 5. If it is, it prints the value of n minus 90 minus 9000, which is 11 - 90 - 9000 = -8889.
The code checks if len is equal to 6. If it is, it prints 90909.

The output of the code is:
11
9
21
909
-8889
90909

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
i = input()
n = int(i)
len = len(i)

if len == 1:
  print(n)
elif len == 2:
  print(9)
elif len == 3:
  print(n - 90) # 2桁の数は90こ
elif len == 4:
  print(909) # 999 - 90
elif len == 5:
  print(n - 90 - 9000) # 4桁の数は (9999 - 999)
elif len == 6:
  print(90909)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```11
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
