The variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized to 5, 5 and 7, respectively.
The code then checks if the list of numbers (a, b, c) is sorted and if the sorted list is equal to [5, 5, 7].
If the condition is met, the code prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".
<<<Output>>>
YES

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b,c=map(int, input().split())
if sorted(list((a,b,c)))==[5,5,7]:
  print("YES")
else:
  print("NO")
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 5 7
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
