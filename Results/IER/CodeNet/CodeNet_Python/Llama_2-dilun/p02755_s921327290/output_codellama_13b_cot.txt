The variable a and variable b are initialized to 2 and 2, respectively.
The variable ans is initialized to -1, which will be used to store the final answer.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1001 to 1, meaning it will consider numbers from 1001 to 1.
For each number tax in this range, it checks if the product of tax and 0.08 is equal to a and the product of tax and 0.1 is equal to b. If it is, it stores the value of tax in ans and breaks out of the loop.
The condition is met when tax is 1250.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 1250.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
a, b = map(int, input().split())
ans = -1
for tax in range(1001):
    if int(tax * 0.08) == a and int(tax * 0.1) == b:
        ans = tax
        break
print(ans)

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
