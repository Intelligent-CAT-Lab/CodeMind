The code first initializes the variables n0, n1 and n2 to 0, 15 and 14, respectively.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 15 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 15.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```0??
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
