The variables w, h and c are initialized to 10, 20 and 5, respectively.
The code calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of w and h, which is 5 in this case.
It then calculates the square of the gcd, which is 25.
It multiplies the width and height of the rectangle by the square of the gcd, which is 25.
It multiplies the result by c, which is 5 in this case.
The final result is 1250.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import math
w,h,c=map(int,input().split())
print(int(w*h/math.gcd(w,h)**2*c))

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10 20 5
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
