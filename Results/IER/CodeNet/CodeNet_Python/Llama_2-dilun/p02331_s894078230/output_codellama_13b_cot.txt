The variable n and variable k are initialized to 2 and 3, respectively.
The variable mod is initialized to 1e9+7, which is 1000000007.
The variable ans is initialized to 1.
The code enters a while loop that iterates while n is greater than 0.
The code checks if n is odd. If it is, it multiplies ans by k and calculates the remainder of the result modulo mod.
The code then multiplies k by k and calculates the remainder of the result modulo mod.
The code then divides n by 2 and checks if it is still greater than 0. If it is, the loop continues.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 1.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
n, k = list(map(int,input().split()))

mod = int(1e9+7)
ans = 1
while (n > 0):
    if (n % 2 == 1):
        ans = (ans * k) % mod
    k = (k * k) % mod
    n = n // 2
print(ans)

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
