The variable n and variable i are initialized to 4 and 2, respectively.
The code then prints the value of n+1-i, which is 3.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
n,i=map(int,input().split())
print(n+1-i)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
