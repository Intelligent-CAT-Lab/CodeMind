The variable a and variable b are initialized to 20 and 30, respectively.
The code checks if a is less than b. If it is, it prints the difference between a and b.
If a is not less than b, it prints the difference between b and a.
<<<Output>>>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b= map(int, input().split())
if a < b:
    print(b-a)
else:
    print(a-b)

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20 30
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
