The variable n is initialized to 432.
The code then creates a dictionary with keys as the numbers that are multiples of 1.08 and values as the corresponding numbers.
The code then checks if n is a multiple of 1.08. If it is, it prints the corresponding number. If it is not, it prints ":(".

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
n=int(input())

dic={}
for i in range(1,50001):
    p=int(i*1.08)
    dic[p]=i
if n in dic:
    print(dic[n])
else:
    print(":(")
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```432
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
