The variable x and variable y are initialized to 3 and 8, respectively.
The variable count is initialized to 0.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to x+1, meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 4.
For each number a in this range, it calculates the value of b = x - a.
It then checks if (2*a + 4*b) is equal to y. If it is, it sets count to 1 and breaks out of the loop.
After the loop finishes, the code prints "Yes" if count is 1, otherwise it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No

Consider the following code:
<Code>
x, y = map(int, input().split())
count = 0
for a in range(x+1):
    b = x - a
    if (2*a + 4*b) == y:
        count = 1
        break
    else:
        pass
print("Yes" if count == 1 else "No")
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 8
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
