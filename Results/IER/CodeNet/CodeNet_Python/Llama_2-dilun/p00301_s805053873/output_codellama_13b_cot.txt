The variable n is initialized to 25.
The code then enters a loop that iterates while n is not 0.
The code checks if n is divisible by 3. If it is, it adds "0" to the list l.
If n is not divisible by 3, it checks if n is divisible by 3 minus 1. If it is, it adds "+" to the list l.
If n is not divisible by 3 minus 1, it checks if n is divisible by 3 plus 1. If it is, it adds "-" to the list l.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of l, which is "0+-".
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>

n=int(input())
l=[]
while n:
    if n%3==0:l=["0"]+l;n//=3
    elif n%3==1:l=["+"]+l;n=(n-1)//3
    else:l=["-"]+l;n=(n+1)//3
print("".join(l))

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```25
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
