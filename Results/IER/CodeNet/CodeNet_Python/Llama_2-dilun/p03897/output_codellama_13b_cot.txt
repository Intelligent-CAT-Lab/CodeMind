The variable n is initialized to 2.
The code then creates an empty list ans.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 1.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is odd. If it is, it adds the pair (i, 0) to ans.
The code then enters another loop that iterates from 0 to n-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 1.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is odd. If it is, it adds the pair (i, j) to ans, where j is the number of the current iteration.

The code then prints the length of ans, which is 1.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
n=int(input())
ans=[]
for i in range(n-1):
  if i%2:
    ans+=[(i,0)]
for i in range(n-1):
  if i%6==1:
    for j in range(2,n):
      if j%2==0:
        ans+=[(i,j)]
  if i%6==4:
    for j in range(n):
      if j%2:
        ans+=[(i,j)]
for j in range(n):
  if(n-1+j)%2:
    ans+=[(n-1,j)]
print(len(ans))
for x,y in ans:
  print(x,y)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
