The variable X and variable Y are initialized to 81 and 58, respectively.
The code then prints the value of X+Y/2, which is 81+58/2 = 70.
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
X, Y = map(int, input().split())
print(int(X+Y/2))
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```81 58
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
