The variable num is initialized to 67.
The code checks if 65 <= num <= 90, which is true.
The code prints 1.
<<<Output>>>

[INST]
Consider the following code:
<Code>
num=int(input())
if 65<=num<=90:
    print(1)
elif 97<=num<=122:
    print(2)
else:
    print(0)

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```67
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
