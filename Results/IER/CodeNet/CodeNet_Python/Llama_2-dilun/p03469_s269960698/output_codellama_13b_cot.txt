The variable S is initialized to the input string "2017/01/07".
The code then prints the first 3 characters of S followed by "8" and the last 4 characters of S.
The output is "2017/01/08".

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
S = input()
print(S[:3]+"8"+S[4:])
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2017/01/07
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
