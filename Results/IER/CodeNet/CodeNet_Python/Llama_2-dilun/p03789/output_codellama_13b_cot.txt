The input is 80.
The code converts the input to a list, which is [8].
The code then reverses the list, which is [8].
The code then initializes lb and ub to 0 and the length of the list, respectively.
The code then defines a function check, which takes an integer x as input and returns whether x is positive.
The function check calculates x-x-g+int(i) and checks if x is positive.
If x is positive, it returns True.
If x is negative, it returns False.
The code then initializes x to 9*mid, where mid is the midpoint of the range [lb, ub].
The code then checks if x is positive.
If x is positive, it sets ub to mid.
If x is negative, it sets lb to mid.
The code then prints the final value of ub, which is 40.
<<<Output>>>
40

Consider the following code:
<Code>
n=list(input())
n.reverse()
lb,ub=0,len(n)
def check(x):
	g=0
	for i in n:
		x-=(x+g-int(i))%10
		if x<0:
			break
		g=(x+g)//10
	return x>=0
while ub-lb>1:
	mid=(lb+ub)//2
	if check(9*mid):
		ub=mid
	else:
		lb=mid
print(ub)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```80
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
