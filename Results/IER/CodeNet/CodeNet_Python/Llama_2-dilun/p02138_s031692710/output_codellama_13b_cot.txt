The code starts with the initialization of variables A, B, C and D.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 1000000000 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 1000000000.
For each number turn in this range, it calculates the sum of A and C, and the sum of B and D.
If the sum of A and C is less than or equal to 0 or the sum of B and D is less than or equal to 0, the code returns the value of turn.
If the condition is not met, the code checks if hoge is 0 or 1.
If hoge is 0, the code checks if turn is even or odd.
If turn is even, the code checks if A + C is less than or equal to 0 or B + D is less than or equal to 0.
If A + C is less than or equal to 0 or B + D is less than or equal to 0, the code returns the value of turn.
If the condition is not met, the code checks if A + C is less than or equal to B + D.
If A + C is less than or equal to B + D, the code subtracts B from A and C, and subtracts D from B and D.
If the condition is not met, the code checks if A + C is greater than or equal to B + D.
If A + C is greater than or equal to B + D, the code subtracts A from B and D, and subtracts C from A and C.
If the condition is not met, the code checks if A + C is greater than B + D.
If A + C is greater than B + D, the code subtracts A from B and D, and subtracts C from A and C.
If the condition is not met, the code checks if A + C is less than B + D.
If A + C is less than B + D, the code subtracts A from B and D, and subtracts C from A and C.
If the condition is not met, the code checks if A + C is less than or equal to B + D.
If A + C is less than or equal to B + D, the code subtracts A from B and D, and subtracts C from A and C.
If the condition is not met, the code checks if A + C is greater than or equal to B + D.
If A + C is greater than or equal to B + D, the code subtracts A from B and D, and subtracts C from A and C.
If the condition is not met, the code checks if A + C is greater than B + D.
If A + C is greater than B + D, the code subtracts A from B and D, and subtracts C from A and C.
If the condition is not met, the code checks if A + C is less than B + D.
If A + C is less than B + D, the code subtracts A from B and D, and subtracts C from A and C.
If the condition is not met, the code checks if A + C is less than or equal to B + D.
If A + C is less than or equal to B + D, the code subtracts A from B and D, and subtracts C from A and C.
