The variable x is initialized to 7.
The variable ans is initialized to 0.
The code checks if x - 11*ans > 6.
If it is, it prints 2*ans+2.
If it is not, it checks if x - 11*ans == 0.
If it is, it prints 2*ans.
If it is not, it prints 2*ans+1.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
#C
x = int(input())
ans = x//11

if x - 11*ans > 6:
    print(2*ans+2)
elif x - 11*ans == 0:
    print(2*ans)
else:
    print(2*ans+1)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
