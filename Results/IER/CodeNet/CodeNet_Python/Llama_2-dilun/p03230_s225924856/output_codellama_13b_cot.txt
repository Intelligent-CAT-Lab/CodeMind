The code first takes the input N and initializes the variable K to -1.
It then iterates from 1 to N (inclusive) and checks if the number k * (k - 1) // 2 is equal to N.
If it is, it sets K to k and breaks the loop.
If it is not, it sets K to -1 and continues the loop.

After the loop finishes, the code prints Yes, K and a list of numbers.
The list of numbers is a list of pairs of numbers, where each pair of numbers is a pair of numbers that are consecutive in the sequence of numbers from 1 to K.

The code then prints the length of each pair of numbers and the numbers in the pair.

The output is:
```Yes
3
[1, 1]
[1, 1]
[1, 1]
```

<<<Output>>>
Yes
3
[1, 1]
[1, 1]
[1, 1]
