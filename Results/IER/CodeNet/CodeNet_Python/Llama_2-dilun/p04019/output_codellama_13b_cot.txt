The code first converts the input string to a list of characters.
Then it converts the list to a set of unique characters.
The code then checks if the length of the set is 4. If it is, it prints "Yes".
If the length is 3, it prints "No".
If the length is 2, it checks if the set contains "N" and "S". If it does, it prints "Yes".
If the set contains "E" and "W", it prints "Yes".
Otherwise, it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No

Consider the following code:
<Code>

def main():
    s = list(input())
    s = list(set(s))
    
    if len(s)==4:
        print("Yes")
    elif len(s)==3:
        print("No")
    elif len(s)==2:
        if "N"in s and "S" in s:
            print("Yes")
        elif "E" in s and "W" in s:
            print("Yes")
        else:
            print("No")
    else:
        print("No")
if __name__=='__main__':
    main()
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```SENW
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
