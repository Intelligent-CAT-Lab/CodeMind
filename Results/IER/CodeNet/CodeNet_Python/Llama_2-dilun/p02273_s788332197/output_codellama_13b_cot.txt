The code first reads the input n, which is 1 in this case.
The code then calls the function koch with the input parameters p1, p2 and n.
The function koch takes the input parameters p1 and p2, which are the coordinates of the first and second points, respectively.
It also takes the input parameter n, which is the number of points to generate.
The function koch then returns a list of points, where each point is a tuple of two coordinates.
The function koch first generates the first point, which is the origin (0, 0).
It then generates the second point, which is the first point plus a vector with a length of 1.
The function koch then generates the third point, which is the second point plus a vector with a length of 1.
The function koch then generates the fourth point, which is the third point plus a vector with a length of 1.
The function koch then generates the fifth point, which is the fourth point plus a vector with a length of 1.
The function koch then generates the sixth point, which is the fifth point plus a vector with a length of 1.
The function koch then generates the seventh point, which is the sixth point plus a vector with a length of 1.
The function koch then generates the eighth point, which is the seventh point plus a vector with a length of 1.
The function koch then generates the ninth point, which is the eighth point plus a vector with a length of 1.
The function koch then generates the tenth point, which is the ninth point plus a vector with a length of 1.
The function koch then generates the eleventh point, which is the tenth point plus a vector with a length of 1.
The function koch then generates the twelfth point, which is the eleventh point plus a vector with a length of 1.
The function koch then generates the thirteenth point, which is the twelfth point plus a vector with a length of 1.
The function koch then generates the fourteenth point, which is the thirteenth point plus a vector with a length of 1.
The function koch then generates the fifteenth point, which is the fourteenth point plus a vector with a length of 1.
The function koch then generates the sixteenth point, which is the fifteenth point plus a vector with a length of 1.
The function koch then generates the seventeenth point, which is the sixteenth point plus a vector with a length of 1.
The function koch then generates the eighteenth point, which is the seventeenth point plus a vector with a length of 1.
The function koch then generates the nineteenth point, which is the eighteenth point plus a vector with a length of 1.
The function koch then generates the twentieth point, which is the nineteenth point plus a vector with a length of 1.

The function koch then generates the twenty-second point, which is the twenty-first point plus a vector with a length of 1.
The function koch then generates the twenty-third point, which is the twenty-second point plus a vector with a length of 1.
The function koch then generates the twenty-fourth point, which is the twenty-third point plus a vector with a length of 1.
The function koch then generates the twenty-fifth point, which is the twenty-fourth point plus a vector with a length of 1.
