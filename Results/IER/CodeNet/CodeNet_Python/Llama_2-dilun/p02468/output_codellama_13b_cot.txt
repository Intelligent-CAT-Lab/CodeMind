The variable m and variable n are initialized to 2 and 3, respectively.
The variable mod is initialized to 10^9 + 7, which is 1000000007.
The code calculates the value of pow(m,n,mod), which is 2^3 mod 1000000007.
The value of 2^3 mod 1000000007 is 2^3 = 8, which is 1000000000 mod 1000000007 = 1000000000 - 1000000000 = 0.
Therefore, the output is 0.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
m,n = map(int, input().split())
mod = 10**9+7
print(pow(m,n,mod))

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
