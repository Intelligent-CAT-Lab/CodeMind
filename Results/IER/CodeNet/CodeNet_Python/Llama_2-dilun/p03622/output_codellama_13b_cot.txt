The variable M is initialized to 8**7, which is 2187.
The variables m, f, g, i are initialized to M*476+1, [j:=1], [k:=1]*M, 1, respectively.
The variable j is initialized to 1, and the variable k is initialized to 1.
The variable f is initialized to the list [j:=1], and the variable g is initialized to the list [k:=1]*M.
The variable i is initialized to 1.
The variable f is updated by adding the value of f[-1] (the last element of the list f) to itself multiplied by i%m (the remainder of i divided by m).
The variable g is updated by adding the value of pow(M*f[-1], m-2, m) (the value of M multiplied by the last element of the list f, raised to the power of m-2, and then divided by m) to itself.
The variables A and B are initialized to the values of the input, which are 1 and 1, respectively.
If A is less than B, A and B are swapped.
The variable j is initialized to 1, and the variable k is initialized to 1.
The variable i is updated by adding the value of k*f[A+B-j]*g[B-j] (the value of k multiplied by the product of f[A+B-j] (the value of f at the index A+B-j) and g[B-j] (the value of g at the index B-j)) to itself.
The variable k is updated by multiplying it by 2%m (the value of k multiplied by 2, and then divided by m).
The variable j is updated by adding 1 to it.
The variable i is updated by adding the value of f[A+B-j]*g[B-j] (the value of f at the index A+B-j multiplied by the value of g at the index B-j) to itself.
The variable k is updated by multiplying it by 2%m (the value of k multiplied by 2, and then divided by m).
The variable j is updated by adding 1 to it.
The variable i is updated by adding the value of f[A+B-j]*g[B-j] (the value of f at the index A+B-j multiplied by the value of g at the index B-j) to itself.
The variable k is updated by multiplying it by 2%m (the value of k multiplied by 2, and then divided by m).
