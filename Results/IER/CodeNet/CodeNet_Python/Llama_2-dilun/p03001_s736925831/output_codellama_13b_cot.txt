The variable w, h, x and y are initialized to 2, 3, 1 and 2, respectively.
The code then calculates the area of the rectangle, which is 2 * 3 / 2 = 3.
The code then checks if the x and y coordinates are the center of the rectangle.
If they are, it prints 3 1, which means the answer is 3.
If they are not, it prints 3 0, which means the answer is 0.
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import sys
read = sys.stdin.buffer.read
readline = sys.stdin.buffer.readline
readlines = sys.stdin.buffer.readlines

w, h, x, y = map(int, readline().split())

ans = w * h / 2
if x == w / 2 and y == h / 2:
    print(ans, '1')
else:
    print(ans, '0')
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 3 1 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
