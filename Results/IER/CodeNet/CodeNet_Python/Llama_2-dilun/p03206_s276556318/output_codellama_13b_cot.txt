The variable D is initialized to 25.
The code checks if D is equal to 25. If it is, it prints "Christmas".
The code checks if D is equal to 24. If it is, it prints "Christmas Eve".
The code checks if D is equal to 23. If it is, it prints "Christmas Eve Eve".
The code checks if D is not equal to 25, 24 or 23. If it is, it prints "Christmas Eve Eve Eve".
<<<Output>>>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())

for i in range(1,N+1):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        print("Even")
    else:
        print("Odd")
</Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

The variable N is initialized to 10.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 10.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is even or odd. If it is even, it prints "Even". If it is odd, it prints "Odd".
The code prints "Even" 5 times and "Odd" 5 times.
<<<Output>>>
Even
