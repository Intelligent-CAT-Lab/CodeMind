The variable n is initialized to 100.
The variable ans is initialized to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates through the list (25, 10, 5, 1).
For each element in the list, it calculates the quotient of n and the element, and stores the result in ans.
It then calculates the remainder of n and the element, and stores the result in n.
The loop finishes when n is 0.
The code then prints the final value of ans, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
n = int(input())
ans = 0
for x in (25, 10, 5, 1):
  ans += n // x
  n %= x
print(ans)

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```100
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
