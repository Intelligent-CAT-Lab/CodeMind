<<<Analysis>>>
The variable s and variable K are initialized to "0101 1" and 1, respectively.
The code checks if K is 0, which is not the case.
The variable a is initialized to an empty list.
The variable cnt is initialized to 0.
The code iterates over the string s and counts the number of 0s in it.
The variable a is then initialized to a list containing the number of 0s in each substring of s.
The variable n is initialized to the length of a.
The variables dp, col and dia are initialized to 2D arrays of lists.
The variable dp[0][0][0] is initialized to 1.
The variable col[0][0] is initialized to 1.
The variable dia[0][0] is initialized to 1.
The code iterates over the 2D array dp and calculates the value of dp[i][j][k] for each i, j and k.
The variable ans is initialized to 0.
The code iterates over the 2D array dp and calculates the value of dp[n][j][0] for each j.
The variable ans is then calculated as the sum of dp[n][j][0] for each j.
