The variable n, variable a and variable b are initialized to 8, 3 and 4, respectively.
The code calculates the quotient of n by a+b, which is 2.
The code calculates the remainder of n by a+b, which is 4.
The code prints the product of 2*3, which is 6, and the minimum of 4 and 3, which is 4.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
n,a,b = map(int,input().split())

k = n//(a+b)
p = n%(a+b)

print(k*a + min(p,a))

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```8 3 4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
