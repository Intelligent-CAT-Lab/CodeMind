The variable a and variable b are initialized to 2 and 5, respectively.
The code then prints the value of a*b, which is 10.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>

a,b = map(int,input().split())

#print(a+b)
print(a*b)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 5
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
