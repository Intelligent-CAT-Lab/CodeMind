The input is 1 + 2.
The code splits the input into three parts: A, s and B.
A is assigned to 1, s is assigned to '+', and B is assigned to 2.
The code then checks if s is equal to '+'. If it is, it prints the sum of A and B, which is 3.
The code then checks if s is equal to '-'. If it is, it prints the difference of A and B, which is -1.
<<<Output>>>
3
-1

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
A,B = input().split()
A = int(A)
B = int(B)
if A > B:
    print(A-B)
elif A < B:
    print(B-A)

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The input is 1 2.
The code splits the input into two parts: A and B.
A is assigned to 1, and B is assigned to 2.
The code then checks if A is greater than B. If it is, it prints the difference of A and B, which is 1.
The code then checks if A is less than B. If it is, it prints the difference of B and A, which is -1.
