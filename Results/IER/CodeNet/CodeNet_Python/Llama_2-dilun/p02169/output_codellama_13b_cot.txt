The code first reads the input and stores it in variables m, n and k.
The code then checks if n is less than k. If it is, it prints 0 and returns.
The code then checks if m is less than k. If it is, it prints 0 and returns.
The code then calculates the value of ans, which is the answer to the problem.
The code then calculates the values of p, which are the powers of i from 1 to k.
The code then calculates the values of comb, which are the combinations of i from 1 to k.
The code then calculates the value of c, which is the current value of m.
The code then calculates the value of k, which is the sum of the combinations of i from 1 to k.
The code then calculates the value of ans, which is the difference between the sum of the combinations of i from 1 to k and the value of k.
The code then prints the value of ans and returns.

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 10 1
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
