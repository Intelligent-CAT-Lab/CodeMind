The variable x and variable y are initialized to 3 and 2, respectively.
The variable N is initialized to 3, which is the value of x.
The variable K is initialized to 2, which is the value of y.
The code checks if K is 1. If it is, it prints 0. Otherwise, it prints N-K, which is 3-2, which is 1.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
x,y = input().split()
N = int(x)
K = int(y)
if K == 1:
  print(0)
else:
  print(N-K)

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
