The variable n is initialized to 1905.
The variable a is initialized to 190501, which is the sum of the first two digits of n.
The variable b is initialized to 190512, which is the sum of the last two digits of n.
The code checks if b is 0 or greater than 12. If it is, it checks if a is between 1 and 12. If it is, it prints "MMYY". Otherwise, it prints "NA".
If b is not 0 and not greater than 12, the code checks if a is between 1 and 12. If it is, it prints "AMBIGUOUS". Otherwise, it prints "YYMM".

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
n = input()

a = int(n[0]+n[1])
b = int(n[2]+n[3])
if b == 0 or b > 12:
	if 1 <= a <= 12:
		print("MMYY")
	else:
		print("NA")
elif 1 <= a <= 12:
	print("AMBIGUOUS")
else:
	print("YYMM")

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1905
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
