The variable A, variable B and variable C are initialized to 6, 4 and 3, respectively.
The code then calculates the difference between A and B, which is 2.
The code then calculates the difference between C and 2, which is 1.
The code then checks if the difference between A and B is greater than or equal to the difference between C and 2.
If it is, it prints the difference between A and B.
If it is not, it prints 0.
In this case, the difference between A and B is greater than the difference between C and 2, so the code prints 2.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
A,B,C = list(map(int,input().split()))
ans = C-(A-B)

if ans >= 0:
    print(ans)
else:
    print(0)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```6 4 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
