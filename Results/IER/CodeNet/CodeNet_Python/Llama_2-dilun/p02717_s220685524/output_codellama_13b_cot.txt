The variable a, b and c are initialized to 1, 2 and 3, respectively.
The code prints the value of c, a and b.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b,c = map(int, input().strip().split())
print(c,a,b)

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 2 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
