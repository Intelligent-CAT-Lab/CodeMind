The variable N and variable M are initialized to 3 and 14, respectively.
The function make_divisors is called to find the divisors of M.
The function make_divisors iterates through all numbers from 1 to the square root of M, and checks if M is divisible by each number. If it is, it adds the number to the list of divisors.
The function also checks if the number is not equal to the number of times M is divisible by the number. If it is, it adds the number to the list of divisors.
The function returns the list of divisors.
The variable max_gcd is initialized to 0.
The function main is called.
The variable MN is initialized to M/N.
The variable max_gcd is initialized to the largest divisor of M.
The variable max_gcd is compared to the divisor of M that is less than or equal to MN.
If the divisor is greater than or equal to max_gcd, max_gcd is set to the divisor.
The function main prints the value of max_gcd.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def make_divisors(n):
    divisors = []
    for i in range(1, int(n**0.5)+1):
        if n % i == 0:
            divisors.append(i)
            if i!= n // i:
                divisors.append(n//i)

    # divisors.sort()
    return divisors

def main():
    N, M = map(int, input().split())
    MN = M/N
    divisor = make_divisors(M)
    max_gcd = 0
    for d in divisor:
        if (d<=MN) and (d>=max_gcd):
            max_gcd = d
    print(max_gcd)
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 14
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
