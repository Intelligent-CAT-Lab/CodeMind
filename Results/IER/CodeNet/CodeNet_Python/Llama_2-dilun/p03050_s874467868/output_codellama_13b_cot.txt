The code first reads the input N, which is 8 in this case.
The code then initializes a list of pairs (r, m), where r is the remainder of N / m and m is the quotient of N / r.
The code iterates over the list of pairs and checks if the quotient m is 0. If it is, it skips the pair.
Otherwise, it checks if N % m == r. If it is, it adds m to the answer.
The code prints the final answer, which is 2.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import sys
import itertools
# import numpy as np
import time
import math
import heapq
from collections import defaultdict
from collections import Counter
sys.setrecursionlimit(10 ** 7)
 
INF = 10 ** 18
MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7
read = sys.stdin.buffer.read
readline = sys.stdin.buffer.readline
readlines = sys.stdin.buffer.readlines

# map(int, input().split())

N = int(input())
i = 1
divs = []
while i ** 2 <= N:
    if N % i == 0:
        divs.append((i, N // i))
    i += 1

ans = 0
for p in divs:
    r = p[0]
    m = p[1] - 1
    if m == 0:
        continue
    if N % m == r:
        ans += m
print(ans)

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```8
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
