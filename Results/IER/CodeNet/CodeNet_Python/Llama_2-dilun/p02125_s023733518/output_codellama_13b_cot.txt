The variable n is initialized to 2.
The code then enters a loop that iterates forever.
The code then divides n by 2.
The code then increments the variable cnt by 1.
The code then checks if n is equal to 1. If it is, the loop breaks.
The code then prints the value of cnt, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
n = int(input())
cnt = 0
n += 1

while 1:
    n //= 2
    cnt += 1
    if n == 1:
        break

print(cnt)

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
