The input is "oxxoxoo".
The code first stores the input in the variable s.
Then it prints the output based on the value of s[0].
If s[0] is 'o', it prints ['x','o']
If s[0] is not 'o', it prints ['x','x']

Consider the following code:
<Code>
s=input()
print([s[-1],'o'][s[0]=='o'])
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```oxxoxoo
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
