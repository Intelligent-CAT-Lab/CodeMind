The variable a and variable b are initialized to 2 and 2, respectively.
The variable x is initialized to a list of 10 zeros.
The code then iterates from 1 to 10, and for each number i, it sets x[i] to b*10 + i.
The code then iterates from 1 to 10, and for each number i, it checks if a is equal to the product of x[i] and 0.08. If it is, it prints x[i] and breaks the loop.
If none of the numbers in x satisfies the condition, the code prints -1.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
a, b = map(int, input().split())
x = [0]*10
for i in range(10):
    x[i] = b*10 + i
#print(x)

for i in range(10):
    if a == int(x[i]*0.08):
        print(x[i])
        break
else:
    print(-1)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
