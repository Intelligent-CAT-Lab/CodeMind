The variable n is initialized to 1199.
The code then prints "ABC" if n is less than 1200, which is true in this case.
The code then prints "ARC" if n is less than 2800, which is also true in this case.
The code then prints "AGC" if n is less than 2800, which is false in this case.
The code then prints "ABC" as the final output.
<<<Output>>>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
n=int(input())
if n%2==0:
    print("Even")
else:
    print("Odd")
</Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The variable n is initialized to 10.
The code then checks if n is even or odd.
The code checks if n is even by checking if n%2 is 0, which is true in this case.
The code then prints "Even" as the output.
