The variable S is initialized to the input string.
The first 4 characters of S are used to initialize the variable year.
The next 2 characters of S are used to initialize the variable month.
The code then checks if year is less than 2019. If it is, it prints 'Heisei'.
Otherwise, it checks if month is less than 5. If it is, it prints 'Heisei'.
Otherwise, it prints 'TBD'.
<<<Output>>>
Heisei

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
S = input()
year = int(S[:4])
month = int(S[5:7])
if year < 2019:
    print('Heisei')
elif month < 5:
    print('Heisei')
else:
    print('TBD')
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2019/04/30
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
