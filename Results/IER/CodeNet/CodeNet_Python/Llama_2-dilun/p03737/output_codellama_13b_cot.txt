    Consider the following code:
<Code>
s1,s2,s3=input().upper().split()
print(s1[0]+s2[0]+s3[0])
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```atcoder beginner contest```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
