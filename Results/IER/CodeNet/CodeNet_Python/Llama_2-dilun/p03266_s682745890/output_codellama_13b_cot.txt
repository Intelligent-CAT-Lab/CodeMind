The variable N and variable K are initialized to 3 and 2, respectively.
The variable a is initialized to the quotient of N and K, which is 1.
The variable b is initialized to the quotient of (N + int(K/2)) and K, which is 1.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then adds a to the ans variable, which is 1.
The code then checks if K is even, which is true in this case.
The code then adds b to the ans variable, which is 1.
The code then prints the final value of ans, which is 2.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
N,K=map(int,input().split())
ans=0
a=int(N/K)
ans+=a**3
if K%2==0:
 b=int((N+int(K/2))/K)
 ans+=b**3
print(ans)

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
