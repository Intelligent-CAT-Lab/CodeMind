The variable s is initialized to the input string "BBBWW".
The code then prints the sum of the differences between the characters in the string.
The code iterates over the string from the second character to the last character, and compares each character with the previous character.
If the characters are different, the sum is incremented by 1.
The output of the code is 4, which is the sum of the differences between the characters in the string.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
s = input()
print(sum(a!= b for a, b in zip(s[1:], s[:-1])))
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```BBBWW
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
