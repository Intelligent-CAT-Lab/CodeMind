The variables r, c, ar, ac, br, bc are initialized to 4, 4, 0, 0, 3, 3, respectively.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to r (inclusive), meaning it will consider rows from 1 to 4.
For each row, the code enters another loop that iterates from 1 to c (inclusive), meaning it will consider columns from 1 to 4.
For each column, the code calculates the distance between the current column and the previous column, and the distance between the current row and the previous row.
The code then calculates the gain for each row and column.
The code then calculates the product of the gain for each row and column, and the factorial of the distance between the current row and the previous row, and the distance between the current column and the previous column.
The code then calculates the quotient of the product and the factorial of the distance between the current row and the previous row, and the distance between the current column and the previous column.
The code then prints the quotient, which is 100000007.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
# Edit: 2014/09/17
# Lang: Python3
# Time: 00.04s

from math import factorial

if __name__ == "__main__":
    r, c, ar, ac, br, bc = map(int, input().strip("\n").split(" "))
    maxans = 100000007  # 100,000,007

    # tate Row
    dr = min(abs(br - ar), r - abs(br - ar))
    if 2 * dr == r:
        gainr = 2
    else:
        gainr = 1

    # yoko Column
    dc = min(abs(bc - ac), c - abs(bc - ac))
    if 2 * dc == c:
        gainc = 2
    else:
        gainc = 1

    ans = factorial(dr + dc) // factorial(dr) // factorial(dc) * gainr * gainc

    print(ans % maxans)

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4 4 0 0 3 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
