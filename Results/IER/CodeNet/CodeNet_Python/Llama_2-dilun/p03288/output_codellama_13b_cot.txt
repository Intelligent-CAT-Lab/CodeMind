The variable n is initialized to 1199.
The code checks if n is less than 1200. If it is, it prints "ABC".
The code checks if n is less than 2800. If it is, it prints "ARC".
The code checks if n is less than 3000. If it is, it prints "AGC".
The code prints "ABC".
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
n = int(input())
if(n < 1200):
    print("ABC")
elif(n < 2800):
    print("ARC")
else:
    print("AGC")
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1199
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
