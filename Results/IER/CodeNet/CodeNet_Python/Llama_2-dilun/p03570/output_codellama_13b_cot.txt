The function f takes a string as input and returns an integer.
The function first initializes a dictionary s, where the key is the binary representation of the integer and the value is the length of the string.
The function then iterates through the string and calculates the binary representation of each character.
It then calculates the XOR of the binary representation of each character and the binary representation of the previous character.
It then updates the dictionary with the minimum of the current value of the key and the minimum of the value of the key and the length of the string.
Finally, it returns the value of the key if the XOR of the binary representation of the last character is 0, otherwise it returns the value of the key.

The function f takes the string "aabxyyzz" as input and returns 1.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(str):
    s = {}
    s[0] = 0
    pat = 0

    bits = [2**i for i in range(26)]
    lenOfStr = len(str)

    for c in str:
        pat ^= bits[ord(c)-97]
        s[pat] = min(
            min(s.get(pat^bit, lenOfStr) + 1 for bit in bits),
            s.get(pat, lenOfStr))

    if pat == 0:
        return 1

    return s[pat]
            
str = input()
print(f(str))

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```aabxyyzz
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
