The function coun(n,r) calculates the sum of numbers from n to r, inclusive.
The function sigma(func,frm,too) calculates the sum of numbers from frm to too, inclusive, using the function func.
The input is 3 2, which means the sum of numbers from 2 to 3, inclusive, is calculated.
The output is 10, which is the sum of numbers from 2 to 3, inclusive.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def coun(n,r):
    return n*r+1+r-r**2

def sigma(func,frm,too):
    result=0
    for i in range(frm,too+2):
        #print(i)
        result=result+func(too,i)
        #print(result)
    print(result%mod)

n,k=list(map(int,input().split()))
mod=10**9+7

sigma(coun,k,n)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
