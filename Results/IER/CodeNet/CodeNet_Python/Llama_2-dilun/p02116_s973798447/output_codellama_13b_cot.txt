The variable n is initialized to 2.
The code then adds 1 to n, which is 3.
The code then performs the bitwise operation & on n and -~~n.
The bitwise operation & is a bitwise AND operation, which returns 1 if both operands are 1 and 0 otherwise.
The bitwise operation -~~n is a bitwise NOT operation, which returns 1 if the operand is 0 and 0 otherwise.
The bitwise NOT operation is performed on the result of the bitwise AND operation, which is 1.
The final result is 1, which is printed.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
n=int(input())+1;print(n&-~~n)

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
