The code first reads two integers p and q from the input.
It then calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of p and q, which is 1 in this case.
The code then calculates the value of t = q//gcd(p,q), which is 2 in this case.
The code then calculates the value of k = 1, which is the initial value of k.
It then checks if t % 2 == 0, which is False in this case.
It then calculates the value of k *= 2, which is 2.
It then checks if t % 2 == 0, which is True in this case.
It then calculates the value of k //= 2, which is 1.
It then checks if t % 2 == 0, which is False in this case.
It then calculates the value of k *= 2, which is 2.
It then checks if t % 2 == 0, which is True in this case.
It then calculates the value of k //= 2, which is 1.
It then checks if t % 2 == 0, which is False in this case.
It then calculates the value of k *= 2, which is 2.
It then checks if t % 2 == 0, which is True in this case.
It then calculates the value of k //= 2, which is 1.
