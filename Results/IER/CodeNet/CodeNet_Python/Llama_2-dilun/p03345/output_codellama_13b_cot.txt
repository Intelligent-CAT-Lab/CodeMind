The variable A, B, C and K are initialized to 1, 2, 3 and 1, respectively.
The code checks if K is even, which is true in this case.
The code then prints the difference between A and B, which is 1.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def main():
    A, B, C, K = map(int, input().split())
    if K&1 == 0:# 偶数
        print(A-B)
    else:
        print(B-A)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 2 3 1
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
