The variable a and variable b are initialized to 'H' and 'H', respectively.
The code checks if a is equal to 'H'. If it is, it prints b.
The code then checks if b is equal to 'H'. If it is, it prints 'D'.
Otherwise, it prints 'H'.
<<<Output>>>
H

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b=input().split()

if a=='H':
  print(b)
else:
  if b=='H':
    print('D')
  else:
    print('H')
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```H H
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
