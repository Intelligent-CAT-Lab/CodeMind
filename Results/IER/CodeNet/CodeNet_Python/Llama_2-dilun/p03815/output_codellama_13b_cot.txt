The variable x is initialized to 7.
The variable n is initialized to 0, which will be used to store the number of 11s in x.
The variable x is divided by 11, which gives n.
The variable x is then subtracted by 11*n, which gives 7-11*0 = 7.
The code checks if x is 0. If it is, it prints 2*n, which is 2*0 = 0.

The code checks if x is between 1 and 6. If it is, it prints 1+2*n, which is 1+2*0 = 1.

The code checks if x is not between 1 and 6. If it is, it prints 2+2*n, which is 2+2*0 = 2.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
x=int(input())
n=x//11
x=x-11*n
if x==0:
    print(2*n)

elif 1<=x<=6:
    print(1+2*n)
else:
    print(2+2*n)

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```7
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
