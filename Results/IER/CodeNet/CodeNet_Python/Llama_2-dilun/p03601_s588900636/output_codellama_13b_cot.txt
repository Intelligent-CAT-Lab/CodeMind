The code first checks if the hostname is N551J. If it is, it will open a file named a1.in as the input source.
The code then reads the input data and stores it in variables a, b, c, d, e and f.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 31 to 0 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 31 to 0.
For each number i in this range, it enters another loop that iterates from 31 to 0 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 31 to 0.
For each number j in this range, it enters another loop that iterates from 3001 to 0 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 3001 to 0.
For each number k in this range, it calculates the value of water, which is i * 100 * a + j * 100 * b.
It then checks if water + k * c <= f and k * c * 100 <= water * e.
If the condition is met, it calculates the value of l1, which is int((f - water - k * c) / d).
It then calculates the value of l2, which is int((water * e // 100 - k * c) / d).
It then calculates the value of l, which is min(l1, l2).
It then checks if (i, j, k, l)!= (0, 0, 0, 0).
If the condition is met, it calculates the value of sugar, which is k * c + l * d.
It then calculates the value of total, which is water + sugar.
It then calculates the value of density, which is sugar / total.
It then calculates the value of best_density, which is best_sugar / best_total.
It then calculates the value of best_sugar, which is sugar.
It then calculates the value of best_total, which is total.
It then prints the values of best_total and best_sugar.
