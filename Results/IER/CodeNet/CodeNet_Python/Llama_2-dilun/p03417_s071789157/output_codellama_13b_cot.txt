The variable n and variable m are initialized to 2 and 2, respectively.
The code checks if n and m are equal to 1. If they are, it prints 1.
If not, it checks if min(n,m) is equal to 1. If it is, it prints max(0, max(n,m) - 2).
If not, it prints (n-2) * (m-2).

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
n,m = map(int,input().split())
if n == m == 1:
    print(1)
elif min(n,m) == 1:
    print(max(0, max(n,m) - 2))
else:
    print((n-2) * (m-2))
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
