The variable n and variable y are initialized to 9 and 45000, respectively.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n+1, meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 9.
For each number i in this range, it enters a nested loop that iterates from i to n-i+1, meaning it will consider numbers from i to 9.
For each number j in this range, it checks if the difference between y and the sum of i*10000+j*5000 is divisible by 1000.
If it is, it prints the number i, number j and the number n-i-j.
The condition is met when i is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9.
After the loop finishes, the code prints '-1 -1 -1' to indicate that no number meets the condition.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
n,y=map(int,input().split())
for i in range(n+1):
    for j in range(n-i+1):
        if (y-(i*10000+j*5000))/1000==(n-i-j):
            print(str(i)+' '+str(j)+' '+str(n-i-j))
            exit()
print('-1 -1 -1')
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```9 45000
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
