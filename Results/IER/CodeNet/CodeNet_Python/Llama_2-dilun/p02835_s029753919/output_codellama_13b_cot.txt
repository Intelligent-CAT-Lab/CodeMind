<<<Analysis>>>
The variable A, B and C are initialized to 5, 7 and 9, respectively.
The code checks if A+B+C is greater than 21. Since 5+7+9 is 21, the condition is met and the code prints 'bust'.
<<<Output>>>
bust

Consider the following code:
<Code>
A,B,C = map(int,input().split())
if A+B+C > 21:
  print('bust')
else:
  print('win')

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 7 9
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
