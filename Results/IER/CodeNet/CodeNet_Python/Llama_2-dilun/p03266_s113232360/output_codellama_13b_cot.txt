The input is 3 2.
The first line of the code is to import the math module.
The second line of the code is to define a function called gcd, which calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers.
The third line of the code is to define a function called lcm, which calculates the lowest common multiple of two numbers.
The fourth line of the code is to define a function called f, which calculates the sum of the first n numbers that are divisible by b.
The fifth line of the code is to initialize N and K to 3 and 2, respectively.
The sixth line of the code is to check if K is even. If it is, it calculates the sum of the first n numbers that are divisible by K and the sum of the first n numbers that are divisible by K/2.
The seventh line of the code is to print the result of the calculation.
The eighth line of the code is to check if K is odd. If it is, it calculates the sum of the first n numbers that are divisible by K.
The ninth line of the code is to print the result of the calculation.

The output is 12.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    return n * f(n - 1)
 
N = int(input())
print(f(N))

The input is 10.
The function f takes a number n as input and returns the product of n and the result of calling f with n-1 as input.
The first line of the code is to initialize N to 10.
The second line of the code is to call the function f with N as input.
The third line of the code is to print the result of the function call.

The output is 3628800.
