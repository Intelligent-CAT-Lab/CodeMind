The variable A, B and C are initialized to 2, 2 and 2, respectively.
The code then checks if A == B and B == C. Since A == B and B == C, the code prints "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
A, B, C = (int(i) for i in input().strip().split(' '))

if A == B and B == C:
    print("Yes")
else:
    print("No")

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 2 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
