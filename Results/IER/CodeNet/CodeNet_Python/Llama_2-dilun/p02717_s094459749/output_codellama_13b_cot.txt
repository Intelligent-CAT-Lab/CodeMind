The input is 1 2 3.
The code splits the input into three strings, a, b and c.
The code prints the string c, a and b.
The output is 3 1 2.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
a, b, c = input().split()
print(c, a, b)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 2 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
