The variable n is initialized to 1118.
The code checks if the first three digits of n are the same or if the last three digits of n are the same.
If either of these conditions is met, the code prints "Yes".
Otherwise, it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No

Consider the following code:
<Code>
n=input()

if n[0]==n[1]==n[2] or n[3]==n[1]==n[2]:
  print("Yes")
else:
  print("No")
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1118
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
