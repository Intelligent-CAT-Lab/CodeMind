The variable N and variable K are initialized to 5 and 3, respectively.
The code checks if K is greater than ((N-1)*(N-2))//2, which is 10 in this case.
If it is, it prints -1 and exits.
Otherwise, it prints the value of N-1+((N-1)*(N-2))//2-K, which is 1 in this case.

The code then prints 1 and 2, which are the only two numbers that satisfy the condition.

The code then initializes a to 0.
It then iterates from 2 to N, which is 5 in this case.
For each number i in this range, it iterates from i+1 to N+1, which is 6 in this case.
It checks if a is less than ((N-1)*(N-2))//2-K, which is 1 in this case.
If it is, it prints i and j, which are 3 and 4 in this case.
It then increments a by 1.

The output is 1 3 4.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def MI(): return map(int,sys.stdin.readline().rstrip().split())

N,K = MI()

if K > ((N-1)*(N-2))//2:
    print(-1)
    exit()

print(N-1+((N-1)*(N-2))//2-K)

for i in range(2,N+1):
    print(1,i)

a = 0
for i in range(2,N):
    for j in range(i+1,N+1):
        if a < ((N-1)*(N-2))//2-K:
            print(i,j)
            a += 1

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
