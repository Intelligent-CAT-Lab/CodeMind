The variable r is initialized to 2.
The variable s is initialized to r * r * math.pi, which is 2 * 2 * 3.141592653589793 = 12.56602540378443.
The variable l is initialized to r * 2 * math.pi, which is 2 * 3.141592653589793 = 6.283185307179586.
The code then prints the final values of s and l, which are 12.56602540378443 and 6.283185307179586, respectively.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import math
    
r = float(input())
    
s = r * r * math.pi
    
l = r * 2 * math.pi
    
print('%.5f %.5f' % (s, l))
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
