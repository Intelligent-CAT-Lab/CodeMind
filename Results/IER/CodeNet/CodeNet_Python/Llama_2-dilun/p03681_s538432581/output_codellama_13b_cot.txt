The variable n and m are initialized to 2 and 2, respectively.
The variable ans1 is initialized to 1, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The variable ans2 is initialized to 1, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The variable mod is initialized to 10^9 + 7, which will be used to calculate the remainder of the sum of numbers meeting the condition.

The code checks if the absolute difference between n and m is greater than or equal to 2. If it is, it prints 0 and exits the program.

The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n+1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 2.
For each number i in this range, it multiplies ans1 by i and calculates the remainder of the result by dividing it by mod.
The code checks if the absolute difference between n and m is 1. If it is, it prints the remainder of the result of multiplying ans1 by ans2 and dividing it by mod.
