The code first reads the input n, which is 10.
The code then calculates the square root of n, which is 3.1622776601683794.
The code then multiplies the square root by itself, which is 3.1622776601683794^2.
The code then prints the result, which is 9.653593240488281.
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import sys

n = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())

for i in range(1,n+1):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        print(i)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The code first reads the input n, which is 10.
The code then iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), which is 1 to 10.
For each number i in this range, the code checks if i is even. If it is, it prints i.
The condition is met when i is 2,4,6,8,10.
The code prints 2,4,6,8,10.
