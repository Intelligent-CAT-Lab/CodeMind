The variable n, variable a and variable b are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
The function SumOfDigits(n) is called to calculate the sum of digits of n.
The variable sum is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in add.
The code checks if add is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum, which is 84.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def SumOfDigits(n): #各桁の和を計算する関数
    sum = 0
    while n > 0:
        sum += (n % 10)
        n //= 10
    return sum

n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
sum = 0

for i in range(n+1):
    add = 0
    add = SumOfDigits(i)
    if a <= add and add <= b:
        sum += i

print(sum)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20 2 5
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
