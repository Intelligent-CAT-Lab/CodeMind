The variable N is initialized to 2.
The function num2alpha takes a number as input and returns a string.
The function num2alpha first checks if the number is less than 26. If it is, it returns the corresponding ASCII character.
If the number is not less than 26, it checks if the number is divisible by 26. If it is, it returns the result of calling num2alpha on the number divided by 26 minus 1.
If the number is not divisible by 26, it returns the result of calling num2alpha on the number divided by 26 plus the ASCII character corresponding to the number modulo 26.
The function num2alpha is called with N as input.
The function num2alpha returns the string "a".
The string "a" is converted to lowercase and printed.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())
def num2alpha(num):
    if num<=26:
        return chr(64+num)
    elif num%26==0:
        return num2alpha(num//26-1)+chr(90)
    else:
        return num2alpha(num//26)+chr(64+num%26)
print(num2alpha(N).lower())
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
