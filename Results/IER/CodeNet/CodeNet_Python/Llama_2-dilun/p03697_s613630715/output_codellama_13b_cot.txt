The variable A and variable B are initialized to 6 and 3, respectively.
The code checks if A + B is greater than or equal to 10.
Since A + B is 9, the condition is not met and the code prints 9.
<<<Output>>>
9

Consider the following code:
<Code>
A,B = list(map(int,input().split()))
if A + B >= 10:
    print("error")
else:
    print(A+B)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```6 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
