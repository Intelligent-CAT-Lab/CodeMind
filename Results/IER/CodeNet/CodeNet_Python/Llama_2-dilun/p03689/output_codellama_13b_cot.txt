The variable H, variable W, variable h and variable w are initialized to 3, 3, 2 and 2, respectively.
The code checks if H is divisible by h and W is divisible by w. If it is, it prints "No".
Otherwise, it prints "Yes".

The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to H (inclusive), meaning it will consider rows from 0 to 3.
For each row y in this range, it enters another loop that iterates from 0 to W (inclusive), meaning it will consider columns from 0 to 3.
If the column x is not 0, it prints a space.
If the column x is not divisible by w, it prints 100000.
Otherwise, it prints -100000*(w-1)-1.

The code then prints a newline.

The code then checks if W is divisible by w. If it is, it prints "Yes".
Otherwise, it prints "Yes".

The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to H (inclusive), meaning it will consider rows from 0 to 3.
For each row y in this range, it enters another loop that iterates from 0 to W (inclusive), meaning it will consider columns from 0 to 3.
If the column x is not 0, it prints a space.
If the column x is not divisible by h, it prints 100000.
Otherwise, it prints -100000*(h-1)-1.

The code then prints a newline.

The code then prints the final value of H, which is 3.
