The input is 4 12.
The code first converts the input to a list of integers.
The code then checks if the second element of the list is divisible by the first element.
If it is, the code adds the first and second elements of the list.
If it is not, the code subtracts the first element from the second element.
The output is 16.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
if a[1] % a[0] == 0:
  b = a[0] + a[1]
if a[1] % a[0]!= 0:
  b = a[1] - a[0]
print(b)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4 12
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
