    Consider the following code:
<Code>
n = input()

if n.isupper():
    print("A")
elif n.islower():
    print("a")
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```B
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
