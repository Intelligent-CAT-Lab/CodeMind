The variable a, b and c are initialized to 3, 1 and 4, respectively.
The code checks if c is less than or equal to a+b+1.
If it is, it prints b+c.
If it is not, it prints a+2*b+1.

The condition is met when c is 1, 2 or 3.

The output is 1+4=5, 2+4=6 and 3+4=7.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b,c=map(int,input().split())
if c<=a+b+1:
    print(b+c)
else:
    print(a+2*b+1)

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 1 4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
