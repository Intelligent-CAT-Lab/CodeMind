The variable a and variable b are initialized to 3 and 5, respectively.
The code checks if a is greater than or equal to b. Since a is 3 and b is 5, the condition is not met.
The code then checks if b is divisible by a. Since b is 5 and a is 3, the condition is met.
The code then prints the quotient of b divided by a, which is 1.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
a, b = map(int, input().split())

if a >= b:
    print(1)
else:
    if b % a == 0:
        print(b // a)
    else:
        print(b // a + 1)

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 5
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
