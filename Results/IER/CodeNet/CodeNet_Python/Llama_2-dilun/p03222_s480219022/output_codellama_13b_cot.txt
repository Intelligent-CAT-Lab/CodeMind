The code first reads the input and assigns it to variables H, W and K.
The code then calls the function solve, which is a recursive function that calculates the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The function takes the height of the triangle and the number of rows as input, and returns the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The function first checks if the height is 0, in which case it returns 1 if the number of rows is 1, and 0 otherwise.
If the number of rows is 1, it returns the product of the first number in the triangle and the last number in the triangle.
If the number of rows is 2, it returns the product of the first number in the triangle and the last number in the triangle, plus the product of the second number in the triangle and the second-to-last number in the triangle.
If the number of rows is greater than 2, it recursively calls the function with the height decreased by 1 and the number of rows decreased by 1.
It then calculates the sum of the products of the numbers in the triangle with the height decreased by 1 and the number of rows decreased by 1, multiplied by the first number in the triangle, multiplied by the last number in the triangle, multiplied by the product of the first number in the triangle and the last number in the triangle, multiplied by the product of the second number in the triangle and the second-to-last number in the triangle.
It then returns the sum of the products of the numbers in the triangle with the height decreased by 1 and the number of rows decreased by 1, multiplied by the first number in the triangle, multiplied by the last number in the triangle, multiplied by the product of the first number in the triangle and the last number in the triangle, multiplied by the product of the second number in the triangle and the second-to-last number in the triangle.

The function then returns the sum of the products of the numbers in the triangle with the height decreased by 1 and the number of rows decreased by 1, multiplied by the first number in the triangle, multiplied by the last number in the triangle, multiplied by the product of the first number in the triangle and the last number in the triangle, multiplied by the product of the second number in the triangle and the second-to-last number in the triangle.

The function then returns the sum of the products of the numbers in the triangle with the height decreased by 1 and the number of rows decreased by 1, multiplied by the first number in the triangle, multiplied by the last number in the triangle, multiplied by the product of the first number in the triangle and the last number in the triangle, multiplied by the product of the second number in the triangle and the second-to-last number in the triangle.

The function then returns the sum of the products of the numbers in the triangle with the height decreased by 1 and the number of rows decreased by 1, multiplied by the first number in the triangle, multiplied by the last number in the triangle, multiplied by the product of the first number in the triangle and the last number in the triangle, multiplied by the product of the second number in the triangle and the second-to-last number in the triangle.

The function then returns the sum of the products of the numbers in the triangle with the height decreased by 1 and the number of rows decreased by 1, multiplied by the first number in the triangle, multiplied by the last number in the triangle, multiplied by the product of the first number in the triangle and the last number in the triangle, multiplied by the product of the second number in the triangle and the second-to-last number in the triangle.

The function then returns the sum of the products of the numbers in the triangle with the height decreased by 1 and the number of rows decreased by 1, multiplied by the first number in the triangle, multiplied by the last number in the triangle, multiplied by the product of the first number in the triangle and the last number in the triangle, multiplied by the product of the second number in the triangle and the second-to-last number in the triangle.

The function then returns the sum of the products of the numbers in the triangle with the height decreased by 1 and the number of rows decreased by 1, multiplied by the first number in the triangle, multiplied by the last number in the triangle, multiplied by the product of the first number in the triangle and the last number in the triangle
