The variable N and variable M are initialized to 1 and 2, respectively.
The code then checks if N is greater than M. If it is, it swaps the values of N and M.
The code then initializes the variables fact, powm and pown to 0.
The variable fact is a list of integers that stores the factorial of each number from 0 to M.
The variable powm is a list of integers that stores the power of each number from 0 to M.
The variable pown is a list of integers that stores the power of each number from 0 to N.
The variable fact[0] is initialized to 1, and the variables powm[0] and pown[0] are initialized to 1.
The code then iterates from 1 to M (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 2.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the factorial of i and stores it in fact[i].
It then calculates the power of i and stores it in powm[i].
It then calculates the power of N + 1 and stores it in pown[i].
The code then defines a function called pow that calculates the power of a number.
The function pow takes two integers as input, n and m, and returns the power of n to the power of m.
The function pow first checks if m is 0. If it is, it returns 1.
If m is 1, it returns n.
If m is even, it returns the power of n to the power of m divided by 2.
If m is odd, it returns the power of n to the power of m divided by 2 multiplied by n modulo 998244353.
The code then defines a function called C that calculates the number of combinations of n and r.
The function C takes two integers as input, n and r, and returns the product of the factorial of n and the factorial of r multiplied by the inverse of the factorial of n multiplied by the inverse of the factorial of r.
The function C first calculates the factorial of n and the factorial of r.
It then calculates the product of the factorial of n and the factorial of r.
It then calculates the product of the inverse of the factorial of n and the inverse of the factorial of r.
It then calculates the product of the factorial of n and the factorial of r multiplied by the inverse of the factorial of n multiplied by the inverse of the factorial of r.
The code then initializes the variable ans to 0.
The code then iterates from 1 to N + 1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 3.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the product of the negative of i, the number of combinations of N and i, the number of combinations of M and i, the factorial of i, the power of N - i, and the power of M - i.
It then calculates the product of the result and the modulo of 998244353.
It then calculates the modulo of the result.
It then prints the result.
