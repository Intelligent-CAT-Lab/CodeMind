The variable x is initialized to 1000.
The code checks if x is less than 1200.
If it is, it prints ABC.
If it is not, it prints ARC.
<<<Output>>>
ABC
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

Consider the following code:
<Code>
x = int(input())

if x < 1200:
    print('ABC')
else:
    print('ARC')
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1000
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
