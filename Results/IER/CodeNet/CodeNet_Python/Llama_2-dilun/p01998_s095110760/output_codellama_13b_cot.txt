The variable N is initialized to 3.
The variable P is initialized to a list of True values.
The first two elements of P are set to False.

The code then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to the square root of N + 3 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 2 to 3.
For each number i in this range, if P[i] is True, it sets P[i * 2] and P[i * 2 + 1] to False.

The code then enters a loop that iterates from 3 to N + 1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 3 to 4.
For each number q in this range, if P[q] and P[2 + q] are True, it increments the count by 2.

After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of count, which is 2.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import math

N = int(input())
P = [True for x in range(N + 3)]

P[0] = False
P[1] = False

for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(N + 3)) + 1):
    if P[i]:
        for j in range(i * 2, N + 3, i):
            P[j] = False

count = 0

for q in range(3, N + 1):
    if P[q] and P[2 + q]:
        count += 2

print(count)


<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
