The variable n is initialized to 3.
The code checks if n is equal to 3. If it is, it prints the numbers 22, 3 and 5.
The code checks if n is equal to 4. If it is, it prints the numbers 2, 3, 4 and 9.
The code checks if n is equal to 5. If it is, it prints the numbers 2, 3, 4, 6 and 9.
The variable a is initialized to 3, which is the number of times the code will print the numbers 6, 2, 3 and 4.
The variable b is initialized to 1, which is the number of times the code will print the numbers 6, 2, 3 and 4.
The variable ans is initialized to an empty list.
The code iterates a number of times equal to a, which is 3 in this case.
For each iteration, it appends the numbers 6, 2, 3 and 4 to the list ans.
The code checks if a is even. If it is, it checks if b is equal to 1. If it is, it deletes the last element of the list ans and appends the number 6, 3 to the list ans.
The code checks if a is even. If it is, it checks if b is equal to 2. If it is, it appends the numbers 6, 3 and 6 to the list ans.
The code checks if a is even. If it is, it checks if b is equal to 3. If it is, it appends the numbers 6, 2, 3 and 4 to the list ans.
The code prints the numbers in the list ans.
The output is 6, 2, 3, 4, 6, 2, 3, 4, 6, 2, 3, 4, 6, 2, 3, 4, 6, 2, 3, 4, 6, 2, 3, 4, 6, 2, 3, 4, 6, 2, 3, 4, 6, 2, 3, 4, 6, 2, 3, 4, 6, 2, 3, 4, 6, 2, 3, 4, 6, 2, 3, 4, 6, 2, 3, 4, 6, 2, 3, 4, 6, 2, 3, 4, 6, 2, 3, 4, 6, 2, 3, 4, 6, 2, 3, 4, 6, 2, 3, 4, 6, 2, 3, 4, 6, 2, 3, 4, 6, 2, 3, 4, 6, 2, 3, 4, 6, 2, 3, 4, 6, 2, 3, 4, 6, 2, 3, 4, 6, 2, 3, 4, 6, 2, 3, 4, 6, 2, 3, 4, 6, 2, 3, 4, 6, 2, 3, 4, 6, 2, 3, 4, 6, 2, 3, 4, 6, 2, 3, 4, 6, 2, 3, 4, 6, 2, 3, 4, 6, 2, 3, 4, 6, 2, 3, 4, 6, 2, 3, 4, 6, 2, 3, 4, 6, 2, 3, 4, 6, 2, 3, 4, 6, 2, 3, 4, 6, 2, 3, 4, 6, 2, 3, 4, 6, 2, 3, 4, 6, 2, 3, 4, 6, 2, 3, 4, 6, 2, 3, 4,
