The code first checks if the input is a string. If it is, it stores it in inputStrings.
The code then iterates through the input string, and checks if the next character is "A". If it is, it appends "A" to the outputStrings list.
The code then checks if the next character is "Z". If it is, it appends "Z" to the outputStrings list.
The code then checks if the outputStrings list is empty. If it is, it prints "-1".
If the outputStrings list is not empty, it checks if the last character of the outputStrings list is "A". If it is, it removes the last character from the outputStrings list.
The code then prints the outputStrings list.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def get_max_sum(arr):
    max_sum = 0
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        for j in range(i+1, len(arr)):
            sum = arr[i] + arr[j]
            if sum > max_sum:
                max_sum = sum
    return max_sum


arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
print(get_max_sum(arr))


<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

The code first checks if the input is a list. If it is, it stores it in arr.
The code then iterates through the list, and calculates the sum of each pair of elements.
The code then checks if the sum is greater than the current maximum sum. If it is, it stores the sum as the new maximum sum.
The code then prints the maximum sum.
