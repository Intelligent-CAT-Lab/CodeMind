The variable n, variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized to 3, 1, 2 and 0, respectively.
The variable MOD is initialized to 1000000007.
The variables FACT and INVERSE_FACT are initialized to [0] * (n + 1) and [0] * (n + 1), respectively.
The variable FACT[0] is initialized to 1 and the variable INVERSE_FACT[0] is initialized to 1.
For each value i in the range [1, n + 1], the variable FACT[i] is initialized to FACT[i - 1] * i % MOD and the variable INVERSE_FACT[i] is initialized to inverse(FACT[i]).
The variable ans is initialized to 0.

The code checks if b % 2!= 0, which is false in this case. If it is true, it prints 0 and exits the program.

The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to min(a + 1, c + 1), which is 2 in this case.
For each value y in this range, the code enters another loop that iterates from 0 to (c - y) // 3 + 1, which is 1 in this case.
For each value z in this range, the code calculates the value of FACT[x + y + z] * INVERSE_FACT[x] % MOD, which is 1 * 1 % 1000000007 = 1.
The code then calculates the value of INVERSE_FACT[y] % MOD, which is 1 * 1 % 1000000007 = 1.
The code then calculates the value of INVERSE_FACT[z] % MOD, which is 1 * 1 % 1000000007 = 1.
The code then calculates the value of comb(x + y + z + 1 + b // 2 - 1, b // 2) % MOD, which is 1 * 1 % 1000000007 = 1.
The code then calculates the value of comb(b // 2 + rest3 - 1, rest3) % MOD, which is 1 * 1 % 1000000007 = 1.

The code then calculates the value of ans + cur_ans % MOD, which is 1 + 1 % 1000000007 = 0.

The code then calculates the value of ans % MOD, which is 0 % 1000000007 = 0.

The code prints the value of ans, which is 0.
