The variable a and variable b are initialized to 5 and 4, respectively.
The code checks if a and b are less than 9. Since they are, the code prints "Yay!".
<<<Output>>>
Yay!

Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b=map(int,input().split())
if a<9 and b<9:
    print("Yay!")
else:
    print(":(")
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
