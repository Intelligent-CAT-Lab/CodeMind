The function gcd calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.
The function lcm calculates the least common multiple of two numbers by multiplying them and then dividing by the greatest common divisor.
The input is 2 and 3, so the output is 6.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def gcd(a, b):
    '''ユークリッド互除法を使った最大公約数の求め方'''
    while b!= 0:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return(a)


def lcm(a, b):
    '''最小公倍数の求め方'''
    return a * b // gcd(a, b)

A, B = list(map(int, input().split()))

print(lcm(A,B))
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
