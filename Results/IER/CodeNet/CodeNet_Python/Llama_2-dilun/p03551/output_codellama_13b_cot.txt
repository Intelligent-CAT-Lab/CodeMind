The variable N and variable M are initialized to 1 and 1, respectively.
The code then calculates the time in seconds, which is 1900*1+(1-1)*100 = 1900.
The code then multiplies the time by 2 to the power of M, which is 2^1 = 2.
The code then prints the result, which is 1900*2 = 3800.
<<<Output>>>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
N,M = list(map(int,input().split()))
time = 1900*M+(N-M)*100
print(time*(2**M))

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 1
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
