The variable x is initialized to 10.
The variable ans is initialized to 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to the square root of 1000 (inclusive), which is 31.622776601683794.
For each number b in this range, the code enters another loop that iterates from 2 to 10 (inclusive).
For each number p in this range, the code calculates the power of b to the power of p and stores it in y.
The code checks if y is less than or equal to x and if ans is less than y. If both conditions are met, it sets ans to y.
The condition is met when p is 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 1000.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
x = int(input())
ans = 1
for b in range(1, int(1000**.5)+1):
    for p in range(2, 10):
        y = b**p
        if y <= x and ans < y:
            ans = y
print(ans)

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
