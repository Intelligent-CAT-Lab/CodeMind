The variable N, variable K are initialized to 3, 2, respectively.
The variable MOD is initialized to 10 ** 9 + 7.

The variable dp is initialized to a 2D array of size N+1 x (K+N*2+1).
The first element of the first row of dp is initialized to 1.

The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 3.
For each number i in this range, it enters a loop that iterates from 0 to i (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 3.
For each number j in this range, it enters a loop that iterates from 0 to K+1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 2.
For each number k in this range, it calculates the value of dp[i+1][j][k+j*2] by adding the value of dp[i][j][k], multiplying it by j * 2, and then moduloing it by MOD.
It then calculates the value of dp[i+1][j+1][k+(j+1)*2] by adding the value of dp[i][j][k], multiplying it by j * j, and then moduloing it by MOD.
