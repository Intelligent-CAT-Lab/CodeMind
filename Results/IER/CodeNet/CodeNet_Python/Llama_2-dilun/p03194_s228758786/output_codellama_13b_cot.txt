The variable n and variable p are initialized to 3 and 24, respectively.
The code checks if n is equal to 1. If it is, it prints p.
Otherwise, it initializes the variable ans to 1 and the variable limit to the ceiling of p raised to the power of 1/n.
The code then enters a while loop that iterates until limit is less than 1.
In each iteration, it initializes the variable cnt to 0 and the variable a to p.
It then checks if a is divisible by limit. If it is, it increments cnt and sets a to a divided by limit.
Otherwise, it breaks out of the loop.
If cnt is greater than or equal to n, it sets ans to limit and breaks out of the loop.
Otherwise, it decrements limit.
The code then prints ans.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import math
n, p = map(int, input().split())
if n==1:
	print(p)
else:
	ans = 1
	limit = math.ceil(p**(1/n))
	while(limit>1):
		cnt = 0
		a = p
		while(a!=0):
			if a%limit == 0:
				cnt += 1
				a = a // limit
			else:
				break
		if cnt >= n:
			ans = limit
			break
		limit -= 1
	print(ans)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 24
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
