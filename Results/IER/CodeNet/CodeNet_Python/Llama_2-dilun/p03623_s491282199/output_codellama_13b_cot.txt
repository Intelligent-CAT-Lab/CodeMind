The variable a, b and c are initialized to 5, 2 and 7, respectively.
The code then checks if the absolute difference between a and b is less than the absolute difference between c and a.
If it is, it prints "A". Otherwise, it prints "B".
In this case, the absolute difference between a and b is 3, which is less than the absolute difference between c and a, which is 5.
Therefore, the code prints "A".
<<<Output>>>
A

Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b,c=map(int,input().split())
if abs(a-b)<abs(c-a):
  print('A')
else:
  print('B')
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 2 7
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
