The input is 575.
The variables a, b and c are initialized to 575.
The code then prints "Yes" if a == c, which is true in this case.
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b,c=input()
print("Yes" if a==c else "No")
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```575
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
