The variable n and variable m are initialized to 3 and 100, respectively.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 3.
For each number i in this range, it prints a space if i is not 0, and prints "0" if i is 0.
After the loop finishes, the code prints an empty line.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
(n,m)=[int(a) for a in input().split()]
for i in range(n):
    if i:print(" ",end="")
    if i<=n/2: print("0",end="")
    else: print("{}".format(m),end="")
print("")
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 100
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
