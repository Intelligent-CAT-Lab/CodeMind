The variable N is initialized to 3.
The code then prints the value of N * (N % 2 + 1), which is 3 * (3 % 2 + 1), which is 3 * 1, which is 3.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())

print(N * (N % 2 + 1))

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
