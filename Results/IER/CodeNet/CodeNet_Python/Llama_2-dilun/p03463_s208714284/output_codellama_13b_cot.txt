<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 5, 2 and 4, respectively.
The code then prints the string 'Borys' if the difference between A and B is even, and prints the string 'Alice' otherwise.
The difference between A and B is 2, which is even, so the code prints 'Borys'.
<<<Output>>>
Borys
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

[INST]
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N,A,B = map(int,input().split())
print('Borys' if (B-A)%2 else 'Alice')

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 2 4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
