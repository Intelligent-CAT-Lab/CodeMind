The variable w, h, ax, ay, bx and by are initialized to 4, 4, 0, 0, 3 and 3, respectively.
The code then calculates the minimum of the absolute difference between the left and right sides of the rectangle and the width of the rectangle.
The code then calculates the minimum of the absolute difference between the top and bottom sides of the rectangle and the height of the rectangle.
The code then calculates the product of the minimum of the absolute difference between the left and right sides of the rectangle and the width of the rectangle and the product of the minimum of the absolute difference between the top and bottom sides of the rectangle and the height of the rectangle.
The code then calculates the product of the result of the previous step and the number of ways to arrange the rectangle such that the left and right sides are equal to the width of the rectangle.
The code then calculates the product of the result of the previous step and the number of ways to arrange the rectangle such that the top and bottom sides are equal to the height of the rectangle.
The code then calculates the product of the result of the previous step and the number of ways to arrange the rectangle such that the left and right sides are equal to the width of the rectangle and the top and bottom sides are equal to the height of the rectangle.
The code then prints the result of the previous step modulo 100000007.
The result is 100000000.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import sys
from math import factorial
sys.setrecursionlimit(10000)
def comb (x,y):
	return factorial(x)//factorial(x-y)//factorial(y)

w,h,ax,ay,bx,by=map(int,input().split())
dx=min(w-abs(ax-bx),abs(ax-bx))
dy=min(h-abs(ay-by),abs(ay-by))
ans=1
if dx*2==w:ans*=2
if dy*2==h:ans*=2
ans*=comb(dx+dy,dx)
print(ans%100000007)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4 4 0 0 3 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
