The variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized to 6, 4 and 3, respectively.
The variable d is initialized to c - (a - b).
The code then checks if d is less than 0. If it is, it prints 0. Otherwise, it prints d.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b,c=map(int,input().split())
d=c-(a-b)
if d<0:
    print(0)
else:
    print(d)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```6 4 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
