The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 4, 2 and 1, respectively.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 4.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 1] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4 and 1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 10.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
print(sum(map(int,input().split())))

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4 2 1 1
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
