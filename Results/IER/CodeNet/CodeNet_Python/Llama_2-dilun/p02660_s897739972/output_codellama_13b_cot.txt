The variable n is initialized to 24.
The function factorization is called, which calculates the prime factorization of n.
The prime factorization of 24 is [2, 2, 2, 3].
The function factorization returns the prime factorization of n as a list.
The variable a is initialized to the prime factorization of n.
The variable ans is initialized to 0.
The for loop iterates through the elements of the list a.
For each element i in the list, the variable k is initialized to i[1], which is the number of times the element i appears in the prime factorization of n.
The variable ans is updated by adding the value of (-1 + (1 + 8 * k) ** (0.5)) / 2.
The final value of ans is 12.

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```100
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
