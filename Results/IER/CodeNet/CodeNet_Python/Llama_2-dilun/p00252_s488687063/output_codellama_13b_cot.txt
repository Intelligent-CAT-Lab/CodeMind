The variable b1, b2 and b3 are initialized to 0, 0 and 1, respectively.
The code checks if b1 is 1. If it is, it checks if b2 is 1. If it is, it prints "Open". If it is not, it checks if b3 is 1. If it is, it prints "Open". If it is not, it prints "Close".
The code checks if b1 is not 1. If it is not, it checks if b2 is 1. If it is, it prints "Close". If it is not, it checks if b3 is 1. If it is, it prints "Open". If it is not, it prints "Close".
The code prints "Open" because b1 is 1 and b2 is 1.
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
b1,b2,b3 = map(int,input().split())

if b1 == 1:
    if b2 == 1:
        print("Open")
    else:
        print("Close")
else:
    if b2 == 1:
        print("Close")
    else:
        if b3 == 1:
            print("Open")
        else:
            print("Close")

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 1 1
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
