The variables a, b, c and d are initialized to 1, 1, 3 and 4, respectively.
The absolute values of c-a and d-b are calculated and stored in x and y, respectively.
If x or y is 0, the code prints 0 and exits.
The code then calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of x and y, which is 1 in this case.
The code then calculates the sum of x and y, which is 5 in this case.
The code then multiplies the sum by the GCD, which is 1 in this case.
The code then prints the result, which is 5.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b,c,d = map(int, raw_input().split())

x = abs(c-a)
y = abs(d-b)

if x == 0 or y == 0:
	print 0
	import sys
	sys.exit(0)

def gcd(a,b):
	return a if b == 0 else gcd(b, a % b)

e = gcd(x,y)
x /= e
y /= e

print (x+y-1) * e
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 1 3 4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
