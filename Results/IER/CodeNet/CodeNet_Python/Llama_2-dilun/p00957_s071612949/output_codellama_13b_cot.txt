The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 5, 3, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 5.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [3, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 3,4 and 5.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 12.
