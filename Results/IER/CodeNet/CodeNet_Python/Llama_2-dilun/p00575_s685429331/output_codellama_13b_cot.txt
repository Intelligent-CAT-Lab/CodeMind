The variable a, b and c are initialized to 3, 0 and 10, respectively.
The variable d is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The variable i is initialized to 1, which will be used to iterate through the loop.
The code enters a loop that iterates forever.
Inside the loop, it checks if the current value of i is divisible by 7. If it is, it adds a and b to d. If it is not, it only adds a to d.
The code then checks if d is greater than or equal to c. If it is, it breaks out of the loop.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of i, which is 10.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b,c=map(int,input().split())
d=0
i=1
while True:
    if i%7==0:
        d=d+a+b
    else:
        d=d+a
    if d>=c:
        break
    i=i+1
print(i)

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 0 10
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
