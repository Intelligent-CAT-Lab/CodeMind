The variables t1, t2, r1 and r2 are initialized to 9, 8, 1000 and 999, respectively.
The code checks if r1 and r2 are -1. If they are, it checks if t1 is less than t2. If it is, it prints "Alice". If t1 is greater than t2, it prints "Bob". If t1 is equal to t2, it prints "Draw".
If r1 and r2 are not -1, the code checks if r1 is greater than r2. If it is, it prints "Alice". If r1 is less than r2, it prints "Bob". If r1 is equal to r2, it prints "Draw".

The output is "Alice".

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
t1,t2,r1,r2 = map(int,input().split())
if r1 == -1 or r2 == -1:
    if t1 < t2:
        print('Alice')
    elif t1 > t2:
        print('Bob')
    else:
        print('Draw')
elif r1 > r2:
    print('Alice')
elif r1 < r2:
    print('Bob')
else:
    print('Draw')

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```9 8 1000 999
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
