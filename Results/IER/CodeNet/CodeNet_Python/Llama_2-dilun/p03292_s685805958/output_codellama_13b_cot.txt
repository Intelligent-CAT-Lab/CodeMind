The variable A is initialized to a numpy array containing the numbers 1, 6 and 3.
The variable A is sorted in ascending order, which results in the array [1, 3, 6].
The variable A is then sliced to remove the first element and the last element, resulting in the array [3, 6].
The variable A is then subtracted from itself, resulting in the array [3, -3].
The variable A is then summed, resulting in the value 0.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import numpy as np
A = np.array(sorted(map(int, input().split())))
print((A[1:] - A[:-1]).sum())

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 6 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
