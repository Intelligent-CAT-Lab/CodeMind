The variable N, variable k are initialized to 4 and 2, respectively.
The function main is called with the input N and k.
The function main iterates from 0 to N-1, meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 3.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the value of p and p2.
p is the sum of the first k numbers, which is 0+1+2+3=6.
p2 is the sum of the first k numbers minus the sum of the first k-1 numbers, which is 6-5=1.
The function main then returns p2, which is 1.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
# coding: utf-8
# Here your code!

def main(N,k):
    p = 0
    p2 = 0
    memo = 0
    for i in range(N-1):
        p, p2 = p2, k*(p2+1)//(k-1) - 2
        while p2-1-p2//k!= p:
            p2+=1
    return p2

if __name__ == '__main__':
    N,k=input().split()
    print(main(int(N),int(k)))
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
