The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 7, 17 and 120, respectively.
The code then prints the minimum of A*N and B, which is 120.
<<<Output>>>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
N,A,B=map(int,input().split())

print(min(A*N,B))
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```7 17 120
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
