The variable l, r and d are initialized to 5, 10 and 2, respectively.
The code then prints the result of the following calculation:
r//d - (l-1)//d

The result is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2

Consider the following code:
<Code>
#!/usr/bin/env python3
l, r, d = map(int, input().split())
print(r//d - (l-1)//d)

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 10 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
