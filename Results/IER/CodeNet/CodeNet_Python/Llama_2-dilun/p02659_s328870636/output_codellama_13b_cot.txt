The variable a is initialized to 198 and the variable b is initialized to 1.10.
The variable a is converted to an integer and the variable b is converted to a decimal.
The code then prints the integer result of multiplying the two variables.
<<<Output>>>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
a, b = map(int, input().split())

print(a * b)

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```198 1.10
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
