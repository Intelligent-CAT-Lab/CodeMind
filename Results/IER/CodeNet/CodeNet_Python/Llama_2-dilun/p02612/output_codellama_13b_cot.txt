The variable n is initialized to 1900.
The code then prints the value of 1000 minus the remainder of 1900 divided by 1000.
The remainder is 0, so the output is 0.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
n=int(input())
print(1000-n%1000 if n%1000!=0 else 0)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1900
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
