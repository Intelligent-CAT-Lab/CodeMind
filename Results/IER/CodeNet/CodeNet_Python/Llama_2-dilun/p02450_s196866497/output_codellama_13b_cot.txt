The variable n is initialized to 2.
The function permutations is called on the range of numbers from 1 to n (inclusive), which is 1 to 2 in this case.
The function returns a list of all permutations of the numbers in the range.
The list is iterated over and for each permutation, it is converted to a string and printed.
The output is:
```1 2
2 1```
<<<Output>>>
1 2

Consider the following code:
<Code>
n = int(input())
b = permutations(range(1, n+1))
for ele in b:
  print(" ".join(map(str, ele)))

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
