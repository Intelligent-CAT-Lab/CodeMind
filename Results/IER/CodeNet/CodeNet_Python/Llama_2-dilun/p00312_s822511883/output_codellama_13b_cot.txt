The variable a and variable b are initialized to 10 and 5, respectively.
The code then prints the value of a // b + a % b, which is 10 // 5 + 10 % 5 = 2.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
a, b = map(int, input().split())
print(a // b + a % b)

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10 5
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
