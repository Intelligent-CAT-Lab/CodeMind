The variable a, b and c are initialized to 2, 3 and 3, respectively.
The code checks if a is greater than c. If it is, it prints the difference between a and c and b.
The code checks if a + b is less than c. If it is, it prints 0 and 0.
The code checks if a is greater than c and a + b is less than c. If it is, it prints 0 and a + b - c.
The code prints 0 and 3 - 3, which is 0.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
a, b, c = map(int,input().split())
if a > c:
  print(a-c, b)
elif a + b < c:
  print(0,0)
else:
  print(0,a+b-c)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 3 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
