The variable N and variable K are initialized to 5 and 3, respectively.
The function cmb(a, b) is called, which calculates the number of combinations of a and b.
The function resolve() is called, which prints the result of cmb(N-1, N-K) % mod.
The result is 1, which is the number of combinations of 4 and 2.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
#!python3

iim = lambda: map(int, input().rstrip().split())

def cmb(a, b):
    if a == b or b == 0: return 1
    c = a - b

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
