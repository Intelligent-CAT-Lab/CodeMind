The variable n is initialized to 5.
The variable rent is initialized to 100000.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 5.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the ceiling of rent multiplied by 1.05 and then multiplies it by 1000.
The code prints the final value of rent, which is 105000.
<<<Output>>>
105000

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import math

n = input()
rent = 100000

for i in range(0, n):
  rent = math.ceil(rent*1.05/1000)*1000

print "%d"%rent
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
