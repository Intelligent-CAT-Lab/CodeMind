The variable a, variable op and variable b are initialized to 1, "+", and 2, respectively.
The code checks if op is "+", which is true.
The code then adds a and b, which is 3.
The code then prints 3.
<<<Output>>>
3

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
a, op, b = input().split(' ')
a = int(a)
b = int(b)
if op == '+':
    print(a+b)
else:
    print(a-b)

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 - 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The variable a, variable op and variable b are initialized to 1, "-", and 2, respectively.
The code checks if op is "-", which is true.
The code then subtracts a and b, which is -1.
The code then prints -1.
