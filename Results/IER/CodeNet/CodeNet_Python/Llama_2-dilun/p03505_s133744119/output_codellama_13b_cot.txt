The variable K, variable A and variable B are initialized to 4000, 2000 and 500, respectively.
The code checks if K is less than or equal to A. If it is, it prints 1.
Otherwise, it checks if A is less than or equal to B. If it is, it prints -1.
Otherwise, it calculates x = (K-B-1)/(A-B)+1.
It then prints 2*x-1.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
# coding:utf-8

K, A, B = map(int, raw_input().split())
if K <=A:
    print 1

elif A <= B:
    print -1
else:
    x = (K-B-1)/(A-B)+1
    print 2*x-1
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4000 2000 500
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
