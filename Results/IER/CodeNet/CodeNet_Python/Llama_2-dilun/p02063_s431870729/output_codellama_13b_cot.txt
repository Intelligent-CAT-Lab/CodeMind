The variable A and variable B are initialized to 4 and 6, respectively.
The function calca(x) calculates the sum of x and x/A.
The variable X is initialized to -(-B//A)*A, which is -(-2//4)*4 = -(-1)*4 = -4.
The variable Y is initialized to calca(X - X//B*B) + X//B, which is calca(-4 - (-4//6)*6) + (-4//6) = calca(-4 - (-4//6)*6) + 1 = calca(-4 - (-4//6)*6) + 1.
The condition -(-B//A) < Y is equivalent to -(-2//4) < calca(-4 - (-4//6)*6) + 1, which is -(-2//4) < calca(-4 - (-4//6)*6) + 1.
The condition is true, so the code prints the value of X, which is -4.
<<<Output>>>
-4

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def inpl(): return list(map(int, input().split()))

A, B = inpl()

def calca(x):
    return x//A + x%A

X = -(-B//A)*A
Y = calca(X - X//B*B) + X//B
if -(-B//A) < Y:
    print(X)
else:
    print(-1)

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4 6
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
