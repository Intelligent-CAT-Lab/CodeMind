The variable s is initialized to a list of three integers, which are 3, 8 and 1.
The variable s1 is initialized to a list of three integers, which are 1, 3 and 8.
The variable s1 is sorted in ascending order.
The code prints the first, second and third elements of the sorted list s1, which are 1, 3 and 8.
<<<Output>>>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
s =list(map(int,input().split()))
s1 = sorted(s)
print(str(s1[0])+" "+str(s1[1])+" "+str(s1[2]))


<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 8 1
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
