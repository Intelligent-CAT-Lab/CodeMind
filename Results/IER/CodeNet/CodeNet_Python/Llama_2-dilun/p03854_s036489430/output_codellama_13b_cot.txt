The code first initializes the variable St to an empty string.
It then initializes the variable t to a list containing the strings "dream", "dreamer", "erase" and "eraser".
The variable i is initialized to the length of the string St minus 1.
The variable cur is initialized to an empty string.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from the length of St minus 1 to 0 (inclusive), meaning it will consider the last character of St to the first character of St.
For each character in this range, it appends the character to cur and decreases the value of i by 1.
If cur is in the list t, it sets cur to an empty string.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if the length of cur is 0. If it is, it sets the variable ans to "YES". Otherwise, it sets the variable ans to "NO".
The code then prints the value of ans.
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def examC():
    St = S()
    t = ["dream", "dreamer", "erase", "eraser"]
    i = len(St)-1
    cur = ""
    while i>=0:
#        print(cur)
        cur = St[i] + cur
        i -=1
        if cur in t:
            cur = ""
    if len(cur)==0:
        ans = "YES"
    else:
        ans = "NO"
    print(ans)


import sys
def I(): return int(sys.stdin.readline())
def LI(): return list(map(int,sys.stdin.readline().split()))
def LS(): return sys.stdin.readline().split()
def S(): return sys.stdin.readline().strip()
mod = 10**9 + 7
inf = float('inf')

examC()

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```erasedream
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
