The variable a, b and c are initialized to 10, 10 and 5, respectively.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 60 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 60.
For each number t in this range, it checks if t % 60 is within the range [c, t % 60 + a], which is [5, 15] in this case. If it is, it prints the number t / 60 * 60 + c and breaks the loop.
The condition is met when t is 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55 and 60.
After the loop finishes, the code prints -1.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
a, b, c = map(int, raw_input().split())
t = 0
for loop in xrange(61):
    if t % 60 <= c <= t % 60 + a:
        print t / 60 * 60 + c
        break
    t += a + b
else:
    print -1
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10 10 5
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
