The variable n is initialized to 10000.
The variable result is initialized to an empty list.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to the square root of n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 100.
For each number i in this range, it checks if n is divisible by i. If it is, it adds the length of the string representation of i and the length of the string representation of n//i (n divided by i) to the list result.
The code then prints the minimum length of the strings in the list result, which is 3.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
n = int(input())

result = []
for i in range(1, int(n**(1/2)+1)):
    if n%i==0:
        result.append(max(len(str(i)), len(str(n//i))))
print(min(result))
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10000
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
