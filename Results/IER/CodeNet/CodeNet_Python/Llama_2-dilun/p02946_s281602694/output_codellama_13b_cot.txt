The variable n is initialized to a list containing two integers, 3 and 7.
The variable k is initialized to the first element of n, which is 3.
The variable x is initialized to the second element of n, which is 7.
The variable s1 is initialized to x - k + 1, which is 4.
The variable s2 is initialized to x + k - 1, which is 10.
The variable a1 is initialized to a list containing all integers from 4 to 10, inclusive.
The code then prints the list a1 as a string, which is "4 5 6 7 8 9 10".
<<<Output>>>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
n = list(map(int, input().split()))
k = n[0]
x = n[1]
s1 = x - k + 1
s2 = x + k - 1
a1 = list(range( (s1), (s2 + 1)  ))
print(" ".join(list(map(str, a1))))
</Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 7
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
