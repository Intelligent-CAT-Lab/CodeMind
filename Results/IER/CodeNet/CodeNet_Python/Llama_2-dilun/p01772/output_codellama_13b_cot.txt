The variable s is initialized to the input string "AIZUNYANPEROPERO".
The variable flag is initialized to False.
The code iterates through each character in the string s.
If the character is "A" and flag is False, it sets flag to True.
If the character is "Z" and flag is True, it adds "AZ" to the string ans and sets flag to False.
If the string ans is empty, it prints -1.
Otherwise, it prints ans.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
s = input()
ans = ""
flag = False
for c in s:
  if c == "A" and not flag:flag = True
  if c == "Z" and flag:
    ans += "AZ"
    flag = False
if ans == "":
  print(-1)
else:
  print(ans)

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```AIZUNYANPEROPERO
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
