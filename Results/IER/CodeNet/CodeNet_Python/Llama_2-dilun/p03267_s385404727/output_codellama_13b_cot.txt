The code first reads the value of L, which is 4.
Then it calls the main() function, which is the main function of the program.
The main() function calculates the value of n, which is 3, and the value of m, which is 4.
The code then creates a list of edges, which are pairs of integers representing the start and end points of an edge, and a weight value.
The edges are created by iterating from 1 to n, which is 3 in this case.
For each number i in this range, the code adds two edges to the list: one with start point i and end point i+1, and another with start point i and end point n, with a weight of 0.
It also adds two more edges with start point i and end point i+1, and a weight of 2**(i-1).

The code then calculates the value of cur, which is 2**(3-1) + 2**(3-1) = 8.
It then calculates the value of q, which is L - cur = 4 - 8 = -4.
It then calculates the value of r, which is the remainder of divmod(q, 2), which is 0.

The code then iterates from 1 to n, which is 3 in this case.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the value of q, which is the remainder of divmod(q, 2), which is 0.
If q is not 0, the code continues to the next iteration.
Otherwise, it adds an edge to the list with start point i and end point n, with a weight of cur, which is 8.
It then calculates the value of cur, which is cur + 2**(i-1) = 8 + 2**(3-1) = 16.
It then calculates the value of m, which is m + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5.

The code then yields the values of n and m, which are 3 and 4, respectively.
It then iterates through the edges in the list, yielding each edge as a tuple of three integers representing the start point, end point, and weight.

The output of the code is:
(3, 4)
(1, 2, 0)
(2, 3, 2)
(3, 4, 8)
(1, 2, 2)
(2, 3, 4)
(3, 4, 16)

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import sys

def main():
    n = int(sys.stdin.readline().rstrip())
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        print(i, end=' ')
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The code first reads the value of n, which is 10.
It then iterates from 1 to n+1, which is 11 in this case.
For each number i in this range, it prints i, followed by a space.
The output of the code is:
