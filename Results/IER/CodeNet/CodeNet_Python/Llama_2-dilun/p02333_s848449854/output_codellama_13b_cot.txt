The code first takes input n and k.
The code then checks if n is greater than or equal to k.
If n is greater than or equal to k, it calculates the answer by iterating from k to 1.
For each value of i, it calculates the answer by multiplying the value of i by the value of (-1) raised to the power of i.
It then multiplies the result by the value of k to the power of n, modulo MOD.
It then adds the result to the answer.
It repeats this process for each value of i from k to 1.
It then prints the final value of the answer.

If n is less than k, it calculates the answer by iterating from 1 to k.
