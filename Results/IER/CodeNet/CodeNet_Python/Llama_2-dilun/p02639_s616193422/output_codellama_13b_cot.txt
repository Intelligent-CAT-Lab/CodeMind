The variable a is initialized to the input string.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 4 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 4.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is equal to the number in the input string minus 1. If it is, it continues to the next iteration. Otherwise, it prints the number i+1.
The condition is met when i is 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of i, which is 5.
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
a = input().split()
for i in range(5):
  if i == int(a[i])-1:
    continue
  else:
    print(i+1)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```0 2 3 4 5
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
