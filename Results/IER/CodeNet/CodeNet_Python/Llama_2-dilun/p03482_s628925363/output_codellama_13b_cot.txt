The variable s is initialized to the input string "010".
The variable n is initialized to the length of s, which is 3.
The variable ans is initialized to n, which is 3.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 3.
For each number i in this range, it checks if the character at position i-1 is equal to the character at position i. If it is, the code continues to the next iteration. Otherwise, it calculates the minimum value of ans and the maximum value of i and n-i.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 2.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
s=input()
n=len(s)
ans=n
for i in range(1,n):
  if s[i-1]==s[i]:
    continue
  else:
    ans=min(ans,max(i,n-i))
print(ans)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```010
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
