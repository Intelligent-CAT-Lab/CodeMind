The variable a is initialized to 3.
The variable s is initialized to ['ACL'].
The variable w is initialized to an empty list.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to a (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 3.
For each number i in this range, it adds the string 'ACL' to the list w.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of w, which is ['ACL', 'ACL', 'ACL'].

Consider the following code:
<Code>
a = int(input())
s = ['ACL']
w =[]
for i in range(a):
    w += s
print(''.join(w))

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
