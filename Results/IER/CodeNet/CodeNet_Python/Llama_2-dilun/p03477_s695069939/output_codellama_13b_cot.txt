The variable a, b, c and d are initialized to 3, 8, 7 and 1, respectively.
The code checks if (a + b) > (c + d).
Since 3 + 8 > 7 + 1, the code prints 'Left'.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
a, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())

if (a + b) > (c + d):
    print('Left')
elif (a + b) < (c + d):
    print('Right')
else:
    print('Balanced')

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 8 7 1
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
