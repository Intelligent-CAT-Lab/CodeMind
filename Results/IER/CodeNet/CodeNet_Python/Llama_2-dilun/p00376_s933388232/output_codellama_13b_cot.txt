<<<Analysis>>>
The input is 20 30.
The code first splits the input into two numbers, x1 and x2.
Then it checks if x2 is greater than x1. If it is, it prints the difference between x2 and x1.
If it is not, it prints the difference between x1 and x2.
In this case, x2 is greater than x1, so the code prints 10.
<<<Output>>>
10

Consider the following code:
<Code>
x1,x2=(int(x) for x in input().split())
if x2>x1:
    print(int(x2-x1))
else:
    print(int(x1-x2))

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20 30
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
