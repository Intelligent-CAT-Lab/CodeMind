The variable inputlist is initialized to a list of three integers, which are 3, 1 and 4.
The variables a, b and c are initialized to 3, 1 and 4, respectively.
The variable oishii is initialized to b + c, which is 5.
The variable gedoku is initialized to a + b, which is 4.
The variable doku is initialized to c, which is 4.
The variable tabereru_doku is initialized to gedoku + 1, which is 5.
The variable tabereta_doku is initialized to tabereru_doku, which is 5.
The variable tabereta_doku is then added to b, which is 1.
The final value of tabereta_doku is 6, and the final value of the output is 10.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
inputlist = list(map(int, input().split()))

a = inputlist[0]
b = inputlist[1]
c = inputlist[2]

oishii = b + c
gedoku = a + b
doku = c

if doku - gedoku > 1 :
    tabereru_doku = gedoku + 1
else :
    tabereru_doku = doku

tabereta_doku = tabereru_doku

print(tabereta_doku + b)

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 1 4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
