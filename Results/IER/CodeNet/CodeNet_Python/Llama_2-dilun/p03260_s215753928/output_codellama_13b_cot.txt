The variable A and variable B are initialized to 3 and 1, respectively.
The code checks if A and B are odd numbers. If they are, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
A,B = map(int,input().split())

if A%2!=0 and B%2!=0:
    print("Yes")
else:
    print("No")
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 1
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
