The code first reads the input as a string.
It then replaces all commas and dots with empty strings.
It then splits the string into a list of words.
It then iterates through the list and appends each word to the list if its length is between 3 and 6.
Finally, it prints each word in the list.
<<<Output>>>
rain rain go to Spain

Consider the following code:
<Code>
code = raw_input()
code = code.replace(",","")
code = code.replace(".","")
code = code.split()
	
list = []
	
for var in code:
	if len(var) >= 3 and len(var) <= 6:
		list.append(var)
			
for var in list:
	print var,
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```Rain, rain, go to Spain.
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
