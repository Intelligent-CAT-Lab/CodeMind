The variable List is initialized to the list [1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 5, 2, 2, 1, 5, 1, 2, 1, 14, 1, 5, 1, 5, 2, 2, 1, 15, 2, 2, 5, 4, 1, 4, 1, 51].
The variable K is initialized to 6.
The code then prints the element at index K-1, which is 14.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())
A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
B = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
C = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
D = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
for i in range(1,N+1):
    for j in range(1,N+1):
        for k in range(1,N+1):
            for l in range(1,N+1):
                if A[i] == B[j] and B[j] == C[k] and C[k] == D[l]:
                    print(i, j, k, l)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The variable N is initialized to 10.
The variable A is initialized to the list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10].
The variable B is initialized to the list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10].
The variable C is initialized to the list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10].
The variable D is initialized to the list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10].
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 10.
For each number i in this range, it enters another loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 10.
For each number j in this range, it enters another loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 10.
For each number k in this range, it enters another loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 10.
For each number l in this range, it checks if A[i] is equal to B[j], B[j] is equal to C[k] and C[k] is equal to D[l].
If all these conditions are met, it prints the values of i, j, k and l.
The condition is met when i is 1, j is 1, k is 1 and l is 1.
The condition is also met when i is 2, j is 2, k is 2 and l is 2.
The condition is also met when i is 3, j is 3, k is 3 and l is 3
