The variable g is initialized to 9.8.
The variable eps is initialized to 1e-10.
The variable N, variable V, variable X and variable Y are initialized to 0, 7, 3 and 1, respectively.
The variable obstacles is initialized to an empty list.
For each obstacle in the input, the code adds it to the list obstacles.
The variable check is called with the input parameters X and Y.
If the function returns 1, the code prints "Yes" and exits.
If the function returns 0, the code checks if any of the obstacles in the list obstacles can be passed.
If so, the code prints "Yes" and exits.
If not, the code prints "No" and exits.

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```0 7 3 1
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
