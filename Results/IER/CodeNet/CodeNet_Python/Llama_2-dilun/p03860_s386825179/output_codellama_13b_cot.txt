The variable a, x and c are initialized to "AtCoder Beginner Contest", "AtCoder Beginner Contest" and "AtCoder Beginner Contest", respectively.
The code then prints the concatenation of the first character of each of these strings.
The output is "AtCoder Beginner Contest".

Consider the following code:
<Code>
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

a, x, c = map(str, input().split())

print(a[0] + x[0] + c[0])
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```AtCoder Beginner Contest
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
