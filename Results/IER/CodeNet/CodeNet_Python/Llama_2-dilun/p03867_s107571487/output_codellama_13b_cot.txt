The variable n,k are initialized to 4, 2, respectively.
The variable M is initialized to 10^9+7.
The function fs(n) calculates the prime factors of n.
The variable ds is initialized to the prime factors of n.
The variable m is initialized to the length of ds.
The variable nums is initialized to a list of None.
For each element i in the range [0, m-1], the variable val is initialized to the value of k^((ds[i]+1)/2, M).
For each element j in the range [0, i-1], if ds[i]%ds[j]==0, the variable val is decreased by nums[j].
The variable val is then initialized to the value of val%M.
The variable ans is initialized to 0.
The variable inv2 is initialized to 2^M-2, M.
For each element i in the range [0, m-1], if ds[i]%2==0, the variable ans is increased by ds[i]*nums[i]*inv2.
Otherwise, the variable ans is increased by ds[i]*nums[i].
The variable ans is then decreased by M.
The variable ans is then printed.

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
