The variable a, variable b and variable k are initialized to 8, 12 and 2, respectively.
The function gcd(x, y) calculates the greatest common divisor of x and y.
The function gcd(x, y) is called with a and b as arguments.
The function gcd(x, y) returns the greatest common divisor of x and y.
The variable ans is initialized to the greatest common divisor of a and b.
The variable cnt is initialized to 1.
The while loop iterates until cnt is less than k.
The variable ans is decreased by 1.
If a is divisible by ans and b is divisible by ans, cnt is increased by 1.
After the while loop finishes, the code prints the value of ans, which is 2.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def gcd(x, y):
    if y == 0:
        return x
    else:
        return gcd(y,x%y)

a,b,k = map(int,input().split())
ans = gcd(a,b)
cnt = 1
while cnt < k:
    ans -= 1
    if a % ans == 0 and b % ans == 0:
        cnt += 1
print(ans)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```8 12 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
