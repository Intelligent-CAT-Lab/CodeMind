The variable N and variable K are initialized to 3 and 2, respectively.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the answer.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 3.
For each number a in this range, it checks if 2 * a % K is not equal to 0. If it is, it continues to the next number.
Otherwise, it adds (floor((N + a) / K) - ceil((a + 1) / K) + 1) ** 2 to ans.
The condition is met when a is 1, 2 or 3.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 1.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
from math import floor, ceil

N, K = map(int, input().split())

ans = 0
for a in range(1, N + 1):
    if 2 * a % K!= 0:
        continue
    ans += (floor((N + a) / K) - ceil((a + 1) / K) + 1) ** 2
print(ans)

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
