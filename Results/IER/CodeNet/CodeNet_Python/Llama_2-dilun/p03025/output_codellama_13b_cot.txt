The variable n, variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized to 1, 25, 25 and 50, respectively.
The variable p is initialized to 1000000007, which is 10^9 + 7.

The function fact is called to calculate the factorial of 2 * n, which is 50.
The function invfact is called to calculate the inverse factorial of 2 * n, which is 1000000007 - 2.

The function comb is called to calculate the number of combinations of a and b, where a is 2 * n and b is n.
The variable a is multiplied by 1000000007 - 2 and the variable b is multiplied by 1000000007 - 2.
The variable a is then divided by 1000000007 - 2 and the variable b is also divided by 1000000007 - 2.

The variable a is multiplied by the inverse factorial of 2 * n and the variable b is multiplied by the inverse factorial of n.
