The variable a and variable b are initialized to 2 and 1, respectively.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to a (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 2.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the number of combinations of i and 2.
The code checks if b is greater than 1, meaning it will consider numbers from 2 to 10.
For each number j in this range, it calculates the number of combinations of j and 2.
The code then adds the two numbers together and prints the result.
The condition is met when i is 2 and j is 10.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of cnt, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
a, b = map(int, input().split())
cnt = 0

# 偶数
#if a!= 0:
#    if a % 2!= 0:
#        a = a - 1

# 奇数


# 組み合わせ

def cmb(n, r):
    if r == 0 or r == n: return 1
    if r == 1: return n
    if (n, r) in nCr: return nCr[(n, r)]
    nCr[(n, r)] = cmb(n - 1, r) + cmb(n - 1, r - 1)
    return nCr[(n, r)]


#
if a > 1:
    cnt = cnt + cmb(a, 2)

if b > 1:
    cnt = cnt + cmb(b, 2)
print(cnt)

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 1
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
