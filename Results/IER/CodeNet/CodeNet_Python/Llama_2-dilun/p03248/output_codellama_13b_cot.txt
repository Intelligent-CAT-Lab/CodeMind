The code first checks if the last character of the input is 1 or the first character is 0. If it is, it prints -1 and exits.

The code then iterates through the input string from the middle to the end. For each character, it checks if the current character is the same as the character two positions before it. If it is, it prints -1 and exits.

The code then creates a new string sd, which is the input string with the last character changed to 1. It then creates a list plist, which contains the indices of all 1s in sd.

The code then iterates through the input string from the beginning to the middle. For each character, it finds the index of the character in plist and prints the index plus 1.

The output is:
```1 2
3 4
5 6
7 8
9 10
11 12
13 14
15 16
17 18

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import bisect
s = input()
if s[-1] == "1" or s[0] == "0":
    print(-1)
    exit()

for i in range((len(s) - 1) // 2):
    # print(i,len(s)- i - 2)
    if s[i]!= s[len(s) - i -2]:
        print(-1)
        exit()

sd = s[:-1] + '1'
plist = [i for i, v in enumerate(sd) if v == '1']
# print(plist)
for i,v in enumerate(s[:-1]):
    r = bisect.bisect(plist,i)
    print(i+1,plist[r] + 1)


<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1111
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
