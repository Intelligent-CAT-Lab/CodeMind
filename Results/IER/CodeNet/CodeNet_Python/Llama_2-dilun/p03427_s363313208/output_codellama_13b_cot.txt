The variable N is initialized to 100.
The code then calculates the first digit of N, which is 1.
The variable K is initialized to the length of N, which is 3.
The variable ans is initialized to 1 + 9 * (K - 1) - 1, which is 1 + 9 * 2 - 1, which is 1 + 17 - 1, which is 18.
The code then iterates through the rest of the digits in N, which are 0 and 0.
If any of the digits is not 9, the code breaks out of the loop.
If the code does not break out of the loop, it adds 1 to ans.
The code then prints the final value of ans, which is 19.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())

ans = 0
for i in range(N):
    ans += 1
print(ans)
</Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```100```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The variable N is initialized to 100.
The variable ans is initialized to 0.
The code then iterates through the range from 0 to N - 1, which is 0 to 99.
For each number i in this range, it adds 1 to ans.
The code then prints the final value of ans, which is 100.
