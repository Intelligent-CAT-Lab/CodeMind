The code first sorts the input string.
Then it groups the sorted string into groups of consecutive characters.
For example, the input string "aatt" is grouped into the following groups:
["a", "at", "t"]

The code then calculates the number of permutations for each group.
For example, the number of permutations for the group "a" is 2 (a and A), the number of permutations for the group "at" is 3 (at, ta, and tA), and the number of permutations for the group "t" is 1 (t).

The code then calculates the total number of permutations by multiplying the number of permutations for each group by the number of groups.
In this case, the total number of permutations is 2 * 3 * 1 = 6.

The code then prints the total number of permutations.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import sys
from fractions import gcd
from itertools import groupby as gb
from itertools import permutations as perm
from collections import Counter as C
from collections import defaultdict as dd
sys.setrecursionlimit(10**5)

s = input()
s = sorted(s)
g = gb(s)
l = len(s)

res = l * (l - 1) // 2 + 1
for k, v in g:
    p = len(list(v))
    res -= p * (p - 1) // 2
print(res)

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```aatt
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
