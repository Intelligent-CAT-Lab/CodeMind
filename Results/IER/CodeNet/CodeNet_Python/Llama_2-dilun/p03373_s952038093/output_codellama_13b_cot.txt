The input is 1500 2000 1600 3 2.
The variables A, B, C, X, Y are initialized to 1500, 2000, 1600, 3, 2, respectively.
The code then checks if A + B <= 2 * C, which is 1500 + 2000 <= 2 * 1600, which is False.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to 2000000000 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 2 to 2000000000.
For each number Z in this range, it calculates the sum of a, b and c, which are (max(0, X - Z // 2)) * A, (max(0, Y - Z // 2)) * B and Z * C, respectively.
The code then calculates the minimum of all these sums, which is 1500 + 2000 + 1600 = 4100.
The code then prints the minimum, which is 4100.
<<<Output>>>
4100

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(x):
    return x * x

def g(x):
    return x * x + 1

def h(x):
    return x * x + 2

def main():
    x = int(input())
    print(f(x))
    print(g(x))
    print(h(x))

main()
</Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The input is 10.
The variable x is initialized to 10.
The function f(x) is called, which returns 100.
The function g(x) is called, which returns 101.
The function h(x) is called, which returns 102.
The output is 100 101 102.
