The variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized to 7, 5 and 1, respectively.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 100 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 100.
For each number n in this range, it checks if the product of n and a is divisible by b and the remainder is equal to c.
If it is, the code prints "YES" and exits the loop.
If it is not, the code prints "NO" and continues to the next number.
After the loop finishes, the code prints "NO" because the product of n and a is not divisible by b for any number n in the range.
<<<Output>>>
NO

Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b,c=list(map(int,input().split()))
for n in range(101):
    if (a*n) % b ==c:
        print("YES")
        exit()
print("NO")

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```7 5 1
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
