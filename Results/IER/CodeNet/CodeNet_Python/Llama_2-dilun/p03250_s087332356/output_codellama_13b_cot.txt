The input is 1 5 2.
The code first splits the input into a list of strings.
Then it converts each string to an integer.
The list is sorted in ascending order.
The code then prints the product of the third element of the list multiplied by 10, the second element of the list and the first element of the list.
The output is 152.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
a=input().strip().split(" ")
b=[int(i) for i in a]

b.sort()

print(b[2]*10+b[1]+b[0])

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 5 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
