The variable S is initialized to "serval".
The variable alphabet is initialized to a list of all characters in the alphabet.
The variable hoge is initialized to a set of all characters in the string S.
The variable character is initialized to a character in the alphabet.
The variable tmp is initialized to 0.
The variable copy_s is initialized to a copy of the string S.
The variable copy_s_dash is initialized to a list of characters in the string S.
The variable ans is initialized to 10^9, which is the largest possible value.
The code enters a loop that iterates through all characters in the alphabet.
For each character, the code checks if it is not in the set hoge. If it is, the code continues to the next character.
Otherwise, the code creates a copy of the string S and removes the character from it.
The code then checks if the set of the new string is equal to the character.
If it is, the code updates the variable ans to the minimum of ans and the length of the new string minus the length of the character.
The code then checks if the character is the last character in the alphabet.
If it is, the code prints the value of ans.
