The variable r is initialized to 2.
The variable r is squared and multiplied by pi. The result is stored in the variable menseki.
The variable shuu is initialized to 2 * r * pi.
The variable shuu is printed.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import math

r = float(raw_input())

menseki = r ** 2 * math.pi
shuu = 2 * r * math.pi

print("{:.6f} {:.6f}".format(menseki, shuu))
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
