The variable n is initialized to 1900.
The code checks if n%1000 == 0. If it is, it sets ans to 0. Otherwise, it sets ans to 1000 - n%1000.
The code prints the value of ans, which is 1000.
<<<Output>>>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
n = int(input())

if n%1000 == 0:
    ans = 0
else:
    ans = 1000 - n%1000
print(ans)

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1900
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
