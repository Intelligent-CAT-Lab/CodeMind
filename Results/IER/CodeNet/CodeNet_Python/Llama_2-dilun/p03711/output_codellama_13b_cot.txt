The variable x and variable y are initialized to 1 and 3, respectively.
The code then checks if x is equal to 2 or y is equal to 2. If it is, it prints 'No'.
Otherwise, it checks if x is in the list a and y is in the list a, or x is in the list b and y is in the list b. If it is, it prints 'Yes'.
Otherwise, it prints 'No'.
<<<Output>>>
No

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def main():
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    a = [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12]
    b = [4, 6, 9, 11]
    if x == 2 or y == 2:
        print('No')
    elif (x in a and y in a) or (x in b and y in b):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
main()
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
