The variable x is initialized to 6.
The function cal(n) is called to calculate the sum of the first n natural numbers.
The variable ans is initialized to a list containing two elements, the first element is 1 and the second element is the sum of the first n natural numbers.
The variable a is initialized to 0.
The variable a is incremented by 1.
The variable tmp is initialized to the sum of the first n natural numbers divided by 2.
If tmp is greater than x, the second element of the list ans is updated to the sum of the first n natural numbers divided by 2.
If tmp is less than x, the first element of the list ans is updated to the sum of the first n natural numbers divided by 2.
If tmp is equal to x, the sum of the first n natural numbers divided by 2 is printed and the program terminates.
If the difference between the first and second elements of the list ans is 1, the first element of the list ans is printed and the program terminates.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def cal(n): return n*(n+1)//2

x=int(input())
ans=[1,cal(x)]
a=0
while 1:
    a+=1
    tmp=cal(sum(ans)//2)
    if tmp>x:
        ans[1]=sum(ans)//2
    elif tmp<x:
        ans[0]=sum(ans)//2
    elif tmp==x:
        print(sum(ans)//2)
        break
    if ans[1]-ans[0]==1:
        print(ans[1])
        break
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```6
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
