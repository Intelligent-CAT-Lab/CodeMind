The variable n is initialized to 11.
The variable cnt is initialized to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 10.
For each number k in this range, it enters another loop that iterates from 0 to n-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 10.
For each number j in this range, it checks if 4*k+7*j is equal to n. If it is, it adds 1 to cnt.
The condition is met when k is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and j is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if n is less than 4 or cnt is 0. If it is, it prints "No". Otherwise, it prints "Yes".

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
n = int(input())
cnt = 0
for k in range(n):
    for j in range(n):
        if 4*k+7*j == n:
            cnt += 1
if n < 4 or cnt == 0:
    print("No")
else:
    print("Yes")
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```11
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
