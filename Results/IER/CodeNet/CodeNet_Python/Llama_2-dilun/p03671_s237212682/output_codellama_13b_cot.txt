The variable a, b and c are initialized to 700, 600 and 780, respectively.
The code then calculates the sum of a and b, b and c, and c and a, and prints the minimum of these three values.
The sum of a and b is 1300, the sum of b and c is 1380, and the sum of c and a is 1480.
The minimum of these three values is 1300.
<<<Output>>>
1300

Consider the following code:
<Code>
a, b, c = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
print(min(a+b, b+c, c+a))
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```700 600 780
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
