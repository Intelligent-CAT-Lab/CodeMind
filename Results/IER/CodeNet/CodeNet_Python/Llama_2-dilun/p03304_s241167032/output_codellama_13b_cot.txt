The variables n, m and d are initialized to 2, 3 and 1, respectively.
The code calculates the value of ans as 2*(n-d)*(m-1)/pow(n,2).
The value of ans is 2*(2-1)*(3-1)/(2^2) = 2*(1)*(2)/4 = 1.
The code checks if d is 0. If it is, it calculates the value of ans as (m-1)/n.
The value of ans is (3-1)/2 = 2/2 = 1.
The code prints the final value of ans, which is 1.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
n,m,d=map(int,input().split())
ans=2*(n-d)*(m-1)/pow(n,2)
if d==0:
    ans=(m-1)/n
print(ans)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 3 1
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
