The variable N is initialized to 1222.
The code then prints the length of the list of numbers in N that are equal to 2.
The list is empty, so the length is 0.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = raw_input()
print len([i for i in N if i == '2'])

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1222
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
