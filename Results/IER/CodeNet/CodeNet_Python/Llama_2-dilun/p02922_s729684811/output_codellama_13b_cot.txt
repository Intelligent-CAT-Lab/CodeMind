The variable a and variable b are initialized to 4 and 10, respectively.
The variable av is initialized to a, which is 4.
The variable n is initialized to 0.
The variable num is initialized to 1.
The code enters a loop that iterates while num is less than b, which is 10.
In each iteration, the variable n is incremented by 1.
The variable num is incremented by av-1, which is 3.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the value of n, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import math

a,b = map(int, input().split())
av = a
n = 0
num = 1
while num < b:
  n += 1
  num += av-1
print(n)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4 10
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
