The variable n, m and k are initialized to 3, 2 and 1, respectively.
The function cmb(n, r, mod) calculates the value of the combination of r elements from n elements, modulo mod.
The variable mod is initialized to 998244353, which is the maximum value that can be output.
The variable N is initialized to 2 * 10^5, which is the maximum value of n.
The variable g1 is initialized to [1, 1], which is the table of the first element of the combination.
The variable g2 is initialized to [1, 1], which is the table of the second element of the combination.
The variable inverse is initialized to [0, 1], which is the table of the inverse of the second element of the combination.

The for loop iterates from 2 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 2 to 2000000.
For each number i in this range, it adds i to the table g1.
It also adds the inverse of the second element of g1 to the table inverse.
It then adds the product of the second element of g1 and the second element of inverse to the table g2.

The variable kk is initialized to n - k, which is 2 - 1 = 1.
The variable color is initialized to m * (m - 1) ^ (kk - 1) % mod, which is 2 * (2 - 1) ^ (1 - 1) % 998244353 = 2 * 1 % 998244353 = 2.
The while loop iterates from kk to n, meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 2.
For each number kk in this range, it calculates the value of the combination of (n - kk) elements from n elements, modulo mod.

It then adds the product of the second element of g2 and the second element of inverse to the variable color.
It then adds the product of the second element of g2 and the value of the combination to the variable now.
