The variable x is initialized to 10.
The variable ans is initialized to 1.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to x (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 10.
For each number b in this range, the code enters a loop that iterates from 2 to x (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 2 to 10.
For each number p in this range, the code checks if b**p is less than or equal to x. If it is, it sets ans to the maximum of ans and b**p. The condition is met when b is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 100.
<<<Output>>>
100

Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())
A = list(map(int, input().split()))
B = list(map(int, input().split()))
C = list(map(int, input().split()))
D = list(map(int, input().split()))
for i in range(N):
    if A[i] == B[i] == C[i] == D[i]:
        print("YES")
    else:
        print("NO")
</Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3
1 1 1 1
1 1 1 2
1 1 2 2
2 2 2 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

The variable N is initialized to 3, which means the code will consider 3 cases.
The variables A, B, C and D are initialized to the following lists:
```
[1, 1, 1, 1]
[1, 1, 1, 2]
[1, 1, 2, 2]
```
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider all 3 cases.
For each case, the code checks if A[i], B[i], C[i] and D[i] are all equal. If they are, it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".
The condition is met when i is 0, 1 and 2.
After the loop finishes, the code prints "YES" 3 times.
<<<Output>>>
YES
YES
YES
