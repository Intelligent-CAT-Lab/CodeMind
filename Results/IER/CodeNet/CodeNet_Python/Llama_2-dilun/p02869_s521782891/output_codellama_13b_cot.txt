The variable n and variable k are initialized to 1 and 1, respectively.
The variables s1, s2, s3, s4, s5 and s6 are initialized to k, k+n-1, k+n, k+2*n-1, k+2*n, k+3*n-1, respectively.
The condition s1 + s4 <= (s5 + s6)/2 is checked.
If the condition is met, the code enters a loop that iterates from n//2+n%2 to n//2.
For each iteration, the code calculates the sum of a, b and c, where a is the sum of s1 and i*2, b is the sum of s4 and -i, and c is the sum of s5 and n//2 + i.
The code prints the sum of a, b and c.
After the loop finishes, the code enters another loop that iterates from n//2 to 0.
For each iteration, the code calculates the sum of a, b and c, where a is the sum of s1 and 1 + i*2, b is the sum of s4 and (n+1)//2 - i, and c is the sum of s5 and i.
The code prints the sum of a, b and c.
If the condition is not met, the code prints -1.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
n, k = map(int, input().split())
s1, s2, s3, s4, s5, s6 = k, k+n-1, k+n, k+2*n-1, k+2*n, k+3*n-1
if s1 + s4 <= (s5 + s6)/2:
  for i in range(n//2+n%2):
    a = s1 + i*2
    b = s4 - i
    c = s5 + n//2 + i
    print(a, b, c)
  for i in range(n//2):
    a = s1 + 1 + i*2
    b = s4 - (n+1)//2 - i
    c = s5 + i
    print(a, b, c)
else:
  print(-1)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 1
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
