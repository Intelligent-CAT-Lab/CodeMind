The function Base_10_to_n takes an integer X and an integer n as input.
It returns the string representation of X in base n.
The function is recursive, meaning it calls itself.
The function first checks if X is divisible by n. If it is, it returns the string representation of X divided by n, followed by the string representation of X modulo n.
If X is not divisible by n, it returns the string representation of X modulo n.

The function is called with N = 11 and K = 2.
The function is called with X = 11 and n = 2.
The function checks if 11 is divisible by 2. It is, so it returns the string representation of 11 divided by 2, followed by the string representation of 11 modulo 2.
The function is called with X = 5 and n = 2.
The function checks if 5 is divisible by 2. It is, so it returns the string representation of 5 divided by 2, followed by the string representation of 5 modulo 2.
The function is called with X = 1 and n = 2.
The function checks if 1 is divisible by 2. It is not, so it returns the string representation of 1 modulo 2.
