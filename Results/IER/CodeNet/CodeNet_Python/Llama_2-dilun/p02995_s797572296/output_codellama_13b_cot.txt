The variables a, b, c and d are initialized to 4, 9, 2 and 3, respectively.
The function gcd calculates the greatest common divisor of c and d, which is 1 in this case.
The variable cc is initialized to (c * d) // gcd, which is 18.
The variables mm1, mm2 and mmc are initialized to b // c, b // d and b // cc, respectively.
The variables A1 and A2 are initialized to b - (mm2 + mm1 - mmc) and a - (mm2 + mm1 - mmc), respectively.
The variable a is decremented by 1.
The variables mm1, mm2 and mmc are reinitialized to a // c, a // d and a // cc, respectively.
The variable A2 is reinitialized to a - (mm2 + mm1 - mmc).
The variable A1 is reinitialized to b - (mm2 + mm1 - mmc).
The output of the code is A1 - A2, which is 1.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import math

a,b,c,d=map(int,input().split())

def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

gcd_ = int(gcd(c,d))

cc = (c//gcd_ * d)


mm1 = b//c
mm2 = b//d
mmc = b//cc
A1 = b - (mm2 + mm1 - mmc)
# print(A1, b, mm2, mm1, mmc)

a-=1
mm1 = a//c
mm2 = a//d
mmc = a//cc
A2 = a - (mm2 + mm1 - mmc)
# print(A2, a, mm2, mm1, mmc)


print(A1 - A2)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4 9 2 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
