The variable a and variable b are initialized to 3 and 5, respectively.
The code then prints 0 if a is less than b, which is true in this case.
Otherwise, it prints 10.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b=map(int,input().split())
print(0 if a<b else 10)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 5
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
