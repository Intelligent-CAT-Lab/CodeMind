<<<Analysis>>>
The variable A and variable B are initialized to 9 and 12, respectively.
The code then calculates the sum of A and B, which is 21.
The code then calculates the remainder of 21 modulo 24, which is 3.
The code then prints the remainder, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>

[INST]
Consider the following code:
<Code>
A, B = [int(_) for _ in input().split()]

print((A + B) % 24)

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```9 12
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
