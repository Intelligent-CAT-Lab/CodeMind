The variable s and variable c are initialized to 1 and 6, respectively.
The code then prints the sum of s and ((c-s*2)//4).
The code then prints the value of c//2.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
s, c = map(int, input().split())

print(s + ((c-s*2)//4)) if s * 2 <= c else print(c//2)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 6
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
