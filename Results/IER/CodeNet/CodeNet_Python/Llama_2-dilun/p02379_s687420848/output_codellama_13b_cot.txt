The variable x1, y1, x2 and y2 are initialized to 0, 0, 1 and 1, respectively.
The code calculates the distance between the two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) using the Pythagorean theorem.
The distance is then rounded to 6 decimal places and printed.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import math
x1,y1,x2,y2 = map(float, input().split())
dist = math.sqrt((x2-x1)**2+(y2-y1)**2)
print("%.6f" % (dist))
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```0 0 1 1
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
