The variable N, variable X and variable T are initialized to 20, 12 and 6, respectively.
The code checks if N is divisible by X. If it is, it prints the result of (N//X)*T+T. If it is not, it prints the result of (N//X)*T.
The code prints 120.
<<<Output>>>
120

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
N,X,T= map(int,input().split())
if N%X!= 0:
  print((N//X)*T+T)
else:
  print((N//X)*T)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20 12 6
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
