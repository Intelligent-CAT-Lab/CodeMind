The variable n and d are initialized to 6 and 2, respectively.
The code checks if n is odd, which is true in this case.
The code then calculates the value of ans, which is 3.
The code prints the value of ans, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
n, d = map(int,input().split())
if n%(2*d+1)>0:
    ans = n//(2*d+1) +1
else:
    ans = n//(2*d+1)
print(ans)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
