The variable H and variable W are initialized to 4 and 5, respectively.
The code then checks if H or W is 1. If it is, it prints 1 and exits the program.
If the condition is not met, the code calculates the answer by dividing (H*W+1) by 2.
The answer is 10.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import sys
 
input = sys.stdin.readline
 
H, W = list(map(int,input().split()))
 
if H==1 or W==1:
    print(1)
    exit(0)

ans =int((H*W+1) // 2)
print(ans)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4 5
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
