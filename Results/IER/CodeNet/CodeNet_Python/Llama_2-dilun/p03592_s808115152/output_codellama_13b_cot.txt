The variable N, variable M and variable K are initialized to 2, 2 and 2, respectively.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 2.
For each number x in this range, it enters another loop that iterates from 1 to M (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 2.
For each number y in this range, it calculates the product of x and M, the product of y and N, and the sum of x and y.
It then checks if the sum of x and y is equal to the product of M and N. If it is, it prints "Yes" and exits the program.
After the loop finishes, the code prints "No" and exits the program.
<<<Output>>>
No

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, M = map(int, input().split())
for i in range(1, N + 1):
    for j in range(1, M + 1):
        if i * j == N:
            print("Yes")
            break
        else:
            print("No")
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
