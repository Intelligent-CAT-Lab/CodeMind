The variable a is initialized to the input string "KUPCkupcKUPC".
The variable K is initialized to the number of occurrences of the letter "K" in the string.
The variable U is initialized to the number of occurrences of the letter "U" in the string.
The variable P is initialized to the number of occurrences of the letter "P" in the string.
The variable C is initialized to the number of occurrences of the letter "C" in the string.
The variable list is initialized to a list containing the values of K, U, P and C.
The minimum value of the list is then printed.
The minimum value is 2, which is the number of occurrences of the letter "K" in the string.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
a=input()

K=a.count('K')
U=a.count('U')
P=a.count('P')
C=a.count('C')
list=[K,U,P,C]
print(min(list))


<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```KUPCkupcKUPC
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
