The variable n is initialized to 1900.
The code checks if n is divisible by 1000. If it is, it prints 0. Otherwise, it prints 1000 - n % 1000.
The code prints 1000 - 1900 % 1000, which is 1000 - 0, which is 1000.
<<<Output>>>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
n = int(input())
if n % 1000 == 0:
    print(0)
else:
    print(1000 - n % 1000)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1900
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
