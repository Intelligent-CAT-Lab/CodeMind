<<<Analysis>>>
The variable a, b and c are initialized to 5, 2 and 4, respectively.
The code then calculates the absolute difference between b and c, which is 2.
The code then checks if the absolute difference is even, which is true in this case.
The code then prints "Alice".
<<<Output>>>
Alice

Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b,c=[int(i) for i in input().split()]
if abs(b-c)%2==0:
	print("Alice")
else:
	print("Borys")
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 2 4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
