The variable n and variable m are initialized to 3 and 8, respectively.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n+1, meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 3.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the value of f, which is 2 * i + 4 * (n - i).
The code checks if f is equal to m, which is 8 in this case. If it is, it prints 'Yes' and breaks out of the loop.
The condition is met when i is 0, 1 or 2.
After the loop finishes, the code prints 'No' because the condition is not met for i = 3.
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
n, m = map(int, input().split())

for i in range(0, n+1):
    f = 2 * i + 4 * (n - i)
    if f == m:
        print('Yes')
        break
    
else:
    print('No')
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 8
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
