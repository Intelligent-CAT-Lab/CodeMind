The input is 99 98 1.
The code first initializes A, B and K to 99, 98 and 1, respectively.
The code then initializes C to [0] * n, where n is the length of A.
The code then initializes B to [0] * max(0, n - len(B)) + B, where B is the length of B.
The code then initializes C to [0] * n, where n is the length of A.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from n - 1 to 0, meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 99.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in C[i].
The code checks if A[i] - borrow >= B[i], which is 99 - 98 >= 1 in this case.
If it is, it sets C[i] to A[i] - borrow - B[i], which is 99 - 98 - 1.
The code then returns solve(C,K,i-1,0), which is solve([99 - 98 - 1], 1, 0).
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 1, meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 1.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in C[i].
The code checks if K > 0, which is true in this case.
It then returns max(solve(C,K-1,i-1,0),solve(C,K,i-1,1)), which is max(solve([99 - 98 - 1], 0, 0, 0), solve([99 - 98 - 1], 1, 0, 1)).
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 1, meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 1.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in C[i].
The code checks if K > 0, which is false in this case.
It then returns solve(C,K,i-1,1), which is solve([99 - 98 - 1], 1, 0, 1).
The code then returns solve(C,K,n-1,0), which is solve([99 - 98 - 1], 1, 0, 0).
The code then prints the final value of solve(C,K,n-1,0), which is 9.
