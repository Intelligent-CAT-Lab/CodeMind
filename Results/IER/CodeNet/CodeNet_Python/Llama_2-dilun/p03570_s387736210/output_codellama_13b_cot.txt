The variable L is initialized to 9^9, which is 524288.
The variable dp is initialized to a dictionary with the key 0 and the value 0.
The code iterates through the input string, which is "aabxyyzz".
For each character c in the input string, it calculates the value of 1<<ord(c)-ord('a'), which is 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288.
The code then calculates the value of v, which is the sum of the values of 1<<ord(c)-ord('a') for all characters c in the input string.
The code then checks if v is in the dictionary dp. If it is, it returns the value of dp[v]. If it is not, it returns the value of L.
The code then checks if v is equal to 0. If it is, it returns the value of dp[v]+(v==0). If it is not, it returns the value of dp[v].
The code then prints the value of dp[v]+(v==0).

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import itertools
L=9**9
dp={0:0}
for v in itertools.accumulate(map(lambda c:1<<ord(c)-ord('a'),input()),lambda a,b:a^b):
	dp[v]=min(dp.get(v,L),min(dp.get(v^1<<i, L)for i in range(26))+1)
print(dp[v]+(v==0))
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```aabxyyzz
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
