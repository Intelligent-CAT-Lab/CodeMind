The variable a, b and c are initialized to 3, 4 and 5, respectively.
The code then creates a list with the three numbers.
The list is sorted in ascending order.
The code then calculates the product of the first two numbers and divides it by 2.
The output is 12.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b,c=map(int,input().split())
list=[a,b,c]
list.sort()
print(int(list[0]*list[1]/2))
</Code>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 4 5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
