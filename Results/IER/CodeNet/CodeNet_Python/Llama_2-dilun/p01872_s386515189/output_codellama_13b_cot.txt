The input is ```12345678901```
The function CheckDisit() takes the input a as a list of 11 characters.
The function then calculates the sum of the first 4 characters multiplied by (6-i) and the sum of the last 7 characters multiplied by (12-i).
The sum is then divided by 11 and the remainder is calculated.
If the remainder is 0, the function returns 0.
If the remainder is not 0, the function returns (11 - remainder).

The function then checks if the 11th character is '?'. If it is, the function returns the value of CheckDisit().
If the 11th character is not '?', the function checks if the value of CheckDisit() is equal to the 11th character.
If it is, the function returns the index of the 11th character.
If it is not, the function prints "MULTIPLE".

The output of the code is "0".

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def CheckDisit(a) :
    tmp = 0
    for i in range(11) :
        if i <= 4 :
            tmp += int(a[i]) * (6-i)
        else :
            tmp += int(a[i]) * (12-i)
    tmp = tmp % 11
    if tmp <= 1 :
        return 0
    else :
        return (11 - tmp)
        
        
m = list(input())
if m[11] == '?' :
    print(CheckDisit(m))
else :
    ans = []
    x = m.index('?')
    for i in range(10) :
        m[x] = str(i)
        if int(m[11]) == CheckDisit(m) :
            ans.append(i)
    if len(ans) == 1 :
        print(ans[0])
    else :
        print("MULTIPLE")
