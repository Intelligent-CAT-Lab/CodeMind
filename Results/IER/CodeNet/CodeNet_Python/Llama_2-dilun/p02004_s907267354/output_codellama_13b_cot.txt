The code first reads the input string S, which is "RRRRLLLLRRRR".
It then iterates through the string character by character.
If the character is "R", it increments the variable cur, which keeps track of the number of "R"s in a row.
If the character is not "R", it decrements the variable d, which keeps track of the number of "L"s in a row.
If the variable d is 0 and the variable cur is 4, it increments the variable ans, which keeps track of the number of "RRRR"s in the string.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 1.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import sys
readline = sys.stdin.readline
write = sys.stdout.write
def solve():
    S = readline().strip()
    ans = 0
    d = 0; cur = 0
    for c in S:
        if c == "R":
            if d == cur:
                cur += 1
            d = (d + 1) % 4
            if d == 0 and cur == 4:
                ans += 1
                cur = 0
        else:
            d = (d - 1) % 4
            if d == 0:
                cur = 0
    write("%d\n" % ans)
solve()

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```RRRRLLLLRRRR
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
