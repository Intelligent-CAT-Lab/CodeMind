The variable n and variable m are initialized to 1 and 6, respectively.
The code then checks if n * 2 >= m. This is equivalent to checking if 1 * 2 >= 6, which is false.
The code then checks if m - n * 2 >= 0. This is equivalent to checking if 6 - 1 * 2 >= 0, which is true.
The code then prints m//2, which is 3.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
n, m = [int(item) for item in input().split()]
# Enough s
if n * 2 >= m:
    print(m//2)
# Enough m 
else:
    amari = m - n*2
    print(amari//4 + n)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 6
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
