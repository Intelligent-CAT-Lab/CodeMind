<<<Analysis>>>
The variable a, b and c are initialized to 10, 30 and 20, respectively.
The code checks if a is equal to b + c, which is 40.
If it is, it prints 'Yes'.
The code then checks if a + b is equal to c, which is 50.
If it is, it prints 'Yes'.
The code then checks if a + c is equal to b, which is 30.
If it is, it prints 'Yes'.
Since none of the conditions are met, the code prints 'No'.
<<<Output>>>
No

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
a, b, c = map(int, input().split())

if a == b + c:
    print('Yes')
elif a + b == c:
    print('Yes')
elif a + c == b:
    print('Yes')
else:
    print('No')
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10 30 20
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
