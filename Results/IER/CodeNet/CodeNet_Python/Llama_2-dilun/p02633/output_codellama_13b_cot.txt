The variable x is initialized to 90.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 10^5 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 1000000.
For each number i in this range, it checks if 360 * i % x == 0. If it is, it prints 360 * i // x and breaks out of the loop.
The condition is met when i is 360000, 720000, 1080000, 1440000, 1800000, 2160000, 2520000, 2880000, 3240000, 3600000.
After the loop finishes, the code prints nothing.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
x = int(input())

for i in range(1, 10**5):
    if 360 * i % x == 0:
        print(360 * i // x)
        break
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```90
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
