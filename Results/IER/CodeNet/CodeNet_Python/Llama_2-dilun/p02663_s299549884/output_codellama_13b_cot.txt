The variable h1, m1, h2, m2, k are initialized to 10, 0, 15, 0, 30, respectively.
The function solve is called with the test case number t.
The function solve then calculates the difference between the two times r1 and r2, and the difference between the two times r1 and r2 is max(0, r2 - r1 - k).
The function solve then prints the maximum value.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import sys

from  collections import defaultdict

# sys.stdin = open('input.txt', 'r')
# sys.stdout = open('output.txt', 'w')

def solve(test):
	h1, m1, h2, m2, k = map(int, input().split())
	r1 = h1 * 60 + m1
	r2 = h2 * 60 + m2
	ans = max(0, r2 - r1 - k)
	print(ans)

if __name__ == "__main__":

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10 0 15 0 30
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
