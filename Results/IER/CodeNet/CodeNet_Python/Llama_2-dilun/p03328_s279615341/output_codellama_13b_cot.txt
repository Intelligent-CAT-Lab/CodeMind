The variable a and variable b are initialized to 8 and 13, respectively.
The variable lis is initialized to a list of 0s with length 1000.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 1000 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 1000.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the value of lis[i] by multiplying i+2 and i+1 and then dividing the result by 2.
The code checks if i is greater than 1. If it is, it checks if the difference between b and a is equal to the difference between lis[i] and lis[i-1]. If it is, it prints the value of lis[i] minus b.
The condition is met when i is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100.
The code then prints the value of lis[100] minus b, which is 13-1000, which is -987.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b=map(int,input().split())
lis=[0]*1000
for i in range(1000):
    lis[i]=(i+2)*(i+1)//2
    if i>=1:
        if b-a==lis[i]-lis[i-1]:
            print(lis[i]-b)
            break
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10 13
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
