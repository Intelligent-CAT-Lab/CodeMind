The variable total is initialized to 1024.
The variable num_500 is initialized to the quotient of total divided by 500.
The variable remain is initialized to the remainder of total divided by 500.
The variable num_5 is initialized to the quotient of remain divided by 5.
The code prints the sum of num_500 * 1000 + num_5 * 5.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())

A = [0]*N

for i in range(N):
    A[i] = int(input())

for i in range(N):
    for j in range(N):
        if A[i] == A[j]:
            A[i] = 0

for i in range(N):
    print(A[i])

</Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3
1 2 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The variable N is initialized to 3.
The variable A is initialized to a list of 0s with length N.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 2.
For each number i in this range, it stores the input number in A[i].
The code then enters another loop that iterates from 0 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 2.
For each number i in this range, it iterates from 0 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 2.
For each number j in this range, it checks if A[i] is equal to A[j]. If it is, it sets A[i] to 0.
The code then prints the values of A[i] for each i in the range 0 to N (inclusive), meaning it will print 0, 0 and 1.
