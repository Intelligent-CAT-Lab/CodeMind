The variable n and variable x are initialized to 4 and 4, respectively.
The function solve() is called.
The function solve() checks if x is 1 or 2 * n - 1. If it is, it prints "No" and returns.
If x is not 1 or 2 * n - 1, it initializes a list a with None for all elements except for the elements at indices m, m - 1 and m + 1.
The variable m is calculated as (2 * n - 1) // 2, which is 2 in this case.
The elements at indices m, m - 1 and m + 1 are initialized to x, x - 1 and x + 1, respectively.
The variable y is initialized to 1.
The variable y is set to x + 2 if it is equal to x - 1, x or x + 1.
The elements at indices not equal to m - 1, m and m + 1 are initialized to y.
The variable y is incremented by 1.
The function solve() prints "Yes" and prints the elements of a, separated by a newline.
The output is:
```Yes
1
2
3
4
```

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4 4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
