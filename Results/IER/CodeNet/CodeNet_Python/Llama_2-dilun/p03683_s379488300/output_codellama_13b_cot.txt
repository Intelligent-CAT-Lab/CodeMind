The variable n and variable m are initialized to 2 and 2, respectively.
The absolute value of n - m is calculated, which is 0.
If the absolute value of n - m is greater than 1, the code prints 0.
Otherwise, the code calculates the factorial of n and m, and multiplies them.
The result is then divided by 2 and the remainder is calculated.
The remainder is then calculated using the modulo operator.
The code prints the result.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
from math import factorial
n, m = map(int, input().split())
mod = 10 ** 9 + 7
if abs(n - m) > 1:
    print(0)
else:
    if (n + m) % 2 == 0:
        ans = factorial(n) * factorial(m) * 2 % mod
    else:
        ans = factorial(n) * factorial(m) % mod
    print(ans)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
