The variable n is initialized to 119.
The code then replaces all 1s with x and all 9s with 1.
The code then replaces all x with 9.
The final output is 119119.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
n=str(input())
print(n.replace("1","x").replace("9","1").replace("x","9"))
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```119
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
