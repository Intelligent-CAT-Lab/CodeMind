The variable n is initialized to the input string.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to len(n) (inclusive), meaning it will consider each character in the input string.
For each character i in this range, it adds the character to ans.
The code checks if ans is divisible by 9. If it is, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
The condition is met when the input is 123456789.
<<<Output>>>
Yes

Consider the following code:
<Code>
n = list(input())
ans=0
for i in range(len(n)):
    ans+=int(n[i])

if ans%9==0:
    print('Yes')
else:
    print('No')
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```123456789
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
