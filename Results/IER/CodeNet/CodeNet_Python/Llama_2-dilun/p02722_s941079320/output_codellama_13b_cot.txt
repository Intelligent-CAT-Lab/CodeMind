The variable N is initialized to 6.
The function make_divisors(n) is called to calculate the divisors of n.
The function takes n as an argument and returns a list of divisors.
The list is sorted in ascending order.
The variable Nod is initialized to the list of divisors of N-1.
The variable divs is initialized to the list of divisors of N.

The for loop iterates through the list of divisors of N.
For each divisor d in the list, the variable c is initialized to N.
The while loop checks if d is 1. If it is, the loop breaks.
If d is not 1, the code checks if c is divisible by d. If it is, the code breaks.
If c is not divisible by d, the code checks if c is divisible by d//d. If it is, the code breaks.
If c is not divisible by d//d, the code checks if c is divisible by d. If it is, the code breaks.
If c is not divisible by d, the code checks if c is divisible by d//d. If it is, the code breaks.
If c is not divisible by d//d, the code checks if c is divisible by d. If it is, the code breaks.
If c is not divisible by d, the code checks if c is divisible by d//d. If it is, the code breaks.
If c is not divisible by d//d, the code checks if c is divisible by d. If it is, the code breaks.
