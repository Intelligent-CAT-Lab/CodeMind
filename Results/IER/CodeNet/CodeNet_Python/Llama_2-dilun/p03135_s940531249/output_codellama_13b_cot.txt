The variable T and variable X are initialized to 8 and 3, respectively.
The code then calls the function solve, which prints the value of T / X and returns.

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10 5
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
