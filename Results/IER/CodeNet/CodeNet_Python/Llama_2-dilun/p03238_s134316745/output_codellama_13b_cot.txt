The variable N is initialized to 1.
The code checks if N is equal to 1. If it is, it prints 'Hello World'.
Otherwise, it asks for two numbers A and B.
It then calculates A + B and prints the result.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>

N = int(input())

if N == 1:
    print('Hello World')


else:
    A = int(input())
    B = int(input())
    A_B = A + B
    print(A_B)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
