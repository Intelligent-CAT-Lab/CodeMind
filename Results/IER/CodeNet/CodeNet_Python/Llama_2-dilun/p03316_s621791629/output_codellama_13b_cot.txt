The variable n is initialized to 12.
The variable s is initialized to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the length of n, which is 2 in this case.
For each character in n, the code converts it to an integer and adds it to s.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if the remainder of n divided by s is 0. If it is, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
The code prints "Yes" because 12%2 == 0.
<<<Output>>>
Yes

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
n = input()
s = 0
for i in range(len(n)) :
  s += int(n[i])
if int(n)%s == 0 :
  print('Yes')
else :
  print('No')

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```12
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
