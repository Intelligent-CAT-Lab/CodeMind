The variable b is initialized to 'A'.
The code checks if b is equal to 'A'. If it is, it prints 'T'.
The code checks if b is equal to 'T'. If it is, it prints 'A'.
The code checks if b is equal to 'G'. If it is, it prints 'C'.
The code checks if b is not equal to 'A', 'T' or 'G'. If it is, it prints 'G'.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
b=input()
if b=='A':
  print('T')
elif b=='T':
  print('A')
elif b=='G':
  print('C')
else:
  print('G')
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```T
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
