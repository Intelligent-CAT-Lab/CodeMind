The variable n is initialized to 2.
The code then prints the value of n+n^2+n^3, which is 2+4+8, which is 14.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
n=int(input())
print(int(n+n**2+n**3))
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
