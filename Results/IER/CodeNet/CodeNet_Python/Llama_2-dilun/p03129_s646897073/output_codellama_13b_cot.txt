The variable N and variable K are initialized to 3 and 2, respectively.
The code then checks if N/2 >= K, which is true.
The code then prints "YES".
<<<Output>>>
YES

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
a = list(map(int,input().split()))
N,K = a[0]-1,a[1]-1

if N/2 >= K:
    print("YES")
else:
    print("NO")
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
