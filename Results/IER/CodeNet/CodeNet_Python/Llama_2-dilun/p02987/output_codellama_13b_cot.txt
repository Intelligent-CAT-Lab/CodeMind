The variable a, b, c and d are initialized to ASSA, respectively.
The code checks if a, b, c and d are equal to each other.
If they are, the flag is set to 1.
If they are not, the flag is set to 0.
The code then checks if a, b, c and d are equal to each other.
If they are, the flag is set to 0.
If they are not, the flag is set to 1.
The code then prints "Yes" if the flag is 1, and "No" if the flag is 0.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b,c,d = input()
flag = 0
if(a==b and c==d):
    flag = 1
elif(a==c and b==d):
    flag = 1
elif(a==d and b==c):
    flag = 1
else:
    flag = 0
if(a==b and a==c and a==d):
    flag = 0
if(flag==1):
    print("Yes")
else:
    print("No")
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```ASSA
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
