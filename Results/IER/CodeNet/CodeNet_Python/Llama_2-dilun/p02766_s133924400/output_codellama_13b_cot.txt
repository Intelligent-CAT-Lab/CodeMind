The variable n and variable k are initialized to 11 and 2, respectively.
The code then enters a while loop that iterates while n is greater than 0.
The code then adds 1 to the variable res, which is initialized to 0.
The code then divides n by k, which is 2 in this case.
The code then prints the value of res, which is 5.
<<<Output>>>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
n, k = (int(i) for i in input().split());

res = 0;

while n > 0:
    res += 1;
    n //= k;

print(res);

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```11 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
