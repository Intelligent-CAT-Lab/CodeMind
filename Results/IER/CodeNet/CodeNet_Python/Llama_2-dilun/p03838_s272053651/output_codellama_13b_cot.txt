The variable x and variable y are initialized to 10 and 20, respectively.
The code checks if x*y is positive or not. If it is, it sets k to 2. Otherwise, it sets k to 1.
The code checks if x and y are equal. If they are, it prints 0.
The code checks if x is 0 and y is negative. If it is, it prints abs(y)+1.

The code checks if x is less than y. If it is, it checks if k is 2 or x is 0. If either of these conditions is true, it prints y-x.
If y is 0, it checks if k is 2 or x is 0. If either of these conditions is true, it prints abs(x).
If neither of these conditions is true, it prints abs(abs(y)-abs(x))+k.

The code checks if y is less than x. If it is, it checks if k is 2 or y is 0. If either of these conditions is true, it prints abs(abs(y)-abs(x))+k.
If x is 0, it checks if k is 2 or y is 0. If either of these conditions is true, it prints abs(x).
If neither of these conditions is true, it prints abs(abs(y)-abs(x))+k.

The code checks if x is less than 0 and y is 0. If it is, it prints abs(x).
If neither of these conditions is true, it prints abs(abs(y)-abs(x))+k.

The code checks if y is less than 0 and x is 0. If it is, it prints abs(x).
If neither of these conditions is true, it prints abs(abs(y)-abs(x))+k.

The code checks if x is less than 0 and y is 0. If it is, it prints abs(x).
If neither of these conditions is true, it prints abs(abs(y)-abs(x))+k.

The code checks if y is less than 0 and x is 0. If it is, it prints abs(x).
If neither of these conditions is true, it prints abs(abs(y)-abs(x))+k.

The code checks if x is less than 0 and y is 0. If it is, it prints abs(x).
If neither of these conditions is true, it prints abs(abs(y)-abs(x))+k.

The code checks if y is less than 0 and x is 0. If it is, it prints abs(x).
If neither of these conditions is true, it prints abs(abs(y)-abs(x))+k.

The code checks if x is less than 0 and y is 0. If it is, it prints abs(x).
If neither of these conditions is true, it prints abs(abs(y)-abs(x))+k.

The code checks if y is less than 0 and x is 0. If it is, it prints abs(x).
If neither of these conditions is true, it prints abs(abs(y)-abs(x))+k.

The code checks if x is less than 0 and y is 0. If it is, it prints abs(x).
If neither of these conditions is true, it prints abs(abs(y)-abs(x))+k.

The code checks if y is less than 0 and x is 0. If it is, it prints abs(x).
If neither of these conditions is true, it prints abs(abs(y)-abs(x))+k.

The code checks if x is less than 0 and y is 0. If it is, it prints abs(x).
If neither of these conditions is true, it prints abs(abs(y)-abs(x))+k.

The code checks if y is less than 0 and x is 0. If it is, it prints abs(x).
If neither of these conditions is true, it prints abs(abs(y)-abs(x))+k.

The code checks if x is less than 0 and y is 0. If it is, it prints abs(x).
If neither of these conditions is true, it prints abs(abs(y)-abs(x))+k.
