The variable a, b, c and k are initialized to 2, 1, 1 and 3, respectively.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the final answer.
The code first calculates the minimum of a and k, which is 1.
It then adds 1 to ans.
The code then subtracts 1 from k, which is now 2.
The code then calculates the minimum of b and k, which is 1.
It then adds 0 to ans.
The code then subtracts 1 from k, which is now 1.
The code then calculates the minimum of c and k, which is 1.
It then adds (-1) to ans.
The code then subtracts 1 from k, which is now 0.
The code then prints the final value of ans, which is 1.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
a, b, c, k = map(int, input().split())
ans = 0
ans += 1*( min(a, k) )
k -= min(a, k)
ans += 0*( min(b, k) )
k -= min(b, k)
ans += (-1)*( min(c, k) )
k -= min(c, k)
print(ans)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 1 1 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
