The variable s is initialized to the input string "fAIR, LATER, OCCASIONALLY CLOUDY.".
The code then calls the method swapcase() on the variable s, which returns the string "FAIR, LATER, OCCASIONALLY CLOUDY.".
The code then prints the string "FAIR, LATER, OCCASIONALLY CLOUDY.".
<<<Output>>>
FAIR, LATER, OCCASIONALLY CLOUDY.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
s = input()
print(s.split())

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```fAIR, LATER, OCCASIONALLY CLOUDY.
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The variable s is initialized to the input string "fAIR, LATER, OCCASIONALLY CLOUDY.".
The code then calls the method split() on the variable s, which returns a list of strings.
The code then prints the list of strings, which is ["fAIR", "LATER", "OCCASIONALLY CLOUDY."].
<<<Output>>>
['fAIR', 'LATER', 'OCCASIONALLY CLOUDY.']
