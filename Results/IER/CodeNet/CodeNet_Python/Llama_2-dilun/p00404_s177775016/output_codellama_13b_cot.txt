The variable x, variable y and variable cnt are initialized to 0, 0 and 1, respectively.
The variable xy and variable xy2 are initialized to [0,0] and [1,1], respectively.
The code checks if the condition xy[0] <= x < xy2[0] and xy[1] <= y < xy2[1] is met.
If it is, it prints the value of cnt and exits the program.
The code then enters a while loop that iterates indefinitely.
Inside the loop, the code checks if cnt is divisible by 4.
If it is, it updates the value of xy2.
If cnt is divisible by 4, it means that the value of cnt is 1, 2, 3 or 4.
If cnt is 1, it means that the value of xy2[0] is updated to xy2[1] - xy[1].
If cnt is 2, it means that the value of xy2[1] is updated to xy2[0] - xy[0].
If cnt is 3, it means that the value of xy[0] is updated to xy2[1] - xy[1].
If cnt is 4, it means that the value of xy[1] is updated to xy2[0] - xy[0].
The code then checks if the condition xy[0] <= x < xy2[0] and xy[1] <= y < xy2[1] is met.
If it is, it prints the value of cnt % 3 + 1 and exits the program.
If it is not, it increments the value of cnt and continues to check the condition.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import sys
x,y = list(map(int, input().split()))

cnt = 1
xy = [0,0]
xy2 = [1,1]
if xy[0] <= x < xy2[0] and xy[1] <= y < xy2[1]:
    print(cnt)
    sys.exit(0)
while 1:
    if cnt % 4 == 1:
        xy2[0] += xy2[1] - xy[1]
    elif cnt % 4 == 2:
        xy2[1] += xy2[0] - xy[0] 
    elif cnt % 4 == 3:
        xy[0] -= xy2[1] - xy[1]
    elif cnt % 4 == 0:
        xy[1] -= xy2[0] - xy[0]
    if xy[0] <= x < xy2[0] and xy[1] <= y < xy2[1]:
        print((cnt % 3) + 1)
        break
    cnt += 1

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```0 0
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
