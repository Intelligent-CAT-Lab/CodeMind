The variable tableA and variable tableB are initialized to the values returned by the function make_table().
The code then enters a while loop that will continue until the input is empty.
The code tries to read the input as a string. If the input is empty, the code will break out of the loop.
Otherwise, the code will split the input into a list of characters.
For each character in the list, the code will check if it is in tableA. If it is, the code will add it to the string ans.
The code will then check if the character is in tableB. If it is, the code will add the corresponding value to the string tmp.
The code will then check if tmp is empty. If it is, the code will add the character to ans.
The code will then check if ans is empty. If it is, the code will add the character to tmp.
