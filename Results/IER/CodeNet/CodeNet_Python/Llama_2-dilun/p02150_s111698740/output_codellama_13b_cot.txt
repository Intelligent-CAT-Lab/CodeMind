The variable a, variable b and variable x are initialized to 3, 1 and 5, respectively.
The code then prints the output of the code, which is 1.
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
#!/usr/bin/env python3
a, b, x = map(int, input().split())
print((x + max(x - b, 0) // (a - b) * b) % 1000000007)


<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 1 5
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
