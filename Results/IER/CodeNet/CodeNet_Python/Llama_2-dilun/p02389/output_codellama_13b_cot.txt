The variable a and variable b are initialized to 3 and 5, respectively.
The code prints the product of a and b, which is 15.
The code then prints the sum of a and b, which is 8.
The code then prints the product of the sum of a and b and 2, which is 16.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b = map(int, input().split())
print(a*b, (a+b)*2)

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 5
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
