The variable a is initialized to 1.
The code checks if a is divisible by 7. If it is, it prints the corresponding day of the week.
The code prints "fri" because 1 is divisible by 7.
<<<Output>>>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
a=int(input())
if a%7==1:
    print("fri")
if a%7==2:
    print("sat")
if a%7==3:
    print("sun")
if a%7==4:
    print("mon")
if a%7==5:
    print("tue")
if a%7==6:
    print("wed")
if a%7==0:
    print("thu")

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
