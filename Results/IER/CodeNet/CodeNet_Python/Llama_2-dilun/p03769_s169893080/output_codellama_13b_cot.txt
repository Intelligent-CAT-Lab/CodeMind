The variable n is initialized to 7.
The variable n is converted to a binary string.
The variable ra is initialized to an empty list.
The variable rb is initialized to an empty list.
The variable c is initialized to 1.
The variable i is initialized to the first character of the binary string of n.
The variable ra is appended with the value of c.
The variable rb is appended with the value of c.
The variable c is incremented by 1.
If the value of i is 1, the variable ra is appended with the value of c.
The variable rb is appended with the value of c.
The variable c is incremented by 1.
The variable res is initialized to the concatenation of the values of ra and rb.
The length of res is printed.
The values of res are joined by spaces and printed.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
n = int(raw_input())
a = []
for i in range(n):
    a.append(raw_input())
print''.join(a)

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3
a
b
c
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
