The variable n is initialized to 5.
If n is equal to 1, the code prints 1.
Otherwise, it initializes the list ans to [2,1].
Then it iterates from 1 to n-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 4.
For each number i in this range, it appends the sum of the previous two elements of the list ans to the list ans.
Finally, it prints the last element of the list ans, which is 10.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
n = int(input())
if n == 1:
    print(1)
else:
    ans = [2,1]
    for i in range(n-1):
        ans.append(ans[-1]+ans[-2])
    print(ans[-1])
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
