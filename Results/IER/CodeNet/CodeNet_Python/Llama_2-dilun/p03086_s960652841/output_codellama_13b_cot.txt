The code first splits the input string S into a list of substrings using the regular expression [^ATGC].
The code then calculates the maximum length of the substrings in the list.
The code prints the maximum length.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import re

S = input()

splitted = re.split("[^ATGC]", S)

max_length = 0
for inv in splitted:
    max_length = max(max_length, len(inv))

print(max_length)

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```ATCODER
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
