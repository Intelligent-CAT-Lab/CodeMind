The variable a is initialized to 2.
The code then prints the sum of a, a^2 and a^3, which is 2 + 4 + 8 = 14.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
a = int(input())
print(a + a ** 2 + a ** 3)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
