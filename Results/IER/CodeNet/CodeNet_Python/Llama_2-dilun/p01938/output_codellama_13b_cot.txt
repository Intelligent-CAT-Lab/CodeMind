The variable S is initialized to "AIZU".
The variable alpha is initialized to "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ".
The variable Now is initialized to 0.
The variable ans is initialized to 0.
The variable Next is initialized to the index of the first occurrence of the character s in the string alpha.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the characters in S.
For each character s in S, it calculates the index of s in the string alpha using the find() method and stores it in Next.
If the current index Now is less than the index Next, the code does nothing. Otherwise, it adds 1 to the variable ans.
The code then updates the variable Now to the index Next.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 3.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
S = input()

alpha = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"
Now = 0
ans = 0
for s in S:
    Next = alpha.find(s)
    # print(s, Now, Next)

    if(Now < Next):
        pass
    else:
        ans += 1
    Now = Next
print(ans)

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```AIZU
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
