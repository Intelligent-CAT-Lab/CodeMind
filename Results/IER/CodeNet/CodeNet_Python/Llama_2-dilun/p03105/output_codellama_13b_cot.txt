The variable a, b and c are initialized to 2, 11 and 4, respectively.
The code checks if a*c is less than b.
If it is, it prints c.
If it is not, it prints b//a.
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b,c=map(int,input().split())
if a*c<b:
    print(c)
else:
    print(b//a)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 11 4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
