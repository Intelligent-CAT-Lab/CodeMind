The variable n, variable a and variable b are initialized to 5, 2 and 4, respectively.
The code then prints the string "Alice" if the difference between a and b is even, and prints the string "Borys" otherwise.
The difference between a and b is 2, which is even, so the code prints "Alice".
<<<Output>>>
Alice

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
n,a,b=map(int,input().split())
print('Alice' if (b-a)%2==0 else 'Borys')
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 2 4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
