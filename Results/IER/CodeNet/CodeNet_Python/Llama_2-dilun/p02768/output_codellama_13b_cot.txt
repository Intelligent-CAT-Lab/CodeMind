The variable n, variable a and variable b are initialized to 4, 1 and 3, respectively.
The variable MOD is initialized to 10^9 + 7, which is 1000000007.

The function modcomb takes three parameters: n, a and mod. It calculates the number of combinations of a given set of numbers, where the number of combinations is the product of the number of ways to choose the first number, the number of ways to choose the second number, and so on. The function returns the number of combinations modulo mod.

The variable X is initialized to 2^n - 1, which is 16 in this case.
The variable A is initialized to the number of combinations of n numbers, where the first number is 1 and the rest are 0. The variable B is initialized to the number of combinations of n numbers, where the first number is 3 and the rest are 0.

The variable ans is initialized to the difference between X and A - B, which is 15 in this case. The variable ans is then calculated modulo MOD, which is 1000000007 in this case.

The function then prints the value of ans, which is 15.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
n,a,b = map(int, input().split())
MOD = 10**9 + 7

def modcomb(n,a,mod):
    cnt = 1
    for i in range(a):
        cnt *= (n-i)
        cnt *= pow(i+1,mod-2,mod)
        cnt %= mod
    # print(cnt)
    return cnt
    


X = pow(2,n,MOD)-1
A = modcomb(n,a,MOD)
B = modcomb(n,b,MOD)
ans = (X-A-B)%MOD
print(ans)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4 1 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
