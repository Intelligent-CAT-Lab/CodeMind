The code first creates a dictionary D, which will be used to store the frequency of each character in the input string.
The code then creates a list pool, which will be used to store the nodes of the heap.
For each character in the input string, the code calculates its frequency and adds it to the dictionary D.
The code then creates a Node object for each character in the input string, with the frequency as its value.
The code then initializes the pool with the Node objects.
The code then enters a loop that iterates through the pool.
For each Node object in the pool, the code checks if its value is greater than the value of its left child.
If it is, the code swaps the left child and the Node object.
The code then checks if the value of the Node object is greater than the value of its right child.
If it is, the code swaps the right child and the Node object.
The code then checks if the value of the Node object is greater than the sum of the values of its left child and right child.
If it is, the code adds the Node object to the pool.
The code then checks if the pool is empty.
If it is, the code prints the sum of the frequencies of each character in the input string.
