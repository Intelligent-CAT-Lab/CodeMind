The variable s is initialized to the input string "+-++".
The variable ans is initialized to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the characters in s.
For each character i in s, the code checks if i is '+'. If it is, it increments ans by 1.
The code then checks if i is '-'. If it is, it decrements ans by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 0.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
s = input()

ans = 0
for i in s:
    if  i == '+':ans = ans +1
    if  i == '-':ans = ans -1

print(ans)

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```+-++
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
