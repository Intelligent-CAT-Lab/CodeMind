The variable s is initialized to "hihi".
The variable cnt is initialized to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the characters in s.
For each character i in s, the code checks if i is even and s[i] is 'h'. If both conditions are met, it increments cnt by 1.
The code then checks if i is odd and s[i] is 'i'. If both conditions are met, it increments cnt by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if the length of s is even and cnt is equal to the length of s.
If both conditions are met, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No

Consider the following code:
<Code>
s = input()
cnt = 0
for i in range(len(s)):
  if i % 2 == 0 and s[i] == 'h':
    cnt += 1
  elif i % 2 == 1 and s[i] == 'i':
    cnt += 1
if len(s) % 2 == 0 and cnt == len(s):
  print('Yes')
else:
  print('No')
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```hihi
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
