The variable n and variable m are initialized to 3 and 3, respectively.
The code checks if n is equal to m. Since n and m are equal, the code prints "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
n,m = map(int,input().split())

if n == m:
  print("Yes")
else:
  print("No")
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
