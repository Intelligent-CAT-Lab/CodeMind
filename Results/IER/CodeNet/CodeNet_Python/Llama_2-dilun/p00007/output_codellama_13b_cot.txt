The variable ans is initialized to 100000.
The code then enters a loop that iterates for 5 times.
For each iteration, the variable ans is multiplied by 1.05.
If the result of the multiplication is not a multiple of 1000, the code adds 1000 to ans.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 1000000000.
<<<Output>>>
1000000000

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())
for i in range(N):
    A, B = map(int, input().split())
    if A > B:
        print(A)
    else:
        print(B)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 1
3 2
4 3
5 4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The variable N is initialized to 5.
The code then enters a loop that iterates for 5 times.
For each iteration, the code reads two numbers A and B.
If A is greater than B, the code prints A.
Otherwise, it prints B.
After the loop finishes, the code prints nothing.
