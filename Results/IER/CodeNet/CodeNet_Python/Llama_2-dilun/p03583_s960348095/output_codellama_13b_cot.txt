The code first initializes N to 2.
Then it iterates from 1 to 3500 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 3499.
For each number h in this range, it iterates from 1 to 3500 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 3499.
For each number w in this range, it checks if the equation (4 * h * w - N * w - N * h) == 0 is true.
If it is, it calculates the value of n = N * h * w / (4 * h * w - N * w - N * h) and checks if it is an integer and greater than 0.
If it is, it prints the values of h, w and n.
The condition is met when h is 1, w is 1 and n is 2.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of n, which is 2.

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
