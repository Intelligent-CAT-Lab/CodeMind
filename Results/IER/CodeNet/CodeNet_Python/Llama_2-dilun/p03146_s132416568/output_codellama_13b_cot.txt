The variable s is initialized to 8.
The variable a is initialized to a list containing the number 8.
The variable elm is initialized to 8.
The code enters a loop that iterates forever.
In the loop, the variable elm is divided by 2 if it is even, and multiplied by 3 and then added by 1 if it is odd.
The code checks if elm is in the list a. If it is, the loop breaks.
The code prints the length of the list a plus 1.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
s = int(input())
a = []
a.append(s)
elm = s
while True:
  if (elm%2 == 0):
    elm = elm//2
  else:
    elm = 3*elm + 1
  if elm in a:
    break
  else:
    a.append(elm)

print(len(a)+1)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```8
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
