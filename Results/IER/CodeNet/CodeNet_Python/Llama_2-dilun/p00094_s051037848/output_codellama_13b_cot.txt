Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b=map(int,input().split())
print("{0:.6f}".format(a*b/3.305785))

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```15 25
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
