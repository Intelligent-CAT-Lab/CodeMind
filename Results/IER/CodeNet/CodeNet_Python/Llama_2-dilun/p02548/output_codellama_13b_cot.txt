The variable n is initialized to 3.
The variable cnt is initialized to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 3.
For each number a in this range, it enters another loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 3.
For each number b in this range, it calculates the product of a and b, and checks if the product is greater than or equal to n. If it is, the inner loop breaks.
The code then adds 1 to cnt.
After the inner loop finishes, the code prints the final value of cnt, which is 2.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
n = int(input())

cnt = 0
for a in range(1, n):
    for b in range(1, n):
        x = a * b
        if x >= n:
            break
        cnt += 1

print(cnt)

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
