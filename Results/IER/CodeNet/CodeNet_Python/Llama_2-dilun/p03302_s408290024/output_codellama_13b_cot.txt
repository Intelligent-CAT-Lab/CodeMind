The variable N is initialized to 4 11.
The variable a is initialized to 4 and the variable b is initialized to 11.
The code checks if a + b== 15. Since 4 + 11 == 15, the code prints '+'.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = input().split(" ")
a = int(N[0])
b = int(N[1])
if a + b== 15:
    print('+')
elif a * b== 15:
    print('*')
else:
    print('x')

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4 11
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
