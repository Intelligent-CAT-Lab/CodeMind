    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import math
a,b=map(int,input().split())
print(4/3*b**3*math.pi)

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
