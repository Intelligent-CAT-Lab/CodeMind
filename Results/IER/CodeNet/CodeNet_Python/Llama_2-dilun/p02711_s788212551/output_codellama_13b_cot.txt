The variable n is initialized to 117.
The code checks if "7" is in n.
Since 117 contains 7, the code prints "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
n=input()
if "7" in n:
  print("Yes")
else:
  print("No")
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```117
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
