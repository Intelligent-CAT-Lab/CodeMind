The variable a and variable b are initialized to 2 and 3, respectively.
The code then prints the value of a*b//gcd(a, b), which is 2/1.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import fractions
a, b = map(int, input().split())
print(a*b//fractions.gcd(a, b))
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
