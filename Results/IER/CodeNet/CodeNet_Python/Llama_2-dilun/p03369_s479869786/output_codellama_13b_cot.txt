The variable s is initialized to the input string "oxo".
The variable ans is initialized to 700.
The code then iterates over the characters in s.
For each character i in s, if i is 'o', ans is increased by 100.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 800.
<<<Output>>>
800

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
# A
s = str(input())

ans = 700
for i in list(s):
    if i == 'o':
        ans += 100
print(ans)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```oxo
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
