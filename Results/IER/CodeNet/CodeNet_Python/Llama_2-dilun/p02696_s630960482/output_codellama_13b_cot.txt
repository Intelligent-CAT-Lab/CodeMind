The variable A, B and N are initialized to 5, 7 and 4, respectively.
The code checks if N is greater than or equal to B. If it is, it sets x to B - 1.
Otherwise, it sets x to N.

The code then calculates the value of ans, which is the difference between the product of A and x divided by B, and the product of A and the quotient of x divided by B.

The code prints the value of ans, which is 1 in this case.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())

if N >= B:
    x = B - 1
    ans = ((A * x) // B) - (A * (x // B))
else:
    x = N
    ans = ((A * x) // B) - (A * (x // B))


print(ans)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 7 4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
