The input is 1222.
The code first splits the input into 4 parts, each of which is a single digit.
The code then checks if the sum of the 4 digits is equal to 7.
If it is, the code prints the 4 digits and a = b = c = d = 1.
If it is not, the code checks if the sum of the 4 digits is equal to 7 minus 1.
If it is, the code prints the 4 digits and a = b = c = d = 2.
If it is not, the code checks if the sum of the 4 digits is equal to 7 minus 2.
If it is, the code prints the 4 digits and a = b = c = d = 3.
If it is not, the code checks if the sum of the 4 digits is equal to 7 minus 3.
If it is, the code prints the 4 digits and a = b = c = d = 4.
If it is not, the code checks if the sum of the 4 digits is equal to 7 minus 4.
If it is, the code prints the 4 digits and a = b = c = d = 5.
If it is not, the code checks if the sum of the 4 digits is equal to 7 minus 5.
If it is, the code prints the 4 digits and a = b = c = d = 6.
If it is not, the code checks if the sum of the 4 digits is equal to 7 minus 6.
If it is, the code prints the 4 digits and a = b = c = d = 7.
If it is not, the code checks if the sum of the 4 digits is equal to 7 minus 7.
If it is, the code prints the 4 digits and a = b = c = d = 8.
If it is not, the code checks if the sum of the 4 digits is equal to 7 minus 8.
If it is, the code prints the 4 digits and a = b = c = d = 9.
If it is not, the code checks if the sum of the 4 digits is equal to 7 minus 9.
If it is, the code prints the 4 digits and a = b = c = d = 10.
If it is not, the code checks if the sum of the 4 digits is equal to 7 minus 10.
If it is, the code prints the 4 digits and a = b = c = d = 11.
If it is not, the code checks if the sum of the 4 digits is equal to 7 minus 11.
If it is, the code prints the 4 digits and a = b = c = d = 12.
If it is not, the code checks if the sum of the 4 digits is equal to 7 minus 12.
If it is, the code prints the 4 digits and a = b = c = d = 13.
If it is not, the code checks if the sum of the 4 digits is equal to 7 minus 13.
If it is, the code prints the 4 digits and a = b = c = d = 14.
If it is not, the code checks if the sum of the 4 digits is equal to 7 minus 14.
If it is, the code prints the 4 digits and a = b = c = d = 15.
If it is not, the code checks if the sum of the 4 digits is equal to 7 minus 15.
If it is, the code prints the 4 digits and a = b = c = d = 16.
If it is not, the code checks if the sum of the 4 digits is equal to 7 minus 16.
If it is, the code prints the 4 digits and a = b = c = d = 17.
If it is not, the code checks if the sum of the 4 digits is equal to 7 minus 17.
If it is, the code prints the 4 digits and a = b = c = d = 18.
If it is not, the code checks if the sum of the 4 digits is equal to 7 minus 18.
If it is, the code prints the 4 digits and a = b = c = d = 19.
