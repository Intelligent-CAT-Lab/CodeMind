The code first reads the input and stores it in variables N and M.
The code then calls the function fact_table, which calculates the factorial table.
The function fact_table returns three arrays: fact, fact_inv and inv.
The array fact contains the factorial of numbers from 1 to N.
The array fact_inv contains the inverse of the factorial of numbers from 1 to N.
The array inv contains the inverse of the factorial of numbers from 1 to N.
The function main then calculates the value of x, which is the product of the factorial of numbers from 1 to N and the inverse of the factorial of numbers from N+1 to M.
The value of x is then multiplied by the product of numbers from M-N+1 to M-N+2 to M-N+3 to... to M-N+N.
The value of x is then multiplied by the product of numbers from M-N+N+1 to M-N+N+2 to M-N+N+3 to... to M-N+2N.
The value of x is then multiplied by the product of numbers from M-N+2N+1 to M-N+2N+2 to M-N+2N+3 to... to M-N+2N+N.
The value of x is then multiplied by the product of numbers from M-N+N+1 to M-N+N+2 to M-N+N+3 to... to M-N+N+N.
