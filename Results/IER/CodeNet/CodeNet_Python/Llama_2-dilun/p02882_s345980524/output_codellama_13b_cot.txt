The variable a, h and x are initialized to 2, 2 and 4, respectively.
The code calculates the value of y as 2*h/a - 2*x/a**3.
The code calculates the value of z as (h**2)*a/(2*x).
The code then calculates the value of b as x/(a**2).
The code then checks if b is greater than h/2. If it is, it prints the value of y. Otherwise, it prints the value of z.
The code prints the value of y, which is 2.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import math
a,h,x = [int(j) for j in input().split()]
# y = (h*a - x/a)*(2/a**2)
# y = a**2/(2*h*a-2*x)
y = 2*h/a - 2*x/a**3
z = (h**2)*a/(2*x)
# try:
# print(y)
b = x/(a**2)
if b>h/2:
    print(math.degrees(math.atan(y)))
else:
    print(math.degrees(math.atan(z)))
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 2 4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
