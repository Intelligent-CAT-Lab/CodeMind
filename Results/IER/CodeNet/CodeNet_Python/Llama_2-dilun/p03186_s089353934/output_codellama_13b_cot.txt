The variable A, variable B and variable C are initialized to 3, 1 and 4, respectively.
The code checks if the sum of A and B is greater than C minus 1.
If it is, it prints the sum of B and C.
If it is not, it prints the sum of B, the sum of A and B and 1.
The condition is met when A=3 and B=1.
The output is 5.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
# coding: utf-8
# Your code here!
A,B,C=map(int,input().split())

if (A+B)>C-1:
    print(B+C)
else:
    print(B+(A+B)+1)

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 1 4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
