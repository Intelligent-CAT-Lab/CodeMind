The variable k is initialized to 103.
The variable now is initialized to 100.
The variable cnt is initialized to 0.
The code enters a loop that iterates while now is less than k.
The variable now is multiplied by 1.01, which is 101% of now.
The variable now is converted to an integer.
The variable cnt is incremented by 1.
The loop finishes when now is 103.
The code prints the value of cnt, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())

A = [0]*N

for i in range(N):
    A[i] = int(input())

for i in range(N):
    for j in range(N):
        if A[i] == A[j]:
            A[i] = 0

for i in range(N):
    print(A[i])
</Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5
1 1 1 1 1
2 2 2 2 2
3 3 3 3 3
4 4 4 4 4
5 5 5 5 5
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The variable N is initialized to 5.
The variable A is initialized to an array of zeros.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to N-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 4.
For each number i in this range, it reads the value of A[i] from the input.
The code enters another loop that iterates from 0 to N-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 4.
For each number j in this range, it checks if A[i] is equal to A[j]. If it is, it sets A[i] to 0.
The code prints the value of A[i] for each i in the range 0 to 4.
