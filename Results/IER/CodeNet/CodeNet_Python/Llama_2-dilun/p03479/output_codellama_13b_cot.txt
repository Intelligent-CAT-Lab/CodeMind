The variable a is initialized to 3, and the variable b is initialized to 20.
The code then enters a loop that iterates while x * 2 <= b, meaning it will continue to iterate while x is less than or equal to 20.
The variable x is initialized to 3, and it is multiplied by 2 to get 6.
The code then checks if 6 is less than or equal to 20, which is true.
The variable x is then set to 6, and the loop continues.
The variable x is then multiplied by 2 to get 12, and the code checks if 12 is less than or equal to 20, which is true.
The variable x is then set to 12, and the loop continues.
The variable x is then multiplied by 2 to get 24, and the code checks if 24 is less than or equal to 20, which is true.
The variable x is then set to 24, and the loop continues.
The variable x is then multiplied by 2 to get 48, and the code checks if 48 is less than or equal to 20, which is true.
The variable x is then set to 48, and the loop continues.
The variable x is then multiplied by 2 to get 96, and the code checks if 96 is less than or equal to 20, which is true.
The variable x is then set to 96, and the loop continues.
The variable x is then multiplied by 2 to get 192, and the code checks if 192 is less than or equal to 20, which is true.
The variable x is then set to 192, and the loop continues.
The variable x is then multiplied by 2 to get 384, and the code checks if 384 is less than or equal to 20, which is true.
The variable x is then set to 384, and the loop continues.
The variable x is then multiplied by 2 to get 768, and the code checks if 768 is less than or equal to 20, which is true.
The variable x is then set to 768, and the loop continues.
The variable x is then multiplied by 2 to get 1536, and the code checks if 1536 is less than or equal to 20, which is true.
The variable x is then set to 1536, and the loop continues.
The variable x is then multiplied by 2 to get 3072, and the code checks if 3072 is less than or equal to 20, which is true.
The variable x is then set to 3072, and the loop continues.
The variable x is then multiplied by 2 to get 6144, and the code checks if 6144 is less than or equal to 20, which is true.
The variable x is then set to 6144, and the loop continues.
The variable x is then multiplied by 2 to get 12288, and the code checks if 12288 is less than or equal to 20, which is true.
The variable x is then set to 12288, and the loop continues.
The variable x is then multiplied by 2 to get 24576, and the code checks if 24576 is less than or equal to 20, which is true.
The variable x is then set to 24576, and the loop continues.
The variable x is then multiplied by 2 to get 49152, and the code checks if 49152 is less than or equal to 20, which is true.
The variable x is then set to 49152, and the loop continues.
The variable x is then multiplied by 2 to get 98304, and the code checks if 98304 is less than or equal to 20, which is true.
The variable x is then set to 98304, and the loop continues.
The variable x is then multiplied by 2 to get 196608, and the code checks if 1
