The variable a and variable b are initialized to 2 and 1, respectively.
The code then prints the string "Alice" if the absolute value of a-b is greater than 1, otherwise it prints the string "Brown".
The absolute value of a-b is 1, so the code prints "Alice".
<<<Output>>>
Alice

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
# coding: utf-8
a,b=map(int,input().split())
print('Alice' if abs(a-b)>1 else 'Brown')
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 1
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
