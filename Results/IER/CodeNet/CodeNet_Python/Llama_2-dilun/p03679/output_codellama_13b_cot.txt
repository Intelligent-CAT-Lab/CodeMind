The variable x, variable a and variable b are initialized to 4, 3 and 6, respectively.
The code checks if b is less than or equal to a. If it is, it prints "delicious".
Otherwise, it checks if (b-a) is less than or equal to x. If it is, it prints "safe".
Otherwise, it prints "dangerous".

Consider the following code:
<Code>
x,a,b=map(int,input().split())
if b<=a:
  print('delicious')
elif (b-a)<=x:
  print('safe')
else:
  print('dangerous')
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4 3 6
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
