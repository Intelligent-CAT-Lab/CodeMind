The variable A, B, C and D are initialized to 3, 5, 2 and 7, respectively.
The function resolve() is called.
The function resolve() calculates the product of A and B, which is 15.
The function resolve() then checks if the product of A and B is greater than the product of C and D.
Since 15 is greater than 14, the function resolve() prints 15.
<<<Output>>>
15

    Consider the following code:
<Code>

def resolve():
    A, B, C, D = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(A*B if A*B > C*D else C*D)


if '__main__' == __name__:
    resolve()
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 5 2 7
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
