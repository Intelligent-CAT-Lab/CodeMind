The variable n is initialized to 4.
The variable m is initialized to 2^4, which is 16.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 15 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 15.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
n=int(input())
m=2**n
for i in range(m):
    temp=[0 for i in range(n)]
    j=i
    count=0
    while j>0:
        if j%2==1:
            temp[count]=1
            #print(count,temp[count])
        j//=2
        count+=1

    temp2=[]
    for k in range(n):
        if temp[k]==1:
            temp2.append(k)
    print(i,end="")
    if i!=0:
        print(":",end=" " )
        print(*temp2)
    else:
        print(":")

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
