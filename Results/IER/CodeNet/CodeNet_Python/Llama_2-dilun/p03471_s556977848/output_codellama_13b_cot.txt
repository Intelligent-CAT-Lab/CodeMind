The variable n and variable y are initialized to 9 and 45000, respectively.
The variable flag is initialized to False.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n + 1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 9.
For each number i in this range, it enters another loop that iterates from 1 to n + 1 - i (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 8.
For each number j in this range, it calculates the value of y - 10000 * i - 5000 * j.
If the value of this calculation is divisible by 1000, the code prints the value of i, j and the value of the calculation divided by 1000.
The code then checks if flag is True. If it is, it breaks out of the inner loop and the outer loop.
If flag is False, it enters the inner loop again.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the value of -1, -1 and -1.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
n, y = map(int, input().split())

flag = False
for i in range(n + 1):
    for j in range(n + 1 - i):
        res = y - 10000 * i - 5000 * j
        if res // 1000 == n - i - j:
            print(i, j, res // 1000)
            flag = True
            break
    if flag:
        break
else:
    print(-1, -1, -1)

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```9 45000
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
