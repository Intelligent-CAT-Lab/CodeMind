The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 5, 1 and 3, respectively.
The variable MOD is initialized to 998244353.

The code checks if B is 0. If it is, it prints 1 and exits.

The variable f is initialized to 1. The variable F is initialized to a list of 1s with length N + 1.

The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N + 1. For each number i in this range, it calculates f = f * i % MOD.

The variable F is initialized to a list of 1s with length N + 1.

The code enters a loop that iterates from N to 1, decreasing by 1. For each number i in this range, it calculates fi = pow(f, MOD - 2, MOD).

The variable z is initialized to 0.

The code enters a loop that iterates from min(A + 1, N - B) if N - B - A else A + 1 to 1. For each number k in this range, it calculates x = (B - k) * F[B + k - 1] * FI[B] * FI[k] % MOD.

The code enters a loop that iterates from N - B - k - 1 to A - k. For each number i in this range, it calculates y = F[N + A - B - 2 * k - 1] * FI[N - B - k - 1] * FI[A - k] % MOD.

The variable z is updated to (z + x * y) % MOD.

The code prints the final value of z.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
MOD = 998244353

if B == 0:
    print(1)
    exit()

f = 1
F = [1] * (N + 1)
for i in range(1, N + 1):
    F[i] = f = f * i % MOD

FI = [1] * (N + 1)
FI[N] = fi = pow(f, MOD - 2, MOD)
for i in range(N, 1, -1):
    FI[i - 1] = fi = fi * i % MOD

z = 0
for k in range(min(A + 1, N - B) if N - B - A else A + 1):
    x = (B - k) * F[B + k - 1] * FI[B] * FI[k] % MOD
    y = F[N + A - B - 2 * k - 1] * FI[N - B - k - 1] * FI[A - k] % MOD
    z = (z + x * y) % MOD

print(z)

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 1 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
