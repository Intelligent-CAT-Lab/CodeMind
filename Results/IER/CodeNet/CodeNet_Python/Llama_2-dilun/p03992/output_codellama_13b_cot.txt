The variable s is initialized to the input string "CODEFESTIVAL".
The code then prints the first 4 characters of s followed by a space and the last 4 characters of s.
The output is "CODEFEST" followed by a space and "IVAL".

Consider the following code:
<Code>
s = input()
print(s[:4] +'' + s[4:])
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```CODEFESTIVAL
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
