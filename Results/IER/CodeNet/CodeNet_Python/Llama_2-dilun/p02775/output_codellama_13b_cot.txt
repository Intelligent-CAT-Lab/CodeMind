The input is 36.
The code first reverses the input and stores it in a list.
The list is then appended with 0 at the end.
The code then iterates through the list from the last element to the first element.
For each element, it calculates the sum of the element and the previous element.
If the sum is less than 5 or if the sum is 5 and the next element is less than 5, the code adds the sum to the result.
Otherwise, the code adds 10 minus the sum to the result.
The code then adds the last element to the result.
The result is 10.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>

def main():
    n = list(map(int, input()[::-1])) + [0]
    s = 0
    res = 0
    for i, ni in enumerate(n[:-1]):
        k = ni + s
        if k < 5 or (k == 5 and int(n[i + 1]) < 5):
            res += k
            s = 0
        else:
            res += 10 - k
            s = 1
    res += s
    print(res)

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```36
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
