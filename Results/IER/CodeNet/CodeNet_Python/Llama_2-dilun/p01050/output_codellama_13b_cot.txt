The code first converts the input string to a list of characters.
The code then initializes two lists, abc and num, to store the counts of the characters in the string that are in the range [a, z] and [0, 9], respectively.
The code then iterates through the string and counts the number of times each character appears in the string.
The code then calculates the sum of the counts for each character in the range [a, z] and [0, 9].
