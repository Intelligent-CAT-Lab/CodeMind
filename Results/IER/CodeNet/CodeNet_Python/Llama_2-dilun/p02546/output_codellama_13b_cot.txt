The variable s is initialized to "apple".
The code checks if the last character of s is's'.
If it is, it prints "apples".
If it is not, it prints "apples".
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
s = input()
if s[-1]=='s':
    print(s+'es')
else:
    print(s+'s')
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```apple
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
