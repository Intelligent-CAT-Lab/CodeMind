The code first reads the input from the standard input, which is the first line of the input file.
The input is split into two strings, a and b, which are then converted to integers.
The variable n is initialized to the sum of a and b, which is 21.
The variable sqrtn is initialized to the square root of n, which is 4.54834775341477.
The variable i is initialized to 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to sqrtn (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 4.54834775341477.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i * i is equal to n. If it is, the code prints "Yes" and breaks out of the loop.
If the loop finishes without printing "Yes", it prints "No".

The output of the code is "No".

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
#!/usr/bin/python3
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

import sys

def main():
    a, b = sys.stdin.readline().split()
    n = int(a + b)
    sqrtn = int(sqrt(n))
    i = 1
    for i in range(1, sqrtn + 1):
        if i * i == n:
            print('Yes')
            break
    else:
        print('No')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 21
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
