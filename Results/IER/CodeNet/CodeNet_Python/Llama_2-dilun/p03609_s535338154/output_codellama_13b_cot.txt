The variable x and variable t are initialized to 100 and 17, respectively.
The code then prints the output of the expression x-t.
The expression x-t is evaluated as follows:
x-t = 100-17 = 83
The code then prints the output of the expression 0 if x-t < 0 else x-t.
The expression 0 if x-t < 0 else x-t is evaluated as follows:
0 if x-t < 0 else x-t = 0 if 83 < 0 else 83 = 0

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
x, t = map(int, input().split())
print(0 if x-t < 0 else x-t)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```100 17
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
