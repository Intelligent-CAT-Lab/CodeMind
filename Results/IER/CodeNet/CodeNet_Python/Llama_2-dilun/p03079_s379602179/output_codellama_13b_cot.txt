The variables a, b and c are initialized to 2, 2 and 2, respectively.
The code checks if a, b and c are equal to each other.
Since a, b and c are all equal to 2, the condition is met and the code prints "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b,c = map(int,input().split())
if a== b and b == c and a == c:
    print("Yes")
else:
    print("No")
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 2 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
