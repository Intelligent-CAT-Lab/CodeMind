The variable a and variable b are initialized to 4 and 11, respectively.
The code checks if a+b == 15, which is not true.
The code then checks if a*b == 15, which is true.
The code prints '*'.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b = map(int,input().split())
if a+b == 15:
	print('+')
elif a*b == 15:
	print('*')
else:
	print('x')
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4 11
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
