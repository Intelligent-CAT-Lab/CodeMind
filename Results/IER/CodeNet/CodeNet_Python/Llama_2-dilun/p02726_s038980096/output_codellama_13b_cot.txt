The variable N, variable X and variable Y are initialized to 5, 2 and 4, respectively.
The variable S is initialized to an empty list.
The variable S is then filled with a list of lists.
Each list in S is a list of two lists.
The first list in each list is a list of numbers from 1 to i (inclusive), where i is the index of the list in S.
The second list in each list is a list of numbers from N-i to N, where i is the index of the list in S.
The variable S is filled with the following lists:
[
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
[6, 7, 8, 9, 10],
[11, 12, 13, 14, 15],
[16, 17, 18, 19, 20],
[21, 22, 23, 24, 25]
]

The variable S[X-1][Y-1] is set to 1.
The variable S[Y-1][X-1] is set to 1.

The variable S is then iterated over.
For each list in S, the variable i is set to the index of the list in S.
The variable j is set to the index of the second list in the list in S.
The variable x is set to X-1.
The variable y is set to Y-1.
The variable S[i][j] is set to the minimum of S[i][j], S[i][x]+1+S[y][j].

The variable dist is initialized to an empty list.

The variable dist is then iterated over.
For each element in dist, the variable i is set to the index of the element in dist.
