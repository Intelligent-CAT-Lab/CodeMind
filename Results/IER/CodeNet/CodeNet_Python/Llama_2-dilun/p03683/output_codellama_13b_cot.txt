The variable N and variable M are initialized to 2 and 2, respectively.
The variable thres is initialized to 10^9 + 7.

The code checks if the absolute value of N-M is 1. If it is, it sets N to be the minimum of N and M.

The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N+1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 3.
For each number i in this range, it multiplies i^2 and stores the result in retVal.
The code checks if retVal is greater than or equal to thres. If it is, it moduloes retVal by thres.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of retVal, which is 1.

The code then checks if N is equal to M. If it is, it sets retVal to 2 and enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N+1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 3.
For each number i in this range, it multiplies i^2 and stores the result in retVal.
The code checks if retVal is greater than or equal to thres. If it is, it moduloes retVal by thres.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of retVal, which is 16.

The code then checks if N is not equal to M. If it is, it prints 0.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
buf=input().split()
N=int(buf[0])
M=int(buf[1])

thres=10**9+7

if abs(N-M)==1:
    N=min(N,M)
    retVal=1
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        retVal*=(i**2)
        if retVal>=thres:
            retVal=retVal%thres
    retVal*=(N+1)
    if retVal>=thres:
        retVal=retVal%thres
    print(retVal) 
elif N==M:
    retVal=2
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        retVal*=(i**2)
        if retVal>=thres:
            retVal=retVal%thres
    print(retVal)
else:
    print(0)

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
