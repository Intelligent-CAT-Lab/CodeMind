The variable x is initialized to the input string "Thank you for your mail and your lectures".
The variable A is initialized to a list of strings, which is the list of all the words in the input string.
The variable S is initialized to a list of integers, which will be used to store the number of times each word appears in the input string.
The variable L is initialized to a list of integers, which will be used to store the length of each word in the input string.
The code then iterates through the list A and for each word i, it calculates the number of times it appears in the input string using the method A.count(i). This number is stored in the list S.
The code also calculates the length of each word in the input string using the method len(i), which is stored in the list L.
The code then finds the maximum value in the list S using the method max(S), which is the number of times the word "mail" appears in the input string.
The code also finds the maximum value in the list L using the method max(L), which is the length of the word "lectures".
The code then uses the method S.index(M) to find the index of the word "mail" in the list S, which is 1.
The code also uses the method L.index(m) to find the index of the word "lectures" in the list L, which is 2.
The code then prints the words at these indices, which are "mail" and "lectures".

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
x=input()
A=x.split()
S=[]
L=[]
for i in A:
    s=A.count(i)
    S.append(s)
    l=len(i)
    L.append(l)
M=max(S)
m=max(L)
Y=S.index(M)
y=L.index(m)
print(A[Y],A[y])

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```Thank you for your mail and your lectures
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
