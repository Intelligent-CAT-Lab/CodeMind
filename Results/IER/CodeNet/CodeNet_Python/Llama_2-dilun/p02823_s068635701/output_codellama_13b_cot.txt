The variable n, variable a and variable b are initialized to 5, 2 and 4, respectively.
The variable diff is initialized to b - a, which is 2.
The code checks if diff is even, which is true in this case.
If diff is even, the code prints diff//2, which is 1.
If diff is odd, the code checks if a is less than n - b + 1, which is true in this case.
If a is less than n - b + 1, the code checks if diff is positive, which is true in this case.
If diff is positive, the code prints a + (diff-1)//2, which is 3.
If diff is negative, the code prints a, which is 2.
If a is not less than n - b + 1, the code checks if diff is positive, which is true in this case.
If diff is positive, the code prints n-b+1 + (diff)//2, which is 6.
If diff is negative, the code prints n-b+1, which is 5.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
n, a, b = map(int, input().split())

diff = b - a

if diff % 2 == 0:
	print(diff//2)
else:
	if a < n - b + 1:
		if diff > 0:
			print(a + (diff-1)//2)
		else:
			print(a)
	else:

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 2 4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
