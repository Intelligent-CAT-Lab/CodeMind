The variable N and variable K are initialized to 4 and 2, respectively.
The variable MOD is initialized to 10 ** 9 + 7.
The variable i is initialized to 1.
The variable M is initialized to N.
The variable div is initialized to an empty list.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 4.
For each number i in this range, it checks if N is divisible by i. If it is, it adds i to the list div.
If N is not divisible by i, it checks if N is divisible by N // i. If it is, it adds N // i to the list div.
The code then sorts the list div.
The variable N1 is initialized to the length of the list div.
The variable num is initialized to an array of 0s with length N1 + 1.
The variable ans is initialized to 0.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to N1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 3.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the power of K to the (div[i] + 1) // 2, which is 1, 2 or 3.
It then calculates the remainder of the power of K to the (div[i] + 1) // 2, which is 0, 1 or 2.
It then calculates the product of div[i] and the power of K to the (div[i] + 1) // 2, which is 1, 2 or 3.
It then calculates the remainder of the product of div[i] and the power of K to the (div[i] + 1) // 2, which is 0, 1 or 2.
It then calculates the sum of the product of div[i] and the power of K to the (div[i] + 1) // 2 and the remainder of the product of div[i] and the power of K to the (div[i] + 1) // 2, which is 0, 1 or 2.
It then calculates the remainder of the sum of the product of div[i] and the power of K to the (div[i] + 1) // 2 and the remainder of the product of div[i] and the power of K to the (div[i] + 1) // 2, which is 0, 1 or 2.
It then calculates the product of the sum of the product of div[i] and the power of K to the (div[i] + 1) // 2 and the remainder of the product of div[i] and the power of K to the (div[i] + 1) // 2 and the remainder of the sum of the product of div[i] and the power of K to the (div[i] + 1) // 2 and the remainder of the product of div[i] and the power of K to the (div[i] + 1) // 2, which is 0, 1 or 2.
It then calculates the remainder of the product of the sum of the product of div[i] and the power of K to the (div[i] + 1) // 2 and the remainder of the product of div[i] and the power of K to the (div[i] + 1) // 2 and the remainder of the sum of the product of div[i] and the power of K to the (div[i] + 1) // 2 and the remainder of the product of div[i] and the power of K to the (div[i] + 1) // 2, which is 0, 1 or 2.
It then calculates the sum of the product of div[i] and the power of K to the (div[i] + 1) // 2 and the remainder of the product of div[i] and the power of K to the (div[i] + 1) // 2 and the remainder of the sum of the product of div[i] and the power of K to the (div[i] + 1) // 2 and the remainder of the product of div[i] and the power of K to the (div[i] + 1) // 2 and the remainder of
