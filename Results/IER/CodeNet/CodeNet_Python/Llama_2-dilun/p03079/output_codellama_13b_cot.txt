<<<Analysis>>>
The variable a, b and c are initialized to 2, 2 and 2, respectively.
The code checks if a == b and b == c. Since a == b and b == c, the condition is met and the code prints "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes

Consider the following code:
<Code>
a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
if a == b and b == c :
    print("Yes")
else :
    print("No")
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 2 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
