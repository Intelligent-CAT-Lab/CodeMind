The variable N is initialized to 15.
The function DigitsSum takes a number n as input and returns the sum of its digits.
The variable min_sum is initialized to 10^5, which is 1000000.
The code then iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 15.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum.
It then calculates the sum of digits of N-i and stores it in sum.
It then checks if the sum of digits of i and N-i is less than min_sum.
If it is, it updates min_sum to the sum of digits of i and N-i.
The condition is met when i is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of min_sum, which is 1000000.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def DigitsSum(n):
    sum = 0
    while (n!= 0):
        sum += (n % 10)
        n = int(n / 10)
    return sum

N = int(input())

min_sum = 10**5
for i in range(1, N):
    sum = DigitsSum(i) + DigitsSum(N-i)
    if (sum < min_sum):
        min_sum = sum

print(min_sum)

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```15
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
