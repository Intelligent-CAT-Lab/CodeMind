The variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized to 5, 14 and 80, respectively.
The variable d is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the number of numbers that are divisible by c.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from a to b (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 5 to 14.
For each number i in this range, it checks if c is divisible by i. If it is, it adds 1 to d. The condition is met when c is divisible by 5, 10 and 14.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of d, which is 2.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
d = 0
for i in range(a, b+1):
  if c % i == 0:
    d += 1
print(d)

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 14 80
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
