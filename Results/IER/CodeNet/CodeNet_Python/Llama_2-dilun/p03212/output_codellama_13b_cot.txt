The variable n is initialized to 575.
The function dfs(s) is called with the string s initialized to '0'.
The function dfs(s) checks if the string s is greater than n.
If it is, it returns 0.
Otherwise, it checks if all the characters in the string s are 7, 5 or 3.
If they are, it returns 1.
Otherwise, it returns 0.
Then, it iterates over the characters in the string s and calls dfs(s + c) for each character c in '753'.
It returns the sum of the results of all the calls to dfs(s + c).
Finally, it prints the result.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
n = int(input())

def dfs(s):
    if int(s) > n:
        return 0
    ret = 1 if all(s.count(c) > 0 for c in '753') else 0
    for c in '753':
        ret += dfs(s + c)
    return ret

print(dfs('0'))
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```575
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
