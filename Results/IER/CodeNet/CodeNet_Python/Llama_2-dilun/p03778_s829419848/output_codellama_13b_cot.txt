The variable W, variable A and variable B are initialized to 3, 2 and 6, respectively.
The code then calculates the value of x, y and z.
x is 0 if A <= B <= A + W or A <= B + W <= A + W or B <= A <= B + W or B <= A + W <= B + W.
y is abs(A - (B + W))
z is abs(B - (A + W))
The code then prints the minimum value of x, y and z.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import sys
import heapq, math
from itertools import zip_longest, permutations, combinations, combinations_with_replacement
from itertools import accumulate, dropwhile, takewhile, groupby
from functools import lru_cache
from copy import deepcopy

W, A, B = map(int, input().split())

x = 0 if A <= B <= A + W or A <= B + W <= A + W or B <= A <= B + W or B <= A + W <= B + W else 1 << 28
y = abs(A - (B + W))
z = abs(B - (A + W))
print(min(x, y, z))
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 2 6
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
