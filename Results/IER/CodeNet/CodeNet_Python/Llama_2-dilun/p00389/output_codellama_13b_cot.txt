The variable N and variable K are initialized to 4 and 2, respectively.
The variable t is initialized to 1, which will be used to count the number of times the loop iterates.
The variable n is initialized to 1, which will be used to store the number of times the loop iterates.
The variable a is initialized to 1, which will be used to store the value of a after each iteration.
The code enters a loop that iterates until the condition N < a is met.
In each iteration, the variable n is calculated as (K+a-1)//K, which is the number of times the loop iterates.
The variable a is then updated to be the value of a after the iteration.
The code then increments the variable t by 1, which is the number of times the loop iterates.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of t, which is 3.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
N,K = map(int, input().split())
t = n = a = 1
while True:
    n = (K+a-1)//K
    a += n;
    if  N < a: break
    t += 1
print(t)

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
