The variable K is initialized to 0.
The variable N is initialized to 50.
The variable div is initialized to 0, which is the quotient of K and N.
The variable mod is initialized to 0, which is the remainder of K and N.
The variable A is initialized to an empty list.
The code then iterates from 0 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 49.
For each number i in this range, it adds i + div - mod to the list A.
The code then iterates from 0 to mod (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 49.
For each number i in this range, it adds N + 1 to the list A.
The code then prints the value of N, which is 50.
The code then prints the list A, which is [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59].
