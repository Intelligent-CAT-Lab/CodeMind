The variable x and variable y are initialized to 10 and 20, respectively.
The absolute value of x is calculated and stored in abs_x.
The absolute value of y is calculated and stored in abs_y.

The code checks if x is less than y and y is greater than 0. If it is, it prints the value of y minus x and exits the program.
The code checks if y is less than 0 and x is greater than 0. If it is, it prints the value of x minus y plus 2 and exits the program.
The code checks if y is 0 and x is greater than 0. If it is, it prints the value of x plus 1 and exits the program.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
x, y = map(int, input().split())

if x < y:
    print (x)
elif x == y:
    print (x)
else:
    print (y)

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10 20
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
