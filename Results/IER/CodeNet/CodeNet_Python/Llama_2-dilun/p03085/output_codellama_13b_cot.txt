The variable b is initialized to the input "A".
The code then checks if b is equal to "A". If it is, it prints "T".
The code then checks if b is equal to "C". If it is, it prints "G".
The code then checks if b is equal to "G". If it is, it prints "C".
The code then checks if b is equal to any other value. If it is, it prints "A".
The output is "T".

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
b=input()
if b =='A':
    print('T')
elif b=='C':
    print('G')
elif b=='G':
    print('C')
else:
    print('A')

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```A
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
