The variable a, b and c are initialized to 3, 8 and 5, respectively.
The code checks if a is less than c and c is less than b or a is greater than c and c is greater than b.
In this case, the condition is met when a is 3, c is 8 and b is 5.
The code then prints "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b,c=map(int,input().split())
if a<c<b or a>c>b:
  print('Yes')
else:
  print('No')
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 8 5
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
