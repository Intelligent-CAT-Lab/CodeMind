The variable a and variable b are initialized to 8 and 13, respectively.
The variable tower_dis is initialized to b - a, which is 5.
The variable b_height is initialized to tower_dis * (tower_dis + 1) // 2, which is 10.
The variable ans is initialized to b_height - b, which is 2.
The code prints the value of ans, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
a, b = map(int, input().split())

tower_dis = b - a
b_height = tower_dis * (tower_dis + 1) // 2
ans = b_height - b

print(ans)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```8 13
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
