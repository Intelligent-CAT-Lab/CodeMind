The variable a and variable b are initialized to 5 and 5, respectively.
The code checks if a is greater than b. If it is, it subtracts 1 from a and prints the result. Otherwise, it prints a.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b = map(int,input().rstrip().split())
if a>b:
    print(a-1)
else:
    print(a)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 5
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
