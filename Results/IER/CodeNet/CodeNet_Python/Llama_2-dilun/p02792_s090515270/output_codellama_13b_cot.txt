The variable n is initialized to 25.
The variable lr_cnt is initialized to a 2-dimensional array of zeros.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 25.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in lr_cnt.
The code then prints the final value of ans, which is 120.
<<<Output>>>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
n = int(input())
lr_cnt = [[0 for _ in range(10)] for _ in range(10)]
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    str_i = str(i)
    start = int(str_i[0])
    end = int(str_i[-1])
    lr_cnt[start][end] += 1
ans = 0
for i in range(10):
    for j in range(10):
        ans += lr_cnt[i][j] * lr_cnt[j][i]
print(ans)

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```25
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
