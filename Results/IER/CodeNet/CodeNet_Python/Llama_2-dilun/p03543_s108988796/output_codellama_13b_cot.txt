The variable N is initialized to 1118.
The code checks if the first three digits of N are the same or if the second and third digits are the same as the third and fourth digits.
If it is, it prints "Yes".
If it is not, it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No

Consider the following code:
<Code>
N=input()
if N[0]==N[1]==N[2] or N[1]==N[2]==N[3]:
  print('Yes')
else:
  print('No')
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1118
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
