The code first prints the input.
Then it evaluates the input using eval() function.
The input is 1 + 2, which is evaluated to 3.
The code then prints the result of the evaluation, which is 3.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
print(eval(input()))
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 + 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
