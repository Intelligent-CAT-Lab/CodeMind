The variable x is initialized to 103.
The variable y is initialized to 100.
The variable ans is initialized to 0.
The code enters a while loop that iterates while y is less than x.
The code calculates the value of y by multiplying it by 1.01.
The code adds 1 to ans.
The code checks if y is less than x. If it is, the code repeats the above steps.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 103.
<<<Output>>>
103

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import math
x = int(input())

y = 100
ans = 0
while y < x:
    ans += 1
    y = math.floor(y*1.01)

print(ans)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```103
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
