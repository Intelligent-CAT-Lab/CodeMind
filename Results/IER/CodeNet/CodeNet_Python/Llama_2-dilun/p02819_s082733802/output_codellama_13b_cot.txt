The function isPrime() takes an integer n as input and returns True if n is prime, and False otherwise.
The function iterates through all integers from 2 to n-1 and checks if n is divisible by any of them. If it is, it returns False.
If n is not divisible by any of them, it returns True.
The code then calls the function isPrime() with X as input.
If X is prime, the code prints X.
If X is not prime, it increments X and calls the function again.
This process repeats until X is prime.

The code prints 20.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def isPrime(n):
    div = 2
    while div * div <= n:
        if n % div == 0: return False
        div += 1
    return True

X = int(input())
while not isPrime(X): X+=1
print(X)

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
