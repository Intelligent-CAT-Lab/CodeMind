The variable a and variable b are initialized to 3 and 4, respectively.
The code checks if a*b is even or odd.
If a*b is even, the code prints "Even".
If a*b is odd, the code prints "Odd".
<<<Output>>>
Odd

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
#better 
a, b = map(int, input().split())

#2n
if (a*b%2==0):
    print('Even')    

#2n-1    
else:
    print('Odd')
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
