The variable s is initialized to the string "gpg".
The code then prints the length of s divided by 2, which is 3.
The code then prints the number of occurrences of the character 'p' in s, which is 1.
The code then prints the difference between the two numbers, which is 2.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
s=input()
print(len(s)//2-s.count('p'))
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```gpg
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
