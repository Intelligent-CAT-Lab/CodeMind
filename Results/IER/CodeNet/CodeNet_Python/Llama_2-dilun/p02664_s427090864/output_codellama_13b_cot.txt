The code first reads the input and stores it in the variable t.
The variable n is initialized to the length of t, which is 5 in this case.
The code then iterates over the characters in t, and if the character is '?', it appends 'D' to the list ans.
Otherwise, it appends the character to the list ans.
The final list ans is printed.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import sys

from bisect import bisect_right as br
from bisect import bisect_left as bl
sys.setrecursionlimit(2147483647)

from collections import defaultdict
from itertools import accumulate
from collections import Counter
from collections import deque
from operator import itemgetter
from itertools import permutations
mod = 10**9 + 7
inf = float('inf')
def I(): return int(sys.stdin.readline())
def LI(): return list(map(int,sys.stdin.readline().split()))

t = input()
n = len(t)
ans = []
for i in range(n):
    if t[i] == '?':
        ans.append('D')
    else:

print(''.join(ans))

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```PD?D??P
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
