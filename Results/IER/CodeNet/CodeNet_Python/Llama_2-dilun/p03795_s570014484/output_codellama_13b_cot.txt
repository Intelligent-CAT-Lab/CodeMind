The variable n is initialized to 20.
The variable x is initialized to 20 * 800, which is 16000.
The variable y is initialized to 20 // 15, which is 4.
The variable y is then multiplied by 200, which is 800.
The variable x is then subtracted from the variable y, which is 16000 - 800, which is 15200.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
n = int(input())

x = n * 800
y = n // 15
y = y*200

print(x - y)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
