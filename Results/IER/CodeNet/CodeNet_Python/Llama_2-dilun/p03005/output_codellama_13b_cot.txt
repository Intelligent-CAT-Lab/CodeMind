The variable N and variable K are initialized to 3 and 2, respectively.
The code checks if K is equal to 1. If it is, it prints 0.
Otherwise, it prints N-K, which is 3-2, which is 1.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
N,K=map(int,input().split())
if K==1:
    print(0)
else:
    print(N-K)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
