The code first asks the user to input a number N.
If N is even, the code will iterate from 1 to N, and for each pair of numbers (i, j), it will add them to the list A.
Then, it will iterate from 1 to N//2, and for each pair of numbers (i, N-i), it will add them to the list B.
The code will then subtract the set of elements in A from the set of elements in B, and print the length of the resulting set.
Finally, it will print the elements in the resulting set.

If N is odd, the code will iterate from 1 to N, and for each pair of numbers (i, j), it will add them to the list A.
Then, it will iterate from 1 to N//2, and for each pair of numbers (i, N-i-1), it will add them to the list B.
The code will then subtract the set of elements in A from the set of elements in B, and print the length of the resulting set.
Finally, it will print the elements in the resulting set.

In this case, N is 3, so the code will iterate from 1 to 3, and for each pair of numbers (i, j), it will add them to the list A.
Then, it will iterate from 1 to 1, and for each pair of numbers (i, N-i), it will add them to the list B.
The code will then subtract the set of elements in A from the set of elements in B, and print the length of the resulting set.
Finally, it will print the elements in the resulting set.

The resulting set is {(1, 2), (1, 3)}.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
N=int(input())
A=[]
B=[]
if N%2==0:
  for i in range(1,N):
    for j in range(i+1,N+1):
      A.append((i,j))
  for i in range(N//2):
    B.append((i+1,N-i))
  D=set(A)-set(B)
  print(len(D))
  for a,b in D:
    print(a,b)
else:
  for i in range(1,N):
    for j in range(i+1,N+1):
      A.append((i,j))
  for i in range(N//2):
    B.append((i+1,N-i-1))
  D=set(A)-set(B)
  print(len(D))
  for a,b in D:
    print(a,b)

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
