Consider the following code:
<Code>
x = int(input())

if 400 <= x and x <= 599:
    print(8)
elif 600 <= x and x <= 799:
    print(7)
elif 800 <= x and x <= 999:
    print(6)
elif 1000 <= x and x <= 1199:
    print(5)
elif 1200 <= x and x <= 1399:
    print(4)
elif 1400 <= x and x <= 1599:

elif 1600 <= x and x <= 1799:
    print(2)
elif 1800 <= x and x <= 1999:

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1200```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
