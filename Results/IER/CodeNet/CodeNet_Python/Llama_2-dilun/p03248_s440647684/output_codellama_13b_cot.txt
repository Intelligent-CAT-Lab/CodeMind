The code first checks if the input string starts with 0 or ends with 1. If it does, it prints -1 and exits.

The code then checks if the input string is symmetric. It does this by checking if the first half of the string is equal to the second half of the string.

If the input string is symmetric, the code then checks if the first half of the string contains a 1. If it does, it appends the index of the 1 to a list called possible.

The code then creates a list called edges. This list will contain pairs of indices that represent the edges of the string.

The code then iterates through the list possible and for each index i, it checks if there is a pair of indices in the list edges that contains the index i. If there is, it prints the indices of the pair.

If there is no pair of indices in the list edges that contains the index i, the code checks if the index i is the last index in the list possible. If it is, it prints the index i + 1.

The code then iterates through the list edges and for each pair of indices e, it prints the indices of the pair.

The code then exits.

if s[0] == "0" or s[-1] == "1":

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1111
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
