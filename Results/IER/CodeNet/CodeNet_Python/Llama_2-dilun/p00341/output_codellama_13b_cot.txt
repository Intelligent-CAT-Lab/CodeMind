The variable a is initialized to a list of 100 zeros.
The variable b is initialized to a list of 7 integers, which are 1, 1, 3, 4, 8, 9 and 7.
The variable c is initialized to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 12 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 7.
For each number i in this range, it adds 1 to the element at index b[i]-1 in the list a.
After the loop finishes, the code enters a second loop that iterates from 0 to 99 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 99.
For each number i in this range, it checks if the element at index i in the list a is non-zero and if the remainder of i divided by 4 is 0.
If both conditions are met, it adds the value of a[i]//4 to c.
After the second loop finishes, the code prints the value of c, which is 3.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
a=[0]*100
b=list(map(int,input().split()))
for i in range(12):
    a[b[i]-1]+=1
c=0
for i in range(100):
    if a[i] and a[i]%4==0: c+=a[i]//4
print('yes' if c==3 else 'no')
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 1 3 4 8 9 7 3 4 5 5 5
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
