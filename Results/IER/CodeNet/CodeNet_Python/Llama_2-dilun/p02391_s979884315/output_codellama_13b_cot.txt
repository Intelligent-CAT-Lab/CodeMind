The variable a and variable b are initialized to 1 and 2, respectively.
The code then checks if a is less than b. If it is, it prints "a < b".
If a is greater than b, it prints "a > b".
If a is equal to b, it prints "a == b".
<<<Output>>>
a < b

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
a, b = map(int, input().split())

if(a < b):
    print('a < b')
elif(a > b):
    print('a > b')
else:
    print('a == b')

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
