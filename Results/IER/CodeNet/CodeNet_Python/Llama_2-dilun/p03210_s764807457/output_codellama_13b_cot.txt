    Consider the following code:
<Code>
print("YES") if int(input()) in[3, 5, 7] else print("NO")

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
