The variable a and variable b are initialized to 7 and 3, respectively.
The code then checks if a is divisible by b. If it is, it prints 0. Otherwise, it prints 1.
The code checks if a is divisible by b. Since 7 is not divisible by 3, it prints 1.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import sys
import math

# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

a,b=list(map(int, input().split()))



if a%b is 0:
    print('0')
else:
    print('1')

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```7 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
