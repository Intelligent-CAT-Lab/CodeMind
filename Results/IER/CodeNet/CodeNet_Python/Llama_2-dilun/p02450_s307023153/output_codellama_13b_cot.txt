The variable n is initialized to 2.
The variable nl is initialized to a list of strings, each of which is a single digit.
The function perm() is called.
The function perm() iterates through the list nl and calls itself recursively.
The function perm() returns a list of lists, each of which is a permutation of the digits in nl.
The list of lists is printed.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def perm(nl):

    if len(nl) == 0:
        return []

    if len(nl) == 1:
        return [nl]

    l = []

    for i in range(len(nl)):

        m = nl[i]

        rest = nl[:i] + nl[i+1:]

        for p in perm(rest):
            l.append([m] + p)


    return l



for i in perm(nl):
    print(" ".join(i))

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
