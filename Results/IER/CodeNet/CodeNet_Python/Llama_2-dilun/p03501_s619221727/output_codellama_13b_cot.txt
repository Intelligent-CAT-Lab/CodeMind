The variable n, variable a and variable b are initialized to 7, 17 and 120, respectively.
The code checks if n * a is greater than b. If it is, it prints b. Otherwise, it prints n * a.
The condition is met when n * a is greater than b, which is true when n is 7 and a is 17.
The code prints 120.
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
if n * a > b:
  print(b)
else:
  print(n * a)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```7 17 120
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
