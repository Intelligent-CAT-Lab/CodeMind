The variable a, variable b and variable x are initialized to 3, 5 and 4, respectively.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to a + b (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 8.
For each number x in this range, it checks if x is within the range [a, a + b], which is [3, 8] in this case. If it is, it prints 'YES'. The condition is met when x is 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8.
After the loop finishes, the code prints 'NO'.
<<<Output>>>
NO

Consider the following code:
<Code>
a, b, x = [int(i) for i in input().split()]

if x >= a and x <= a + b:
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 5 4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
