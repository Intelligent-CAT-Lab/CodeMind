The variable A, variable B, variable C and variable D are initialized to 10, 9, 10 and 10, respectively.
The code enters a while loop that iterates until C <= 0.
The code then calculates C = C - B, which is C = 10 - 9 = 1.
The code then checks if C <= 0, which is true.
The code then prints "Yes" and breaks the loop.

The code then calculates A = A - D, which is A = 10 - 10 = 0.
The code then checks if A <= 0, which is true.
The code then prints "No" and breaks the loop.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
# 整数の入力
A, B, C, D = map(int, input().split())

while(1):
  C = C -B 
  if C <= 0:
    print("Yes")
    break
  A = A - D
  if A <= 0:
    print("No")
    break
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10 9 10 10
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
