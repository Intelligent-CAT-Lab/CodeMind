The variable N, variable MOD are initialized to 3, 1000000007, respectively.
The variable memo is initialized to a list of empty dictionaries, each of which is used to store the result of the recursive function dfs.

The function dfs is called with the input of 0 and "TTT".
The function dfs iterates through the string "TTT" and checks if the string contains "AGC" or not.
If it does, it returns False.
If it does not, it returns True.

The function dfs then calls itself with the input of the current value of cur and the last 3 characters of the string "TTT".
The function dfs iterates through the string "ACGT" and checks if the string contains "AGC" or not.
If it does, it returns False.
If it does not, it returns True.

The function dfs then calculates the sum of the result of dfs called with the input of the current value of cur + 1 and the last 3 characters of the string "TTT" and the result of dfs called with the input of the current value of cur and the last 3 characters of the string "TTT" + c.
The result is then divided by MOD and the remainder is returned.

The function dfs then stores the result in the dictionary memo[cur][last3].

The function dfs then returns the result.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, MOD = int(input()), 10 ** 9 + 7
memo = [{} for i in range(N + 1)]


def ok(last4):
    for i in range(4):
        # tの初期化
        t = list(last4)

        if i >= 1:
            # 文字の入れ替え
            t[i - 1], t[i] = t[i], t[i - 1]

        if "".join(t).count("AGC") >= 1:
            return False

    return True


def dfs(cur, last3):
    # 深いところから戻っていく過程で
    # 今までのlast3 のパターンと同様なら再利用
    if last3 in memo[cur]:
        return memo[cur][last3]

    if cur == N:
        return 1
    ret = 0

    for c in "ACGT":
        if ok(last3 + c):
            # ok の場合count を増やす
            # 1個ずらして curを増やす
            ret = (ret + dfs(cur + 1, last3[1:] + c)) % MOD
    memo[cur][last3] = ret

    return ret


print(dfs(0, "TTT"))

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
