The code first reads the input from the standard input.
The input is 8, which is the number of test cases.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 8 (inclusive), meaning it will consider 8 test cases.
For each test case, the code reads the input from the standard input.
The input is 1, which is the number of steps.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider 1 step.
For each step, the code reads the input from the standard input.
The input is 1, which is the number of steps.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider 1 step.
For each step, the code reads the input from the standard input.
The input is 1, which is the number of steps.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider 1 step.
