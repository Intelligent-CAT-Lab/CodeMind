The variable n is initialized to 100.
The code then prints the string ABC100.
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
n=str(input())
print ('ABC'+n)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```100
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
