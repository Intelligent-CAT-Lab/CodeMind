The variable X is initialized to 1.
The variable Day is initialized to a list containing the strings "mon", "tue", "wed", "thu", "fri", "sat", "sun".
The variable a is initialized to the remainder of X divided by 7, which is 1.
The code checks if a is 2 or 3. If it is, it prints the string "sat".
The code checks if a is 4, 5 or 6. If it is, it prints the string "wed".
The code checks if a is 0 or 1. If it is, it prints the string "sat".
The output is "sat".

Consider the following code:
<Code>

X=int(input())
Day=["mon","tue","wed","thu","fri","sat","sun"]
a=X%7
if a==2 or a==3:
  print(Day[a+3])
elif a==4 or a==5 or a==6:
  print(Day[a-4])
elif a==0 or a==1:
  print(Day[a+3])
  


<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
