The variable N is initialized to 8.
The variable n is initialized to the square root of N, which is 2.8284271247461903.
The variable plist is initialized to an empty list.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 2.8284271247461903.
For each number i in this range, it checks if N is divisible by i. If it is, it appends i to plist. If i is not equal to the quotient of N divided by i, it also appends the quotient to plist.
The variable ans is initialized to 0.
The code then enters another loop that iterates from 0 to len(plist) (inclusive), meaning it will consider all the elements in plist.
For each element x in plist, the code calculates the quotient of N divided by x and stores it in kari.
If kari is 0, it does nothing. Otherwise, it calculates the quotient of N divided by kari and stores it in q. It also calculates the remainder of N divided by kari and stores it in r.
If q is equal to r, it adds kari to ans.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 4.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
#D問題
#D問題
import math
N=int(input())
n=int(math.sqrt(N))
plist=[]
for i in range(1,n+1):
    if N%i == 0:
        plist.append(i)
        if i!= int(N/i):
            plist.append(int(N/i))
ans=0
for i in range(len(plist)):
    x=plist[i]
    kari=int(N/x)-1
    if kari == 0:
        pass
    else:
        q=int(N/kari)-1
        r=N%kari
        if q == r:
            ans+=kari
print(ans)
            

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```8
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
