The variable N is initialized to 2.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 2*N+1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 4.
For each number n in this range, it enters another loop that iterates from 1 to N+1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 2.
For each number w in this range, it tries to calculate the value of h.
If h is not equal to 0, the code prints the value of h, n and w.
If h is equal to 0, the code exits.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import sys
N=int(input())
for n in range(1,2*N+1):
  for w in range(1,N+1):
    try:
      h = w*n*N // (4*w*n-(n+w)*N)
    except:
      continue
    if h>0 and h*(4*w*n-(n+w)*N) - w*n*N == 0:
      print(h,n,w)
      sys.exit()
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
