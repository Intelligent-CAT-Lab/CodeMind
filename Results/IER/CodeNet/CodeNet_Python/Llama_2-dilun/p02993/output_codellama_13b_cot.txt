The variable s is initialized to 3776.
The function f takes the input string s and returns "Bad" if it contains a repeated character. Otherwise, it returns "Good".
The code then prints the output of the function f.
<<<Output>>>
Good

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(s):
	for u,v in zip(s,s[1:]):
		if u == v:return 'Bad'
	return 'Good'
print f(s)  
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3776
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
