The input is 1 3 8.
The code splits the input into three parts, a, b and c.
The code then checks if a is less than b and b is less than c.
Since a is 1, b is 3 and c is 8, the condition is met.
The code prints "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes

Consider the following code:
<Code>
input_line = raw_input().split()

a = int(input_line[0])
b = int(input_line[1])
c = int(input_line[2])

if( (a<b)and(b<c) ):
	print 'Yes'
else:
	print 'No'
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 3 8
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
