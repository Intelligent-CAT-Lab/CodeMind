The input is 5 7 5.
The code first splits the input into three strings A, B and C.
Then it checks if A, B and C are equal to each other.
If they are, it prints "No".
Otherwise, it checks if A, B and C are not equal to each other.
If they are, it prints "No".
Otherwise, it prints "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes

[INST]
    Consider the following code:
<Code>
A,B,C = input().split()
if A == B and B == C:
    print("No")
elif A!= B and B!= C and C!= A:
    print("No")
else:
    print("Yes")
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 7 5
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
