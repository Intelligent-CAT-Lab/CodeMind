The variable n is initialized to 100.
The code calculates the value of c by adding the values of n//25, n//10, n//5 and n%5.
The value of n//25 is 4, the value of n//10 is 10, the value of n//5 is 20 and the value of n%5 is 0.
The value of c is 4+10+20+0 = 34.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
n = int(input())
c = 0
c += n//25
n %= 25
c += n//10
n %= 10
c += n//5
c += n%5
print(c)

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```100
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
