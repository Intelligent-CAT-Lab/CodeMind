The variable H and variable W are initialized to 3 and 5, respectively.
The code then calls the function pat1, which returns 0 if H is divisible by 3, and returns W otherwise.
The code then calls the function pat2, which returns 0 if W is divisible by 3, and returns H otherwise.
The code then calls the function pat3, which calculates the minimum value of the following three values:

H * W
H * (W - w)
(H // 2) * (W - w)

where w is the value of W // 2.
The code then calls the function pat4, which calculates the minimum value of the following three values:

W * h
(W - w) * (H - h)
(W // 2) * (H - h)

where h is the value of H // 2.
The code then returns the minimum value of all the above values.
The minimum value is 10^15, which is the minimum value of the following three values:

0
0
10^15

    Consider the following code:

        return 0
    else:

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 5
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
