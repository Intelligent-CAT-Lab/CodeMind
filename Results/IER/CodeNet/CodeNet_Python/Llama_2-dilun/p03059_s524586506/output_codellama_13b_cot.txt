The variable A, variable B and variable T are initialized to 3, 5 and 7, respectively.
The code calculates the value of T + 0.5 and divides it by A. The result is rounded to the nearest integer.
The result is then multiplied by B to get the final output.
The final output is 1.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
A, B, T = map(int, input().split())
print(int((T + 0.5) // A * B))
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 5 7
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
