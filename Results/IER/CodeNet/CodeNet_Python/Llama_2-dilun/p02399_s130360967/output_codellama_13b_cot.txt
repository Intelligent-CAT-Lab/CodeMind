The variable a and variable b are initialized to 3 and 2, respectively.
The variable d is initialized to 3 // 2, which is 1.
The variable r is initialized to 3 % 2, which is 1.
The variable f is initialized to 3 / 2, which is 1.5.
The code then prints the output:

Consider the following code:
<Code>
a, b = map(int, input().split())
d = a // b
r = a % b
f = a / b
print(f'{d} {r} {f:.5f}')

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
