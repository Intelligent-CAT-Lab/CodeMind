The variable c is initialized to a.
The code checks if c is in the set 'aeiou'.
If it is, it prints 'vowel'.
If it is not, it prints 'consonant'.
<<<Output>>>
vowel

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
c = input()

if c in 'aeiou':
    print('vowel')
else:
    print('consonant')
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```a
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
