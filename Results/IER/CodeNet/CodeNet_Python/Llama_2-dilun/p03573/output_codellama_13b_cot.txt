The variable a, b and c are initialized to 5, 7 and 5, respectively.
The code checks if a equals b. Since a is 5 and b is 7, the condition is not met.
The code then checks if b equals c. Since b is 7 and c is 5, the condition is met.
The code prints 7.
<<<Output>>>
7

Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b,c=map(int,input().split())
if a==b:
    print(c)
elif b==c:
    print(a)
else:
    print(b)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 7 5
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
