The variable A, B, C, X and Y are initialized to 1500, 2000, 1600, 3 and 2, respectively.
The variable mi is initialized to the minimum of X and Y, which is 3 in this case.
The variable a is initialized to A*X+B*Y, which is 1500*3+2000*2, which is 1500+4000, which is 5500.
The variable b is initialized to mi*C*2+A*(X-mi)+B*(Y-mi), which is 3*1600*2+1500*(3-3)+2000*(2-3), which is 3200+1500+4000, which is 8700.
The variable c is initialized to max(X,Y)*C*2, which is 2000*1600*2, which is 32000.
The code then prints the minimum of a, b and c, which is 5500.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
A,B,C,X,Y = map(int,input().split())

mi = min(X,Y)
a = A*X+B*Y
b = mi*C*2+A*(X-mi)+B*(Y-mi)
c = max(X,Y)*C*2

print(min(a,b,c))
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1500 2000 1600 3 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
