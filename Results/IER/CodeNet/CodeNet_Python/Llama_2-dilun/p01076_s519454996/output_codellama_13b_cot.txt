The variable n and variable d are initialized to 4 and 3, respectively.
If d is 1, the code prints the value of n*(n-1)//2, which is 6.
Otherwise, the code prints the value of ((n-1)+(n-d-1)*n-((n-d-1)*(n+d-2)//2)), which is 12.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
# AOJ 1591 Graph Making
# Python3 2018.7.13 bal4u
 
n, d = map(int, input().split())
if d == 1: print(n*(n-1)//2)
else: print((n-1)+(n-d-1)*n-((n-d-1)*(n+d-2)//2))

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
