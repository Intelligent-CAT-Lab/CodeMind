The variable n and variable k are initialized to 7 and 4, respectively.
The code calculates the remainder of n divided by k, which is 3.
The code then prints the minimum of n, 3 and the absolute value of 3-4, which is 1.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
n, k = map(int,input().split())
a = n % k
print(min(n,a,abs(a-k)))
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```7 4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
