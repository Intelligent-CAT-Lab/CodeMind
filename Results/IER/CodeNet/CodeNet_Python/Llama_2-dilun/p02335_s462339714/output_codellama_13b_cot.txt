The input is 3 5.
The function run() is called.
The variables n and k are initialized to 3 and 5, respectively.
The condition n > k is checked. Since n is 3 and k is 5, the condition is not met.
The function returns 0.

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 5
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
