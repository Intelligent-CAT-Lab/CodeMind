The code first calculates the number of digits in the input, which is 2.
Then it calls the function judge to calculate the two functions h1 and h2.
The code then iterates over all possible pairs of numbers (x,y) in the range [0, N*2) and checks if the two functions h1 and h2 are both true.
If so, it prints the number x and y.
The code continues to iterate until it finds N*N pairs of numbers that satisfy the condition.

The output of the code is:
```0 0
1 1
2 2
3 3
4 4

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
from math import sqrt
from itertools import product

import numpy as np

def judge(D):
  n = 1
  while D%4==0:
    n *= 2
    D //= 4

  def h1(x,y):
    return ~(x//n+y//n)%2
  def h2(x,y):
    return ~(x//n)%2

  return h1 if D%2==1 else h2

N,D1,D2 = map(int,input().split())
j1,j2 = judge(D1),judge(D2)
cnt = 0
for x,y in product(range(N*2),repeat=2):
  if j1(x,y) and j2(x,y):
    print(x,y)
    cnt += 1
    if cnt >= N*N:
      break

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 1 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
