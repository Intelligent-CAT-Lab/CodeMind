The code first reads the input N, which is 4 in this case.
It then calculates the sum of divisors of each number from 1 to 4.
The sum of divisors of 1 is 1, 2 is 2, 3 is 3 and 4 is 4.
The sum of divisors of 1, 2, 3 and 4 is 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively.
The code then calculates the sum of the sum of divisors of each number from 1 to 4.
The sum of the sum of divisors of 1, 2, 3 and 4 is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10.
The code then prints the sum of the sum of divisors of each number from 1 to 4, which is 10.
