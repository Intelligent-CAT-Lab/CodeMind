The variable n is initialized to 54.
The variable ret is initialized to 1.
The variable i is initialized to 0.
The code enters a loop that iterates while ret <= n, meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 54.
The variable ret is set to 2**i, which is 2 raised to the power of i.
The variable i is incremented by 1.
The code prints the value of ret//2, which is 2.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
n = int(input())
ret = 1
i = 0
while ret <= n:
    ret = 2**i
    i += 1
print(ret//2)

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```54
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
