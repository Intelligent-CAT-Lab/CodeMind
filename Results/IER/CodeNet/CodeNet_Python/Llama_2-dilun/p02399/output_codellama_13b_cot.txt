The variable a and variable b are initialized to 3 and 2, respectively.
The code then prints the output of the code.
The output is:

Consider the following code:
<Code>
a, b = map(int, raw_input().split())
 
print "%d %d %f" % (a / b, a % b, float(a)/ b)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
