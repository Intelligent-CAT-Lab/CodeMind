The input is 5 4 2 2 1.
The first line of code initializes i to a list of 5 integers.
The second line of code checks if i[2] + i[4] <= i[0].
Since i[2] + i[4] = 4 + 2 = 6 <= 5, the condition is met.
The third line of code checks if i[2] - i[4] >= 0.
Since i[2] - i[4] = 4 - 2 = 2 >= 0, the condition is met.
The fourth line of code checks if i[3] + i[4] <= i[1].
Since i[3] + i[4] = 2 + 2 = 4 <= 1, the condition is met.
The fifth line of code checks if i[3] - i[4] >= 0.
Since i[3] - i[4] = 2 - 2 = 0 >= 0, the condition is met.
The code prints "Yes".

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
i = list(map(int, input().split()))

if i[2] + i[4] <= i[0]:
    if i[2] - i[4] >= 0:
        if i[3] + i[4] <= i[1]:
            if i[3] - i[4] >= 0:
                print("Yes")
            else:
                print("No")
        else:
            print("No")
    else:
        print("No")
else:
    print("No")

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 4 2 2 1
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
