The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 5, 3 and 2, respectively.
The function solve() is called.
The condition A + B - 1 <= N and N <= A * B is checked.
The condition is met when A = 1 and B = 2.
The function solve() returns the list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].

N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
def solve():
    if A + B - 1 <= N and N <= A * B:
        if A == 1:

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 3 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
