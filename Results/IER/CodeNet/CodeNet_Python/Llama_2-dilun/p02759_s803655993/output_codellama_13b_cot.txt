The variable n is initialized to 5.
The code checks if n is odd. If it is, it calculates the sum of n and 1, and then divides the result by 2.
If n is even, it simply divides n by 2.
The code then prints the result.
<<<Output>>>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
n=int(input())
if n%2!=0:
  s=(n+1)//2
else:
  s=n//2
print(s)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
