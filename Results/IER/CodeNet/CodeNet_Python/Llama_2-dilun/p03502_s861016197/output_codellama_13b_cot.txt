The variable n is initialized to 12.
The variable _sum is initialized to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the length of n, which is 2 in this case.
For each character in n, the code calculates its integer value and adds it to _sum.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if the sum of the digits of n is equal to the value of n itself.
If it is, the code prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".
In this case, the sum of the digits of n is 3, which is not equal to the value of n itself, so the code prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No

Consider the following code:
<Code>
n=input()
_sum=0
for i in range(len(n)):
    _sum+=int(n[i])
print('Yes') if int(n)%_sum==0 else print('No')
</Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```12
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
