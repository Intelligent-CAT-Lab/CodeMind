The variable a and variable b are initialized to 9 and 12, respectively.
The code then prints the result of (a + b) % 24, which is 11.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b = map(int,input().split())

print((a + b) % 24)

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```9 12
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
