The code first reads the input and stores it in variables n and k.
The code then initializes l and r to 0 and k+1, respectively.
The code then enters a while loop that iterates until l+1 is greater than r.
In each iteration, the code calculates the middle value m by dividing the difference between l and r by 2.
If the condition ok(m) is True, the code updates l to m.
Otherwise, the code updates r to m.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of l, which is 1.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def main():
    n,k=MI()
    l=0
    r=k+1
    while l+1<r:
        m=(l+r)//2
        if ok(m):l=m
        else:r=m
    print(l)

main()

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 1
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
