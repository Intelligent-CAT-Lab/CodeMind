The code reads the input from stdin and stores it in the variable S.
The code then calculates the length of S and stores it in the variable n.
The code then iterates over the elements of S and calculates the number of elements in the subsequence that are greater than the previous element.
The code then iterates over the elements of S in reverse order and calculates the number of elements in the subsequence that are less than the previous element.
The code then calculates the maximum of the two numbers for each element of S and stores it in the variable seq.
The code then calculates the sum of the elements of seq and prints it.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
from sys import stdin
S = str(stdin.readline().rstrip())
#l = list(map(int, stdin.readline().rstrip().split()))
#A, B, C = map(int, stdin.readline().rstrip().split())
#S = [list(map(int, stdin.readline().rstrip().split())) for _ in range(h)]#hの定義を忘れずに

n = len(S)+1
sho = [0]*n
dai = [0]*n

for i,s in enumerate(S):
    i += 1
    if s ==">":
        sho[i] = 0
    else:
        sho[i] = sho[i-1] + 1

for i,s in enumerate(S[::-1]):
    i = n-i-2
    if s == "<":
        dai[i]=0
    else:
        dai[i] = dai[i+1] +1

seq = [max(x,y) for x,y in zip(sho,dai)]

print(sum(seq))

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```<>>
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
