The variable X is initialized to 10.
The variable answer is initialized to 0.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to the ceiling of the square root of X (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 3.
For each number i in this range, it enters a nested loop that iterates from 2 to 11 (inclusive).
For each number j in this range, it checks if i**j is less than or equal to X. If it is, it sets answer to be the maximum of i**j and answer.
The condition is met when i is 1, 2 or 3 and j is 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of answer, which is 100.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import math
X = int(input())
answer = 0
for i in range(1,math.ceil(X**0.5)+1):
  for j in range(2,11):
    if i**j <= X:
      answer = max(i**j,answer)

print(answer)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
