The variable N and variable K are initialized to 2 and 2, respectively.
The code then prints the value of K multiplied by the value of K raised to the power of N-1.
The value of K is 2, and the value of N is 2.
Therefore, the output is 2*2 = 4.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
N,K=map(int,input().split())
print(K*((K-1)**(N-1)))
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
