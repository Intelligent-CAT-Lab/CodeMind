<<<Analysis>>>
The variable a is initialized to a list of integers.
The input is split into a list of strings.
For each string in the list, it is converted to an integer.
The first and second elements of the list are compared.
If they are equal, the code prints "Yes".
Otherwise, it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No

[INST]
Consider the following code:
<Code>
a = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
if a[0] == a[1]:
  print('Yes')
else:
  print('No')
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
