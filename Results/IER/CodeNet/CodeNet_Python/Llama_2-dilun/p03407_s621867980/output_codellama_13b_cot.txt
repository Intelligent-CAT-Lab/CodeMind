The variable A, B and C are initialized to 50, 100 and 120, respectively.
The code then prints the string 'Yes' if A+B>=C else 'No'.
The condition is met when A+B>=C, which is true when A=50 and B=100.
The output is 'Yes'.
<<<Output>>>
Yes

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
A,B,C=map(int,input().split())
print('Yes' if A+B>=C else 'No')
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```50 100 120
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
