The code first initializes the variables N and M to 2 and 2, respectively.
The code then calls the function solve, which is defined in the code.
The function solve takes two arguments, N and M, and returns the value of the expression:
(M-k)!/(k!(N-k)!) * N!M!/((M-N)!^2)

The code then calls the function naive, which is also defined in the code.
The function naive takes two arguments, N and M, and returns the value of the expression:
sum(all(a!= b for a,b in zip(A,B)) for A in permutations(range(M),N) for B in permutations(range(M),N))

The code then prints the value of the expression returned by the function solve.
The value of the expression is 12, which is the output of the code.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>

def solve(N,M):
    fac,inv = factorials_with_inv(max(N,M), MOD)

    # (M-k)!/(k!(N-k)!) * N!M!/((M-N)!^2)

    res = 0
    sign = True
    for k in range(N+1):
        t = fac[M-k]*inv[k]*inv[N-k]
        if sign:
            res += t
        else:
            res -= t
        res %= MOD
        sign = not sign

    res *= fac[N]*fac[M]*inv[M-N]**2
    res %= MOD
    return res

from itertools import permutations

def naive(N,M):
    res = 0
    for A in permutations(range(M),N):
        for B in permutations(range(M),N):
            res += all(a!= b for a,b in zip(A,B))
    return res%MOD

if __name__ == '__main__':
    N,M = map(int,input().split())

    # print(naive(N,M))
    print(solve(N,M))
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
