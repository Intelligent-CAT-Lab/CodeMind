The variable n, variable a and variable b are initialized to 4, 4 and 6, respectively.
The code checks if n is greater than or equal to 2. Since n is 4, the condition is met.
The code then checks if b is greater than or equal to a. Since b is 6 and a is 4, the condition is met.
The code then calculates (n-2)*(b-a)+1, which is 1*2+1, which is 3.
The code then prints 3.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
n, a, b = map(int,input().split())

if n >= 2:
    if b >= a:
        print((n-2)*(b-a)+1)
    else:
        print(0)
else:
    if a == b:
        print(1)
    else:
        print(0)

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4 4 6
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
