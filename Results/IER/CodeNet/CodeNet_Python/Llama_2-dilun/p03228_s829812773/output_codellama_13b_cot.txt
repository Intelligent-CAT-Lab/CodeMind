The variable a, b and k are initialized to 5, 4 and 2, respectively.
The code then enters a loop that iterates k times.
The loop checks if the current iteration is even or odd. If it is even, it calls the function play(a, b) to swap the values of a and b.
If it is odd, it calls the function play(b, a) to swap the values of a and b.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the values of a and b, which are 2 and 4.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def main():
    a, b, k = [int(s) for s in input().split()]

    for i in range(k):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            a, b = play(a, b)
        else:
            b, a = play(b, a)

    print(a, b)

def play(a, b):
    return (a // 2, b + a // 2)

main()

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 4 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
