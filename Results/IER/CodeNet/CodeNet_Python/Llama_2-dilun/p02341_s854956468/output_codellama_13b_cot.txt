The variable n and variable k are initialized to 5 and 10, respectively.
The code then prints 0 if n is greater than k, otherwise it prints 1.
In this case, n is 5 and k is 10. Since n is less than k, the code prints 1.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
n, k = map(int, input().split())
print(0 if n > k else 1)

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 10
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
