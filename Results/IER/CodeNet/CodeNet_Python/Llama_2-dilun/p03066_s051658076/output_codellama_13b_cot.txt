The variable N, variable X are initialized to 3, 3, respectively.
The variable P is initialized to 998244353.

The variable A is initialized to a 2D array with the following dimensions:
A[i][j] is the number of permutations of 1's and 2's whose length is i and whose sum is j.
A[0][0] is initialized to 1.
The variable B is initialized to a 1D array with the following dimensions:
B[i] is the number of permutations of 1's and 2's with length i none of whose consecutive subsequenses is equal to X.

The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to N+1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 3.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the number of permutations of 1's and 2's with length i and whose sum is j.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from i to min(2*i+1, X) (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 6.
For each number j in this range, it adds the number of permutations of 1's and 2's with length i and whose sum is j to the variable B[i].

The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to X (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 3.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the number of permutations of 1's and 2's with length i and whose sum is 2X or more.
If X is odd, it adds 1 to the variable B[i].

The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to X (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 3.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the number of permutations of 1's and 2's with length i and whose sum is X <= Sum < 2X.
It then calculates the number of permutations of 1's and 2's with length a and whose sum is a+1.
It then calculates the number of permutations of 1's and 2's with length a+1 and whose sum is a+2.
It then adds the number of permutations of 1's and 2's with length a and whose sum is a+1 to the variable B[k].
It then adds the number of permutations of 1's and 2's with length a+1 and whose sum is a+2 to the variable B[k].
It then checks if the variable B[k] is greater than or equal to P.
If it is, it subtracts P from the variable B[k].

The code then calculates the sum of the numbers in the variable B.
It then calculates the remainder of the sum divided by P.
It then prints the remainder.

The output is 1.
