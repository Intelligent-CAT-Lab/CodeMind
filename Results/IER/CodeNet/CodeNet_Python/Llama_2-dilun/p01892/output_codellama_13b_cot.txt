The variable a, variable b and variable n are initialized to 19, 30 and 3, respectively.
The variable score is initialized to abs(a - b), which is 11.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 3.
For each number x in this range, it enters another loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 3.
For each number y in this range, the code checks if b * x % y == 0, which is true when x is 3 and y is 1.
In this case, the code calculates new_a = b * x // y, which is 10.
The code then calculates the minimum of score and abs(a - new_a), which is 10.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of score, which is 10.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
a, b, n = map(int, input().split())
score = abs(a - b)
for x in range(1, n + 1):
  for y in range(1, n + 1):
    if b * x % y == 0:
      new_a = b * x // y
      score = min(score, abs(a - new_a))
print(score)

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```19 30 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
