The code first takes the input as a string and stores it in variable S.
It then iterates through the string and checks if the character is a dot or a left parenthesis.
If it is a dot, it stores the index of the dot in variable o.
If it is a left parenthesis, it stores the index of the left parenthesis in variable p.
It also stores the string before the left parenthesis in variable sub.
It then calculates the length of the string after the dot, which is 3.
It also calculates the length of the string after the left parenthesis, which is 1.
It then checks if the left parenthesis is present. If it is, it calculates the length of the string after the left parenthesis, which is 2.
It then calculates the difference between the length of the string after the dot and the length of the string after the left parenthesis, which is 3 - 2 = 1.
It then checks if the left parenthesis is present. If it is, it calculates the difference between the length of the string after the left parenthesis and the length of the string after the dot, which is 1 - 3 = -2.
It then checks if the left parenthesis is present. If it is, it calculates the difference between the length of the string after the left parenthesis and the length of the string after the dot, which is 2 - 3 = -1.
It then checks if the left parenthesis is present. If it is, it calculates the difference between the length of the string after the left parenthesis and the length of the string after the dot, which is 1 - 3 = -2.
