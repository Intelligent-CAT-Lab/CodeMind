The variable a, variable b and variable k are initialized to 5, 4 and 2, respectively.
The variable turn is initialized to 0.
The code enters a loop that iterates k times.
In the first iteration, the variable turn is 0.
If the variable a is even, the code adds a//2 to b and subtracts a//2 from a.
If the variable a is odd, the code subtracts 1 from a and adds a//2 to b.
After the first iteration, the variable turn is 1.
In the second iteration, the variable turn is 1.
If the variable b is even, the code adds b//2 to a and subtracts b//2 from b.
If the variable b is odd, the code subtracts 1 from b and adds b//2 to a.
After the second iteration, the variable turn is 0.
The code repeats this process k times.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final values of a and b, which are 1 and 2.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b,k=map(int,input().split())
turn=0
for i in range(k):
    if(turn==0):
        if(a%2==0):
            b+=a//2
            a-=a//2
        else:
            a-=1
            b+=a//2
            a-=a//2
        turn=1
    else:
        if(b%2==0):
            a+=b//2
            b-=b//2
        else:
            b-=1
            a+=b//2
            b-=b//2
        turn=0
print(a,b)

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 4 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
