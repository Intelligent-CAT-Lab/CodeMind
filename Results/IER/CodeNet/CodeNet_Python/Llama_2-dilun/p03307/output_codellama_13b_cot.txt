The variable n is initialized to 3.
The code checks if n is even. If it is, it prints n. Otherwise, it prints 2 * n.
The code prints 3.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
n = int(input())
if n % 2 == 0:
    print(n)
else:
    print(2 * n)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
