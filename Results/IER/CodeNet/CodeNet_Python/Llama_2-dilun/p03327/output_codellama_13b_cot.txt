The variable n is initialized to 999.
The code checks if n is less than 1000. If it is, it prints "ABC".
Otherwise, it prints "ABD".
<<<Output>>>
ABD

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
# -*- coding:utf-8 -*-
if __name__ == "__main__":
    n = int(input())
    if n < 1000:
        print("ABC")
    else:
        print("ABD")
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```999
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
