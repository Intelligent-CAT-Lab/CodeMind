The variable n is initialized to 4.
The variable nums is initialized to a list of numbers from 1 to 4, inclusive.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of curr_sum.
The code iterates through the list nums and calculates the sum of curr_sum for each number.
The sum of curr_sum is calculated by multiplying the number by the number of times it appears in the list, then dividing by 2.
The code prints the final value of ans, which is 10.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>

def main():
    n = int(input())
    nums = list(range(1,n+1))
    ans = 0
    for num in nums:
        cnt = n//num
        curr_sum = cnt*(2*num+(cnt-1)*num)//2
        ans += curr_sum
    print(ans)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
