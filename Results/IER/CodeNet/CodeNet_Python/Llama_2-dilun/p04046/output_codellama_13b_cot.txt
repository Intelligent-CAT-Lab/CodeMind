The variable H, W, A and B are initialized to 2, 3, 1 and 1, respectively.
The variable MOD is initialized to 10 ** 9 + 7.
The variable factorial is initialized to [1], which will be used to store the factorial of numbers.
The variable inv_factorial is initialized to [1], which will be used to store the inverse of the factorial of numbers.

The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to H+W+1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 5.
For each number i in this range, it appends the factorial of i to the list factorial and the inverse of the factorial of i to the list inv_factorial.

The code then defines a function f that takes two arguments h and w, and returns the product of the factorial of h+w-2 and the inverse of the factorial of h-1 and w-1, both modulo MOD.

The code then enters a loop that iterates from B+1 to W+1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 2 to 5.
For each number i in this range, it adds the product of f(H-A, i) and f(A, W-i+1) to the variable answer, which is initialized to 0.
The product is calculated modulo MOD.

After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of answer, which is 10.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import math


def f(n):
    return (n * (n+1) // 2) % 1000000007


def g(n):
    return (n * (n+1) // 2) % 1000000007


def h(n):
    return (n * (n+1) // 2) % 1000000007


def main():
    n = int(input())
    print(f(n))
    print(g(n))
    print(h(n))


main()

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The variable n is initialized to 10, which will be used as the input to the function f.
The function f calculates the product of n and (n+1) // 2, both modulo 1000000007.
The function g calculates the product of n and (n+1) // 2, both modulo 1000000007.
The function h calculates the product of n and (n+1) // 2, both modulo 1000000007.

The function main takes the input n and prints the output of f, g and h, all modulo 1000000007.

After the function main finishes, the code prints the output of f, g and h, which are 10, 10 and 10, respectively.
