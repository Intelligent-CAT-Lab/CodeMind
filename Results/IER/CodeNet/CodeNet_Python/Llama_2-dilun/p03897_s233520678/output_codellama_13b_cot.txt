The code first reads the input N, which is 2 in this case.
The code then initializes a 2x2 array grid to all zeros.
The code then sets the values of grid[::2,::2] and grid[1::2,1::2] to 1.
The code then sets the values of grid[::6,1::6] and grid[::6,5::6] to 1.
The code then sets the values of grid[2::6,1::6] and grid[2::6,3::6] to 1.
The code then sets the values of grid[4::6,3::6] and grid[4::6,5::6] to 1.
The code then sets the values of grid[0,:] and grid[-1,:] to 1.
The code then sets the values of grid[:,0] and grid[:,-1] to 1.
The code then sets the values of grid[::2,::2] and grid[1::2,1::2] to 0.

The code then finds the indices of the 1s in the grid.
The code then prints the number of indices, which is 1 in this case.
The code then prints the indices of the 1s in the grid.

The output is:
```1
(0, 0)
```

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import sys
readline = sys.stdin.readline
readlines = sys.stdin.readlines

N = int(readline())

grid = np.zeros((N,N),np.int8)

grid[::2,::2] = 1
grid[1::2,1::2] = 1

grid[::6,1::6] = 1
grid[::6,5::6] = 1
grid[2::6,1::6] = 1
grid[2::6,3::6] = 1
grid[4::6,3::6] = 1
grid[4::6,5::6] = 1

grid[0,:] = 1
grid[-1,:] = 1
grid[:,0] = 1
grid[:,-1] = 1

grid[::2,::2] = 0
grid[1::2,1::2] = 0

x,y = np.where(grid==1)

print(len(x))
for cell in zip(x,y):
    print(*cell)

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
