The variable a, b and k are initialized to 2, 3 and 3, respectively.
The code checks if a is greater than or equal to k. If it is, it prints the difference between a and k, followed by b.
The code checks if a + b is greater than or equal to k. If it is, it prints 0, followed by the sum of a and b minus k.
The code checks if neither of the above conditions is met. If it is, it prints 0, followed by 0.
The output is 0, 3.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
a, b, k=map(int, input().split())
if a>=k:
  print(a-k, b)
elif a+b>=k:
  print(0, a+b-k)
else: 
  print(0, 0)

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 3 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
