The input is a list of characters.
The code converts the input to a list of strings.
The code then counts the number of strings that contain '2'.
The output is 2.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
n = list(input())
print(n.count('2'))
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1222
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
