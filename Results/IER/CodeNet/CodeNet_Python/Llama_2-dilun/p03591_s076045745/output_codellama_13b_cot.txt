The variable S is initialized to "YAKINIKU".
The code checks if the first 4 characters of S are "YAKI".
Since "YAKINIKU" starts with "YAKI", the condition is met and the code prints "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
S = input()
if S[:4] == "YAKI":
    print("Yes")
else:
    print("No")
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```YAKINIKU
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
