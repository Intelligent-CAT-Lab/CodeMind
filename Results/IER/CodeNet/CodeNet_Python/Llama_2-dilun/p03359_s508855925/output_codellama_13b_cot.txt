The variable a and variable b are initialized to 5 and 5, respectively.
The code then prints the value of a-1+(int)(a<=b).
The value of a-1 is 4.
The value of a<=b is 1.
The value of a-1+(int)(a<=b) is 4+1, which is 5.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b=map(int,input().split())
print(a-1+(int)(a<=b))

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 5
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
