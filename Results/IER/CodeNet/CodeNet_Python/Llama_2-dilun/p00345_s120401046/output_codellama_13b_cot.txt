The code first splits the input into two parts, x and y.
x is 0 and y is 3.
The code then checks if y[-1] is not ')', which is not true.
The code then calculates p = x * 1000 + y, which is 0 * 1000 + 3, which is 3000.
The code then calculates q = 1000, which is 1000.
The code then calls the solve function with p and q as arguments.
The solve function calculates the GCD of p and q, which is 1000.
The code then calculates p = p // GCD, which is 3000 // 1000, which is 3.
The code then calculates q = q // GCD, which is 1000 // 1000, which is 1.
The code then prints p and q, which is 3/1.

<<<Output>>>
3/1

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
from math import gcd


def solve(p, q):
    GCD = gcd(p, q)
    p = p // GCD
    q = q // GCD
    print(p, q, sep="/")


s = input()
x, y = s.split('.')
if(y[-1]!= ')'):
    p = int(x) * pow(10, len(y)) + int(y)
    q = pow(10, len(y))
    solve(p, q)

else:
    y, z = y.split('(')[0], y.split('(')[1][:-1]
    a = int(x+y+z)
    b = int(x+y)
    solve(a-b, (pow(10, len(z))-1)*pow(10, len(y)))


<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```0.(3)
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
