The variable n and variable k are initialized to 1 and 1, respectively.
The variable l is initialized to 0, which will be used to store the lower bound of the range.
The variable r is initialized to k+1, which will be used to store the upper bound of the range.
The code then enters a loop that iterates while the difference between the upper and lower bound is greater than 1.
In this case, the loop will iterate 10 times.
For each iteration, the code calculates the midpoint of the range, which is the average of the lower and upper bound.
It then calculates the sum of the midpoint and all the numbers from 1 to n-1.
If the sum is greater than k, it sets the upper bound to the midpoint.
Otherwise, it sets the lower bound to the midpoint.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of l, which is 1.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
n,k=map(int,input().split())
l,r=0,k+1
while r-l>1:
  m=(l+r)//2
  res = m
  t = m
  for i in range(n-1):
    t //= 2
    res += t
    if t == 0:
      break
  if res > k:
    r = m
  else:
    l = m
print(l)

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 1
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
