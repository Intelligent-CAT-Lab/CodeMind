The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 5, 2 and 4, respectively.
The code then checks if the absolute difference between A and B is even. If it is, it prints the absolute difference divided by 2.
Otherwise, it checks if A is less than N minus B. If it is, it prints A minus 1 plus the absolute difference divided by 2.
Otherwise, it prints N minus B plus 1 plus the absolute difference divided by 2.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import sys

input = sys.stdin.readline
MOD = 1000000007

N,A,B = map(int,input().split())

if abs(A-B)%2 == 0:
    print(abs(A-B)//2)
else:
    if (A-1) < (N-B):
        print((A-1)+1+(B-A-1)//2)
    else:
        print((N-B)+1+(B-A-1)//2)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 2 4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
