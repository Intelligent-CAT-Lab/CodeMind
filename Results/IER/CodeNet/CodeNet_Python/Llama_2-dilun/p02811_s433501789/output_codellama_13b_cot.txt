The variable K and variable N are initialized to 2 and 900, respectively.
The code checks if 500 * K is greater than or equal to N.
Since 500 * 2 is 1000, which is greater than 900, the condition is met and the code prints "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes

Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())
for i in range(1,N+1):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        print(i)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The variable N is initialized to 10.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 10.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is even. If it is, it prints i.
The condition is met when i is 2,4,6,8 and 10.
After the loop finishes, the code prints nothing.
