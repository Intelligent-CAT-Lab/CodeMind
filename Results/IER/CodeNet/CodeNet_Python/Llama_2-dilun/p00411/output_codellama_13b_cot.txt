The variable a, t and r are initialized to 180, 120 and 90, respectively.
The code calculates the product of r and t, which is 10800.
The code then calculates the quotient of the product and a, which is 6.25.
The code then prints the result with 6 decimal places, which is 6.250000.
<<<Output>>>
6.250000

Consider the following code:
<Code>
a, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())
ans = 0
for i in range(a, b+1):
    for j in range(c, d+1):
        if i*j == ans:
            break
        ans += 1
print(ans)
</Code>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10 100 1000 10000```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
