The variable n is initialized to 5.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 5.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import math

def main():
    n = int(input())
    _debt = 100000
    for i in range(n):
        _debt += math.ceil(_debt*0.05*0.001)*1000
    print(_debt)



if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
