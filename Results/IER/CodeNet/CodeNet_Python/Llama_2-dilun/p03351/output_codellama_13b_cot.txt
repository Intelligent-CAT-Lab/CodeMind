The variable a, b, c and d are initialized to 4, 7, 9 and 3, respectively.
The code then prints the string "YNeos" with the following condition:

```
YNeos[not (abs(a-c)<=d or abs(a-b)<=d and abs(b-c)<=d)::2]
```

The condition is true when the absolute difference between a and c is greater than d or the absolute difference between a and b is greater than d and the absolute difference between b and c is greater than d.

In this case, the condition is true when a is 4, c is 7 and d is 3.

The output is "YNeos".

Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b,c,d=map(int, input().split())
print("YNeos"[not (abs(a-c)<=d or abs(a-b)<=d and abs(b-c)<=d)::2])
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4 7 9 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
