The variable a and variable p are initialized to 1 and 3, respectively.
The variable piece is initialized to p + 3 * a, which is 3 + 3 * 1, which is 4.
The variable piece is then divided by 2, which is 2.
The variable piece is then rounded to the nearest integer, which is 2.
The variable piece is then printed.
<<<Output>>>
2

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b,c=map(int,input().split())
if a==b==c:
    print("YES")
else:
    print("NO")
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 1 1
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized to 1, 1 and 1, respectively.
The code checks if a == b == c, which is true.
The code then prints "YES".
<<<Output>>>
