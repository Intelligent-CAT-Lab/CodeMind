The variable x and variable t are initialized to 100 and 17, respectively.
The code then prints the value of x-t if x-t is greater than 0, otherwise it prints 0.
The value of x-t is 83, which is greater than 0.
Therefore, the code prints 83.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
x, t = map(int, input().split())
print(x-t if x-t > 0 else 0)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```100 17
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
