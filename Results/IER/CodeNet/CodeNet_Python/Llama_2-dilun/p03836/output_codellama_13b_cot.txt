The variables sx, sy, tx, ty are initialized to 0, 0, 1, 2, respectively.
The code calculates the difference between tx and sx, which is 1, and the difference between ty and sy, which is 2.
The code then calculates the number of "U"s and "R"s needed to print the order.
The number of "U"s is equal to the difference between ty and sy, which is 2.
The number of "R"s is equal to the difference between tx and sx, which is 1.
The code then prints the order, which is "LURDRULURD".
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
sx,sy,tx,ty = map(int,input().split())
x = (tx-sx)
y = (ty-sy)

order = "L"

order += "U"*(y+1)
order += "R"*(x+1)
order += "D"

order += "R"
order += "D"*(y+1)
order += "L"*(x+1)
order += "U"

order += "U"*y
order += "R"*x
order += "D"*y
order += "L"*x
print(order)

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```0 0 1 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
