The variable a, b and c are initialized to 1000, 3000 and 3000, respectively.
The code checks if c is less than or equal to a. If it is, it prints 0.
If c is not less than or equal to a, the code checks if c is less than or equal to a+b. If it is, it prints c-a.
If c is not less than or equal to a+b, it prints NA.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b,c=map(int,input().split())
if c <= a:
 print("0")
elif c <= a+b:
 print(c-a)
else:
 print("NA")
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1000 3000 3000
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
