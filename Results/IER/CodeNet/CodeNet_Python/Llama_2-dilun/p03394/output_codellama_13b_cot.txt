The variable N is initialized to 3.
The code then initializes two lists P2 and P3.
P2 is initialized to a list of 5000 lists, each of which is initialized to [0, 0, 0].
P3 is initialized to a list of 2500 lists, each of which is initialized to [0, 0].
The variable limit is initialized to 30000.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 4999 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 4999.
For each number i in this range, the code calculates the values of P2[i] and P3[i] and stores them in the corresponding lists.
The code then checks if N is equal to 3. If it is, it prints the values of 2, 3 and 25.
The code then checks if N is equal to 4. If it is, it prints the values of 2, 3, 4 and 9.
The code then checks if N is equal to 6. If it is, it prints the values of 2, 3, 4, 6, 9 and 12.
Otherwise, the code enters a function SP(N) that returns a list of lists.
The function SP(N) first checks if N is equal to 19999. If it is, it initializes the list P to be the concatenation of P2 and P3.
It then sets P[0] to be [4, 8].
The function then checks if N is less than or equal to 12500. If it is, it sets the variable _k to be equal to the maximum value of N - 12500.
The function then sets N to be equal to N - 3 * _k.
It then checks if N is equal to 0. If it is, it returns the list P.
Otherwise, it checks if N is equal to 5. If it is, it sets the variable k to be equal to N // 5.
It then sets the variable m to be equal to N % 5.
If m is equal to 0, the function sets the list P to be the concatenation of P2[:k + _k] and P3[:k].
If m is equal to 1, the function sets the list P to be the concatenation of P2[:k + 1 + _k] and P3[:k - 1].
If m is equal to 2, the function sets the list P to be the concatenation of P2[:k + _k] and P3[:k + 1].
If m is equal to 3, the function sets the list P to be the concatenation of P2[:k + 1 + _k] and P3[:k].
If k is greater than or equal to 2499, the function sets the list P to be the concatenation of P2[:k + 2 + _k] and P3[:k - 1].
Otherwise, the function sets the list P to be the concatenation of P2[:k + _k] and P3[:k + 2].
The function then returns the list P.
The code then prints the string representation of the list P.
