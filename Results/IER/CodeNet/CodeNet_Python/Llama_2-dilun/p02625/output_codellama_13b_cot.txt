The variable n and variable m are initialized to 2 and 2, respectively.
The variable d is initialized to a list of 1s, which will be used to store the result of the calculation.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 1.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the value of d[i+1] using the formula:
d[i+1] = ((m-i)*((m-n+i)*d[i]+i*d[i-1]*(m-i+1)))%(10**9+7)
The code then prints the final value of d[-1], which is 1.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
n,m=map(int,input().split())
d=[1]*(n+1)
for i in range(n):
  d[i+1]=((m-i)*((m-n+i)*d[i]+i*d[i-1]*(m-i+1)))%(10**9+7)
print(d[-1])

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
