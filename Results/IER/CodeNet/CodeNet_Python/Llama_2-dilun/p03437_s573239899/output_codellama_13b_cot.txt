The input is 8 6.
The code first splits the input into two strings, x and y.
Then it converts each string into an integer.
The code then checks if x is divisible by y.
If it is, it prints -1.
If it is not, it prints x.

The code prints 8.
<<<Output>>>
8

[INST]
Consider the following code:
<Code>
x,y = [int(x) for x in input().split()]

if x % y == 0:
    print(-1)
else:
    print(x)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```8 6
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
