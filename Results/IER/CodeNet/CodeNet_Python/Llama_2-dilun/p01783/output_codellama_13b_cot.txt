The code first reads the input and stores it in a string s.
The code then calls the function f() with s as input.
The function f() returns the value of the string s if it is in the dictionary fm.
If it is not in the dictionary, it calculates the value of the string s.
The value of the string s is calculated by replacing the question marks with 9 and then converting it to an integer.
