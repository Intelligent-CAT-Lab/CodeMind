The variable X and variable Y are initialized to 3 and 8, respectively.
The code checks if 2*X is less than or equal to Y and if Y is even.
If both conditions are met, it prints "Yes".
If either condition is not met, it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
X, Y = map(int, input().split())
if 2*X <= Y <= 4*X and Y % 2 == 0:
    print("Yes")
else:
    print("No")
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 8
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
