The variable l is initialized to a list of integers, which is obtained by splitting the input string by whitespace and converting each element to an integer.
The list is then sorted in ascending order.
The variable ans is initialized to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates 3 times.
In the first iteration, the code checks if the first element of the list is even. If it is, it sets ans to 0 and breaks out of the loop.
In the second iteration, the code checks if the first element of the list is odd. If it is, it sets ans to the product of the first and second elements of the list.
In the third iteration, the code checks if the first element of the list is even. If it is, it sets ans to 0 and breaks out of the loop.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 6.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
l = list(map(int, input().split()))
l = sorted(l)
ans = 0
for i in range(3):
    if l[i] % 2 == 0:
        ans = 0
        break
    else:
        ans = l[0] * l[1]
print(ans)

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 3 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
