The variable S is initialized to "ABA".
The code then checks if S is equal to "AAA" or "BBB".
Since S is not equal to "AAA" or "BBB", the code prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
S = input()

if S == "AAA" or S == "BBB":
  print("No")
else:
  print("Yes")
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```ABA
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
