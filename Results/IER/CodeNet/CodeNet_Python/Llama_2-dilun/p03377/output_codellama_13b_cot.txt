The variable a, variable b and variable x are initialized to 3, 5 and 4, respectively.
The code then prints the string 'YES' if a is less than or equal to x and a+b is greater than or equal to x. Otherwise, it prints the string 'NO'.
The condition is met when a is 3 and b is 5.
<<<Output>>>
YES

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b,x = map(int, input().split())
print('YES' if a<=x and a+b>=x else 'NO')
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 5 4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
