The variable a, b, c and d are initialized to 0, 75, 25 and 100, respectively.
The code then calculates the minimum of b and d, which is 25, and the maximum of a and c, which is 75.
The code then calculates the difference between the two values, which is 50.
The code then checks if the difference is greater than or equal to 0, which is true in this case.
The code then prints the difference, which is 50.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b,c,d=map(int,input().split())
print(max([min(b,d)-max(a,c),0]))
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```0 75 25 100
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
