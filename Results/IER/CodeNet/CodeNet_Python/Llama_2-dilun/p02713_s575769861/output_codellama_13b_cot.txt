The variable k is initialized to 2.
The variable ans is initialized to (k+1)*k//2, which is 10.
The variable tttt is initialized to a list of lists, where each inner list is initialized to a list of zeros.
The inner list of tttt[i][j] is initialized to 0 for all i and j.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to k+1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 3.
For each number i in this range, it enters a loop that iterates from 1 to k+1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 3.
For each number j in this range, it checks if tttt[i][j] is not 0. If it is, it adds 3*g to ans.
If tttt[i][j] is 0, it calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of i and j, and stores it in g.
It then sets tttt[i][j] to g and tttt[j][i] to g.
It adds 3*g to ans.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to k-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 2.
For each number i in this range, it enters a loop that iterates from i+1 to k+1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 2 to 3.
For each number j in this range, it enters a loop that iterates from j+1 to k+1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 3 to 4.
For each number l in this range, it checks if tttt[i][j] is not 0. If it is, it adds 6*temp2 to ans.
If tttt[i][j] is 0, it calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of i and j, and stores it in temp.
It then sets tttt[i][j] to temp and tttt[temp][l] to temp.
It adds 6*temp2 to ans.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 10.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import fractions as fr
k = int(input())
ans = (k+1)*k//2
tttt = [[0]*(k+1) for _ in range(k+1)]
for i in range(1, k+1):
  for j in range(1, k+1):
    if i == j:
      continue
    else:
      if tttt[i][j]!= 0:
        g = tttt[i][j]
        ans += 3*g
      else:
        g = fr.gcd(i,j)
        tttt[i][j] = g
        tttt[j][i] = g
        ans += 3*g
for i in range(1, k-1):
  for j in range(i+1, k):
    for l in range(j+1, k+1):
      temp = tttt[i][j]
      temp2 = tttt[temp][l]
      ans+= 6*temp2

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
