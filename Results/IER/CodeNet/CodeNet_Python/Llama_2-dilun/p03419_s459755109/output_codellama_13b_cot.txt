The variable n and variable m are initialized to 2 and 2, respectively.
The code checks if n and m are equal and if n is equal to 1. If both conditions are met, it prints 1.
If the first condition is not met, the code checks if min(n,m) is equal to 1. If it is, it prints max(n,m)-2.
If the second condition is not met, it prints (n-2)*(m-2).

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
n, m = map(int,input().split())
if n==m and n==1:
  print(1)
elif min(n,m)==1:
  print(max(n,m)-2)
else:
  print((n-2)*(m-2))
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
