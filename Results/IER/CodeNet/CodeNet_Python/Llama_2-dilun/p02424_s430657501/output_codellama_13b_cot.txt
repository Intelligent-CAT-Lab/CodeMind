The variable a and variable b are initialized to 8 and 10, respectively.
The code then prints the binary representation of a & b, which is 00000000000000000000000000000000.
The code then prints the binary representation of a | b, which is 00000000000000000000000000000001.
The code then prints the binary representation of a ^ b, which is 00000000000000000000000000000001.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b = map(int,input().split())
MASK = (1 << 32)-1
print("{:032b}".format(a & b))
print("{:032b}".format(a | b))
print("{:032b}".format(a ^ b))

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```8 10
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
