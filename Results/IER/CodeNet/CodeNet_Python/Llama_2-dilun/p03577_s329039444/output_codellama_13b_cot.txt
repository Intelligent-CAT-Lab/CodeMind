<<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module and sets the recursion limit to 10^7.
The code then defines a function called resolve, which takes an input string s and prints the first 8 characters of s.
The code then calls the resolve function.

The input is "CODEFESTIVAL".
The first 8 characters of this string are "CODEFEST".
The code prints "CODEFEST".
<<<Output>>>
CODEFEST
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

[INST]
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import sys

sys.setrecursionlimit(10 ** 7)
f_inf = float('inf')
mod = 10 ** 9 + 7


def resolve():
    s = input()
    print(s[:-8])

if __name__ == '__main__':
    resolve()


<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```CODEFESTIVAL
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
