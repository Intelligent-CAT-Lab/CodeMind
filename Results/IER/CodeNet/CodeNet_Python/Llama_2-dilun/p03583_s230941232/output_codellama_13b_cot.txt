The variable n is initialized to 2.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 3500 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 3500.
For each number i in this range, it enters another loop that iterates from i to 3500 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from i to 3500.
For each number j in this range, the code checks if the condition (4*i*j-n*(i+j))>0 and n*i*j%(4*i*j-n*(i+j))==0 is met.
If it is, it sets k to n*i*j//(4*i*j-n*(i+j)) and breaks out of the inner loop.
If it is not, it continues the inner loop.
After the inner loop finishes, the code breaks out of the outer loop.
The code then prints the values of i, j and k, which are 1, 1 and 2 in this case.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
n=int(input())
for i in range(1,3501):
  for j in range(i,3501):
    if (4*i*j-n*(i+j))>0 and n*i*j%(4*i*j-n*(i+j))==0:
      k=n*i*j//(4*i*j-n*(i+j))
      break
  else:
    continue
  break
print(i,j,k)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
