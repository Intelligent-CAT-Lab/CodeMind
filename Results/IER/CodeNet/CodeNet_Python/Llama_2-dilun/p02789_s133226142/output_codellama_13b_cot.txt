The variable N and variable M are initialized to 3 and 3, respectively.
The code checks if N is equal to M. If it is, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
N,M=map(int,input().split())

if N==M:
    print('Yes')
else:
    print('No')
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
