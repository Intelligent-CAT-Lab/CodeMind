The input is 4 8 2.
The code first converts the input to a list.
Then it extracts the first element a, the second element b and the third element x.
The code then calculates the result as b // x - (a - 1) // x.
The result is 2.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
_input = list(map(int, input().split(" ")))
a = _input[0]
b = _input[1]
x = _input[2]

result = b // x - (a - 1)// x

print(result)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4 8 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
