The variables x1, y1, x2 and y2 are initialized to 0, 0, 1 and 1, respectively.
The code then calls the function hypot from the math module, which calculates the hypotenuse of a right triangle.
The hypotenuse is the length of the side opposite the right angle.
The function takes two arguments, the difference between the x-coordinates and the difference between the y-coordinates.
In this case, the hypotenuse is 1.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import math
x1,y1,x2,y2 = map(float,input().split())
print(math.hypot(x2-x1,y2-y1))
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```0 0 1 1
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
