The variable x is initialized to 1.
The code checks if x is equal to 0. If it is, it prints 1. Otherwise, it prints 0.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
x = int(input())
if x == 0:
  print(1)
else:
  print(0)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
