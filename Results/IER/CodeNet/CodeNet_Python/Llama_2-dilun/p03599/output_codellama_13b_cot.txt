The variables a, b, c, d, e, f are initialized to 1, 2, 10, 20, 15, 200, respectively.
The variable maxsugar is initialized to 0, which will be used to store the maximum sugar.
The variable maxwater is initialized to 100*a, which is 100*1 = 100.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 31 to 1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 31 to 1.
For each number i in this range, the code enters another loop that iterates from 31 to 1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 31 to 1.
For each number j in this range, the code enters another loop that iterates from 3001 to 1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 3001 to 1.
For each number k in this range, the code calculates the water value, which is 100*a*i+100*b*j.
The code calculates the sugar value, which is c*k.
The code checks if the water+sugar value is greater than f. If it is, it continues the loop.
The code checks if the sugar value is greater than (a*i+b*j)*e. If it is, it continues the loop.
The code calculates the sugar value, which is sugar+min((f-(water+sugar))//d*d,((a*i+b*j)*e-c*k)//d*d).
The code checks if 100*maxsugar*(water+sugar) is less than 100*sugar*(maxsugar+maxwater). If it is, it continues the loop.
The code stores the maximum sugar value in maxsugar and the maximum water value in maxwater.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of maxsugar+maxwater and maxsugar.
The output is 1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
