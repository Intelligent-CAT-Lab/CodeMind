The variable D is initialized to 20.
The variable ds is initialized to a list of 20 zeros.

The function log10 calculates the logarithm of a number with base 10.

The for loop iterates from 1 to 20, which means it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of the digits of the number i.
The sum is stored in the variable ds[i], which is the sum of the digits of the number i.

The function calc calculates the sum of the digits of a number m.
If m is 0, it returns 0.
Otherwise, it calculates the logarithm of m with base 10, which is stored in the variable c.
The variable fr is initialized to 10**(c-1)-1, which is the first digit of the number m.
The variable to is initialized to m, which is the number m itself.
The sum of the digits of the number m is calculated and stored in the variable ds[c-1].
The sum of the digits of the number m is calculated and stored in the variable ds[c-1].
