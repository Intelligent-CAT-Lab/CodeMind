    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import sys
from collections import deque

input = sys.stdin.readline


def dfs(N):
    alphabet = "abcdefghij"
    stack = deque(["a"])
    while stack:
        s = stack.pop()
        if len(s) == N:
            print(s)
            continue
        for suffix in reversed(alphabet[:len(set(s)) + 1]):
            stack.append("".join((s, suffix)))


def main():
    N = int(input())

    dfs(N)


if __name__ == "__main__":

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
