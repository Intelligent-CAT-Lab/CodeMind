The variable k is initialized to 101.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to k (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 101.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i % 10 is in the range [0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8]. If it is, it prints -1.
If i % 10 is 1, it calculates the product of k and 7, and stores it in tmp. It then calculates the product of k and 1, and stores it in ans. It then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to len(str(tmp)) (inclusive), meaning it will consider the length of the string representation of tmp from 1 to 7.
For each length l in this range, it checks if the string representation of tmp has exactly l occurrences of 7. If it does, it prints the sum of ans and l - 1.
If i % 10 is 3, it calculates the product of k and 9, and stores it in tmp. It then calculates the product of k and 3, and stores it in ans. It then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to len(str(tmp)) (inclusive), meaning it will consider the length of the string representation of tmp from 1 to 9.
For each length l in this range, it checks if the string representation of tmp has exactly l occurrences of 7. If it does, it prints the sum of ans and l - 1.
If i % 10 is 7, it calculates the product of k and 1, and stores it in tmp. It then calculates the product of k and 7, and stores it in ans. It then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to len(str(tmp)) (inclusive), meaning it will consider the length of the string representation of tmp from 1 to 7.
For each length l in this range, it checks if the string representation of tmp has exactly l occurrences of 7. If it does, it prints the sum of ans and l - 1.
If i % 10 is 9, it calculates the product of k and 3, and stores it in tmp. It then calculates the product of k and 3, and stores it in ans. It then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to len(str(tmp)) (inclusive), meaning it will consider the length of the string representation of tmp from 1 to 9.
For each length l in this range, it checks if the string representation of tmp has exactly l occurrences of 7. If it does, it prints the sum of ans and l - 1.

After the loop finishes, the code prints -1 if i % 10 is in the range [0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8]. Otherwise, it prints the sum of ans and len(str(tmp)) - 1.
