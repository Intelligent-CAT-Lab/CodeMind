The variable n is initialized to 3.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 3.
For each number i in this range, it enters a nested loop that iterates from i+1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 2 to 3.
For each number j in this range, it calculates the power of i and j, which is i^j.
It then calculates the number of times the power of i and j is greater than 0, which is the number of times the power of i and j is even.
It prints the number of times the power of i and j is even, followed by a space.
After the loop finishes, the code prints a new line.
