The variables a, b and n are initialized to 5, 7 and 4, respectively.
The code checks if b is less than or equal to n+1. If it is, it sets x to b-1. Otherwise, it sets x to n.
The code then calculates the floor of a multiplied by x divided by b, and prints the result.
The result is 3.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import math
a,b,n=map(int,input().split())
if b<=n+1:
    x=b-1
else:
    x=n
g=math.floor(a*x/b)
print(g)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 7 4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
