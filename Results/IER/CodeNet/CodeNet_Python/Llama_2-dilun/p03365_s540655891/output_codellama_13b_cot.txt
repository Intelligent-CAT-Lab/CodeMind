The variable N is initialized to 4.
The code then calculates the factorial of each number from 1 to N.
The code then calculates the inverse of each factorial.
The code then calculates the combination of each number from 1 to N with each number from 1 to N.
The code then calculates the sum of each combination of each number from 1 to N with each number from 1 to N.
The code then prints the final value of the sum, which is 1.

    Consider the following code:

from functools import reduce
from itertools import *
from collections import defaultdict
from bisect import bisect

MOD = 10**9 + 7

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
