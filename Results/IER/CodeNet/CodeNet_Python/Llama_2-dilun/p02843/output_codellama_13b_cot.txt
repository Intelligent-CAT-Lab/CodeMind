The variable N is initialized to 615.
The variable q is initialized to 615 // 100, which is 6.
The variable mod is initialized to 615 % 100, which is 5.
The code then prints 1 if mod <= q * 5 else 0, which is 1.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())
q, mod = divmod(N, 100)
print(1 if mod <= q * 5 else 0)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1000000000
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
