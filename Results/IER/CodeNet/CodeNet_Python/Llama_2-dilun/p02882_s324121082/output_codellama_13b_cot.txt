The variable a, variable b and variable x are initialized to 2, 2 and 4, respectively.
The variable c is initialized to x/a, which is 4/2 = 2.
The code checks if c is greater than a*b/2, which is 2*2/2 = 2.
If it is, the code sets c to a*b - c, which is 2*2 - 2 = 0.
The variable d is initialized to 2*c/a, which is 2*0/2 = 0.
The variable e is initialized to math.atan(d/a), which is math.atan(0/2) = math.atan(0) = 0.
The code prints the value of math.degrees(e), which is math.degrees(0) = 0.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import math

a, b, x = map(int, input().split())
c = x/a
if c > a*b/2:
  c = a*b - c
  d = c*2 / a
  e = math.atan(d/a)
else:
  d = c*2 / b
  e = math.atan(b/d)
print(math.degrees(e))
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 2 4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
