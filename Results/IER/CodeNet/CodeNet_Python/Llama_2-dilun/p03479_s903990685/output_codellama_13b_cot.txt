The variable x and variable y are initialized to 3 and 20, respectively.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the number of times x is multiplied by 2.
The code enters a while loop that iterates while x <= y, meaning it will consider numbers from 3 to 20.
In each iteration, the code multiplies x by 2 and adds 1 to ans.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 12.
<<<Output>>>
12

Consider the following code:
<Code>
x, y = map(int,input().split())

ans = 0
while x <= y:
    ans += 1
    x *= 2

print(ans)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 20
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
