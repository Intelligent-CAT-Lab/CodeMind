The code first initializes the variable N to 1.
The code then initializes the variable a to Vector(0, 0) and variable b to Vector(100, 0).
The code then calls the function koch(N, a, b) with the input N = 1.
The function koch(N, a, b) calls itself recursively with the input N = 0.
The function koch(0, a, b) calls itself recursively with the input N = 0.
