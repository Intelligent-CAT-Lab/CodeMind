The variable s is initialized to the input string "QWERTYASDFZXCV".
The code then finds the first occurrence of the letter "A" in the string and stores it in s.find('A').
It then finds the last occurrence of the letter "Z" in the string and stores it in s.rfind('Z').
Finally, it prints the length of the substring between these two positions, which is 10.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
s=input()
print(len(s[s.find('A'):s.rfind('Z')+1]))

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```QWERTYASDFZXCV
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
