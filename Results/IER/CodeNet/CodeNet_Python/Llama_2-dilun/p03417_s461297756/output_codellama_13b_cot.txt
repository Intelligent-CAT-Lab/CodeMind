The variable n and variable m are initialized to 2 and 2, respectively.
The code checks if n is greater than or equal to 2 and m is greater than or equal to 2.
If it is, it prints (n - 2) * (m - 2).
If n is 1 and m is greater than 1, it prints m - 2.
If m is 1 and n is greater than 1, it prints n - 2.
If neither of the above conditions is met, it prints 1.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
n, m = map(int, input().split())

if n >= 2 and m >= 2:
    print((n - 2) * (m - 2))
elif n == 1 and m > 1:
    print(m - 2)
elif m == 1 and n > 1:
    print(n - 2)
else:
    print(1)

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
