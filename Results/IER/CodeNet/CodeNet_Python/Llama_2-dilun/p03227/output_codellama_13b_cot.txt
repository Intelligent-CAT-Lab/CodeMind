The variable l is initialized to the string "abc".
The code checks if the length of l is 2. Since it is, it prints the string "bc".
Otherwise, it prints the string "abc" reversed.
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
l=input()
if len(l)==2:
    print(l)
else:
    print(l[::-1])
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```abc
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
