The variable a and variable b are initialized to 5 and 8, respectively.
The code then reads the input from the standard input, which is the input given by the user.
The code then prints the sum of a and b, which is 13.
<<<Output>>>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import sys
a,b=map(int,sys.stdin.readline().split())
print(a+b)

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 8
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
