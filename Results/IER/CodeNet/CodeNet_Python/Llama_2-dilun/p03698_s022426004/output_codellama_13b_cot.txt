The variable S is initialized to the string "uncopyrightable".
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the characters in S.
For each character s in S, it checks if the number of occurrences of s in S is greater than 1. If it is, it prints "no" and exits the program.
If the condition is not met, the code prints "yes".
<<<Output>>>
yes

Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())
A = list(map(int, input().split()))
B = list(map(int, input().split()))
C = list(map(int, input().split()))
D = list(map(int, input().split()))
for i in range(N):
    if A[i] == B[i] == C[i] == D[i]:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
</Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3
1 1 1 1
1 1 1 2
1 1 2 2
2 2 2 2
2 2 2 3
2 2 3 3
2 3 3 3
3 3 3 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The variable N is initialized to 3, which means the code will process 3 test cases.
The variables A, B, C and D are initialized to the lists [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 2], [1, 1, 2, 2] and [2, 2, 2, 3], respectively.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the test cases.
For each test case, it checks if the elements in A, B, C and D are equal. If they are, it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".
The code prints "YES" for the first and second test cases, and "NO" for the third test case.
<<<Output>>>
YES
