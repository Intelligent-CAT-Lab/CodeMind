The variable k is initialized to 3.
The variable k1 is initialized to 3//2, which is 1.
The variable k2 is initialized to 3-1, which is 2.
The code then prints the product of k1 and k2, which is 2.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
k=int(input())
k1=k//2
k2=k-k1
print(k1*k2)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
