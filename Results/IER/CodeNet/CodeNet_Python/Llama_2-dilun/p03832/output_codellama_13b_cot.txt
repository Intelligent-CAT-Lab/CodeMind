The variable N, variable A, variable B, variable C and variable D are initialized to 3, 1, 3, 1 and 2, respectively.
The variable MOD is initialized to 10 ** 9 + 7, which is 1000000007.
The variable fact is initialized to a list of integers, where the first element is 1 and the rest are initialized to 0.
The variable frev is initialized to a list of integers, where the first element is 1 and the rest are initialized to 0.
The variable dp is initialized to a list of integers, where the first element is 0 and the rest are initialized to 0.
The variable Y is initialized to a list of None, where the first element is None and the rest are initialized to None.

The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 3.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the value of fact[i] and frev[i] and stores them in the corresponding variables.

The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 3.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the value of dp[i] and stores it in the corresponding variable.

The code then enters a loop that iterates from A to min(N // C, B) + 1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 3.
For each number g in this range, it calculates the value of y and stores it in the corresponding variable.

The code then enters a loop that iterates from p to min(q, N) + 1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 3.
For each number j in this range, it calculates the value of Y[j] and stores it in the corresponding variable.

The code then enters a loop that iterates from p to min(q, i) + 1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 3.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the value of dp[i] and stores it in the corresponding variable.

The code then enters a loop that iterates from p to N + 1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 3.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the value of dp[i] and stores it in the corresponding variable.

The code then prints the value of dp[N] and terminates.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B, C, D = map(int, input().split())
MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7
fact = [1] * (N + 1)
frev = [1] * (N + 1)

dp = [0] * (N + 1)
dp[0] = 1

for i in range(1, N + 1):
    v = fact[i] = (fact[i - 1] * i) % MOD
    frev[i] = pow(v, MOD - 2, MOD)

Y = [None] * (N + 1)
for g in range(A, min(N // C, B) + 1):
    p = C * g
    q = D * g
    y = frev[g]
    Y[p: min(q, N) + 1: g] = (pow(y, j, MOD) * frev[j]
                              for j in range(C, min(D, N // g) + 1))
    dp[p:] = (dp[i] + frev[N - i] * sum(dp[i - j] * fact[N - i + j] * Y[j]
              for j in range(p, min(q, i) + 1, g)) % MOD
              for i in range(p, N + 1))

print(dp[N] % MOD)
