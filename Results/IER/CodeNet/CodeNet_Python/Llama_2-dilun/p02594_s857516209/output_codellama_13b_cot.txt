The variable x is initialized to 25.
The code checks if x is greater than or equal to 30.
If it is, it prints "Yes".
If it is not, it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
x = int(input())
if x >= 30:
    print("Yes")
else:
    print("No")
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```25
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
