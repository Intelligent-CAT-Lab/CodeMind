The variable A, B and C are initialized to 2, 5 and 4, respectively.
The code then creates two lists, even and odd, to store the even and odd numbers.
The code iterates over the three numbers and appends them to the appropriate list based on whether they are even or odd.
The code then checks if the length of even is 2. If it is, it appends the sum of the two numbers to the list ns.
The code then checks if the length of odd is 2. If it is, it appends the sum of the two numbers to the list ns.
The code then sorts the list ns.
The code then finds the maximum value in the list ns and stores it in the variable max_v.
The code then iterates over the list ns and calculates the difference between each number and the maximum value.
The code then calculates the sum of these differences and stores it in the variable cnt.
The code then prints the value of cnt.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
A,B,C=map(int, input().split())
odd=[]
even=[]
for x in [A,B,C]:
    if x%2==0:
        even.append(x)
    else:
        odd.append(x)
cnt = 0
ns = []
if len(even) == 2:
    for x in even:
        cnt = 1
        ns.append(x+1)
else:
    ns.extend(even)
if len(odd) == 2:
    for x in odd:
        cnt = 1
        ns.append(x+1)
else:
    ns.extend(odd)

ns.sort()
max_v = max(ns)
for x in ns:
    cnt += (max_v-x) // 2

print(cnt)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 5 4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
