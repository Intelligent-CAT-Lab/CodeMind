The variable N is initialized to 117.
The code checks if "7" is in N.
Since "7" is in 117, the code prints "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = input()

if "7" in N:
    print("Yes")
else:
    print("No")
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```117
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
