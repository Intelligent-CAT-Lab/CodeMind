The variable A, B, C and K are initialized to 2, 1, 1 and 3, respectively.
The code checks if K is greater than or equal to A. If it is, it sets sum to A and sets K to K minus A.
If it is not, it sets sum to K and sets K to 0.
The code checks if K is greater than or equal to B and greater than or equal to 1. If it is, it sets K to K minus B.
If it is not, it sets K to 0.
The code checks if K is greater than or equal to C and greater than or equal to 1. If it is, it sets sum to sum minus C.
If it is not, it sets sum to sum minus K.
The code prints the final value of sum, which is 1.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
A, B, C, K = map(int, input().split())
sum = 0

if K >= A:
	sum = A
	K = K - A
else:
	sum = K
	K = 0
if K >= B and K >= 1:
	K = K - B
else:
	K = 0
if K >= C and K >= 1:
	sum = sum - C
else:
	sum = sum - K

print(sum)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 1 1 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
