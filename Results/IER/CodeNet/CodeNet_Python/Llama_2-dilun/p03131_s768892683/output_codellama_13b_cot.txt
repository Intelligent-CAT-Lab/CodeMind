The variable K, variable A and variable B are initialized to 4, 2 and 6, respectively.
The code then calculates the difference between B and A, which is 4-2 = 2.
If the difference is greater than or equal to 2, the code will enter the if statement.
In this case, the condition is met, so the code will enter the if statement.
The code then calculates the number of steps required to hit the target A, which is 2-1 = 1.
