<<<Analysis>>>
The variable a and variable b are initialized to 1000 and 3000, respectively.
The code calculates the sum of a and b, which is 4000.
The code then divides the sum by 2, which is 2000.
The code prints the result, which is 2000.
<<<Output>>>
2000

[INST]
Consider the following code:
<Code>
a, b=map(int,input().split())
x=(a+b)//2
print(x)

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1000 3000
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
