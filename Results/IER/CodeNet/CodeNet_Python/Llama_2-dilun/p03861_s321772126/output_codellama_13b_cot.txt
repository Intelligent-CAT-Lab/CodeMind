The variable a, b and x are initialized to 4, 8 and 2, respectively.
The function f(n, deno) is called with n = b and deno = x.
The function returns b // x + 1, which is 4 // 2 + 1 = 3.
The function is then called with n = a - 1 and deno = x.
The function returns a - 1 // x + 1, which is 3 // 2 + 1 = 2.
The difference between the two values is 1.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(n, deno):
	if n == -1:
		return 0
	else:
		return n // deno + 1

a, b, x = list(map(int, input().split()))
print(f(b,x) - f(a-1, x))
</Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4 8 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
