The variable N, variable P are initialized to 3, 24, respectively.
The function prime_factorize() is called to calculate the prime factors of P.
The function m() is called to calculate the product of the prime factors of P raised to the power of N.
The output is 24.

    a = []
    while n % 2 == 0:
        a.append(2)
        n //= 2

        else:
            f += 2

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 24
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
