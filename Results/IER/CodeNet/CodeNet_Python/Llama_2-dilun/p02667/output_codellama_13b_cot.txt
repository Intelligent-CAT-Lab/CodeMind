The code first initializes the variable res to 0.
The variable length is initialized to 0.
The variable n is initialized to the length of the input string, which is 5 in this case.
The variable used is initialized to a list of 0s with length n.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider all the characters in the input string.
For each character i in this range, if the character is 1, the code will add 1 to the variable length and add 1 to the variable res.
The code will also set the value of used[i] to 1.

The code then enters another loop that iterates from 0 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider all the characters in the input string.
For each character i in this range, if the value of used[i] is 0, the code will add 1 to the variable switch_count.
The code will also set the value of used[i] to 1.

The code then enters another loop that iterates from 0 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider all the characters in the input string.
For each character i in this range, if the value of used[i] is 0, the code will add 1 to the variable cnt_1_even.
The code will also set the value of used[i] to 1.

The code then enters another loop that iterates from 0 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider all the characters in the input string.
For each character i in this range, if the value of used[i] is 0, the code will add 1 to the variable cnt_1_odd.
The code will also set the value of used[i] to 1.

The code then enters another loop that iterates from 0 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider all the characters in the input string.
For each character i in this range, if the value of used[i] is 0, the code will add 1 to the variable cnt_unused.
The code will also set the value of used[i] to 1.

The code then sets the variable switched to the value of switch_count divided by 2.
The code then sets the variable non_switched to the value of cnt_unused minus switched.
The code then adds cnt_1_even * non_switched + cnt_1_odd * switched to res.

The code then sets the variable st to 0.
The code then sets the variable cnt_1_even to 0.
The code then sets the variable cnt_1_odd to 0.
The code then sets the variable switch_count to 0.

The code then sets the variable st to i + 1.
The code then sets the variable cnt_1_even to 0.
