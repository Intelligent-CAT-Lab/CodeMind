The variable N and variable K are initialized to 3 and 2, respectively.
The variable MOD is initialized to 10 ** 9 + 7.
The variable just is initialized to a list of 0s with length K + 1.
The variable ans is initialized to 0.

The code enters a loop that iterates from K to 0, meaning it will consider numbers from 2 to 0.
For each number X in this range, it calculates the number of numbers that are divisible by X and stores it in just[X].
The code then calculates the number of numbers that are divisible by X and X, and stores it in mul.
It then calculates the number of numbers that are divisible by X and mul, and subtracts it from just[X].
It then calculates the number of numbers that are divisible by X and mul + X, and subtracts it from just[X].
It then calculates the number of numbers that are divisible by X and mul + 2X, and subtracts it from just[X].
