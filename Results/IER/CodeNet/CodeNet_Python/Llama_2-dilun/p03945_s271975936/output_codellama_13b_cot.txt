The input is "BBBWW".
The function solve() reads the input from the standard input and stores it in the variable S.
The variable turn is initialized to 0.
The variable current is initialized to the first character of S, which is 'B'.
The loop iterates from 1 to the length of S (inclusive), meaning it will consider the second, third, fourth and fifth characters of S.
For each character i in this range, if it is not equal to the current character, the variable turn is incremented by 1.
The variable current is then set to the current character.
After the loop finishes, the variable turn is printed.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import sys

def solve():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    S = input().strip("\n")
    turn = 0
    current = S[0]
    for i in range(1, len(S)):
        if S[i]!= current:
            turn += 1
            current = S[i]
    print(turn)

    return 0

if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve()
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```BBBWW
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
