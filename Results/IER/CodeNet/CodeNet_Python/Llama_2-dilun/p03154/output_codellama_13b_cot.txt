The variable MOD is initialized to 10^9 + 7, which is 1000000007.
The variable list_size is initialized to 20000001, which is 20000000.
The variable f_list is initialized to a list of 20000000 elements, each of which is initialized to 1.
The variable f_r_list is initialized to a list of 20000000 elements, each of which is initialized to 1.

The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to list_size-1, which is 20000000-1.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the product of f_list[i] and (i+1) and stores it in f_list[i+1].

The code then enters another loop that iterates from list_size-2 to -1, which is 20000000-2 to -1.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the product of f_r_list[i+1] and (i+1) and stores it in f_r_list[i].

The code then calculates the product of k, f_list[h+w], f_r_list[h+w-k] and stores it in ans.

The code then calculates the product of (h+w), k, (k+1), f_list[h+w-1], f_r_list[2], f_r_list[h+w-k] and stores it in ans.

The code then calculates the product of h, w, f_list[h+w-2], (k-1), k, (k+1), pow(3, MOD-2, MOD) and f_r_list[h+w-k] and stores it in ans.

The code then calculates the remainder of ans modulo MOD and prints it.

The final value of ans is 100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
