The code first initializes the variables W, max_digit, ans and work.
W is the input number, which is 25 in this case.
max_digit is the largest digit in the number, which is 3 in this case.
ans and work are two arrays that will be used to store the result.

The code then enters a recursive function called recursive.
The function recursively calculates the answer for each digit.
The function recursively calls itself for each digit, starting from the largest digit.
For each digit, the function first calculates the sum of the current digit and the previous digits.
If the sum is equal to W, the function returns.
Otherwise, the function calculates the answer for the current digit.
The function then recursively calls itself for the previous digits.

After the function recursively calculates the answer for each digit, it prints the result.
The result is printed as a string, with each digit separated by a space.

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```25
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
