The input is 3 5 2 7.
The code splits the input into a list of 4 elements.
The first element is 3, the second is 5, the third is 2 and the fourth is 7.
The code then calculates the product of the first two elements, which is 15.
The code then calculates the product of the last two elements, which is 49.
The code then prints the maximum of the two products, which is 49.
<<<Output>>>
49

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
n=input().split(' ')
a1=int(n[0])*int(n[1])
a2=int(n[2])*int(n[3])
print(max(a1,a2))
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 5 2 7
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
