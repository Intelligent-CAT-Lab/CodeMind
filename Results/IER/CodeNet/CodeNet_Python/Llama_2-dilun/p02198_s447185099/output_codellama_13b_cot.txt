The variable N and variable M are initialized to 3 and 4, respectively.
The code then prints the product of N and M, which is 12.
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, M = map(int, input().split())
print(N * M)

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
