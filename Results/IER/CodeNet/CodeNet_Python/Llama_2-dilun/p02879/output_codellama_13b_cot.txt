The input is 2 5.
The code splits the input into two strings, a and b.
The code then converts the strings to integers.
The code checks if both a and b are within the range [0, 9].
If they are, it prints the product of a and b.
If they are not, it prints -1.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b=input().split()
a=int(a)
b=int(b)

if 0<a and a<10 and 0<b and b<10:
    print(a*b)
else:
    print("-1")

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 5
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
