The variable N, variable A, variable B and variable K are initialized to 4, 1, 2 and 5, respectively.
The function getInv is called to calculate the inverse of numbers from 1 to N.
The function getCmb is called to calculate the number of combinations of numbers from 1 to N.
The function solve is called to calculate the number of combinations of numbers from 1 to N that sum to K.

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4 1 2 5
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
