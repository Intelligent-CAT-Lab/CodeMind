The variable n, variable x and variable t are initialized to 20, 12 and 6, respectively.
The code then prints the output, which is 120.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import math
n, x, t = map(int,input().split())
print(math.ceil(n/x)*t)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20 12 6
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
