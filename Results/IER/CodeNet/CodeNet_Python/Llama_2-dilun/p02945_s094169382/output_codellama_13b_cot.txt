The variable A and variable B are initialized to -13 and 3, respectively.
The code then prints the maximum of A+B, A-B and A*B.
The maximum of A+B, A-B and A*B is 3, 16 and 3, respectively.
The maximum of these three numbers is 3.

[INST]
Consider the following code:
<Code>
A, B = map(int, input().split())
print(max(A+B, A-B, A*B))
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```-13 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
