The variable n is initialized to 13.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 100000 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 100000.
For each number i in this range, it checks if n is greater than or equal to i and if the number n - i is a palindrome. If it is, it prints n - i and breaks out of the loop.
If n + i is a palindrome, it prints n + i and breaks out of the loop.
After the loop finishes, the code prints nothing.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def palind(n):
  return str(n) == str(n)[::-1]

n = input()
for i in range(100000):
  if n >= i and palind(n - i):
    print n - i
    break
  if palind(n + i):
    print n + i
    break
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```13
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
