The variable n and variable m are initialized to 3 and 4, respectively.
The code then prints the product of n and m, which is 12.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
n, m = map(int, input().split())
print((n - 1) * (m - 1))
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
