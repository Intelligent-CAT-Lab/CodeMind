The variable a, b and c are initialized to 0, 0 and 1, respectively.
The code checks if the tuple (a, b, c) is equal to (1, 1, 0), (0, 0, 1) or (0, 1, 0).
If it is, it prints the corresponding string.
In this case, the tuple is (0, 0, 1), so the code prints 'Open'.
<<<Output>>>
Open

Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b,c=map(int,input().split())

if (a,b,c)==(1,1,0):
   print('Open')
elif (a,b,c)==(0,0,1):
    print('Open')
else:
    print('Close')

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```0 0 1
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
