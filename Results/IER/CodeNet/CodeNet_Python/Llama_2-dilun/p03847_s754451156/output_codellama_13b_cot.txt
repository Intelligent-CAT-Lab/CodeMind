The function d_XorSum(N) calculates the number of pairs of integers (a, b) such that a + b <= N and a xor b <= N.
The function f(k) calculates the number of pairs of integers (a, b) such that a + b <= k and a xor b <= k.
The function f(k) is calculated by the following steps:
1. If k is in the memo, return the value in the memo.
2. If k is not in the memo, calculate the value of f(k // 2) + f((k - 1) // 2) + f((k - 2) // 2) and store it in the memo.
3. Return the value in the memo.

The function d_XorSum(N) is calculated by the following steps:
1. If N is 0, return 1.
2. If N is 1, return 2.
3. If N is not 0 or 1, calculate the value of f(N // 2) + f((N - 1) // 2) + f((N - 2) // 2) and return it.

The function f(N) is calculated by the following steps:
1. If N is 0, return 1.
2. If N is 1, return 2.
3. If N is not 0 or 1, calculate the value of f(N // 2) + f((N - 1) // 2) + f((N - 2) // 2) and return it.

The function f(N) is calculated by the following steps:
