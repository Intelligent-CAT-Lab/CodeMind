The variable n is initialized to 12.
The variable sn is initialized to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the characters of n.
For each character, it adds the character's value to sn.
The code then checks if the value of n is divisible by sn.
If it is, it prints "Yes".
If it is not, it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
Yes

Consider the following code:
<Code>
n = input()

sn = 0

for i in range(len(n)):
    sn += int(n[i])


if (int(n) % sn == 0):
    print("Yes")
else:
    print("No")

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```12
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
