The code first calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of n and m, which is 6 in this case.
The code then calculates the length of the list returned by the function factorization(g), which is 2 in this case.
The code then prints the result, which is 3.

    Consider the following code:

def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

def lcm(a, b):
    return a // gcd (a, b) * b

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```12 18
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
