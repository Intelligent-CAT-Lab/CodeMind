The variable H and variable W are initialized to 3 and 5, respectively.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to H (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 3.
For each number h in this range, it calculates the sum of h*W and (H-h)*(W//2) and stores it in S1 and S2, respectively.
It then calculates the sum of H*W-S1-S2 and stores it in S3.
The code then calculates the maximum value of S1, S2 and S3 and stores it in ans.
The code then calculates the minimum value of S1, S2 and S3 and stores it in ans.
The code then calculates the difference between the maximum value and the minimum value of S1, S2 and S3 and stores it in ans.
The code then prints the final value of ans, which is 1.

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 5
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
