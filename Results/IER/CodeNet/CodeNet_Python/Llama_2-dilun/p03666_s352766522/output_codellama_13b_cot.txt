The variable N, variable A, variable B, variable C and variable D are initialized to 5, 1, 5, 2 and 4, respectively.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to N - 1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 4.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the value of l and r, which are the left and right boundaries of the range of numbers that can be found in the range [A, B].
The code then checks if B is within the range [l, r]. If it is, it prints "YES" and breaks out of the loop.
If B is not within the range [l, r], it prints "NO".
After the loop finishes, the code prints "NO".
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import sys
input = sys.stdin.readline
N, A, B, C, D = map(int, input().split())
for i in range(N - 1):
  l = C * i + A - D * (N - i - 1)
  r = D * i + A - C * (N - i - 1) + 1
  if B in range(l, r):
    print("YES")
    break
else: print("NO")
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 1 5 2 4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
