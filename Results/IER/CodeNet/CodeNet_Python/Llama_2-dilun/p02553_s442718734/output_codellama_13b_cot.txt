The variables a, b, c and d are initialized to 1, 2, 1 and 1, respectively.
The code then prints the maximum of a*c, a*d, b*c and b*d.
The maximum of a*c and a*d is 2*1 = 2.
The maximum of b*c and b*d is 2*1 = 2.
Therefore, the output is 2.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b,c,d = map(int,input().split())

print(max(a*c,a*d,b*c,b*d))
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 2 1 1
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
