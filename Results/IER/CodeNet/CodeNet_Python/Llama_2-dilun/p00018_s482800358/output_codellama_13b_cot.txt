The function sort takes a list A as input and returns a sorted list.
The function first calculates the length of the list A, which is 5 in this case.
Then it iterates through the list A from the second element to the last element.
For each element, it checks if the next element is smaller than the current element.
If it is, it swaps the two elements.
After the loop finishes, the function returns the sorted list.

The code then calls the function sort with the list A.
The list A is then printed.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def sort(A):
    N=len(A)
    for i in range(N):
        for j in range(N-i-1):
            if A[j] < A[j+1]:
                temp=A[j+1]
                A[j+1]=A[j]
                A[j]=temp
    return A
A=list(map(int,input().split()))
print(" ".join(list(map(str,sort(A)))))
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 6 9 7 5
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
