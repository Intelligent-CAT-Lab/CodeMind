The variable L is initialized to 3.
The variable hen is initialized to 3/3, which is 1.
The variable hen is then raised to the power of 3, which is 1.
The variable hen is then printed.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

L = int(input())
hen = L/3
print(hen**3)

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
