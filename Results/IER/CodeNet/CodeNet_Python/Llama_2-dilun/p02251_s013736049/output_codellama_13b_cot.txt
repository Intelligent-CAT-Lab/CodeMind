The variable n is initialized to 100.
The variable coin is initialized to [25, 10, 5, 1].
The variable sum_s is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of the number of coins needed to make change for the given amount.
The code enters a loop that iterates through the elements of the array coin.
For each element i in the array, it calculates the number of times i can be used to make change for the given amount n.
The number of times i can be used is calculated by dividing n by i and storing the result in the variable sent.
The remainder of the division is stored in the variable n.
The sum_s variable is then updated by adding the value of sent to it.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_s, which is 10 in this case.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
n = int(input())
coin = [25,10,5,1]
sum_s = 0
for i in coin:
    sent = n // i
    n %= i
    sum_s += sent
print(sum_s)

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```100
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
