The code first initializes variables sx, sy, tx and ty to 0, 0, 1 and 2, respectively.
The code then calls the function solve, which is defined as follows:
```
def solve(sx, sy, tx, ty):
    first = "U"*(ty-sy)+"R"*(tx-sx)
    second = "D"*(ty-sy)+"L"*(tx-sx)
    third = "L"+"U"*(ty-sy+1)+"R"*(tx-sx+1)+"D"
    forth = "R"+"D"*(ty-sy+1)+"L"*(tx-sx+1)+"U"
    
    print(first+second+third+forth)
```
The function first calculates the length of the first, second, third and forth strings.
The first string is "U"*(ty-sy), which is "U"*(-2), which is "UU".
The second string is "R"*(tx-sx), which is "R"*(-1), which is "R".
The third string is "L"+"U"*(ty-sy+1)+"R"*(tx-sx+1)+"D", which is "L"+"U"*(-1)+"R"*(-1)+"D", which is "LURD".
The forth string is "R"+"D"*(ty-sy+1)+"L"*(tx-sx+1)+"U", which is "R"+"D"*(-1)+"L"*(-1)+"U", which is "RDUL".
The function then prints the first, second, third and forth strings, which are "UU", "R", "LURD" and "RDUL", respectively.
The code then prints the output of the function, which is "UURRDUL".

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def solve(sx, sy, tx, ty):
    first = "U"*(ty-sy)+"R"*(tx-sx)
    second = "D"*(ty-sy)+"L"*(tx-sx)
    third = "L"+"U"*(ty-sy+1)+"R"*(tx-sx+1)+"D"
    forth = "R"+"D"*(ty-sy+1)+"L"*(tx-sx+1)+"U"
    
    print(first+second+third+forth)
    
if __name__ == '__main__': 
    sx, sy, tx, ty = map(int, input().split())
    
    solve(sx, sy, tx, ty)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```0 0 1 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
