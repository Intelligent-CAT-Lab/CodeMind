The variable N is initialized to 29.
The code checks if N is divisible by 10 and the remainder is 9. If it is, it prints "Yes".

Consider the following code:
<Code>
N=int(input())

if(N % 10==9):
    print("Yes")
elif(N//10==9):
    print("Yes")
else:
    print("No")

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```29
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
