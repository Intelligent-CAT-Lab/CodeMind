The variables A, B, C, X and Y are initialized to 1500, 2000, 1600, 3 and 2, respectively.
The code calculates the value of v1, which is 1500 * 3 + 2000 * 2, which is 1500 + 4000, which is 5500.
The code calculates the value of v2, which is 1600 * 2 * 2 + (3 - 2) * 1500, which is 3200 + 3000, which is 6200.
The code calculates the value of v3, which is 1600 * 2 * 3, which is 3200.
The code then prints the minimum value among v1, v2 and v3, which is 3200.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
A, B, C, X, Y = map(int, input().split())
# 個別に買う
v1 = A * X + B * Y
# 少ない方に合わせてセットを買い、足りない分を買い足す
if X >= Y:
    v2 = C * 2 * Y + (X - Y) * A
else:
    v2 = C * 2 * X + (Y - X) * B
# すべてセットで買う
v3 = C * 2 * max([X, Y])
print(min([v1, v2, v3]))

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1500 2000 1600 3 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
