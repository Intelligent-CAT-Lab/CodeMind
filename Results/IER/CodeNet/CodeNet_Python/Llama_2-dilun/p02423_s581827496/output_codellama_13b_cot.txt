The variable x is initialized to 8.
The first line prints the binary representation of x, which is 000000100.
The second line prints the binary representation of x, which is 000000100.
The third line prints the binary representation of x shifted to the left by 1 bit, which is 00000000000000000000000000000000.
The fourth line prints the binary representation of x shifted to the right by 1 bit, which is 00000000000000000000000000000000.

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```8
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
