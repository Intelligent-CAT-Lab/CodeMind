The variable N, variable V, variable X and variable Y are initialized to 0, 7, 3 and 1, respectively.
The variable g is initialized to 9.8, which is the acceleration due to gravity.
The variable eps is initialized to 1e-10, which is a small number.
The variable obstacles is initialized to an empty list.
The code then iterates N times, which is 0 in this case.
For each iteration, it reads the next 4 numbers, which are 0, 7, 3 and 1.
The code then calculates the value of g, which is 9.8.
The code then calculates the value of eps, which is 1e-10.
The code then calculates the value of N, which is 0.
The code then calculates the value of V, which is 7.
The code then calculates the value of X, which is 3.
The code then calculates the value of Y, which is 1.
The code then reads the next 4 numbers, which are 0, 7, 3 and 1.
The code then calculates the value of L, which is 0.
The code then calculates the value of B, which is 7.
The code then calculates the value of R, which is 3.
The code then calculates the value of T, which is 1.
The code then checks if L is less than or equal to X and if B is less than or equal to Y.
If both conditions are met, the code adds the tuple (L, B, R, T) to the list obstacles.
The code then checks if X is equal to 0.
If X is equal to 0, the code checks if V*V/(2*g) is less than or equal to Y-eps.
If V*V/(2*g) is less than or equal to Y-eps, the code prints "No" and exits.
If V*V/(2*g) is not less than or equal to Y-eps, the code checks if B is less than Y.
If B is less than Y, the code prints "No" and exits.
If B is not less than Y, the code checks if X is equal to 0.
If X is equal to 0, the code checks if V*V/(2*g) is less than or equal to Y-eps.
If V*V/(2*g) is less than or equal to Y-eps, the code prints "Yes" and exits.
If V*V/(2*g) is not less than or equal to Y-eps, the code checks if B is less than Y.
If B is less than Y, the code prints "Yes" and exits.
If B is not less than Y, the code checks if X is equal to 0.
If X is equal to 0, the code checks if V*V/(2*g) is less than or equal to Y-eps.
If V*V/(2*g) is less than or equal to Y-eps, the code prints "Yes" and exits.
If V*V/(2*g) is not less than or equal to Y-eps, the code checks if B is less than Y.
If B is less than Y, the code prints "Yes" and exits.
If B is not less than Y, the code checks if X is equal to 0.
If X is equal to 0, the code checks if V*V/(2*g) is less than or equal to Y-eps.
If V*V/(2*g) is less than or equal to Y-eps, the code prints "Yes" and exits.
If V*V/(2*g) is not less than or equal to Y-eps, the code checks if B is less than Y.
If B is less than Y, the code prints "Yes" and exits.
If B is not less than Y, the code checks if X is equal to 0.
If X is equal to 0, the code checks if V*V/(2*g) is less than or equal to Y-eps.
If V*V/(2*g) is less than or equal to Y-eps, the code prints "Yes" and exits.
If V*V/(2*g) is not less than or equal to Y-eps, the code checks if B is less
