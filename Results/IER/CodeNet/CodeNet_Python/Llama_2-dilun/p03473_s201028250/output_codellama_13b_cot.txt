The variable m is initialized to 21.
The code then prints the value of 24 minus m plus 24, which is 24.
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
m = int(input())
print((24-m)+24)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```21
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
