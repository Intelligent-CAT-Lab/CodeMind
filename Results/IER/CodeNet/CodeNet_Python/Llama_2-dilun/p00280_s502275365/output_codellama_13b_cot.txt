The input is 2 2.
The code first initializes the Node object with a and b as 2 and 2, respectively.
Then it checks if a <= 3 and b == 5, which is not true.
It then checks if a == 5 and b <= 3, which is also not true.
It then checks if (a, b) in ((5, 5), (6, 4), (4, 6)), which is not true.
Finally, it checks if a+1 <= 3 and b == 5, which is true.
The code then initializes the left and right nodes of the Node object with a+1 and b, respectively.
The code then checks if a <= 3 and b == 5, which is not true.
It then checks if a == 5 and b <= 3, which is also not true.
It then checks if (a, b) in ((5, 5), (6, 4), (4, 6)), which is not true.
Finally, it checks if a+1 <= 3 and b == 5, which is true.
