The variable n and variable m are initialized to 3 and 9, respectively.
The variable mod1 is initialized to 10^9+7, which is 1000000007.
The variable mod2 is initialized to 998244353, which is 998244353.
The variable mod is initialized to mod1, which is 1000000007.
The variable ans is initialized to (m+1)%mod, which is 10%1000000007.
The variable a is initialized to m//(n-1), which is 9//(3-1), which is 3.
The variable ans is updated to ((m+1)*(a+1)+(m+1)*a-(n-1)*a*(a+1))%mod, which is ((10+1)*(3+1)+(10+1)*3-(3-1)*3*(3+1))%1000000007, which is 1000000007.
The code prints the final value of ans, which is 1000000007.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
n,m=map(int,input().split())
mod1,mod2=10**9+7,998244353
mod=mod1
ans=(m+1)%mod
if n!=1:
    a=m//(n-1)
    ans=((m+1)*(a+1)+(m+1)*a-(n-1)*a*(a+1))%mod
print(ans)

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 9
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
