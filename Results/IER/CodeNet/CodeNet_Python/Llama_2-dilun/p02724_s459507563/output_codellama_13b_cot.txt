The variable X is initialized to 1024.
The code then prints the value of X // 500 * 1000 + X % 500 // 5 * 5, which is 1024 // 500 * 1000 + 1024 % 500 // 5 * 5.
The value of 1024 // 500 * 1000 is 2048, and the value of 1024 % 500 // 5 * 5 is 1024 % 500 // 5 * 5.
The final output is 2048 + 1024 % 500 // 5 * 5, which is 2048 + 1024 % 500 // 5 * 5.
<<<Output>>>
2048

Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())

for i in range(1,N+1):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        print(i)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The variable N is initialized to 10.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 10.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is even. If it is, it prints i. The condition is met when i is 2,4,6,8 and 10.
After the loop finishes, the code prints nothing.
