The variable x, k and d are initialized to 6, 2 and 4, respectively.
The absolute value of x is calculated and stored in x.
If x is greater than d*k, the absolute value of x minus d*k is calculated and stored in ans.
Otherwise, the absolute value of x minus x//d*d is calculated and stored in ans.
The value of k is decremented by x//d.
If k is odd, the absolute value of ans minus d is calculated and stored in ans.
The absolute value of ans is calculated and stored in ans.
The code prints the absolute value of ans.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
x,k,d = map(int,input().split())
ans = 0
x = abs(x)
if x>d*k:
    ans = x-d*k
else:
    ans = x-x//d*d
    k-=x//d
    if k%2:
        ans = ans-d
ans = abs(ans)
print(ans)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```6 2 4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
