The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 8, 3 and 4, respectively.
The code then calculates the number of groups that can be formed by dividing N by (A+B). In this case, the number of groups is 2.
The code then calculates the remainder of N divided by (A+B). In this case, the remainder is 4.
The code then checks if the remainder is greater than A. In this case, it is not.
The code then prints the number of groups multiplied by A, which is 2*3 = 6.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
N,A,B = list(map(int, input().split()))


groups = N // (A+B)


amari = N % (A+B)


if amari > A:
  print(groups*A + A)
else:
  print(groups*A + amari)

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```8 3 4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
