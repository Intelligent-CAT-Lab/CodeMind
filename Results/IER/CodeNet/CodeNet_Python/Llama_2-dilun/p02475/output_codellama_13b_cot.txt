The variable a and variable b are initialized to 5 and 8, respectively.
The function round(a, b) is called, which calculates the rounded value of a divided by b.
The function first checks if a * b is negative. If it is, it returns the negative of the quotient of a divided by b.
Otherwise, it returns the quotient of a divided by b.
The function returns 0.625, which is the rounded value of 5 divided by 8.
<<<Output>>>
0.625

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b = map(int,input().split())

def round(a, b):
	if a * b < 0:
		return -(-a//b)
	else:
		return a//b

print(round(a, b))

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 8
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
