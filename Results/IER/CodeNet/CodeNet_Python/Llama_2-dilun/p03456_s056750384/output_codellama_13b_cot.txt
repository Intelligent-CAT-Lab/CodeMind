The code first reads the input from standard input.
The code then checks if the input is None or a newline. If it is, it breaks out of the loop.
The code then splits the input into two strings, a and b.
The code then calculates the sum of a and b, and stores it in temp.
The code then checks if the square root of temp is equal to temp.
If it is, it prints "Yes".
If it is not, it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import sys
import math
for line in sys.stdin:
    if line == None or line == '\n':
        break
    a,b = line.split(" ")
    temp = int(a + b)
    if int(math.sqrt(temp)) * int(math.sqrt(temp)) == temp:
        print("Yes")
    else:
        print("No")
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 21
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
