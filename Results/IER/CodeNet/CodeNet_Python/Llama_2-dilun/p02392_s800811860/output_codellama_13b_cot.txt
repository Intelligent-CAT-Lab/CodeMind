The code first splits the input into a list of strings.
The code then checks if the first element of the list is less than the second element and the second element is less than the third element.
If this condition is met, the code prints "Yes".
If this condition is not met, the code prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No

Consider the following code:
<Code>
s = input().split()
if s[0] < s[1] and s[1] < s[2]:
    print('Yes')
else:
    print('No')

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 3 8
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
