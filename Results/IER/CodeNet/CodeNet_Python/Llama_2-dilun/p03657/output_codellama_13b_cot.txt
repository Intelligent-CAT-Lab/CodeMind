The variable a and variable b are initialized to 4 and 5, respectively.
The code checks if a is divisible by 3. Since 4 is divisible by 3, the code prints 'Possible'.
The code checks if b is divisible by 3. Since 5 is divisible by 3, the code prints 'Possible'.
The code checks if (a+b) is divisible by 3. Since (4+5) is divisible by 3, the code prints 'Possible'.
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
# ABC067 A - Sharing Cookies
a,b = map(int,input().split())

if a%3 == 0:
    print('Possible')
elif b%3 == 0:
    print('Possible')
elif (a+b)%3 == 0:
    print('Possible')
else:
    print('Impossible')
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4 5
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
