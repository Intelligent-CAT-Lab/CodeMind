The input is split into two strings, s[0] and s[1].
The first string is converted to an integer, and the second string is converted to an integer.
The difference between the two integers is printed.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
s = input().split()
print(int(s[0]) - int(s[1]))

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 8
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
