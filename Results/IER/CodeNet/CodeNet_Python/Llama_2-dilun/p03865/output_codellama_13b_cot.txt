The input is "aba".
The first character is 'a', which is the same as the last character.
The length of the input is odd, so the code checks if the first character is the same as the last character.
Since it is, the code prints "Second".
<<<Output>>>
Second

Consider the following code:
<Code>
s = input()
if s[0] == s[-1]:
    if len(s) % 2:
        ans = 'Second'
    else:
        ans = 'First'
else:
    if len(s) % 2:
        ans = 'First'
    else:
        ans = 'Second'
print(ans)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```aba
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
