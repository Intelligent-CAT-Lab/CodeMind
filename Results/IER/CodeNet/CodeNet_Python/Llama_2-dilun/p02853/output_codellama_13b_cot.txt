The variable x and variable y are initialized to 1 and 1, respectively.
The code then checks if x is equal to 3. If it is, it sets X to 100000.
Otherwise, it checks if x is equal to 2. If it is, it sets X to 200000.
Otherwise, it checks if x is equal to 1. If it is, it sets X to 300000.
Otherwise, it sets X to 0.

The code then checks if y is equal to 3. If it is, it sets Y to 100000.
Otherwise, it checks if y is equal to 2. If it is, it sets Y to 200000.
Otherwise, it checks if y is equal to 1. If it is, it sets Y to 300000.
Otherwise, it sets Y to 0.

The code then checks if x is equal to 1 and y is equal to 1. If it is, it adds 400000 to X and Y.
Otherwise, it adds X and Y.

The code then prints the final value of X and Y.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
# A - DDCC Finals
x,y = map(int, input().split())
X = 0
Y = 0


if x == 3:
    X = 100000
elif x == 2:
    X = 200000
elif x == 1:
    X = 300000
else :
    X = 0

if y == 3:
    Y = 100000
elif y == 2:
    Y = 200000
elif y == 1:
    Y = 300000
else:
    Y = 0

if x == 1 and y == 1:
    print(X+Y+400000)
else:
    print(X +Y)

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 1
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
