The variable a, b and c are initialized to 7, 5 and 1, respectively.
The function foo is called with the values of a, b and c.
The function foo iterates through the values of a, b and c.
The function foo checks if the value of i is equal to c.
If it is, it prints "YES" and returns.
If it is not, it adds the value of i to the set seen.
It then calculates the value of i by adding the value of m to the value of i and modulo b.
It checks if the value of i is in the set seen.
If it is, it prints "NO" and returns.
If it is not, it repeats the process.
