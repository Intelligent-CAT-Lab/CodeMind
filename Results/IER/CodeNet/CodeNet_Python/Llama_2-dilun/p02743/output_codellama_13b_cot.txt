The variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized to 2, 3 and 9, respectively.
The code checks if c-a-b is less than 0. If it is, it prints "No".
Otherwise, it checks if 4*a*b is less than (c-a-b)**2. If it is, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b,c = map(int,input().split())
if c-a-b < 0:
    print('No')
else:
    print('Yes' if 4*a*b < (c-a-b)**2 else 'No')
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 3 9
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
