The variable w, variable a and variable b are initialized to 3, 2 and 6, respectively.
The code checks if the absolute difference between a and b is less than w.
If it is, it prints 0.
Otherwise, it prints the absolute difference between a and b minus w.
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
w, a, b = map(int, input().split())

if abs(a-b) < w:
    print(0)
else:
    print(abs(a-b) - w)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 2 6
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
