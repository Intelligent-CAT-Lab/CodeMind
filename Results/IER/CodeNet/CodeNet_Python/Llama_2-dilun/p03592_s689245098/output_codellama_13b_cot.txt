The variable n, variable m and variable k are initialized to 2, 2 and 2, respectively.
The variable t is initialized to a list of 0s, which will be used to store the result of the calculation.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 2.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the product of i and m, which is 2m.
It then calculates the difference between n and i, which is n - i - i, which is 0.
It then sets the value of t[2m] to 1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the value of t[k], which is 0.
Since t[k] is 0, the code prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No

Consider the following code:
<Code>
n,m,k = map(int, input().split())
t = [0 for i in range(n*m+1)]
for i in range(n+1):
    a = i * m
    b = n - i - i
    for j in range(m):
        t[a] = 1
        a += b
if t[k] == 0:
    print('No')
else:
    print('Yes')

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 2 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
