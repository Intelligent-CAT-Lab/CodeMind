The variable n is initialized to 20.
The code enters a while loop that iterates until n is a prime number.
The variable prime_dc is initialized to 0.
The code iterates from 2 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 2 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it checks if n % i is not equal to 0. If it is, it adds 1 to prime_dc.
The code checks if n-2 == prime_dc. If it is, it breaks out of the loop.
The code prints the value of n, which is 19.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
n = int(input())


while 1:
    prime_dc = 0
    for i in range(2,n):
        if n % i!= 0:
            prime_dc += 1
            
    if n-2 == prime_dc:
        break
    
    n += 1

print(n)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
