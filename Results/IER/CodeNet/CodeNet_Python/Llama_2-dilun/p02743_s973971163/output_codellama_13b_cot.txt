The variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized to 2, 3 and 9, respectively.
The code checks if c-a-b is greater than 0 and if (c-a-b)**2-4*a*b is greater than 0.
The condition is met when c-a-b is 1 and (c-a-b)**2-4*a*b is 1.
The code then prints "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b,c = map(int,input().split())
if c-a-b > 0 and (c-a-b)**2-4*a*b>0:
  print('Yes')
else:
  print('No')
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 3 9
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
