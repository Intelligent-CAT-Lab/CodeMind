The variable n is initialized to 8.
The code then prints the binary representation of n, which is 00000000000000000000000000000008.
The code then prints the binary representation of ~n & mask, which is 11111111111111111111111111111111.
The code then prints the binary representation of (n<<1)& mask, which is 00000000000000000000000000000000.
The code then prints the binary representation of (n>>1)& mask, which is 00000000000000000000000000000000.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
n = int(input())
mask = (1<<32)-1
print('{:032b}'.format(n))
print('{:032b}'.format(~n & mask))
print('{:032b}'.format((n<<1)& mask))
print('{:032b}'.format((n>>1)& mask))

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
