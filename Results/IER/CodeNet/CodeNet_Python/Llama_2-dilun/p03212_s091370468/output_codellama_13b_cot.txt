The variable N is initialized to 575.
The function dfs(num) is called with num = "0".
The function dfs(num) iterates through the string "753" and checks if the string is present in num.
If it is, it sets cnt to 1.
If it is not, it sets flag to 0 and breaks the loop.
If flag is 1, it adds 1 to cnt.
It then iterates through the string "753" and calls dfs(num + i) for each i.
It returns the value of cnt.
