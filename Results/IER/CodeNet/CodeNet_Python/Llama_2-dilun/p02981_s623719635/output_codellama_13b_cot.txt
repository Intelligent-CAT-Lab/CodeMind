The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 4, 2 and 9, respectively.
The code then checks if N * A is greater than B. If it is, it prints B. Otherwise, it prints N * A.
The condition is met when N is 4 and A is 2.
The output is 9.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())

if (N * A > B):
  print(B)
else:
  print(N*A)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4 2 9
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
