The variable N and variable M are initialized to 1 and 6, respectively.
The code checks if N is greater than or equal to M. If it is, it adds M//2 to count.
If N*2 is less than or equal to M, it adds N to count and subtracts N*2 from M. It then adds M//4 to count.
The final value of count is 3.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, M = list(map(int, input().split()))

count = 0
if N >= M:
    count += M//2
elif N*2 <= M:
    count += N
    M = M - N*2
    count += M//4

print(count)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 6
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
