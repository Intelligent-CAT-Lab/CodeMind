The variables a, b, c and d are initialized to 1, 1, 3 and 4, respectively.
The absolute value of c-a is calculated and stored in c.
The absolute value of d-b is calculated and stored in d.
The greatest common divisor of max(c,d) and min(c,d) is calculated and stored in g.
The integer part of c/g is calculated and stored in j.
The integer part of d/g is calculated and stored in k.
The product of j+k-1 and g is calculated and printed.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import math
a,b,c,d=map(int,input().split())
x=math.sqrt(a)
y=math.sqrt(b)
z=math.sqrt(c)
w=math.sqrt(d)
print(x*y*z*w)
</Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 1 3 4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
