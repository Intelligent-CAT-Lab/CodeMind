The variable N, variable d and variable x are initialized to 1, 3 and 3, respectively.
The function main is called with the parameters N, d and x.
The function main then enters a while loop that iterates while N is not 0.
In each iteration, it adds d to the sum and then updates d, x and N.
The sum is updated by adding d to the sum and then adding (N-0.5) * x.
d is updated by adding d/N to d, adding 5*x/2*N to d and then adding d to d.
x is updated by adding 2*x/N to x and then adding x to x.
N is updated by subtracting 1 from N.
After the loop finishes, the function main returns the sum.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import sys

read = sys.stdin.buffer.read
readline = sys.stdin.buffer.readline
readlines = sys.stdin.buffer.readlines

N, d, x = map(int, read().split())

def main(N, d, x):
    ret = 0
    while N:
        ret += d + (N-0.5) * x
        d = d + (d/N) + (5*x)/(2*N)
        x += 2*x/N
        N -= 1
    return ret

print(main(N, d, x))
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 3 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
