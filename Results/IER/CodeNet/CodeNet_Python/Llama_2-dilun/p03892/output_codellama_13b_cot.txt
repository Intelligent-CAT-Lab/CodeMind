The variables a, b, c and d are initialized to 1, 1, 3 and 4, respectively.
The function gcd(a, b) is called to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a and b.
The function gcd(a, b) recursively calls itself until the GCD of a and b is found.
The function gcd(a, b) returns b if a%b==0, which means that b is the GCD of a and b.
Otherwise, it returns gcd(b, a%b), which means that the GCD of b and a%b is returned.
The function gcd(a, b) is called with a and b as arguments.
The function gcd(a, b) returns the GCD of a and b, which is 1.
The function gcd(a, b) is called with a and b as arguments.
