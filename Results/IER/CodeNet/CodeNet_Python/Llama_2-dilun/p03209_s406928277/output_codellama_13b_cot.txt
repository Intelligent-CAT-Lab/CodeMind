The variable n, variable x and variable size are initialized to 2 and 7, respectively.
The variable pati is initialized to [1].
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 1.
For each number i in this range, it appends the value of size[i] to the list size.
The code then appends the value of pati[i] to the list pati.
The variable ans is initialized to 0.
The code enters another loop that iterates from 0 to n-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 1.
If x is equal to 1, it will break the loop.
If x is equal to size[n-i], it will add the value of pati[n-i] to ans and break the loop.
If x is equal to size[n-i-1]+2, it will add the value of pati[n-i-1]+1 to ans and break the loop.
If x is greater than size[n-i-1] + 2, it will add the value of pati[n-i-1]+1 to ans and subtract size[n-i-1] + 2 from x.
If none of the above conditions are met, it will subtract 1 from x.
If x is equal to 1, it will add 1 to ans and break the loop.
The code prints the value of ans, which is 10.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
n,x = map(int,input().split())
size = [1]
pati = [1]
for i in range(n):
    size.append(size[i]*2 + 3)
    pati.append(pati[i]*2 + 1)
ans = 0
for i in range(n):
    if x == 1:
        x -= 1
        break
    elif x == size[n-i]:
        ans += pati[n-i]
        break
    elif x == size[n-i-1]+2:
        ans += pati[n-i-1]+1
        break
    elif x > size[n-i-1] + 2:
        ans += pati[n-i-1]+1
        x -= size[n-i-1] + 2
    else:
        x -= 1
if x == 1:
    ans += 1
print(ans)

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 7
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
