The variable n, variable m and variable r are initialized to 2, 0 and 3, respectively.
The variables a and b are initialized to the sorted list [n-1, r-m*n].
The variable d is initialized to 1, which will be used to calculate the value of u.
The variable u is initialized to 1, which will be used to calculate the value of d.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from a to b, meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 2.
For each number i in this range, it multiplies d by i+1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from b to a+b, meaning it will consider numbers from 2 to 3.
For each number i in this range, it multiplies u by i+1.
The code then prints the value of u//d, which is 0.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
n,m,r=map(int,input().split())
a,b=sorted([n-1,r-m*n])
d=1
for i in range(a):d*=i+1
u=1
for i in range(b,a+b):u*=i+1
print(0 if a<1 else u//d)

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 0 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
