The variable n and variable k are initialized to 7 and 4, respectively.
The variable rot is initialized to 1, which is the number of times the number 7 is divided by 4.
The variable x is initialized to 7, which is the remainder of 7 divided by 4.
The code checks if k is 1 or n is k or n is divisible by k. If it is, it sets x to 0.
The code checks if rot is greater than or equal to 1. If it is, it sets x to 7 - 4*rot.
The code checks if x is divisible by k. If it is, it sets t to x divided by k.
The code prints the minimum of t and the absolute value of t minus k.
The output is 0.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
n, k = map(int, input().split())

rot = n//k
x = n

if k == 1 or n == k or n%k == 0:
  x = 0
elif rot >= 1:
  x = n - k*rot
  
t = x%k

print(min(t, abs(t-k)))
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```7 4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
