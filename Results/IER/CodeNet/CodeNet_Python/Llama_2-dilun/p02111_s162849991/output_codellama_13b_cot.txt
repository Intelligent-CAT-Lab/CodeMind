    Consider the following code:
<Code>
s = int(input())

print(s // 30, 2 * (s % 30))

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
