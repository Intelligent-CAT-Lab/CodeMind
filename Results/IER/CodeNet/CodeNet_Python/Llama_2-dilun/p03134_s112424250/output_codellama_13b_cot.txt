    Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())

A = [0]*N
B = [0]*N
C = [0]*N

for i in range(N):
    A[i] = int(input())
    B[i] = int(input())
    C[i] = int(input())

for i in range(N):
    if A[i] == B[i] == C[i]:
        print(1)
    else:
        print(0)
</Code>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 2 2```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
