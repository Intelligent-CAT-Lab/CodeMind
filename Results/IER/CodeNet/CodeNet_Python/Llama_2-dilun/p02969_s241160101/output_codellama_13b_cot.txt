The code first reads the input n, which is 4.
The code then prints 3*4*4, which is 48.
<<<Output>>>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import sys
def inp(): return int(sys.stdin.readline())
def inpl(): return list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))
def inpl_str(): return list(sys.stdin.readline().split())

n = inp()
print(n)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
