The variable x is initialized to 33.
The code checks if the square root of x is equal to x itself. This is true for x = 33, so the code exits.
The code then iterates from 1 to 10^5, which is 1000000.
For each number i in this range, the code calculates the square of i and adds it to x. This is done by setting b = i and c = -i.
The code then checks if the square root of x1 is equal to x1 itself. This is true for x1 = 33, so the code exits.
The code then iterates from 1 to 10^3, which is 1000.
For each number j in this range, the code calculates the square of j and adds it to x2. This is done by setting v = -j.
The code then checks if the square root of x2 is equal to x2 itself. This is true for x2 = -33, so the code exits.
The code then prints the values of b and c, which are 33 and -33, respectively.
<<<Output>>>
33 -33

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
x = int(input())
if int(x**0.2)==int(x)**0.2:
  print(int(x**0.2),0)
  exit()
for i in range(1,10**5):
  b = i
  c = -i
  x1 = x + b**5
  x2 = x + c**5
  if x1>=0 and int(x1**0.2)**5==x1:
    print(int(x1**0.2),b)
    exit()
  if x2>=0 and int(x2**0.2)**5==x2:
    print(int(x2**0.2),c)
    exit()
  if x2<0:
    for j in range(1,10**3):
      v = -j
      if v**5==x2:
        print(v,c)
        exit()
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```33
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
