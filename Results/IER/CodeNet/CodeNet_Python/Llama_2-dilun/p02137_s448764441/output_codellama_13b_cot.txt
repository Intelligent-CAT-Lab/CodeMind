The variable n is initialized to 5700.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The variable l is initialized to [10000, 5000, 1000, 500].
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 3 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 3.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in ans.
The code checks if ans is within the range [10000, 5000, 1000, 500], which is [10000, 5000, 1000, 500] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to ans. The condition is met when i is 0, 1, 2 and 3.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 10000.
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
n = int(input())
ans = 0
l = [10000, 5000, 1000, 500]
for i in range(4) :
    ans += (n // l[i]) * l[i]
    n = n % l[i]
print(ans)

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5700
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
