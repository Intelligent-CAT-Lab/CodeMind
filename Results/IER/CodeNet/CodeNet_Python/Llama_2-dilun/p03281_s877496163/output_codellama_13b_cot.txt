The variable n is initialized to 105.
The code checks if n is less than 105. If it is, it prints 0. Otherwise, it initializes the variable ans to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 105 to n+1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 105 to 210.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the number of factors of i that are less than or equal to 105.
If the number of factors is 8, it adds 1 to ans.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 1.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
n=int(input())
if n<105:
  print(0)
else:
  ans=0
  for i in range(105,n+1,2):
    cnt=0
    for j in range(1,i+1,2):
      if i % j==0:
        cnt +=1
    else:
      if cnt == 8:
        ans +=1
  print(ans)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```105
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
