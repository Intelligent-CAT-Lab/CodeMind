The variable a, variable b and variable t are initialized to 3, 5 and 7, respectively.
The code then prints the output, which is 35.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
a, b, t = map(int, input().split())
print((t // a) * b)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 5 7
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
