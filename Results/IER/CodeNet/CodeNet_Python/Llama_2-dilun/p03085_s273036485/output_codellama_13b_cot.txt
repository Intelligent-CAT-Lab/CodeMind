The variable x is initialized to 'A'.
The code checks if x is equal to 'A', which is true. It prints 'T' and terminates.
<<<Output>>>
T

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
x = input()
if x == 'A': print('T')
elif x == 'T': print('A')
elif x == 'G': print('C')
else: print('G')
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```T
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
