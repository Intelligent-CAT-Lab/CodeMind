The variable n is initialized to 0.
The code then prints the length of the binary representation of n minus 2.
The binary representation of 0 is 0, which has length 1.
The length of the binary representation of 0 minus 2 is 0.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
n = int(input())
print(len(bin(n)) - 2 if n else 0)

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
