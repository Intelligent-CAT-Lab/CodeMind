The variable n and variable m are initialized to 2 and 2, respectively.
The code checks if n and m are equal to 1. If they are, it prints 1.
If n is 1 and m is not 1, it prints the maximum of n and m minus 2.
If n is not 1 and m is 1, it prints the maximum of n and m minus 2.
If neither of the above conditions is met, it prints the product of n minus 2 and m minus 2.

The output is 1.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
n,m = map(int, input().split())
if n == m== 1:
    print(1)
elif n == 1 or m == 1:
    print(max(n,m)-2)
else:
    print((n-2)*(m-2))
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
