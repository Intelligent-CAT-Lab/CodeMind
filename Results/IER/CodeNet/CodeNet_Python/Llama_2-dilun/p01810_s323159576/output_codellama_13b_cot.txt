The variable N and variable k are initialized to 4 and 2, respectively.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N - 1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 3.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the value of ans by multiplying ans by k and adding k - 1.
The code then calculates the value of ans by dividing it by k - 1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10

Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, k = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
ans = 0
for i in range(N - 1):
  ans = (ans * k + k - 1) // (k - 1)
print(ans)

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
