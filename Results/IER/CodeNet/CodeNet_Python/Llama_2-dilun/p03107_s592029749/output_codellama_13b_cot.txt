The variable s is initialized to the input string "0011".
The variable n is initialized to the length of s, which is 4.
The variable ok is initialized to 0, which will be used to check if the code has reached the end of the input.
The code enters a loop that iterates while ok is 0.
In the loop, the variable i is initialized to 0, which will be used to iterate through the input string.
The code then enters another loop that iterates while i is less than the length of s minus 1.
In this loop, the variable str is initialized to the concatenation of the first and second characters of s, which is "01".
The variable j is initialized to 0, which will be used to iterate through the input string.
The code then enters another loop that iterates while str is equal to "01" or "10".
In this loop, the code checks if the concatenation of the first and second characters of s is equal to "01" or "10".
If it is, the code removes the first and second characters of s and sets ok to 0.
The code then increments the variable j by 1.
If the variable i is greater than the variable j plus 1, the code sets the variable str to the concatenation of the first and second characters of s minus j and the first and second characters of s minus j plus 1.
Otherwise, the code breaks out of the loop.
The code then increments the variable i by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the length of s minus the length of the remaining input, which is 2.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import sys
input = sys.stdin.readline
s = input()
n = len(s)
ok = 0
while ok == 0:
    ok = 1
    i = 0
    while i < len(s) - 1:
        str = s[i] + s[i+1]
        j = 0
        while str == "01" or str == "10":
            s = s[:i-j] + s[i+2-j:]
            ok = 0
            j += 1
            if i > j + 1:
                str = s[i-j] + s[i-j+1]
            else:
                break
        i += 1
print(n - len(s))
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```0011
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
