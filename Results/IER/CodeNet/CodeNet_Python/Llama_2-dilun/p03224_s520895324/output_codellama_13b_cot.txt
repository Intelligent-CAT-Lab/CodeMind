The variable N is initialized to 3.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 2000 to 1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 2000 to 3.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i*(i-1)//2 is equal to N. This condition is met when i is 3.
If the condition is met, the code sets c to 1 and initializes the list X to an empty list.
It then iterates through the range of j from 0 to i-1 and iterates through the range of k from j+1 to i-1.
For each pair of j and k, it appends c to X[j] and X[k].
It then increments c by 1.
It prints "Yes" and the length of X.
It then iterates through X and prints the length of each sublist and the sublist itself.
It then breaks out of the loop.
If the condition is not met, it prints "No".

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())
for i in range(2000):
    if i*(i-1)//2 == N:
        c = 1
        X = [[] for _ in range(i)]
        for j in range(i):
            for k in range(j+1, i):
                X[j].append(c)
                X[k].append(c)
                c += 1
        print("Yes")
        print(len(X))
        for x in X:
            print(len(x), *x)
        break
else:

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
