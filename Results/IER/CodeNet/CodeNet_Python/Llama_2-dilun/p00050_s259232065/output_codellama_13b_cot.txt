The input is "the cost of one peach is higher than that of one apple."
The first line of code replaces "apple" with "X" in the input.
The second line of code replaces "peach" with "apple" in the input.
The third line of code replaces "X" with "peach" in the input.
The final input is "the cost of one peach is higher than that of one X."
<<<Output>>>
the cost of one peach is higher than that of one X.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
s = input()
s = s.replace("apple", "X")
s = s.replace("peach", "apple")
s = s.replace("X", "peach")
print(s)

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```the cost of one peach is higher than that of one apple.
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
