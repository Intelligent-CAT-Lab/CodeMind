The variable n, variable a, variable b and variable k are initialized to 4, 1, 2 and 5, respectively.
The variable m is initialized to the value of n // 2 + 1, which is 2 in this case.
The variable mod is initialized to 998244353.
The variable comb is initialized to a list of length m, which is 2 in this case.
The first element of the list is initialized to 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to m (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 2.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the product of the previous element of the list comb and the current number i.
It then calculates the product of the current number i and the number n + 1 - i.
It then calculates the product of the current number i and the number n + 1 - i.
It then calculates the product of the current number i and the number n + 1 - i.
