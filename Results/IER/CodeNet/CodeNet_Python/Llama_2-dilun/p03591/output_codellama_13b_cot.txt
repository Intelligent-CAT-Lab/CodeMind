The variable S is initialized to "YAKINIKU".
The code then prints "Yes" if the first 4 characters of S are "YAKI" and "No" otherwise.
The condition is met, so the code prints "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
S = input()
print('Yes' if S[:4] == 'YAKI' else 'No')
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```YAKINIKU
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
