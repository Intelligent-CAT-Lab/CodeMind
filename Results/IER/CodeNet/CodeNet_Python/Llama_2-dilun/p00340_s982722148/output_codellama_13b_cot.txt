The variable a, b, c and d are initialized to 1, 1, 3 and 4, respectively.
The code checks if a equals b and c equals d. This condition is not met, so the code prints "no".
The code then checks if a equals c and b equals d. This condition is met, so the code prints "yes".
The code then checks if a equals d and b equals c. This condition is met, so the code prints "yes".
<<<Output>>>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b,c,d=map(int,input().split())
if a==b and c==d:
    print('yes')
elif a==c and b==d:
    print('yes')
elif a==d and b==c:
    print('yes')
else:
    print('no')


<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 1 3 4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
