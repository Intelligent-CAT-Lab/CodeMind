The variable N and variable K are initialized to 5 and 2, respectively.
The code then prints the output of the code, which is 0.5.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
# AOJ 1593: Star
# Python3 2018.7.13 bal4u

import math
PI = 3.1415926535897932384626433832795
# area = n*r^2*sin(180/n)*cos(180k/n)*sec(180(k-1)/n), for n/k star
N, K = map(int, input().split())
print(N*math.sin(PI/N)*math.cos(K*PI/N)/math.cos((K-1)*PI/N))

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
