The variable S is initialized to "abac".
The variable a is initialized to 2, which is the number of times "a" appears in S.
The variable b is initialized to 1, which is the number of times "b" appears in S.
The variable c is initialized to 1, which is the number of times "c" appears in S.

The code then checks if the difference between the maximum and minimum number of times a letter appears in S is greater than or equal to 2.
If it is, the code prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES".

In this case, the difference between the maximum and minimum number of times a letter appears in S is 2, so the code prints "NO".

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())
A = list(map(int, input().split()))
B = list(map(int, input().split()))

for i in range(N):
    if A[i] == B[i]:
        print("YES")
    else:
        print("NO")
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3
1 2 3
1 2 3
1 2 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The variable N is initialized to 3, which is the number of test cases.
The variable A is initialized to [1, 2, 3], which is the first test case.
The variable B is initialized to [1, 2, 3], which is the second test case.

The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to N-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider all test cases.
For each test case, it checks if the elements of A and B are equal.
If they are, the code prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".

In this case, the elements of A and B are equal, so the code prints "YES" three times.
<<<Output>>>
YES
YES
