The variable ans is initialized to a list containing 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 16, 12, 64, 24, 36, 48, 1024, 60.
The code then prints the value of ans[int(input())], which is the value of ans at the index of the input.
The input is 1, so the code prints the value of ans[1], which is 6.
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
# AOJ 1562: Divisor
# Python3 2018.7.13 bal4u

ans = [0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 16, 12, 64, 24, 36, 48, 1024, 60] 
print(ans[int(input())])

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
