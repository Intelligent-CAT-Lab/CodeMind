The code reads the input from the standard input, which is the terminal.
The input is "aba".
The code then calculates the length of the input, which is 3.
The code then checks if the first and last characters of the input are the same.
In this case, the first and last characters are 'a', so the condition is met.
The code then calculates the number of characters that are different from the first and last characters, which is 1.
The code then calculates the number of characters that are different from the first and last characters, which is 1.
