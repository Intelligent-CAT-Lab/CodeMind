The variable M is initialized to 55555.
The variable m is initialized to the square root of M plus 1.
The variable S is initialized to a list of zeros with length M+1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to m (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 2 to 55555.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is a multiple of 5 and if it is, it sets the value of S[i] to 1.

For each number i in this range, it checks if i is a multiple of 5 and if it is, it sets the value of S[i] to 1.
The code then prints the value of N, which is 5 in this case.
