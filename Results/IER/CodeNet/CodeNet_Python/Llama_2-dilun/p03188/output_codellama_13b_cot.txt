The variable K is initialized to 2.
The code checks if K is less than or equal to 500. If it is, it prints K and then prints K spaces.
If K is greater than 500, the code calculates KUP, which is 1000 in this case.
It then initializes an array ANS with 1000 rows and 1000 columns.
The code then iterates through the array ANS, starting from the first row and first column.
If the row number is even, it sets the value of the cell to the column number plus 1.
If the row number is odd, it sets the value of the cell to the column number plus 1 plus 1000.
The code then iterates through the array ANS again, starting from the second row and first column.
It sets the value of the cell to the column number plus 1.
It then iterates through the array ANS again, starting from the second row and second column.
It sets the value of the cell to the column number plus 1.
