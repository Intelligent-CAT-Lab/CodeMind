The code checks if the input contains the character '9'.
The input is 29, which contains the character '9'.
Therefore, the code prints 'Yes'.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

[INST]
    Consider the following code:
<Code>
if '9' in input():
    print('Yes')
else:
    print('No')
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```29
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
