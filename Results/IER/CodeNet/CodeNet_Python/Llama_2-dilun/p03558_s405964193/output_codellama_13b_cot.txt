The input is 6.
The code first initializes the variable K to 6.
The code then calls the function small_multiple, which calculates the sum of all numbers that are multiples of 6.
The function small_multiple calculates the sum of all numbers that are multiples of 6.
It does this by first creating a graph that represents the relationship between numbers.
The graph is a list of lists, where each inner list represents a number and each outer list represents a relationship between two numbers.
The graph is then traversed using a breadth-first search algorithm, which calculates the sum of all numbers that are multiples of 6.
The function returns the sum of all numbers that are multiples of 6, which is 12.
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import sys


def main():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        if a > b:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The input is 3.
The code first initializes the variable n to 3.
The code then enters a loop that iterates n times.
For each iteration, the code takes two integers a and b as input and checks if a is greater than b.
If a is greater than b, the code prints "YES".
Otherwise, the code prints "NO".
The output of the code is "YES" for the first iteration, "NO" for the second iteration, and "YES" for the third iteration.
<<<Output>>>
YES
