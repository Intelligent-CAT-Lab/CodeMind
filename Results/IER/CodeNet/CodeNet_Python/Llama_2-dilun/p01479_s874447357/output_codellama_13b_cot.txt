The variable a is initialized to "eggchickenegg".
The code replaces "egg" with "0" and "chicken" with "1" in a.
The code then iterates from the length of a minus 2 to the length of a minus 1, meaning it will consider the last two characters of a.
For each character i in this range, it checks if the character i is equal to the character i+1. If it is, it removes the characters i and i+1 from a.
The code then sorts the characters in a using the key lambda x:len(x) and the reverse True.
The code then prints "egg" if the first character of a is "0" or "chicken" if the first character of a is not "0".
The output is "chicken".

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
a = raw_input().replace("egg","0").replace("chicken","1")
for i in range(len(a)-2,-1,-1):
	if a[i] == a[i+1]: a = a[:i+1] + " " + a[i+1:]
a = sorted(a.split(), key = lambda x:len(x), reverse = True)
print "egg" if a[0][-1] == "0" else "chicken"
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```eggchickenegg
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
