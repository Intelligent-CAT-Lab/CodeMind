The variable a and variable b are initialized to 2 and 5, respectively.
The code checks if max(a,b) is greater than 9. If it is, it prints -1. Otherwise, it prints a*b.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
a, b = map(int, input().split())
if max(a,b)>9:
  print(-1)
else:
  print(a*b)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 5
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
