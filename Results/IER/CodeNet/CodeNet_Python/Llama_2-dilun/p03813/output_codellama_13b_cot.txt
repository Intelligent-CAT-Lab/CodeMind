The variable a is initialized to 1000.
The code then prints 'ABC' if a is less than 1200, which is true in this case.
The code then prints 'ARC' if a is greater than or equal to 1200, which is false in this case.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
a = int(input())
print('ABC' if a<1200 else 'ARC')
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1000
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
