The variable n and variable m are initialized to 2 and 1, respectively.
The code calculates the sum of even numbers and odd numbers.
The sum of even numbers is calculated as n * (n-1) // 2, which is 2 * (2-1) // 2 = 2 * 1 // 2 = 2.
The sum of odd numbers is calculated as m * (m-1) // 2, which is 1 * (1-1) // 2 = 1 * 0 // 2 = 0.
The code then prints the sum of even numbers and odd numbers, which is 2 + 0 = 2.
<<<Output>>>
2

Consider the following code:
<Code>
n,m = map(int,input().split())

even = n * (n-1) // 2
odd = m * (m-1) // 2

print(even + odd)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 1
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
