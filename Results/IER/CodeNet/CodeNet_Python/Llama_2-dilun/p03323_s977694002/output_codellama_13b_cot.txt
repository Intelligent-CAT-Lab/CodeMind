The variable a and variable b are initialized to 5 and 4, respectively.
The code then prints 'Yay!' if a and b are both less than or equal to 8.
The condition is met when a and b are both 5.
The code then prints ':(' if a and b are not both less than or equal to 8.
The condition is met when a is 5 and b is 4.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
a, b = list(map(int, input().split()))
print('Yay!') if a<=8 and b<=8 else print(':(')
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
