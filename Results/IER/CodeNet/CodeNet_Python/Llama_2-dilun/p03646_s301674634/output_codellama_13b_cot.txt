The input is 0.
The code first initializes N to the maximum value of 2 and the minimum value of 50.
The code then initializes ans to a list of integers.
The code then initializes m to the remainder of K divided by N.
The code then iterates over the range of m, which is 0 in this case.
For each value of i in the range, the code iterates over the range of N, which is 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 in this case.
If i is equal to j, the code adds N to the value of ans[j].
If i is not equal to j, the code subtracts 1 from the value of ans[j].
The code then prints the value of N, which is 5.
The code then prints the values of ans, which are 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import sys
def main():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    K=int(input())
    N=max(2,min(50,K))
    ans=[i+K//N for i in range(N)]
    m=K%N
    for i in range(m):
        for j in range(N):
            if i==j: ans[j]+=N
            else: ans[j]-=1
    print(N)
    print(*ans)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
