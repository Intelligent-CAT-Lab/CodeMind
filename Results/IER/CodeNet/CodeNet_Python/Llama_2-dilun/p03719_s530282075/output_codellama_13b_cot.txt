The variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized to 1, 3 and 2, respectively.
The code checks if c is within the range [a, b], which is [1, 3] in this case.
If it is, it prints 'Yes'.
If it is not, it prints 'No'.
<<<Output>>>
Yes

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
if c >= a and c <= b:
    print('Yes')
else:
    print('No')

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 3 4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
