    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import math

# 入力
N=int(input())

print(int(math.sqrt(N))*int(math.sqrt(N)))
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```100
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
