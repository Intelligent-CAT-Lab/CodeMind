The code first reads the input file and stores it in a variable called f.
The code then calls the function solve() with f as an argument.
The function solve() then calls the function read() to read the input file.
The function read() then calls the function next_case() to read the next case.
The function next_case() then calls the function read_int() to read the number of cases.
The function read_int() then returns the number of cases, which is 1 in this case.
