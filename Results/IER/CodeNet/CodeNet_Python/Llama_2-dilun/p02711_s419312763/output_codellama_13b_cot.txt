The code takes the input as a string and converts it to a list of characters.
It then checks if the string contains the character '7'.
If it does, it prints "Yes".
If it doesn't, it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
print("Yes" if "7" in list(input()) else "No")
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```117
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
