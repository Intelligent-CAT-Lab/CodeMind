The code first initializes prime to [2].
The function check takes a number x as input and returns True if x is a prime number.
The function set iterates from 3 to 10^5 and appends each number that is a prime number to the list prime.
The code then takes two numbers p and q as input.
The code checks if q is divisible by p. If it is, it divides q by p and sets p to 1.
The code then iterates through the list prime.
For each number i in the list, it checks if q is divisible by i. If it is, it divides q by i and sets p to 1.
The code then checks if q is divisible by p. If it is, it divides q by p and sets p to 1.
The code then checks if q is divisible by any number in the list prime. If it is, it divides q by the number and sets p to 1.
The code then checks if q is divisible by p. If it is, it divides q by p and sets p to 1.
The code then checks if q is divisible by any number in the list prime. If it is, it divides q by the number and sets p to 1.
The code then checks if q is divisible by p. If it is, it divides q by p and sets p to 1.
The code then checks if q is divisible by any number in the list prime. If it is, it divides q by the number and sets p to 1.
The code then checks if q is divisible by p. If it is, it divides q by p and sets p to 1.
The code then checks if q is divisible by any number in the list prime. If it is, it divides q by the number and sets p to 1.
The code then checks if q is divisible by p. If it is, it divides q by p and sets p to 1.
The code then checks if q is divisible by any number in the list prime. If it is, it divides q by the number and sets p to 1.
The code then checks if q is divisible by p. If it is, it divides q by p and sets p to 1.
The code then checks if q is divisible by any number in the list prime. If it is, it divides q by the number and sets p to 1.
