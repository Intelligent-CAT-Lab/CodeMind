The variable s is initialized to "abc".
The code checks if the length of s is 2. If it is, it prints s.
The code checks if the length of s is 3. If it is, it prints s[2] + s[1] + s[0].

The output is "abc" and "abc".
<<<Output>>>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
s = input()
if len(s) == 2:
    print(s)
if len(s) == 3:
    print(s[2] + s[1] + s[0])

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```abc
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
