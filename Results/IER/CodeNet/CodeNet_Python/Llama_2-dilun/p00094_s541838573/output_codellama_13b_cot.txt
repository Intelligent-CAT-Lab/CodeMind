The variable a and variable b are initialized to 15 and 25, respectively.
The code calculates the product of a and b, which is 375.
The code then calculates the value of x, which is 375/3.305785, which is 113.75.
The code then prints the value of x rounded to 6 decimal places, which is 113.750000.
<<<Output>>>
113.750000

Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b=map(int,input().split())
x=a*b/3.305785
print(f"{x:.6f}")

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```15 25
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
