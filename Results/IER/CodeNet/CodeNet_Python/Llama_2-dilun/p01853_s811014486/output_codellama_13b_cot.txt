The variable n and variable m are initialized to 3 and 100, respectively.
The variable p is initialized to n//2+1, which is 2 in this case.
The code then prints a list of 2 elements, with the first element being a list of 0 elements and the second element being a list of m elements.
The output is [0, 100].

Consider the following code:
<Code>
n,m=map(int,input().split());p=n//2+1;print(*[0]*p+[m]*(n-p))
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 100
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
