The variable a is initialized to a list of integers, which is sorted in ascending order.
The variable b is initialized to a list of integers, which is [1,4,7,9].
The code then checks if a and b are equal. If they are, it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".
<<<Output>>>
NO

Consider the following code:
<Code>
a = sorted(list(int(i) for i in input().split()) )
b = [1,4,7,9]
if a == b:
 ans ='YES'
else:
 ans ='NO'
print(ans)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 7 9 4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
