The variables w, h, ax, ay, bx, by are initialized to 4, 4, 0, 0, 3, 3, respectively.
The code calculates the minimum of the absolute difference between the x-coordinates of the two points and the absolute difference between the y-coordinates of the two points.
The code then calculates the product of the minimum of the absolute difference between the x-coordinates of the two points and the absolute difference between the y-coordinates of the two points and the sum of the absolute difference between the x-coordinates of the two points and the absolute difference between the y-coordinates of the two points.
The code then calculates the product of the minimum of the absolute difference between the x-coordinates of the two points and the absolute difference between the y-coordinates of the two points and the sum of the absolute difference between the x-coordinates of the two points and the absolute difference between the y-coordinates of the two points and the product of the number of ways to arrange the absolute difference between the x-coordinates of the two points and the absolute difference between the y-coordinates of the two points and the sum of the absolute difference between the x-coordinates of the two points and the absolute difference between the y-coordinates of the two points.
