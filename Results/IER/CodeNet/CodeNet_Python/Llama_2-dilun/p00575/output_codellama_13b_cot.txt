The variable A, B and C are initialized to 3, 0 and 10, respectively.
The code calculates the ceiling of C/A, which is 3.3333333333333333.
The code calculates the sum of 7*A and B, which is 21.
The code calculates the quotient of C/s, which is 1.4285714285714286.
The code calculates the ceiling of u/A, which is 2.
The code calculates the sum of 7*t and v, which is 7.
The code calculates the ceiling of b, which is 7.
The code checks if a is greater than b, which is False.
The code prints the value of b, which is 7.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import math as m
A,B,C=(float(x) for x in input().split())

a=m.ceil(C/A)

s=7*A+B
t=C//s
#sは1週間にもらえるコインの枚数
u=C-s*t
#uは端数
v=m.ceil(u/A)

if v<=7:
    b=7*t+v
    
else:
    b=7*t+7
    
if a>b:
    print(int(b))
else:
    print(int(a))

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 0 10
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
