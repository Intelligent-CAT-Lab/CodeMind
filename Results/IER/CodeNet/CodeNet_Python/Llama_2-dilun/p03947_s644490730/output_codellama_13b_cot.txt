The variable s is initialized to the input string.
The first character of the input string is stored in the variable now.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the number of times the character now changes.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to the length of the input string (inclusive), meaning it will consider all characters in the input string.
For each character i in the input string, if the current character now is not equal to the character i, the variable ans is incremented by 1.
The variable now is then set to the character i.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 3.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
s=raw_input()
now=s[0]
ans=0
for i in xrange(1,len(s)):
    if now!=s[i]:
        ans+=1
        now=s[i]
print ans

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```BBBWW
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
