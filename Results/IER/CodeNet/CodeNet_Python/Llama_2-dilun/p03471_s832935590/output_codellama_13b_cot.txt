The code first reads the input and stores it in variables n and y.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 9.
For each number i in this range, it enters another loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 9.
For each number j in this range, it calculates the sum of i and j and stores it in y1000.
If the sum is equal to n, the code prints the values of i, j and y1000.
The code then prints -1, -1, -1 and exits.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
#import collections
#aa = collections.Counter(a) # list to list
def readInts():
  return list(map(int,input().split()))
mod = 10**9 + 7
def main():
    n,y = readInts()
    wa = 0

    for i in range(n+1):
        for j in range(n+1):
            if i+j > n:
                break
            y1000 = (y - 10000 * i - 5000 * j)//1000
            if i + j + y1000 == n:
                print(i,j,y1000)
                exit()
    print(-1,-1,-1)
    exit()


if __name__ == '__main__':
  main()

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```9 45000
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
