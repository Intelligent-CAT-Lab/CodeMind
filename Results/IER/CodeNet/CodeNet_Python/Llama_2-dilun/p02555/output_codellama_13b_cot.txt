<<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized to 7.
The code checks if s is less than 3. If it is, it prints 0 and exits.
The variable n is initialized to s//3, which is 2.
The variable mod is initialized to 10**9+7.
The variable fact is initialized to a list of 1s with length 2*s+1.
The variable inv is initialized to a list of 1s with length 2*s+1.
The code iterates from 2 to 2*s+1 and sets the value of fact[i] to i*fact[i-1]%mod.
The code iterates from 2*s to 1, decreasing by 1, and sets the value of inv[i-1] to inv[i]*i%mod.
The function comb is defined to return the product of fact[x]*inv[y]%mod*inv[x-y]%mod if x>=y>=0 else 0.
The variable ans is initialized to 0.
The code iterates from 1 to s+1 and sets the value of ans to the sum of comb(s-3*i+i-1,i-1)%mod for each i.
The code prints the value of ans.
