The variable s is initialized to the string "atcoder".
The code then prints the string s[::2], which is "atc".

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
s = input()
print(s[::-1])
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```atcoder
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
