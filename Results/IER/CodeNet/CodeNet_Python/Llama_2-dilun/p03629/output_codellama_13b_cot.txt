The code first reads the input string S.
It then calculates the ASCII value of each character in S.
The ASCII value of each character is subtracted by the ASCII value of 'a' to get the integer value of the character.
The code then creates a list of integers, int_s, which stores the integer values of the characters in S.

The code then creates a list of lists, next_char_pos, which stores the position of the next letter in S.
For each character in S, the code calculates the position of the next letter in S.
If the character is the last letter in S, the position is set to len_s + 1.
Otherwise, the position is set to the position of the next letter in S.

The code then creates a list, non_subseq_len, which stores the length of the shortest "non subsequence" in S.
A "non subsequence" is a sequence of letters in S that is not a subsequence of S.
For example, if S is "abc", the shortest "non subsequence" is "ab".
The code calculates the length of the shortest "non subsequence" in S by starting from the last letter in S and iterating through the letters in S.
For each letter in S, the code calculates the length of the shortest "non subsequence" in S[from_idx:] (the letters in S after the current letter).
If the length is greater than the current length, the current length is updated.
If the length is equal to the current length, the code sets the current letter to the letter and the current length to the length.
If the length is less than the current length, the code sets the current letter to the letter and the current length to the length + 1.

The code then creates a list, ans_next_pos, which stores the position of the next letter in S.
For each letter in S, the code calculates the position of the next letter in S.
If the letter is the last letter in S, the position is set to len_s + 1.
Otherwise, the position is set to the position of the next letter in S.

The code then creates a list, ans_letter, which stores the letter at the position in S.
For each letter in S, the code calculates the letter at the position in S.
If the letter is the last letter in S, the letter is set to the letter.
Otherwise, the letter is set to the letter at the position in S.

The code then iterates through the letters in S, starting from the last letter in S.
For each letter in S, the code calculates the length of the shortest "non subsequence" in S[from_idx:] (the letters in S after the current letter).
If the length is greater than the current length, the current length is updated.
If the length is equal to the current length, the code sets the current letter to the letter and the current length to the length.
If the length is less than the current length, the code sets the current letter to the letter and the current length to the length + 1.
