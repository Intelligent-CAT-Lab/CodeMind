The variable x is initialized to 33.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from -1000 to 1000, meaning it will consider numbers from -1000 to 1000.
For each number i in this range, it enters another loop that iterates from -1000 to 1000.
For each number j in this range, it calculates the difference between i^5 and j^5, and checks if the difference is equal to x. If it is, it prints the values of i and j, and breaks out of the inner loop.
If the difference is not equal to x, the code continues to the next iteration of the inner loop.
After the inner loop finishes, the code breaks out of the outer loop.

The code prints the values of i and j when i^5-j^5 is equal to 33, which is when i=1 and j=-1.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
x=int(input())
for i in range(-1000,1000):
  for j in range(-1000,1000):
    if i**5-j**5==x:
      print(i,j)
      break
  else:
    continue
  break
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```33
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
