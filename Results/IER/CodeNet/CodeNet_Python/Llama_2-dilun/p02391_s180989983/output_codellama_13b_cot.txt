The variable a and variable b are initialized to 1 and 2, respectively.
The code checks if a is greater than b. If it is, it prints "a > b".
If a is not greater than b, the code checks if a is less than b. If it is, it prints "a < b".
If a is not less than b, the code checks if a is equal to b. If it is, it prints "a == b".

The output is "a == b".

Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b=map(int,input().split())

if a>b:
    print("a > b")
elif a<b:
    print("a < b")
else:
    print("a == b")

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
