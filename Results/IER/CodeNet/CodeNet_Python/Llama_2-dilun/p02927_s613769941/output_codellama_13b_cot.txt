The variable M and variable D are initialized to 15 and 40, respectively.
The variable count is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the number of solutions.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to M (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 15.
For each number a in this range, it enters another loop that iterates from 22 to D (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 22 to 40.
For each number b in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in d10 and d1.
It then checks if d10 is greater than or equal to 2 and d1 is greater than or equal to 2 and d10*d1 is equal to a.
If it is, it adds 1 to count. The condition is met when b is 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of count, which is 10.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())

count = 0
for a in range(1, N+1):
    for b in range(1, N+1):
        if a*b == A:
            count += 1
            
    
    
print(count)

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10 100
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
