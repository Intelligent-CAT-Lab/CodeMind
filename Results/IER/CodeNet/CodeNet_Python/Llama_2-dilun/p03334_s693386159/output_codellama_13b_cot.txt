The variable N, variable D1 and variable D2 are initialized to 2, 1 and 2, respectively.
The function helper is called with the parameters N, D1 and D2.
The function helper calculates the grid of the given size N and the given divisor D.
The grid is a matrix of boolean values, where True means the cell is part of the grid and False means the cell is not part of the grid.
The grid is calculated by checking the divisor D.
If D is odd, the grid is calculated as follows:
The grid is initialized to all False values.
The grid is set to True for all cells in the first row and the second column.
The grid is set to False for all cells in the second row and the first column.
If D is even, the grid is calculated as follows:
