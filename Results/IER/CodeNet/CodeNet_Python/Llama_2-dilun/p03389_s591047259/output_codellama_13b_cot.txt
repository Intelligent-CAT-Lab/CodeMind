The input is 2 5 4.
The code first converts the input to a list of integers.
The list is then sorted in reverse order.
The code then calculates the difference between the first and second elements of the list, and the difference between the first and third elements of the list.
The code then checks if the sum of these differences is even or odd.
If it is even, the code prints the average of the two differences.
If it is odd, the code prints the average of the two differences plus 1.
In this case, the sum of the differences is 1, which is odd.
Therefore, the code prints the average of the two differences plus 1, which is 3.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
a=[int(i) for i in input().split()]
a.sort(reverse=True)

n1=a[0]-a[1]
n2=a[0]-a[2]
n0=a[1]-a[2]
if (n1 + n2) % 2 ==0:
  print(int((n1+n2)/2))
else:
  print(int((n1+n2+1)/2+1))
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 5 4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
