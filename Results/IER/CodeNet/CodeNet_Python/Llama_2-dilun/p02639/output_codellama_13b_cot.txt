<<<Analysis>>>
The variable x_list is initialized to a list of 5 integers, which are 0, 2, 3, 4 and 5.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 4 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 4.
For each number i in this range, it checks if x_list[i] is 0. If it is, it prints the value of i+1. The condition is met when i is 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of i+1, which is 5.
<<<Output>>>
5
