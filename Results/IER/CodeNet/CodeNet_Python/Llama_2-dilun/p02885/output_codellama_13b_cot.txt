The variable A and variable B are initialized to 12 and 4, respectively.
The code then calculates the difference between A and B * 2, which is 0.
The code then checks if the difference is less than 0. If it is, it prints 0. Otherwise, it prints the difference.
<<<Output>>>
0

Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())
A = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
B = [int(i) for i in input().split()]

for i in range(N):
    if A[i] == B[i]:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
</Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3
1 2
2 1
3 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

The variable N is initialized to 3, which means the code will process 3 sets of input.
The variable A is initialized to [1, 2] and the variable B is initialized to [2, 1].
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider 3 sets of input.
For each set of input, the code checks if A[i] is equal to B[i]. If it is, it prints YES. Otherwise, it prints NO.
The code prints YES for the first set of input, NO for the second set of input and YES for the third set of input.
<<<Output>>>
YES
NO
YES
