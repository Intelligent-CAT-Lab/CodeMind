The variable x and variable y are initialized to 2 and 1, respectively.
The code then prints the string 'Brown' if the absolute value of the difference between x and y is less than or equal to 1. Otherwise, it prints the string 'Alice'.
The absolute value of the difference between x and y is 1, so the code prints 'Brown'.
<<<Output>>>
Brown

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
x,y = map(int,input().split())
print('Brown' if abs(x-y)<=1 else 'Alice')
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 1
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
