The variable n and variable m are initialized to 4 and 1, respectively.
The code checks if n is odd. If it is, it sets l to 1 and r to n-1.
It then iterates m times and prints the values of l and r.
The code then sets l to 1 and r to n-1.
It then iterates m times and prints the values of l and r.

The code checks if n is even. If it is, it sets l to 1 and r to n-1.
