The variable N is initialized to 0.
The code then enters a while loop that iterates while N is not 0.
The code then divides N by 2, which will make N 0.
The code then adds 1 to ans, which is the answer.
The code then prints ans, which is 1.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())
ans = 0
while(N):
    N //= 2
    ans += 1
print(ans)

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```0
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
