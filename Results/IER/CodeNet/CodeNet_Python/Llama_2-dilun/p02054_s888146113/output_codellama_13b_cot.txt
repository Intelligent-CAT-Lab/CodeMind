The variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized to 1, 1 and 10, respectively.
The code checks if a is even, which is true. It then increments the counter cnt by 1.
The code checks if b is even, which is true. It then increments the counter cnt by 1.
The code checks if c is even, which is false. It does not increment the counter cnt.
The code checks if cnt is greater than or equal to 2, which is false. It prints "Hom".
<<<Output>>>
Hom

Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b,c = map(int,input().split())

cnt = 0
if a %2 == 0:
    cnt += 1
if b %2 == 0:
    cnt += 1
if c %2 == 0:
    cnt += 1
if cnt >= 2:
    print('Tem')
else:
    print('Hom')

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 1 10
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
