The code first splits the input into a list of strings.
Then it calculates the length of the set of strings.
The output is 2, which is the length of the set {1, 4}.
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())
A = list(map(int, input().split()))
B = list(map(int, input().split()))
C = list(map(int, input().split()))
D = list(map(int, input().split()))
print(sum(A) + sum(B) + sum(C) + sum(D))
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 1 4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

The code first reads the number N, which is 3 in this case.
It then reads 4 lists of integers, A, B, C and D.
The code then calculates the sum of each list and prints the result.
The output is 10, which is the sum of the 4 lists.
<<<Output>>>
