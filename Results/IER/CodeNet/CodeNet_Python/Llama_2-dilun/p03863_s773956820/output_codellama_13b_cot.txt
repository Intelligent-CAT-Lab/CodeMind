The variable s is initialized to the input string "aba".
The variable f is initialized to 1, which will be used to keep track of the current state of the code.
The variable h is initialized to a dictionary with the key -1 and the value "First", and the key 1 and the value "Second".
The variable r is initialized to True, which will be used to keep track of whether the code should continue or not.
The code enters a while loop that will continue until r is False.
Inside the loop, the variable p is initialized to 0, which will be used to keep track of the current position in the string.
The code then checks if p+2 is less than the length of the string, meaning if the current position is not at the end of the string.
If it is, the code checks if the current character and the next two characters are not the same.
If they are, the code deletes the second character and sets r to True.
This means that the code will continue to the next iteration.
If they are not the same, the code increments p and checks if it is at the end of the string.
If it is, the code prints "Second" and exits the loop.
If it is not, the code increments p and checks if it is at the end of the string again.
This process continues until p is at the end of the string, at which point the code prints "Second" and exits the loop.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
s = list(input())
f = 1 
h = {-1:"First", 1:"Second"}
r = True
while r:
        p = 0 
        r = False 
        for i in s:
                if p+2 < len(s):
                        if s[p]!= s[p+2]:
                                del s[p+1]
                                r = True
                                f = -f
                        else:
                                p += 1
print(h[f])
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```aba
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
