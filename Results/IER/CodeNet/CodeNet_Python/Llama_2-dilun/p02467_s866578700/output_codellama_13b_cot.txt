The input is 12.
The function factorize(n) is called, which takes n as input and returns a list of factors of n.
The list is then converted to a string and printed.
The output is 12: 2 2 3.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>

n=int(input())
def factorize(n):
    b = 2
    fct = []
    while b * b <= n:
        while n % b == 0:
            n //= b
            fct.append(b)
        b = b + 1
    if n > 1:
        fct.append(n)
    return fct

x=factorize(n)

L=" ".join(L)
print(f'{n}: {L}')

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```12
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
