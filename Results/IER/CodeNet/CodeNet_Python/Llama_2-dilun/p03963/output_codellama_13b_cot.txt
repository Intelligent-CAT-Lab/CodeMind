The variable n and variable k are initialized to 2 and 2, respectively.
The code then prints the value of k*(k-1)**(n-1), which is 2*1**(2-1) = 2.
<<<Output>>>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
n,k=map(int,input().split())
print(k*(k-1)**(n-1))
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
