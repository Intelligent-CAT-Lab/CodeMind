The input is 3776.
The code first checks if the input is a palindrome.
A palindrome is a word or phrase that reads the same backward as forward, such as "racecar" or "radar."
The code iterates from 0 to the length of the input minus 1.
For each index i, it checks if the input at index i is the same as the input at index i+1.
If it is, the code breaks out of the loop and prints "Good".
If it is not, the code prints "Bad".
<<<Output>>>
Bad

Consider the following code:
<Code>
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

def f(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    return f(n-1) + f(n-2)

print(f(10))

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
