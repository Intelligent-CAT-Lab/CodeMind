The variable N is initialized to 105.
The function divisor(n) calculates the number of divisors of n.
The variable i is initialized to 1.
The variable answer is initialized to 0.
The variable i is iterated from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 105.
For each number i in this range, if the number of divisors of i is 8, the variable answer is incremented by 1.
The variable i is incremented by 2.
The code prints the final value of answer, which is 10.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())


## 約数の列挙O(√N)
def divisor(n): #nの約数を全て求める
    i = 1
    table = []
    while i * i <= n:
        if n%i == 0:
            table.append(i)
            table.append(n//i)
        i += 1
    table = list(set(table))
    return len(table)
  
i = 1
answer = 0
while i <= N:
  if divisor(i) == 8:
    answer += 1
  i += 2
print(answer)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```105
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
