The variable W is initialized to 4.
The code then prints the value of W*32, which is 128.
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())
for i in range(1,N+1):
    print(i)

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

The variable N is initialized to 10.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 10.
For each number i in this range, it prints i.
The code prints 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10.
