The variable a, b, c, x, y are initialized to 1500, 2000, 1600, 3, 2, respectively.
The code then reads the input from stdin and stores it in a, b, c, x, y.
The code checks if 2 * c <= a + b.
If it is true, it calculates the minimum of x and y, and multiplies it by 2 * c.
It then subtracts the minimum of x and y from x and y.
If x is not 0 and 2 * c <= a, it multiplies 2 * c * x by a.
If x is not 0, it multiplies a * x by a.
If y is not 0 and 2 * c <= b, it multiplies 2 * c * y by b.
If y is not 0, it multiplies b * y by b.
Otherwise, it multiplies x * a by a and y * b by b.

The code then prints the final value of ans, which is 16000.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
from sys import stdin, stdout


a, b, c, x, y = map(int, stdin.readline().split())

ans = 0
if 2 * c <= a + b:
    ans += min(x, y) * 2 * c
    q = min(x, y)
    x -= q
    y -= q
    
    if x and 2 * c <= a:
        ans += 2 * c * x
    elif x:
        ans += a * x
    elif y and 2 * c <= b:
        ans += 2 * c * y
    else:
        ans += b * y
    
else:
    ans = x * a + y * b

stdout.write(str(ans))
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1500 2000 1600 3 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
