<<<Analysis>>>
The variable A, B and C are initialized to 50, 100 and 120, respectively.
The code checks if A+B is greater than or equal to C.
Since 50+100 is 150, which is greater than 120, the condition is met and the code prints "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
A,B,C=map(int,input().split())
if A+B>=C:
    print('Yes')
else:
    print('No')
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```50 100 120
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
