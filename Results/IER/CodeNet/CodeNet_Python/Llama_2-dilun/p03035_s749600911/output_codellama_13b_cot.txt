The variable A and variable B are initialized to 30 and 100, respectively.
The code checks if A is greater than or equal to 13. If it is, it prints B.
If A is not greater than or equal to 13, the code checks if A is greater than or equal to 6. If it is, it prints the value of B divided by 2.
If A is not greater than or equal to 6, it prints 0.

The output is 100.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
A, B = list(map(int, input().split()))

if A >=13:
	print(B)
elif A>=6:
	print(int(B/2))
else:
	print(0)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```30 100
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
