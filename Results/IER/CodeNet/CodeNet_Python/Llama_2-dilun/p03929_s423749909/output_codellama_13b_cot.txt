The code first imports some modules and defines some functions.
The code then reads the input and initializes N and K to 7 and 7, respectively.
The code then defines a list of lists called grid, which is used to store the grid of numbers.
The code then iterates through the list of lists and calculates the sum of the numbers in each row.
