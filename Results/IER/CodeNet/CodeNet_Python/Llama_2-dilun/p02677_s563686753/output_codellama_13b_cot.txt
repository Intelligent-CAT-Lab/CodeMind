The variable a, b, h and m are initialized to 3, 4, 9 and 0, respectively.
The function ii() is used to get the input of the user.
The function mi() is used to convert the input to a list of integers.
The variables a, b, h and m are assigned to the list elements.
The variable rad_m is initialized to m, which is 0.
The variable rad_h is initialized to h*5+5*(m/60), which is 45.
The variable r is initialized to the minimum of abs(rad_m-rad_h) and 360-abs(rad_m-rad_h), which is 360.
The variable rad is initialized to 360*r/60, which is 360.
The function math.sqrt() is used to calculate the square root of a**2+b**2-2*a*b*math.cos(math.radians(rad)), which is 5.
The output is printed.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
from sys import exit
import math
ii = lambda : int(input())
mi = lambda : map(int,input().split())
li = lambda : list(map(int,input().split()))

a,b,h,m = mi()

rad_m = m
rad_h = h*5+5*(m/60)

r = min(abs(rad_m-rad_h),360-abs(rad_m-rad_h))
rad = 360*r/60

print(math.sqrt(a**2+b**2-2*a*b*math.cos(math.radians(rad))))
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 4 9 0
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
