The variable X and variable A are initialized to 3 and 5, respectively.
The code checks if X is less than A. If it is, it prints 0. Otherwise, it prints 10.
<<<Output>>>
10

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
def main():
    X,A = map(int,input().split())
    if X < A:
        print('0')
    else:
        print('10')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 5
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
