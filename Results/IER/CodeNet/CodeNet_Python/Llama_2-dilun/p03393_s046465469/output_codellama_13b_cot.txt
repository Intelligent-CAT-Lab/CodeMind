The code takes the input as a string and converts it to a list of characters.
The code then converts the list of characters to a list of integers by subtracting 97 from each character.
The code then creates a list of booleans, where each element is set to 1 if the corresponding character is in the alphabet and 0 otherwise.
The code then checks if the length of the input is 26, which is the length of the alphabet. If it is, the code prints the input as a string.
If the length of the input is not 26, the code iterates through the alphabet and checks if any element is 0. If there is, the code prints the input as a string.
If there is no element that is 0, the code iterates through the input from the last character to the first character and checks if any element is 0. If there is, the code prints the input as a string.
If there is no element that is 0, the code prints -1.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
# coding: utf-8
# Your code here!
 
S=list(input())
 
 
S=list(map(lambda x : ord(x)-97,S))
 
alpha=[0]*26
for s in S:
    alpha[s]=1
 
if len(S)!=26:
    for i in range(26):
        if alpha[i] == 0:
            S.append(i)
            ans=S[:]
            ans=list(map(lambda x :chr(x+97), ans))
            print("".join(ans))
            exit()
else:
    for i in range(26)[::-1]:
        if alpha[S[i]:].count(0)>0:
            for j in range(S[i],26):
                if alpha[j]==0:
                    ans=S[:i]+[j]
                    ans=list(map(lambda x :chr(x+97), ans))
                    print("".join(ans))
                    exit()
        else:
            alpha[S[i]]=0

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```atcoder

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
