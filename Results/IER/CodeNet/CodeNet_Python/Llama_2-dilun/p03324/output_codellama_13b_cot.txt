The variable D and variable N are initialized to 0 and 5, respectively.
The code then prints the output of the code.
The output is 100 ** 0 * 5 if N!= 100 else 100 ** 0 * (N + 1).
The output is 100 ** 0 * 5 if N!= 100 else 100 ** 0 * (N + 1).

Consider the following code:
<Code>
# coding: utf-8
D, N = map(int, input().split())
print(100 ** D * N if N!= 100 else 100 ** D * (N + 1))
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```0 5
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
