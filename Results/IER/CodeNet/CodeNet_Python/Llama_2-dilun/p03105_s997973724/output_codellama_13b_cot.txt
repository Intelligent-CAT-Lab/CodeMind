The variable A, B and C are initialized to 2, 11 and 4, respectively.
The code checks if B // A is greater than or equal to C.
Since B // A is 1, which is less than C, the code prints C, which is 4.
<<<Output>>>
4

Consider the following code:
<Code>
A, B, C = map(int, input().split())

if B // A >= C:
    print(C)
else:
    print(B // A)

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 11 4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
