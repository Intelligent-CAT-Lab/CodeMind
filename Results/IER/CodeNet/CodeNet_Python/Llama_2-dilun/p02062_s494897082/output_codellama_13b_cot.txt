The code starts with a function evalor() that takes a list of strings as input and returns a tuple of two integers.
The first integer is the minimum of the sum of the first two strings in the list, and the second integer is the sum of the last two strings in the list.
The function andeval() takes two strings as input and returns a tuple of two integers.
The first integer is the minimum of the sum of the first two strings, and the second integer is the sum of the last two strings.
The function push() takes a list of strings and a string as input and returns a list of strings.
It appends the string to the list if the string is not the question mark, and it pops the last two strings from the list and returns the result of andeval() if the string is the question mark.
The function evalor() is called with the list of strings S, which is the input to the program.
The function push() is called with the list of strings f, which is initially empty, and the string s, which is the input to the program.
If s is the question mark, the function push() is called recursively with the list of strings f and the string s.
If s is not the question mark, the function push() is called with the list of strings f and the string s.
The function push() is called with the list of strings f and the string s until the list of strings f contains the string left.
The function push() is called with the list of strings f and the string s until the list of strings f contains the string right.
The function push() is called with the list of strings f and the string s until the list of strings f contains the string left.
