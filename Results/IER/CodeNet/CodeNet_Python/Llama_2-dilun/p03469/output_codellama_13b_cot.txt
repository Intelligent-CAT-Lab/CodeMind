The code prints the string '2018' followed by the input.
The input is '2017/01/07'.
The code then takes the last 4 characters of the input, which is '07', and prints it.
The output is '201807'.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
print('2018'+input()[4:])
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2017/01/07
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
