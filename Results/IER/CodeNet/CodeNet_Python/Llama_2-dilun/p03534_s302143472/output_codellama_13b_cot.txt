The code first converts the input string into a list of characters.
Then it uses the Counter class from the collections module to count the number of occurrences of each character in the list.
The code then stores the counts in a list, with the first element representing the number of occurrences of "a", the second element representing the number of occurrences of "b", and the third element representing the number of occurrences of "c".
The code then checks if the difference between the maximum and minimum counts is less than 2. If it is, the code prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".

In this case, the maximum count is 2, which is the number of occurrences of "a", and the minimum count is 1, which is the number of occurrences of "c". The difference between the maximum and minimum counts is 1, which is less than 2, so the code prints "YES".

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
from collections import Counter

s = list(input())
c = Counter(s)
c = [c["a"], c["b"], c["c"]]

if max(c)-min(c)<2:
    print("YES")
else:
    print("NO")

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```abac
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
