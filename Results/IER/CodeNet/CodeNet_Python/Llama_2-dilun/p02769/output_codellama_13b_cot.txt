<<<Analysis>>>
The code first defines two functions:
i1() returns the input as an integer.
i2() returns a list of integers, where each integer is the input of a single line.

The code then defines a variable mod, which is 10^9+7.

The code then defines a function bp(a, n), which calculates the value of a^n modulo mod.

The code then defines two variables, n and k, which are the input of the function i2().

The code then checks if n <= k. If it is, it sets x to 1 and iterates from n-1 to 1, multiplying x by 2*n-1-i modulo mod.

If n > k, the code sets x to 1 and iterates from k to 1, multiplying x by i+1 modulo mod.

The code then sets y to 1 and iterates from 10^9+5 to 1, multiplying y by i+1 modulo mod.

The code then sets t to 1 and iterates from 10^9+5 to 1, multiplying t by i+1 modulo mod.

The code then sets y to 1 and iterates from n-1 to 1, multiplying y by n-i modulo mod.

The code then sets c to bp(t, 10^9+5) and sets x to y*c*c modulo mod.

The code then prints the value of x.
