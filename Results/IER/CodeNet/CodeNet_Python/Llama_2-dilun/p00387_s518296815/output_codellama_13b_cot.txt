The variable a and variable b are initialized to 3 and 5, respectively.
The code then prints the value of (b+a-1)//a, which is 2.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
a, b = map(int, input().split())
print((b+a-1)//a)

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 5
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
