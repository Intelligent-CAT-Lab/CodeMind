The variable a and variable b are initialized to 20 and 30, respectively.
The code checks if a-b is equal to 0. If it is, it prints 0.
If a is greater than b, it prints a-b.
If a is less than b, it prints b-a.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b=map(int,input().split())
if a-b==0:
    print(0)
elif a>b:
    print(a-b)
else:
    print(b-a)

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20 30
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
