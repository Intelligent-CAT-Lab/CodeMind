The variable x is initialized to 6.
The code checks if the square root of 8 * x + 1 is an integer. If it is, it prints the integer.
Otherwise, it sets x to the negative of the square root of 1 + 8 * x.
It then prints the integer value of x + 1.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import math
x = int(input())
k = 0
t = 0

if (math.sqrt(8 * x + 1) == math.floor(math.sqrt(8 * x + 1))):
  a = (-1 + math.sqrt(1 + 8 * x))/2
  print(int(a))
else:
  x = (-1 + math.sqrt(1 + 8 * x))//2
  print(int(x) + 1)

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```6
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
