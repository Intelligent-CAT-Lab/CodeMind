The code first takes the input as a string and splits it into a list of characters.
Then it iterates through the list and checks if the character is '9' or '1'.
If it is '9', it replaces it with '1' and adds it to the new_S string.
If it is '1', it replaces it with '9' and adds it to the new_S string.
Otherwise, it just adds the character to the new_S string.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the new_S string, which is "1191".
<<<Output>>>

def inpl(): return list(map(int, input().split()))

#### START
S = input()

new_S = ""
for s in S:
  if s == "9":
    new_S = new_S + "1"
  elif s == "1":
    new_S = new_S + "9"
  else:
    new_S = new_S + s

print(new_S)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```119
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
