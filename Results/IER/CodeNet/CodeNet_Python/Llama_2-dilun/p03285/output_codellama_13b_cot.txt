The variable N is initialized to 11.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 25 to 0 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 25 to 0.
For each number i in this range, it enters another loop that iterates from 20 to 0 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 20 to 0.
For each number j in this range, it checks if 4*i + 7*j is equal to N. If it is, it prints 'Yes' and exits the program.
The condition is met when i is 5 and j is 0.
After the loop finishes, the code prints 'No'.
<<<Output>>>
No

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())
for i in range(25):
  for j in range(20):
    if 4*i + 7*j == N:
      print('Yes')
      exit()
print('No')
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```11
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
