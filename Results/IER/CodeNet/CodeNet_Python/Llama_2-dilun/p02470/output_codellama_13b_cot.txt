The input is 6.
The function primes(n) calculates the prime numbers less than or equal to n.
The function phi_func(n, p) calculates the phi function of n with respect to the prime numbers p.
The phi function of n is the number of integers less than or equal to n that are relatively prime to n.
The phi function of 6 is 2, because 1 and 5 are relatively prime to 6.

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The input is 10.
The function primes(n) calculates the prime numbers less than or equal to n.
The function phi_func(n, p) calculates the phi function of n with respect to the prime numbers p.
The phi function of 10 is 4, because 1, 3, 7 and 9 are relatively prime to 10.
