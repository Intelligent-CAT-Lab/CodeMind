The variable n is initialized to the input, which is [3, 5].
The code then prints the product of the first and second elements of n, which is 15.
The code then prints the product of the first element of n and the sum of the first and second elements of n, which is 15.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
# coding: utf-8
n = list(map(int,input().split()))
print(n[0]*n[1],(n[0]+n[1])*2)

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 5
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
