The variable a is initialized to the input string, which is "5 8".
The variable a is then split into two strings, "5" and "8".
The variable a[0] is then converted to an integer, which is 5.
The variable a[1] is then converted to an integer, which is 8.
The output of the code is then printed, which is 40.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
a=raw_input().split()
print(int(a[0])*int(a[1]))


<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 8
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
