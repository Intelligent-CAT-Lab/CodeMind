<<<Analysis>>>
The variable a and variable b are initialized to 4 and 5, respectively.
The code checks if a is divisible by 3, b is divisible by 3 or (a+b) is divisible by 3.
If any of these conditions is met, the code prints "Possible".
Otherwise, it prints "Impossible".
<<<Output>>>
Possible

Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b=map(int,input().split())
if a%3==0 or b%3==0 or (a+b)%3==0:
  print("Possible")
else:
  print("Impossible")
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4 5
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
