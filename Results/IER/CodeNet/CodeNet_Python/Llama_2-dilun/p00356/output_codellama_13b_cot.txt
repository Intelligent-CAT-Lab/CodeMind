The variable a and variable b are initialized to 4 and 4, respectively.
The code then prints the sum of a and b, which is 8.
The code then subtracts the greatest common divisor (gcd) of a and b, which is 2.
The code then adds 1 to the result, which is 7.
The code then prints the result, which is 7.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import math
a,b = map(int,input().split())
print(a+b-(math.gcd(a,b))+1)

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4 4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
