The variable N is initialized to 12.
The code then calculates the sum of digits of N, which is 3.
The code then checks if the number N is divisible by the sum of its digits.
Since 12 % 3 == 0, the code prints "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes

Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = input()
sum_Ndig =sum(map(int,N))
print( 'Yes' if int(N) % sum_Ndig ==0 else 'No')
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```12
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
