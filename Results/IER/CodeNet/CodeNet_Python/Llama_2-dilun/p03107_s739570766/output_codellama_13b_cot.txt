The code reads the input from stdin and stores it in the variable S.
The code then calculates the number of 0s and 1s in S and prints the minimum of the two numbers multiplied by 2.
The output is 2.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(x):
    return x**2

def g(x):
    return x**3

def h(x):
    return x**4

def main():
    x = int(input())
    print(f(x))
    print(g(x))
    print(h(x))

main()
</Code>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The code reads the input x from the user and stores it in the variable x.
The code then calls the function f(x) and prints the result.
The code then calls the function g(x) and prints the result.
The code then calls the function h(x) and prints the result.
The output is 100, 1000 and 1000000.
