The variable A, B and C are initialized to 1000, 900 and 850, respectively.
The code then checks if the maximum value among A, B and C is equal to A.
If it is, it prints "A".
Otherwise, it checks if the maximum value is equal to B.
If it is, it prints "B".
Otherwise, it prints "C".
<<<Output>>>
C

[INST]
Consider the following code:
<Code>
A, B, C = map(int, input().split())
if max(A, B, C) == A :
    print("A")
elif max(A, B, C) == B :
    print("B")
else :
    print("C")

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1000 900 850
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
