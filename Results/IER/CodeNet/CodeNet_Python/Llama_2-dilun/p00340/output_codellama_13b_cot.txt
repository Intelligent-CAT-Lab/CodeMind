The input is 1 1 3 4.
The code first converts the input to a list of integers.
The list is then sorted in ascending order.
The code then checks if the first, second and third elements are equal.
If they are, it checks if the fourth element is equal to the third element.
If all these conditions are met, it prints "yes".
If any of these conditions are not met, it prints "no".
<<<Output>>>
no

Consider the following code:
<Code>
num = list(map(int,input().split()))
num.sort()
if num[0] == num[1] and num[2] ==num[3]:
    print("yes")
else :
    print("no")

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 1 3 4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
