The input is 0 0 1 1.
The code first converts the input to float values.
Then it calculates the square root of the sum of squares of the differences of the x and y coordinates.
The output is 1.4142135623730951.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import math
x1, y1, x2, y2 = map(lambda x: float(x), input().split(" "))
print("{:f}".format(math.sqrt((x1 - x2) ** 2 + (y1 - y2) ** 2)))

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```0 0 1 1
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
