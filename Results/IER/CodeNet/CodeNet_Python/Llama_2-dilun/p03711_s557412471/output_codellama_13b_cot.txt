The variable a is initialized to the set {1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12}.
The variable b is initialized to the set {4, 6, 9, 11}.
The variable c is initialized to the set {2}.
The input is 1 3.
The code then checks if x is in a and y is in a.
Since x is in a and y is in a, the code prints 'Yes'.
<<<Output>>>
Yes

Consider the following code:
<Code>
a={1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12}
b={4, 6, 9, 11}
c={2}
x, y = map(int, input().split())
print('Yes' if (x in a and y in a) or (x in b and y in b) or (x in c and y in c) else 'No')
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
