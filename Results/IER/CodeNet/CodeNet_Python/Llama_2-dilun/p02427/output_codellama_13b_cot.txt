The variable n is initialized to 4.
The function subset(n) is called, which returns a list of all subsets of size n.
The function run() is called, which iterates through all subsets of size 4 and prints them out.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# Bitset 2 - Enumeration of Subsets 2


def subset(n):
    for i in range(2**n):
        yield [v for v in range(n) if i & (1 << v) > 0]


def run():
    n = int(input())

    for i, vs in enumerate(subset(n)):
        print("{}:{}".format(i, "".join([" {}".format(v) for v in vs])))


if __name__ == '__main__':
    run()

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
