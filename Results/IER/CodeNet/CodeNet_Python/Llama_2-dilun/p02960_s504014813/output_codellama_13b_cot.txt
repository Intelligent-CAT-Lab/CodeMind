The variable S is initialized to???2??5.
The variable N is initialized to the length of S, which is 6.
The variable mod is initialized to 10^9 + 7.

The variable p is initialized to 1.

The variable dp is initialized to a list of lists. Each inner list has 13 elements.
The first element of dp is initialized to 0.

The for loop iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 6.
For each number i in this range, if the character at position i-1 is '?', the code will iterate through all possible values of k from 0 to 9.
For each value of k, the code will calculate the value of a, which is (k * p) % 13.
Then, for each value of j from 0 to 12, the code will calculate the value of dp[i][j], which is the sum of dp[i-1][j-a] % mod.
The value of dp[i][j] is then calculated by multiplying it by 10 and then taking the modulo of the result with mod.

If the character at position i-1 is not '?', the code will calculate the value of a, which is (int(S[-i]) * p) % 13.
Then, for each value of j from 0 to 12, the code will calculate the value of dp[i][j], which is the sum of dp[i-1][j-a] % mod.
The value of dp[i][j] is then calculated by multiplying it by 10 and then taking the modulo of the result with mod.

The value of p is then calculated by multiplying it by 10 and then taking the modulo of the result with 13.
