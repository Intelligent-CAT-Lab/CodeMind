The variable a and variable b are initialized to 1 and 3, respectively.
The code then calls the math.ceil() function, which rounds a number up to the nearest integer.
The function takes two arguments, a and b, and returns the ceiling of (a+b)/2.
In this case, the ceiling of (1+3)/2 is 2, so the output is 2.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import math
a,b=map(int,input().split())
print(math.ceil((a+b)/2))
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
