The code imports the following modules:
- sys
- numpy
- math
- fractions
- itertools
- collections
- deque
- Counter
- heapq
- fractions
- bisect

The code then initializes the variable n to 575.
The code then checks if n is divisible by 100 and 10. If it is, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
