The variable n and variable m are initialized to 2 and 0, respectively.
The code then enters a loop that iterates m times, which is 0 times in this case.
The code then prints the value of n-m-1, which is 1.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
n,m=map(int,input().split())
for _ in [0]*m:input()
print(n-m-1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 0
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
