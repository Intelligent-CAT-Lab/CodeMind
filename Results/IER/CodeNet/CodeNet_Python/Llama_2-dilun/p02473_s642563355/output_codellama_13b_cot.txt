The variable a is initialized to the string "5 8".
The code then splits the string into two elements, a[0] and a[1], which are "5" and "8", respectively.
The code then prints the difference between the two elements, which is 3.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
a=raw_input().split()
print(int(a[0])-int(a[1]))

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 8
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
