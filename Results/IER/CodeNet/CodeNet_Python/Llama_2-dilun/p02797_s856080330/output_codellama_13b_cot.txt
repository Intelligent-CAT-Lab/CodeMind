The variable N, variable K and variable S are initialized to 4, 2 and 3, respectively.
The code checks if S is 10^9. If it is, it prints the list [S] * K + [1] * (N - K) which is [3] * 2 + [1] * 2.
If S is not 10^9, it prints the list [S] * K + [10^9] * (N - K) which is [3] * 2 + [10^9] * 2.

    Consider the following code:

#!/usr/bin/env python3
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

import array
from bisect import *
from collections import *
import fractions
import heapq
from itertools import *
import math
import random

N, K, S = map(int, input().split())

if S == 10**9:
    ans = [S] * K + [1] * (N - K)
else:
    ans = [S] * K + [10**9] * (N - K)
print(*ans)

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4 2 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
