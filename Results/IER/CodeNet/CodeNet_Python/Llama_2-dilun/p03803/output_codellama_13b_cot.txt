The variable a and variable b are initialized to 8 and 6, respectively.
The variable j is initialized to a list of integers from 2 to 13, inclusive.
The code then checks if the index of a in the list j is greater than the index of b in the list j. If it is, it prints "Alice".
If the index of a in the list j is less than the index of b in the list j, it prints "Bob".
If the index of a in the list j is equal to the index of b in the list j, it prints "Draw".

In this case, the index of a in the list j is 10, which is greater than the index of b in the list j, which is 8. Therefore, the code prints "Alice".
<<<Output>>>
Alice

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
j = [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,1]
if j.index(a) > j.index(b):
  print('Alice')
elif j.index(a) < j.index(b):
  print('Bob')
else:
  print('Draw')

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```8 6
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
