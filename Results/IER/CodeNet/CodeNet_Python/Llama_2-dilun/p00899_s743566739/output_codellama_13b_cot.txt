The code starts with a while loop that will run forever.
The code will ask for a number n, which is 3 in this case.
The code then asks for n numbers, which are 1, 2 and 3 in this case.
The code then calculates the sum of the lengths of the numbers, which is 6.
The code then calculates the sum of the lengths of the numbers that are not equal to the previous number, which is 3.
The code then calculates the sum of the lengths of the numbers that are not equal to the previous number and are not equal to the previous two numbers, which is 2.
The code then calculates the sum of the lengths of the numbers that are not equal to the previous number and are not equal to the previous two numbers and are not equal to the previous three numbers, which is 1.
The code then calculates the sum of the lengths of the numbers that are not equal to the previous number and are not equal to the previous two numbers and are not equal to the previous three numbers and are not equal to the previous four numbers, which is 0.
