The variable a and variable b are initialized to 2 and 2, respectively.
The code then prints the value of (a-1)*(b-1), which is 0.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b = map(int,input().split())
print((a-1)*(b-1))
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
