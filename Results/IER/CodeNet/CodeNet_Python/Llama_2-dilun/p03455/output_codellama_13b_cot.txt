The variable a and variable b are initialized to 3 and 4, respectively.
The variable c is initialized to 3 * 4 = 12.
The code checks if c is odd or even.
Since c is odd, the code prints 'Odd'.
<<<Output>>>
Odd

Consider the following code:
<Code>
a, b = map(int, input().split())
c = a * b
if c % 2 == 1:
    print('Odd')
else:
    print('Even')
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
