The variable X and variable Y are initialized to 3 and 20, respectively.
The variable count is initialized to 1.
The code enters a while loop that will continue until X is greater than Y.
In each iteration, the code multiplies X by 2.
The code then checks if X is greater than Y. If it is, the loop breaks and the code prints the value of count, which is 1.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
X,Y=map(int,input().split())
count=1
while True:
    X*=2
    if X>Y: break
    else: count+=1
print(count)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 20
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
