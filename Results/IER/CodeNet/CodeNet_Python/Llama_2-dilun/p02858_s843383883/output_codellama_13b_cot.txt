The variable H, W and T are initialized to 2, 2 and 1, respectively.
The function gcd(x, y) calculates the greatest common divisor of x and y.
The variables gh and gw are initialized to the gcd of H and T, and W and T, respectively.
The variables h and w are initialized to the quotient of H and gh, and W and gw, respectively.
The variable MOD is initialized to 1000000007.
The function pow(x, y, z) calculates the value of x raised to the power y modulo z.
The code calculates the value of pow(2, h, MOD) + pow(2, w, MOD) + pow(2, gcd(h, w), MOD) - 3, which is 1.
The code then calculates the value of pow(1, gh * gw, MOD), which is 1.
The code prints the value of 1, which is the output.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def gcd(x, y):
	if y == 0:
		return x
	return gcd(y, x % y)
H,W,T=map(int, input().split())
gh, gw = gcd(H, T), gcd(W, T)
h, w = H // gh, W // gw
MOD = 1000000007
print(pow(pow(2, h, MOD) + pow(2, w, MOD) + pow(2, gcd(h, w), MOD) - 3, gh * gw, MOD))
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 2 1
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
