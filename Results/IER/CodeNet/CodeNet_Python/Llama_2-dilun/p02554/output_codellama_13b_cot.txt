The variable n is initialized to 2.
The variable ant is initialized to 1, the variable bnt is initialized to 1 and the variable cnt is initialized to 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates n times.
For each iteration, the variable ant is multiplied by 10 and then modulo 1000000007.
The variable bnt is multiplied by 9 and then modulo 1000000007.
The variable cnt is multiplied by 8 and then modulo 1000000007.
The variable ans is initialized to the value of ant minus the value of bnt multiplied by 2 minus the value of cnt.
The value of ans is then modulo 1000000007.
If the value of ans is greater than or equal to 0, the code prints the value of ans.
Otherwise, the code prints the value of 1000000007 plus the value of ans.
In this case, the value of ans is 1, which is greater than or equal to 0.
Therefore, the code prints 1.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
n=int(input())
ant,bnt,cnt=1,1,1

for i in range(n) :
    ant=10*ant%1000000007
    bnt=9*bnt%1000000007
    cnt=8*cnt%1000000007

ans=(ant-(bnt*2-cnt))%1000000007

if ans>=0 :
    print(ans)
else :
    print(1000000007+ans) 
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
