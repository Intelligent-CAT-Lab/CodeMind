The variable n is initialized to 5.
The variable k is initialized to 1.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 5.
For each number j in this range, the variable k is multiplied by j.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of k, which is 120.
<<<Output>>>
120

Consider the following code:
<Code>
n = int(input())
k = 1
for j in range(1,n+1):
    k *= j
print(k)

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
