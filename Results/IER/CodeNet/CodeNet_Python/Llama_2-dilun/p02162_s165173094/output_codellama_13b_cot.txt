The variables a, b, c and d are initialized to 9, 8, 1000 and 999, respectively.
The code then checks if c or d is -1. If it is, it checks if a is less than b. If it is, it prints "Alice". If it is not, it prints "Bob". If neither of the conditions is met, it prints "Draw".
If c and d are not -1, the code checks if c is greater than d. If it is, it prints "Alice". If it is not, it checks if c is less than d. If it is, it prints "Bob". If it is not, it checks if c is equal to d. If it is, it prints "Draw".

The output is "Alice".

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b,c,d = map(int,input().split())
def A_win():
    print("Alice")
def B_win():
    print("Bob")
def Draw():
    print("Draw")
if c == -1 or d == -1:
    if a < b:
        A_win()
    elif a > b:
        B_win()
    else:
        Draw()
elif c > d:
    A_win()
elif c < d:
    B_win()
elif c == d:
    Draw()

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```9 8 1000 999
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
