The variable N, variable K are initialized to 2 and 3, respectively.
The code checks if K is less than N. If it is, it prints 0. Otherwise, it sets ans to 1.
The code then iterates from K to K-N, decreasing by 1 each time. For each value of v, it multiplies ans by v and calculates the remainder of the result modulo MOD.
The code prints the final value of ans.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, K = map(int, input().split())
MOD = 10**9 + 7

if K < N:
    print(0)
else:
    ans = 1
    for v in range(K, K-N, -1):
        ans = ans * v % MOD
    print(ans)

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
