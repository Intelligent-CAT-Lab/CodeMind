The variable N, variable A, variable B and variable C are initialized to 6, 3, 2 and 1, respectively.
The code then prints the value of N-A-B+C, which is 6-3-2+1 = 2.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
N,A,B,C=map(int,input().split())
print(N-A-B+C)


<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```6 3 2 1
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
