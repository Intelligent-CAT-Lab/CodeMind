The variable a and variable b are initialized to 3 and 1, respectively.
The code then prints the maximum of a+b, a-b and a*b.
a+b = 4
a-b = 2
a*b = 3
The maximum of these three numbers is 4.
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
a, b = map(int, input().split())
print(max(a+b, a-b, a*b))
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 1
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
