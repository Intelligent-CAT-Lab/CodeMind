The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 10, 3 and 5, respectively.
The code then prints the minimum of A and B, which is 3.
The code then prints the maximum of A+B-N, which is 0.
<<<Output>>>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
N,A,B = map(int,input().split())
print(min(A,B),max(A+B-N,0))
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10 3 5
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
