The variable a and variable b are initialized to 3 and 5, respectively.
The code prints the product of a and b, which is 15.
The code then prints 2 times the sum of a and b, which is 10.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b = map(int, input().split())
print(a*b, 2*(a+b))

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 5
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
