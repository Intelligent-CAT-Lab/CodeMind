The variable a and variable b are initialized to 5 and 3, respectively.
The variable res is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then calculates the maximum of a and b, which is 5 in this case.
The code then calculates the minimum of a and b, which is 3 in this case.
The code then adds the maximum of a and b to res, which is 5 in this case.
The code then calculates the maximum of a and b, which is 3 in this case.
The code then adds the maximum of a and b to res, which is 3 in this case.
The code then prints the final value of res, which is 8.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b = map(int,input().split())
#s = input()
res = 0
res += max(a,b)
a,b = max(a,b)-1,min(a,b)
res += max(a,b)
print(res)

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
