The variable m, rd, rr, cd, cr are initialized to 1000000000, 1000000000, 1000000000, 1000000000, 1000000000, respectively.
The function f takes three parameters a, b and c and returns a*b<100*c.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to m (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 1000000000.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the product of i and rd, and checks if it is less than 100 times the product of i and cd. If it is, it adds 1 to i.
The code then enters another loop that iterates from 1 to m (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 1000000000.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the product of i and rr, and checks if it is less than 100 times the product of i and cr. If it is, it adds 1 to i.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of i, which is 1000000000.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(a,b,c):
    return a*b<100*c
m,rd,rr,cd,cr=map(int,input().split())
ex=cd*100//rd
if(f(ex,rd,cd)):ex+=1
ey=cr*100//rr
if(f(ey,rr,cr)):ey+=1
print(m-ex-ey if m-ex-ey>=0 else -1)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```M r
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
