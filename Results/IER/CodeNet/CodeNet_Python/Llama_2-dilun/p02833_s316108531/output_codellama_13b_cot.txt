The variable n is initialized to 12.
The code checks if n is odd. If it is, it prints 0. Otherwise, it initializes the variable i to 1 and the variable cnt to 0.
The variable n1 is initialized to n.
The code then enters a loop that iterates while n1 is not 0.
In each iteration, it calculates the value of n1 by dividing n1 by 2^i, where i is the current value of i.
The code then increments i and adds n1 to cnt.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the value of cnt, which is 12.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
n=int(input())

if n%2==1:
    print(0)
else:
    i = 1
    cnt = 0
    n1 = n
    while n1!= 0:
        n1 = n
        n1 = n1//(2*(5**i))
        cnt += n1
        i += 1
    print(cnt)

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```12
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
