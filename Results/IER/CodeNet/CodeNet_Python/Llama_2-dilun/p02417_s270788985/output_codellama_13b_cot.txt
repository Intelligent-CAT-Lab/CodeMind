The code first reads the input from stdin, which is "This is a pen.".
It then iterates over each character in the input.
For each character, it checks if it is a lowercase letter. If it is, it increments the count of that letter.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the count of each letter.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
from sys import stdin

cnt = {}
for line in stdin:
    for c in line:
        d = chr(ord(c)|0x20)
        if 'a'<=d<='z':
            cnt[d] = cnt.get(d, 0) + 1

for i in range(ord('z')-ord('a')+1):
    c = chr(ord('a')+i)
    print(c, ':', cnt.get(c, 0))

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```This is a pen.
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
