The variable input() is used to read a number from the user.
The variable input() is then converted to an integer using the int() function.
The variable input() is then multiplied by 6.28, which is the value of pi.
The output of the code is the product of the input and pi, which is 6.28.
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
print(int(input())*6.28)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
