The variable s is initialized to "aba".
The variable n is initialized to the length of s, which is 3.
The code checks if the first and last characters of s are the same.
If they are, it adds 1 to n.
The code then prints "First" if n is even and "Second" if n is odd.
In this case, n is even, so the code prints "First".
<<<Output>>>
First

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
s = input()
n = len(s)
if s[0] == s[-1]:
  n += 1
  
print("First" if n % 2 else "Second")
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```aba
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
