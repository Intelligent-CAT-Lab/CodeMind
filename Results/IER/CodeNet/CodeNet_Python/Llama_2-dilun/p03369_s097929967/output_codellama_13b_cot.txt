The variable s is initialized to "oxo".
The variable p is initialized to 700.
The code iterates through the string s, character by character.
When the character c is 'o', the value of p is increased by 100.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the value of p, which is 800.
<<<Output>>>
800

Consider the following code:
<Code>
s = input()
p = 700
for c in s:
    if c == 'o':
        p += 100

print(p)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```oxo
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
