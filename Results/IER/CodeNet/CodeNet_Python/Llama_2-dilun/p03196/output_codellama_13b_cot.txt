The variable n and variable p are initialized to 3 and 24, respectively.
The function factorization(n) is called, which calculates the prime factorization of n.
The function returns a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the prime factor and the number of times it appears in the factorization.
The list is then stored in the variable l.
The variable ans is initialized to 1.
The variable i is initialized to 0.
The variable i is iterated from 0 to len(l)-1.
If the number of times the prime factor appears in the factorization is greater than or equal to n, then the variable ans is multiplied by the prime factor raised to the power of the number of times it appears in the factorization.
The variable i is incremented by 1.
The code prints the value of ans.

n,p=map(int,input().split())

def factorization(n):
    arr = []

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 24
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
