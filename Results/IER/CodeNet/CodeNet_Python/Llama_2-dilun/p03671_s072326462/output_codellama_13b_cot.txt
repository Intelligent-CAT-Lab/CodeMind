The input is 700 600 780.
The code first converts the input to a list of integers.
The list is then sorted in ascending order.
The code then prints the sum of the first and second elements of the list, which is 700+600=1300.
<<<Output>>>
1300

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import sys
input = sys.stdin.readline

a=list(map(int,input().split()))
a.sort()
print(a[0]+a[1])

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```700 600 780
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
