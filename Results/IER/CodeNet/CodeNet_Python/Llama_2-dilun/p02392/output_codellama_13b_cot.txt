The variables a, b and c are initialized to 1, 3 and 8, respectively.
The code checks if a is less than b and b is less than c.
If this condition is met, the code prints "Yes".
If this condition is not met, the code prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No

Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b,c = map(int,input().split())
if a<b<c:
    print("Yes")
else:
    print("No")


<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 3 8
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
