The variable x is initialized to 7.
The variable N is initialized to 2*(7//11), which is 2*6, which is 12.
The code checks if x is divisible by 11. If it is, it does nothing.
If x is not divisible by 11, it checks if x is less than or equal to 6. If it is, it adds 1 to N.
If x is not less than or equal to 6, it adds 2 to N.
The code prints the final value of N, which is 12.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
x = int(input())

N = 2*(x//11)

if x % 11 ==0:
    pass
elif x % 11 <= 6:
    N += 1
else:
    N += 2
    
print(N)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
