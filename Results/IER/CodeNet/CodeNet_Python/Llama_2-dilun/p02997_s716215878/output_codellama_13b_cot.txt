The variable N and variable K are initialized to 5 and 3, respectively.
The variable x is calculated as (N-1)*(N-2)//2, which is 10 in this case.
The code checks if x is less than K, which is 3 in this case. If it is, it prints -1 and exits.

The variable edge is initialized to a list of tuples. The first tuple is (1,n) for n in range(2,N+1).
The second tuple is (2,n) for n in range(2,N+1).
The third tuple is (3,n) for n in range(2,N+1).
The fourth tuple is (4,n) for n in range(2,N+1).
The fifth tuple is (5,n) for n in range(2,N+1).
The sixth tuple is (1,2).
The seventh tuple is (1,3).
The eighth tuple is (1,4).
The ninth tuple is (1,5).
The tenth tuple is (2,3).
The eleventh tuple is (2,4).
The twelfth tuple is (2,5).
The thirteenth tuple is (3,4).
The fourteenth tuple is (3,5).
The fifteenth tuple is (4,5).
The code calculates the length of the list edge, which is 15 in this case.
The code then prints the length of the list edge, which is 15 in this case.
The code then prints the first 15 tuples in the list edge, which are (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5).

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, K = map(int, input().split())
x = (N-1)*(N-2)//2
if x < K:
    print(-1)
    exit()

edge = [(1,n) for n in range(2,N+1)]
edge += list(itertools.combinations(range(2,N+1),2))[:x-K]

print(len(edge))
for x,y in edge:
    print(x,y)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
