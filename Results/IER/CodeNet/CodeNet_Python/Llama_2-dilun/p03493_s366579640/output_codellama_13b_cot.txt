The variable s is initialized to the string "101".
The code then prints the length of the list of characters in s that are equal to "1".
The length of this list is 2, because there are two "1"s in the string.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
s = input()
print(len([ch for ch in s if ch == "1"]))
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```101
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
