The variable a, b and c are initialized to 10, 30 and 20, respectively.
The code then checks if a + b == c, which is false.
The code then checks if a + c == b, which is true.
The code then checks if b + c == a, which is false.
The code then prints "Yes" as the output.
<<<Output>>>
Yes

Consider the following code:
<Code>
a, b, c = map(int, input().split())

ans = "No"
if a + b == c:
  ans = "Yes"
if a + c == b:
  ans = "Yes"
if b + c == a:
  ans = "Yes"

print(ans)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10 30 20
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
