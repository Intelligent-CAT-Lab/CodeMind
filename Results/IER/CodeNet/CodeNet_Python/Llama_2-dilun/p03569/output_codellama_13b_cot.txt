The variable S is initialized to the input string xabxa.
The variable i is initialized to 0, which will be used to iterate through the string.
The variable j is initialized to the length of the string minus 1, which is 3 in this case.
The variable c is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the number of x's in the string.
The code then enters a loop that iterates through the string.
In the loop, it checks if the current character at index i is equal to the character at index j. If it is, it increments i and decrements j.
If the characters are not equal, it checks if the character at index i is equal to 'x'. If it is, it increments i and increments c.
If the character at index j is equal to 'x', it decrements j and increments c.
If the characters are not equal and neither of them is 'x', it prints '-1' and exits the program.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of c, which is 2.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import sys
S = str(input())
i = 0
j = len(S) - 1
c = 0
while(True):
    if i >= j:
        break
    if (S[i] == S[j]):
        i += 1
        j -= 1
    else:
        if (S[i] == 'x'):
            i += 1
            c += 1
        elif (S[j] == 'x'):
            j -= 1
            c += 1
        else:
            print('-1')
            sys.exit()
print(c)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```xabxa
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
