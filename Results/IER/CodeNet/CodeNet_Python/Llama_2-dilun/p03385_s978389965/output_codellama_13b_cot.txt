The variable S is initialized to the string "bac".
The code then sorts the string and compares it with the sorted string ['a', 'b', 'c'].
If they are equal, the code prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No

Consider the following code:
<Code>
S = input().strip()
if sorted(S) == ['a', 'b', 'c']:
  print('Yes')
else:
  print('No')
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```bac
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
