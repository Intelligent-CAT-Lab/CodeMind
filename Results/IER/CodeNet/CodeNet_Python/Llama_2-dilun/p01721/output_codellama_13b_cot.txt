The variable w, h, v, t, x, y, p, q are initialized to 10, 10, 1, 10, 3, 3, 7, 7, respectively.
The function solve() is called.
The function solve() calculates the number of ways to place the points p and q on the line segment x = a and x = b, respectively, such that the distance between the points is at most 2h.
The function solve() iterates over all possible values of a and b.
For each value of a and b, the function solve() iterates over all possible values of k0 and k1.
For each value of k0 and k1, the function solve() calculates the number of ways to place the points p and q on the line segment x = a and x = b, respectively, such that the distance between the points is at most 2h.
The function solve() returns the sum of the number of ways to place the points p and q on the line segment x = a and x = b, respectively, such that the distance between the points is at most 2h for all possible values of a and b.
The function solve() returns the sum of the number of ways to place the points p and q on the line segment x = a and x = b, respectively, such that the distance between the points is at most 2h for all possible values of a and b.
