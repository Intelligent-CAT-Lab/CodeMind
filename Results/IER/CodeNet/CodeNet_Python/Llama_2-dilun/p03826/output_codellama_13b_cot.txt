The variables a, b, c and d are initialized to 3, 5, 2 and 7, respectively.
The code calculates the product of a and b, which is 15.
The code calculates the product of c and d, which is 14.
The code checks if 15 is greater than 14. If it is, it prints 15. Otherwise, it prints 14.
<<<Output>>>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b,c,d = map(int, input().split())
s = a*b
t = c*d
if s > t: print(s)
else: print(t)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 5 2 7
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
