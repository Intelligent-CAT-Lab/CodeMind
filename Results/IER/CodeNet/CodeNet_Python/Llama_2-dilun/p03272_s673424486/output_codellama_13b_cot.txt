The variable n and variable i are initialized to 4 and 2, respectively.
The code then prints the value of n - i + 1, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import sys


stdin = sys.stdin
def ns(): return stdin.readline().rstrip()
def ni(): return int(stdin.readline().rstrip())
def nm(): return map(int, stdin.readline().split())
def nl(): return list(map(int, stdin.readline().split()))


def main():
    n, i = nm()
    print(n - i + 1)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
