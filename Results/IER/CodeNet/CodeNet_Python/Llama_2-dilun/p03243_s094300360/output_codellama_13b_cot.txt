The variable n is initialized to 111.
The variable x is initialized to 111.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 8 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 8.
For each number i in this range, it checks if x is greater than or equal to n. If it is, it prints x and breaks out of the loop.
Otherwise, it adds 111 to x.
The condition is met when i is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8.
After the loop finishes, the code prints 111.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
n = int(input())
x = 111

for i in range(9):
    if x >= n:
        print(x)
        break
    else:
        x += 111

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```111
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
