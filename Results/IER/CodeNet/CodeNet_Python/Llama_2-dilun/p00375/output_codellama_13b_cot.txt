The variable x is initialized to 68.
The variable y is initialized to (68-30)/2, which is 18.
The variable y is then converted to an integer, which is 18.
The code prints the integer 18.
<<<Output>>>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
x = input()
x = int(x)
y = (x-30)/2
print(int(y))

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```68
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
