The variable a and variable b are initialized to 4 and 3, respectively.
The code then calculates the product of a and b, which is 12.
The code then calculates the product of b and a, which is 12.
The code then sorts the list containing the two strings and prints the first element of the list, which is "1212".
<<<Output>>>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
a, b = map(int, input().split())
s1 = str(a)*b
s2 = str(b)*a
print(sorted([s1,s2])[0])
</Code>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4 3
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
