The code first calls the function checkEqual, which is used to check if the input string is a palindrome.
The function checkEqual takes the input string S as an argument and returns the minimum number of operations needed to convert S to a palindrome.
The function checkEqual works by iterating through the input string S and calculating the minimum number of operations needed to convert each sub-string to a palindrome.
The function checkEqual returns the minimum number of operations needed to convert the entire input string S to a palindrome.
The function check12 takes the input string S as an argument and returns the minimum number of operations needed to convert S to a palindrome.
