The variable a, t and r are initialized to 180, 120 and 90, respectively.
The code then prints the result of the division of r by a multiplied by t, which is 1.5.
<<<Output>>>
1.5

Consider the following code:
<Code>
a, b, c = map(int, input().split())

print(a * b * c)

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10 20 30
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
