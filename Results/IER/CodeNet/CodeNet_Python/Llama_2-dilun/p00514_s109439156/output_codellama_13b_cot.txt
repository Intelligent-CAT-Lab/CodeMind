The variable n, m and r are initialized to 2, 0 and 3, respectively.
The variable r is decreased by m*n, which is 0.
The variable r is then checked to see if it is negative. If it is, the code prints 0.
Otherwise, the variable a is initialized to 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to r (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 3.
For each number i in this range, a is multiplied by i+n.
The code then enters another loop that iterates from 1 to r (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 3.
For each number i in this range, a is divided by i+1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of a, which is 12.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
n,m,r=map(int,input().split())
r-=m*n
if r<0:print(0)
else:
 a=1
 for i in range(r):a*=i+n
 for i in range(r):a//=i+1
 print(a)

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 0 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
