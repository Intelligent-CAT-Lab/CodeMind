The variable n, variable a and variable b are initialized to 7, 17 and 120, respectively.
The code then prints the minimum of a * n and b, which is 17.
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
print(min(a * n, b))
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```7 17 120
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
