The variable a, b and c are initialized to 4, 12 and 20, respectively.
The code checks if a, b and c are equal and if a is even. If they are, it prints -1.
Otherwise, it sets res to 0 and enters a while loop.
In the loop, it checks if a, b and c are odd. If they are, it breaks out of the loop.
Otherwise, it calculates the sum of a, b and c and divides it by 2.
It then sets a, b and c to the new values and increments res by 1.
After the loop finishes, it prints res, which is 1.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b,c = map(int, input().split())
if  a==b==c and a%2 ==0:
    print(-1)
else:
    res = 0
    while True:
        if a%2!= 0 or b%2!= 0 or c%2!= 0:
            break
        a, b, c = (b+c)//2, (a+c)//2, (a+b)//2
        res += 1
    print(res)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4 12 20
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
