The variable S is initialized to "MRL".
The variable A is initialized to an empty list.
The code then iterates through the characters in S, and for each character, it appends the character to the list A.
The code then iterates through the characters in A, and for each character, it prints it to the output.
The output is "MRL".

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
S = input()
A = []
for i in range(len(S)):
    A.append( chr ((ord(S[i])-65-3) % 26 + 65))

for i in A:
    print(i,end="")
print("")
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```MRL
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
