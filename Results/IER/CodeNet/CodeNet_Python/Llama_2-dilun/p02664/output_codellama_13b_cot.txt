The variable a is initialized to the input string "PD?D??P".
The variable a is converted to a list, which is a list of characters.
The code then iterates through the list a and checks if the character at index i is "?". If it is, it replaces it with "D".
The variable b is initialized to an empty string.
The code iterates through the list a again and appends each character to the variable b.
The final value of b is "PD?D??P".
<<<Output>>>
PD?D??P

Consider the following code:
<Code>
a=input()

a=list(a)

for i in range(len(a)):
	if a[i]=="?":
		a[i]="D"

b=""
for i in range(len(a)):
	b+=a[i]

print(b)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```PD?D??P
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
