The variable n, m and r are initialized to 2, 0 and 3, respectively.
The variable a is initialized to n + r - n * m - 1, which is 2 + 3 - 2 * 0 - 1, which is 2.
The variable b is initialized to r - n * m, which is 3 - 2 * 0, which is 1.
The variable s is initialized to 1.
The code checks if a < b or a < 0 or b < 0. If any of these conditions is met, s is set to 0. Otherwise, the code sets b to a - b.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from b to 1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 1.
For each number i in this range, the code calculates the product of a and i and divides it by (i + 1).
The code prints the final value of s, which is 1.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
n,m,r=map(int,input().split());
a=n+r-n*m-1;b=r-n*m;
s=1;
if a<b or a<0 or b<0:s=0;
else:
    if b>a-b:b=a-b;
    for i in range(b):s=s*(a-i)//(i+1);
print(s)

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 0 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
