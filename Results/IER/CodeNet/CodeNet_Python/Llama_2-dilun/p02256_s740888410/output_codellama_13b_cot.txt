The variable a and variable b are initialized to 54 and 20, respectively.
The function gcp(x, y) is called, which calculates the greatest common prime factor of x and y.
The function gcp(x, y) iterates while min(x, y)!= 0, meaning it will continue to iterate while x and y are not both 0.
If x is less than y, it will swap x and y.
It then calculates x % y, which is the remainder of x divided by y.
It returns the maximum of x and y.
The function gcp(x, y) is called again, which calculates the greatest common prime factor of 54 and 20.
The function gcp(x, y) iterates while min(x, y)!= 0, meaning it will continue to iterate while 54 and 20 are not both 0.
If x is less than y, it will swap x and y.
It then calculates x % y, which is the remainder of x divided by y.
It returns the maximum of x and y.
