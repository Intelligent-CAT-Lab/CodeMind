The variable a and variable b are initialized to 4 and 10, respectively.
The variable total is initialized to 1.
The variable ans is initialized to 0.

The code enters a while loop that iterates while total is less than b.
In each iteration, the variable ans is incremented by 1.
The variable total is incremented by a-1.

After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
a, b = map(int, input().split())
total = 1
ans = 0

while total < b:
    ans += 1
    total += a-1

print(ans)

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4 10
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
