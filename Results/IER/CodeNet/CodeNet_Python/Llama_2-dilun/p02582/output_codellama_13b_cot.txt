The code first reads the input from the standard input.
The input is "RRS".
The code then checks if the input is "RRR". If it is, it prints 3.
If it is not, it checks if the input is "RRS" or "SRR". If it is, it prints 2.
If it is not, it checks if the input has no "R". If it does, it prints 0.
If it does not, it prints 1.
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import sys


def solve():
    readline = sys.stdin.buffer.readline
    mod = 10 ** 9 + 7
    s = str(readline().rstrip().decode('utf-8'))
    if s == "RRR":
        print(3)
    elif s == "RRS" or s == "SRR":
        print(2)
    elif s.count("R") == 0:
        print(0)
    else:
        print(1)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    solve()

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```RRR
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
