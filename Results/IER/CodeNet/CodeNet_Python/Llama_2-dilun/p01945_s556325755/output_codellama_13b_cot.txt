The variable S is initialized to the input string.
The variable n is initialized to 0.
The variable ans is initialized to 0.

The code then enters a loop that iterates over the characters in S.
For each character i in S, the code checks if i is an opening parenthesis. If it is, it increments n by 1.
Otherwise, it checks if i is a closing parenthesis. If it is, it decrements n by 1.
If n is 0, the code prints ans and breaks out of the loop.

The code then prints the final value of ans, which is 0.

Consider the following code:
<Code>

S = input()
n = 0
ans = 0

for i in S:
    if i == "(":
        n += 1
    elif i == ")":
        n -= 1
    else:
        print (n)
        break

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```((*)())
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
