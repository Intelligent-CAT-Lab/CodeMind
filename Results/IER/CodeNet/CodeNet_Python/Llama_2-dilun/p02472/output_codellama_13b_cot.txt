The variable A and variable B are initialized to 5 and 8, respectively.
The code then prints the sum of A and B, which is 13.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
A,B=[int(i) for i in input().split(" ")]
print(A+B)


<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 8
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
