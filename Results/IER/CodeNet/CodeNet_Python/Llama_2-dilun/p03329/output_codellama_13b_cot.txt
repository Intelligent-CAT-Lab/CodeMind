The variable N is initialized to 127.
The variable six is initialized to [6**i for i in range(1,8)][::-1], which is [6, 36, 216, 1296, 7776, 46656].
The variable nine is initialized to [9**i for i in range(1,8)][::-1], which is [9, 81, 729, 6561].
The function DP(n) is called with n = 127.
The function DP(n) first checks if n < 6. Since n = 127, the condition is not met.
The function DP(n) then calculates the value of tmp = n. tmp = 127.
The function DP(n) then checks if sixx <= n. Since sixx = 6, the condition is not met.
The function DP(n) then calculates the value of count6 = 0. count6 = 0.
The function DP(n) then checks if n < 9. Since n = 127, the condition is not met.
The function DP(n) then checks if ninee <= n. Since ninee = 9, the condition is not met.
The function DP(n) then calculates the value of count9 = 0. count9 = 0.
The function DP(n) then calculates the value of n = tmp. n = 127.
The function DP(n) then checks if n < 6. Since n = 127, the condition is not met.
The function DP(n) then checks if sixx <= n. Since sixx = 6, the condition is not met.
The function DP(n) then calculates the value of count6 = 1. count6 = 1.
The function DP(n) then checks if n < 9. Since n = 127, the condition is not met.
The function DP(n) then checks if ninee <= n. Since ninee = 9, the condition is not met.
The function DP(n) then calculates the value of count9 = 1. count9 = 1.
The function DP(n) then calculates the value of n = tmp. n = 127.
The function DP(n) then checks if n < 6. Since n = 127, the condition is not met.
The function DP(n) then checks if sixx <= n. Since sixx = 6, the condition is not met.
The function DP(n) then calculates the value of count6 = 1 + DP(n). count6 = 2.
The function DP(n) then checks if n < 9. Since n = 127, the condition is not met.
The function DP(n) then checks if ninee <= n. Since ninee = 9, the condition is not met.
The function DP(n) then calculates the value of count9 = 1 + DP(n). count9 = 2.
The function DP(n) then calculates the value of n = tmp. n = 127.
The function DP(n) then checks if n < 6. Since n = 127, the condition is not met.
The function DP(n) then checks if sixx <= n. Since sixx = 6, the condition is not met.
The function DP(n) then calculates the value of count6 = 2 + DP(n). count6 = 4.
The function DP(n) then checks if n < 9. Since n = 127, the condition is not met.
The function DP(n) then checks if ninee <= n. Since ninee = 9, the condition is not met.
