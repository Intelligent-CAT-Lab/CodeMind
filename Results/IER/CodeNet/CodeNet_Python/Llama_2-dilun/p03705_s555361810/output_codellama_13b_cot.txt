The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 4, 4 and 6, respectively.
The code checks if N is 1. If it is, it checks if A is equal to B. If it is, it prints 1. Otherwise, it prints 0.
If N is not 1, it checks if A is greater than B. If it is, it prints 0. Otherwise, it checks if A is equal to B or N is 2. If it is, it prints 1. Otherwise, it prints (B-A) * (N-2) + 1.

In this case, N is not 1, A is not greater than B, A is not equal to B and N is not 2. Therefore, the code prints (6-4) * (4-2) + 1, which is 16.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
if N == 1:
  if A == B:
    print(1)
  else:
    print(0)
else:
  if A > B:
    print(0)
  elif A == B or N == 2:
    print(1)
  else:
    print((B-A) * (N-2) + 1)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4 4 6
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
