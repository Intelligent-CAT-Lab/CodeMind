The variable x is initialized to "oxoxoxoxoxoxox".
The variable a is initialized to 0.
The code iterates through the characters in x.
When the character is 'x', the variable a is incremented by 1.
The code prints the string "NO" if a is less than or equal to 7, and prints the string "YES" otherwise.
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
x=input()
a=0
for i in x:
  if i=='x':
    a+=1
print(["NO","YES"][a<=7])
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```oxoxoxoxoxoxox
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
