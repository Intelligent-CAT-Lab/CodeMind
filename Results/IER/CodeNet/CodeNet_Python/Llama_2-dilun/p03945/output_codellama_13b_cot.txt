<<<Analysis>>>
The code first converts the input to a string.
Then it uses lambda to create a function that takes the input string as an argument and returns the sum of the number of 'W' and 'B' in the string.
The code then calls the function with the input string.
The output is 3, which is the sum of the number of 'W' and 'B' in the input string.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
# coding: utf-8
print((lambda x:x.count('WB')+x.count('BW'))(input()))
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```BBBWW
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
