The variable n, variable a and variable b are initialized to 4, 2 and 9, respectively.
The code then calculates the product of n and a, which is 8.
The code then checks if the product is greater than b, which is 9 in this case.
If it is, the code prints b, which is 9.
If it is not, the code prints the product of n and a, which is 8.
<<<Output>>>
9

Consider the following code:
<Code>
n, a, b = map(int, input().split())

ans = b if n * a > b else n * a

print(ans)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4 2 9
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
