    Consider the following code:
<Code>
N,M=map(int,input().split())
print(((N-M)*100+M*1900)*2**M)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 1
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
