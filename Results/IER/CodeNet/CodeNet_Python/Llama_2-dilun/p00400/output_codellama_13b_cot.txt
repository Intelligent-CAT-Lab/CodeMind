The variable n is initialized to 67.
The code checks if n is between 65 and 90, which is true.
The code prints "1".

[INST]
Consider the following code:
<Code>
n=int(input())
if(n>=65 and n<=90):
    print("1")
elif(n>=97 and n<=122):
    print("2")
else:
    print("0")

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```67
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
