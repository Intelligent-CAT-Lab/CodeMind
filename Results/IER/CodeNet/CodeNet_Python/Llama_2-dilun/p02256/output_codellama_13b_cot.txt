The variable x and variable y are initialized to 54 and 20, respectively.
The code checks if x is greater than y. If it is, it swaps the values of x and y.
The code then enters a while loop that iterates until x is divisible by y.
In each iteration, it calculates the remainder of x divided by y and stores it in x.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the value of y, which is 2.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
x, y = map(int, input().split())
if x > y:
  x, y = y, x
while x % y!= 0:
  x, y = y, x % y
print(y)

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```54 20
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
