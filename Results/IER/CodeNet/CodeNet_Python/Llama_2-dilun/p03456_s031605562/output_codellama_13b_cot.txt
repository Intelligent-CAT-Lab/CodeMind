The variable a and variable b are initialized to 1 and 21, respectively.
The variable x is initialized to the sum of a and b, which is 22.
The function judge() is called.
The function judge() iterates from 1 to 10001 and checks if the square of each number is equal to x.
If it finds a number that satisfies the condition, it returns True.
If it does not find a number that satisfies the condition, it returns False.
If the function judge() returns True, it prints "Yes".
If the function judge() returns False, it prints "No".

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import sys

readline = sys.stdin.readline
MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7
INF = float('INF')
sys.setrecursionlimit(10 ** 5)


def main():
    a, b = input().split()
    x = int(a + b)

    def judge():
        for i in range(10001):
            if i ** 2 == x:

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 21
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
