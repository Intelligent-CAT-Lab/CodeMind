The variable n is initialized to 3.
The code calculates the value of s as 180 * (n - 2), which is 180 * (3 - 2), which is 180 * 1, which is 180.
The code prints the value of s, which is 180.
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
n = int(input())
s = 180 * (n - 2)
print(s)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
