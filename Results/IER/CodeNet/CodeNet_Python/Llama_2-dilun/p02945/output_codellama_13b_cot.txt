The variable a and variable b are initialized to -13 and 3, respectively.
The code then prints the maximum of a-b, a+b and a*b.
The maximum of a-b, a+b and a*b is a-b, because a-b is 10, a+b is 16 and a*b is 39.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
a, b=map(int, input().split())
print(max(a-b, a+b, a*b))

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```-13 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
