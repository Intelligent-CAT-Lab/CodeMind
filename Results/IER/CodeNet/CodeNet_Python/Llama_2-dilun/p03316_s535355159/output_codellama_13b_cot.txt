The variable n is initialized to 12.
The variable s_n is initialized to the sum of the digits of n.
The code checks if n is divisible by s_n.
If it is, it prints "Yes".
If it is not, it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No

Consider the following code:
<Code>
n = int(input())

s_n = sum([int(i) for i in list(str(n))])

if n % s_n == 0:
    print("Yes")
else:
    print("No")

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```12
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
