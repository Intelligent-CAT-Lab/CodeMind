The variable A and variable B are initialized to 30 and 100, respectively.
The code checks if A is less than or equal to 5. If it is, it prints 0.
Otherwise, it checks if 6 <= A and A <= 12. If it is, it prints the floor of B divided by 2.
Otherwise, it prints B.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import math
A, B = map(int, input().split())
if A <= 5:
    print(0)
elif 6 <= A and A <= 12:
    print(math.floor(B/2))
else:
    print(B)

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```30 100
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
