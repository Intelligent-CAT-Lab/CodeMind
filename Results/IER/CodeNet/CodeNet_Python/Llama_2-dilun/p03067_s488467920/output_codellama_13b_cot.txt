The variable A, B and C are initialized to 3, 8 and 5, respectively.
The code checks if A is less than C and C is greater than B or A is greater than C and C is less than B.
In this case, A is less than C and C is greater than B, so the code prints 'Yes'.
<<<Output>>>
Yes

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
A,B,C = map(int,input().split())
if A < C < B or A > C > B:
    print('Yes')
else:
    print('No')
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 8 5
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
