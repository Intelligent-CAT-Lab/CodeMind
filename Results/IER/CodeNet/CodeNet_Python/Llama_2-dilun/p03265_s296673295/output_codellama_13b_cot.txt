The code first initializes x1, y1, x2, y2 to 0, 0, 0, 1, respectively.
Then it calculates the length of the vector from a to b, which is 1.
Then it calculates the vector c, which is (0, 1) * (1, 0) + (0, 1) = (1, 0).
Then it calculates the vector d, which is (1, 0) * (0, 1) + (0, 1) = (0, 1).
Finally, it prints the output, which is (1, 0) and (0, 1).

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import numpy as np
x1, y1, x2, y2 = map(int, input().rstrip().split())
a = complex(x1, y1)
b = complex(x2, y2)
length = abs(a-b)
c = (a-b) * complex(np.cos(-np.pi/2), np.sin(-np.pi/2)) + b
x3 = int(np.round(c.real))
y3 = int(np.round(c.imag))
d = (b-a) * complex(np.cos(np.pi/2), np.sin(np.pi/2)) + a
x4 = int(np.round(d.real))
y4 = int(np.round(d.imag))
print(x3, y3, x4, y4)

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```0 0 0 1
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
