The variable C is initialized to a.
The function alpha2num is called on C, which returns the ASCII value of the character C.
The variable a is initialized to the ASCII value of C.
If a is equal to 26, which is the ASCII value of the letter Z, a is set to 0.
The function num2alpha is called on a, which returns the character corresponding to the ASCII value of a.
The character is printed.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())

for i in range(N):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    if a > b:
        print(a)
    else:
        print(b)

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3
1 2
2 1
3 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The variable N is initialized to 3.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 3.
For each number i in this range, it reads two numbers a and b from the input.
If a is greater than b, it prints a. Otherwise, it prints b.
The code prints 2, 1 and 2.
