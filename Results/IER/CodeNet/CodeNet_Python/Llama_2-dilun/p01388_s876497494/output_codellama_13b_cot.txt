The code first reads the input from the standard input.
The input is then split into a list of strings.
The code then iterates over the list and counts the number of occurrences of each character.
The code then prints the minimum of the four numbers.
The minimum is 1, which is the number of occurrences of the character K.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import sys

def solve():
    L = raw_input()
    data = []
    data.append(L.count("K"))
    data.append(L.count("U"))
    data.append(L.count("P"))
    data.append(L.count("C"))

    print min(data)
    
                            
if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve()
   
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```KUPCkupcKUPC
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
