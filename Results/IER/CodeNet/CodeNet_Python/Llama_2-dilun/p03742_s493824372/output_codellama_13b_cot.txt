The variable X and variable Y are initialized to 2 and 1, respectively.
The code checks if the absolute value of the difference between X and Y is greater than or equal to 2.
If it is, it prints "Alice".
If it is not, it prints "Brown".
<<<Output>>>
Brown

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
X,Y = map(int,input().split())

if abs(X-Y) >= 2:
  print('Alice')
else:
  print('Brown')
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 1
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
