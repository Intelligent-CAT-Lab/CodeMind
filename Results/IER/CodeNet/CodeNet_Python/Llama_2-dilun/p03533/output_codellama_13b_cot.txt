The variable S is initialized to "KIHBR".
The variable pattern is initialized to "^A?KIHA?BA?RA?$".
The variable S is then passed to the re.match() function.
The re.match() function checks if the string S matches the pattern.
If it does, it prints "YES".
If it does not, it prints "NO".
<<<Output>>>
YES

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import re
pattern = r"^A?KIHA?BA?RA?$"
S = input()
if re.match(pattern,S):
    print("YES")
else:
    print("NO")
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```KIHBR
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
