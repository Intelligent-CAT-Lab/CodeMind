The variable N and variable M are initialized to 2 and 998244353, respectively.
The variable DP is initialized to a list of lists, where each inner list is initialized to a list of -1s.
The variable P is initialized to a function that takes two integers n and k as input and returns the value of the kth digit of the nth number in the sequence.
The function P is defined as follows:
if n<0 or k<1:
    return 0
if DP[n][k]!=-1:
    return DP[n][k]
if k==1:
    DP[n][k]=1
    return 1
DP[n][k]=(P(n,k-1)+P(n-k,k))%M
return DP[n][k]

The variable X is initialized to a list of 0s, and the variable DP is initialized to a list of lists, where each inner list is initialized to a list of 0s.
The variable Y is initialized to a list of 0s.

The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 2.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in X.
