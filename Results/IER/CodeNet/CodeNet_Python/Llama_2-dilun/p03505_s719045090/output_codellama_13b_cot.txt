The variable K, variable A and variable B are initialized to 4000, 2000 and 500, respectively.
The code checks if A is greater than or equal to K. Since A is 2000 and K is 4000, the condition is not met.
The code then calculates the difference between A and B, which is 1500.
The code checks if the difference is less than or equal to 0. Since 1500 is greater than 0, the condition is not met.
The code then calculates the ceiling of K minus A divided by A minus B. The ceiling of 4000 minus 2000 divided by 2000 minus 500 is 1.
The code then adds 2 to the ceiling, which is 3.
The code then prints the final value of 3.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>

def f(x):
    return x * x

def g(x):
    return x * x * x

def h(x):
    return x * x * x * x

def main():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        print(f(i), g(i), h(i))

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The variable n is initialized to 10.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 10.
For each number i in this range, it prints the output of f(i), g(i) and h(i).
The output of f(i) is i * i, which is 1 * 1 = 1.
The output of g(i) is i * i * i, which is 1 * 1 * 1 = 1.
The output of h(i) is i * i * i * i, which is 1 * 1 * 1 * 1 = 1.
