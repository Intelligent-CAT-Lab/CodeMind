The input is 5 7 5.
The code splits the input into three strings a, b and c.
The code then checks if a == b. Since a == 5 and b == 7, the condition is met and the code prints c, which is 5.
The code then checks if a == c. Since a == 5 and c == 5, the condition is met and the code prints b, which is 7.
The code then checks if a == c. Since a == 5 and c == 5, the condition is met and the code prints a, which is 5.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
a, b, c = input().split()

if a == b:
    print(c)
elif a == c:
    print(b)
else:
    print(a)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 7 5
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
