The input is a list of 12 integers.
The list is sorted and the first, fourth and eighth elements are compared.
If they are equal, the code prints "yes".
If they are not equal, the code prints "no".
<<<Output>>>
no

Consider the following code:
<Code>
lst = sorted(map(int, input().split()))
if lst[0] == lst[3] and lst[4] == lst[7] and lst[8] == lst[11]:
  print("yes")
else:
  print("no")

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 1 3 4 8 9 7 3 4 5 5 5
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
