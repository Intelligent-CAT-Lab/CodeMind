The variable a and variable b are initialized to 1 and 3, respectively.
The variable c is initialized to 3 times the value of a, which is 3.
The variable d is initialized to the sum of c and b, which is 3+3=6.
The variable e is initialized to the division of d by 2, which is 6//2=3.
The code then prints the value of e, which is 3.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b=map(int,input().split())
c=a*3
d=c+b
e=d//2
print(e)

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
