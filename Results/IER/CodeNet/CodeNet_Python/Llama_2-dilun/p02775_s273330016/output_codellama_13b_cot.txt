The input is 36.
The code converts the input to a list of integers.
The length of the list is 1, which is the length of the input.
The code initializes a 2-dimensional array dp to [[0,1] for _ in range(n+1)], where n is the length of the input.
The code iterates from 0 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 1.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the minimum of dp[i][0]+x[i] and dp[i][1]+10-x[i].
The code stores the minimum value in dp[i+1][0].
The code calculates the minimum of dp[i][0]+x[i]+1 and dp[i][1]+9-x[i].
The code stores the minimum value in dp[i+1][1].
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of dp[n][0], which is 10.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
x = list(map(int,list(input())))
n = len(x)
dp = [[0,1] for _ in range(n+1)]
for i in range(n):
    dp[i+1][0] = min(dp[i][0]+x[i],dp[i][1]+10-x[i])
    dp[i+1][1] = min(dp[i][0]+x[i]+1,dp[i][1]+9-x[i])
print(dp[n][0])

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```36
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
