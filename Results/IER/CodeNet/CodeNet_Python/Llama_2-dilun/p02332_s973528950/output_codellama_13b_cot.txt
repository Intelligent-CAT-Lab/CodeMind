The code first reads the input, which is 2 3.
The code then calculates the factorial of k, which is 3 in this case.
The code then calculates the factorial of k - n, which is 2 in this case.
The code then calculates the quotient of the two factorials, which is 1.
The code then calculates the remainder of the quotient, which is 1.
The code then prints the remainder, which is 1.

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
