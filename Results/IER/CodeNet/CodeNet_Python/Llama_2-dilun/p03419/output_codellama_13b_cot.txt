The variable n and variable m are initialized to 2 and 2, respectively.
The code checks if n or m is 1. If it is, it prints 1.
Otherwise, it prints the product of n and m minus 2.
The product of n and m is 4, so the output is 2.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
n, m = map(int, input().split())
if n == 1 or m == 1:
    print(1 if n * m == 1 else max(n, m) - 2)
else:
    print((n - 2) * (m - 2))

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
