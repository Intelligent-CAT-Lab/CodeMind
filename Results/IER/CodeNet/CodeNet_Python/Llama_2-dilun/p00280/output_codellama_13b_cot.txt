The code starts with a function dfs(game) that takes a string game as input.
The function dfs(game) iterates through all possible combinations of A and B.
The function dfs(game) checks if the current combination of A and B is a valid combination.
If it is, it adds the current combination to the set possible.
The function dfs(game) then checks if the current combination of A and B is a valid combination of A and B.
