The code first defines the functions getN(), getNM(), getList(), getArray() and input().
The function getN() returns the number of test cases, which is 1 in this case.
The function getNM() returns a list of 2 integers, which is [1, 1] in this case.
The function getList() returns a list of integers, which is [1] in this case.
The function getArray() returns a list of integers, which is [1] in this case.
The function input() returns the input string, which is "1 1" in this case.

The code then uses the input string to initialize the variables N and M to 1 and 1, respectively.
The code then calculates the total number of possible permutations of the input string, which is 1900.
The code then multiplies the total number of permutations by 2 to the power of the number of elements in the input string, which is 1 in this case.
The code then prints the result of the multiplication, which is 1900 * 2 ** 1 = 3800.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def getN():
    return int(input())
def getNM():
    return map(int, input().split())
def getList():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
def getArray(intn):
    return [int(input()) for i in range(intn)]
def input():
    return sys.stdin.readline().rstrip()

from collections import defaultdict, deque, Counter
from sys import exit
import heapq
import math
import fractions
import copy
from itertools import permutations
from operator import mul
from functools import reduce
from bisect import bisect_left, bisect_right

import sys
sys.setrecursionlimit(1000000000)
mod = 10 ** 9 + 7

from itertools import permutations
from math import factorial, hypot

N, M = getNM()
total = 1900 * M + 100 * (N - M)
print(total * (2 ** M))
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 1
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
