The variable s is initialized to the input string "akasaka".
The variable n is initialized to the length of s, which is 6.

The variable r_s is initialized to an empty string.
For each character c in the reversed string s, it is concatenated to r_s.

The variable top is initialized to an empty string.
For each character i in the range [0, 2], it is concatenated to top.

The variable r_top is initialized to an empty string.
For each character c in the reversed string top, it is concatenated to r_top.

The variable last is initialized to an empty string.
For each character i in the range [3, 5], it is concatenated to last.

The variable r_last is initialized to an empty string.
For each character c in the reversed string last, it is concatenated to r_last.

If r_last is not equal to last, the code prints "No" and exits.
If r_last is equal to last, the code prints "Yes".

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import sys

s = input().rstrip()
n = len(s)

r_s = ''
for c in reversed(s):
    r_s = r_s + c

if s!= r_s:
    print('No')
    sys.exit()

top = ''
for i in range(int((n - 1)/2)):
    top = top + s[i]

r_top = ''
for c in reversed(top):
    r_top = r_top + c

if top!= r_top:
    print('No')
    sys.exit()

last = ''
for i in range(int((n + 3)/2) - 1, n):
    last = last + s[i]

r_last = ''
for c in reversed(last):
    r_last = r_last + c

if r_last!= last:
    print('No')
    sys.exit()

print('Yes')
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```akasaka
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
