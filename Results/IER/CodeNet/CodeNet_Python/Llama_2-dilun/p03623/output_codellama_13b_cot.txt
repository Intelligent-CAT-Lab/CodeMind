The variable x, variable a and variable b are initialized to 5, 2 and 7, respectively.
The code then prints the string 'A' if the absolute value of x minus a is less than the absolute value of x minus b. Otherwise, it prints the string 'B'.
The absolute value of x minus a is 3, which is less than the absolute value of x minus b, which is 5. Therefore, the code prints the string 'A'.
<<<Output>>>
A

Consider the following code:
<Code>
x,a,b=map(int,input().split())
print('A' if abs(x-a)<abs(x-b) else 'B')
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 2 7
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
