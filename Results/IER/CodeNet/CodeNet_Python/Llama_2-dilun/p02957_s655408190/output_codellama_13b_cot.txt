The variable A and variable B are initialized to 2 and 16, respectively.
The code checks if the sum of A and B is even. If it is, it prints the value of A+B/2.
If it is not, it prints 'IMPOSSIBLE'.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
A,B=map(int,input().split())
if (A+B)%2==0:
	print(int((A+B)/2))
else:
	print('IMPOSSIBLE')
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 16
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
