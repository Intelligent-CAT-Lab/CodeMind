The variable N is initialized to 54.
The variable count is initialized to 1.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 54.
The variable count is multiplied by 2 at each iteration.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of count, which is 1048576.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())
count = 1
while count <= N:
    count *= 2
print(round(count/2))

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```54
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
