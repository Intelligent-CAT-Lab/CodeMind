The variable N and variable M are initialized to 4 and 1, respectively.
The code checks if N is even or odd. If N is even, it iterates from 1 to (M+1)/2+1, which is 2 in this case.
For each number i in this range, it prints the number i and the number N-i+1.
The code then iterates from M-(M+1)/2 to M, which is 0 in this case.
For each number i in this range, it prints the number M-i and the number M+i+2.
If N is odd, it iterates from 1 to M+1, which is 3 in this case.
For each number i in this range, it prints the number i and the number N-i.

The output is:
```1 3
2 2
```

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
N,M=map(int,input().split())
if N%2==0:
    for i in range(1,(M+1)//2+1):
        print(i,N-i+1)
    for i in range(M-(M+1)//2):
        print(M-i,M+i+2)
else:
    for i in range(1,M+1):
        print(i,N-i)
        
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4 1
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
