The variable S is initialized to the input string.
The variable dic is initialized to an empty dictionary.
For each character in the input string, if it is not in the dictionary, it is added to the dictionary with a value of 1.
Otherwise, the value of the character in the dictionary is incremented by 1.
The variable ans is initialized to 0.
For each character in the dictionary, if its value is odd, the value of ans is incremented by 1.
The final value of ans is printed.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
# AOJ 2816: Alphabet Block
# Python3 2018.7.11 bal4u

dic = {}
S = list(input())
for s in S:
	if s not in dic: dic[s] = 1
	else: dic[s] += 1
ans = 0
for k in list(dic.keys()):
	if dic[k] & 1: ans += 1
print(ans>>1)

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```hcpc
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
