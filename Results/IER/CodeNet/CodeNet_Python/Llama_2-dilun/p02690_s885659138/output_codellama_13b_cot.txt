The variable n is initialized to 33.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 100 to the 5th root of 33 (inclusive), which is 100.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the 5th root of the absolute value of n minus the 5th power of i, and stores it in c.
The code checks if c is equal to the 5th power of b, which is the 5th power of the absolute value of n minus the 5th power of a. If it is, it prints a and c, and exits the loop.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of a and c, which is 10 and 10.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
n=int(input())
for i in range(int(pow(n,1/5))+100):
	a=i
	b=-1*(n-pow(a,5))

	c=int(pow(abs(b),1/5))
	if b<0:
		c=-c
	if c*c*c*c*c==b:
		print(a,c)
		exit()
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```33
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
