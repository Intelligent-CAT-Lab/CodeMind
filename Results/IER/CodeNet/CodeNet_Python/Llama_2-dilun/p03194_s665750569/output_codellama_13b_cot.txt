The variable N, variable P are initialized to 3, 24, respectively.
The variable rt is initialized to the square root of P, which is 5.
The variable cnt is initialized to an empty dictionary.
The code then iterates from 2 to rt (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 2 to 5.
For each number i in this range, it checks if P is divisible by i. If it is, it increments the counter for i in the dictionary cnt.
The code then checks if P is not 1. If it is, it increments the counter for P in the dictionary cnt.
The code then calculates the product of all the counters in the dictionary cnt.
The final value of the product is 125.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import math


def main():
    N, P = map(int, input().split())
    rt = math.floor(math.sqrt(P))
    cnt = {}
    for i in range(2, rt+1):
        while P % i == 0:
            if i not in cnt:
                cnt[i] = 0
            cnt[i] += 1
            P //= i
    if P!= 1:
        cnt[P] = 1
    ans = 1
    for c in cnt:
        ans *= c**(cnt[c]//N)
    print(ans)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 24
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
