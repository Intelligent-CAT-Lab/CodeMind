The code first declares variables A, B, C, D, E and F.
Then it takes input N and M, which are 10 and 11, respectively.
The code then checks if N is greater than M. If it is, it prints ">" and terminates.
If N is equal to M, it prints "=" and terminates.
If N is less than M, it prints "<" and terminates.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, M = map(int, input().split())

for i in range(N):
    for j in range(M):
        print(i, j)
</Code>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 3```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The code first declares variables N and M.
Then it takes input N and M, which are 2 and 3, respectively.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to N-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 1.
For each number i in this range, it enters a nested loop that iterates from 0 to M-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 2.
For each number j in this range, it prints the value of i and j.
The code prints 0 0, 0 1, 0 2, 1 0, 1 1, 1 2 and 2 0.
