The variable N is initialized to 1118.
The variable a, b, c and d are initialized to the first, second, third and fourth characters of N, respectively.
The code checks if a, b and c are equal or b and c are equal to d.
If the condition is met, the code prints "Yes".
Otherwise, it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def main():
    N = input()

    a, b, c, d = list(N)
    if a == b == c or b == c == d:
        print("Yes")
    else:
        print("No")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1118
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
