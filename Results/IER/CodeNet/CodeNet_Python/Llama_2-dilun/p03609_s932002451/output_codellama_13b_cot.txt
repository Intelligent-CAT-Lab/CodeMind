The variable x and variable t are initialized to 100 and 17, respectively.
The code then prints the difference between x and t, which is 83.
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
x, t = map(int, input().split())
print((x - t) if x > t else 0)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```100 17
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
