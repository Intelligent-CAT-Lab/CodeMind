The variable A, B and X are initialized to 100, 100 and 2400, respectively.
The code then calculates the ceiling of X divided by 1000, which is 24, and multiplies it by A, which is 100.
The code then calculates the ceiling of X divided by 500, which is 4, and multiplies it by B, which is 100.
The code then calculates the floor of X divided by 1000, which is 240, and adds the ceiling of (X % 1000) divided by 500, which is 0, to it.
The code then prints the minimum of the three values, which is 240.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>

import math

A,B,X = [int(i) for i in input().split()]

ans1 = math.ceil(X/1000) * A
ans2 = math.ceil(X/500) * B
ans3 = math.floor(X/1000) * A + math.ceil((X % 1000)/500) * B

print(min(ans1,ans2,ans3))

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```180 100 2400
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
