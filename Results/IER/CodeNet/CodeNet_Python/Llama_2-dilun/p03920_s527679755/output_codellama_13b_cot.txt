The code first asks the user to input a number N.
Then it iterates from 1 to 10^4, which is 100000.
For each number i, it calculates the product of i and (i+1)/2.
If the product is greater than or equal to N, it stores the value of i in M.
Then it calculates the value of upper, which is the product of M and (M+1)/2.
It then calculates the difference between upper and N.
It then iterates from M to upper, which is 100000.
For each number j, it checks if j is not equal to the difference.
If it is, it appends j to a list called tar.
The code then prints the sum of the elements in tar, M, upper and difference.
If 1628 is in tar, it prints "True".

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
