The variable M and variable D are initialized to 15 and 40, respectively.
The function solve() is called.
The function solve() iterates from 12 to D (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 12 to 40.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the product of the first and second digits of i, and checks if the product is less than or equal to M.
If it is, it adds 1 to ans. The condition is met when i is 12, 13, 14, 15, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40.
After the loop finishes, the function solve() returns ans, which is 10.
