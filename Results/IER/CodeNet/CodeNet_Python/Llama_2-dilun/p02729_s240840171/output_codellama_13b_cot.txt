The variable N and variable M are initialized to 2 and 1, respectively.
The code checks if N is 0. If it is, it does not do anything.
Otherwise, it calculates the sum of N * (N -1) // 2.
The code checks if M is 0. If it is, it does not do anything.
Otherwise, it calculates the sum of M * (M -1) // 2.
The code prints the sum of the two values.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, M = map(int, input().split())

count = 0
if N!= 0:
    count += N * (N -1) // 2
if M!= 0:
    count += M * (M -1) // 2
print(count)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 1
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
