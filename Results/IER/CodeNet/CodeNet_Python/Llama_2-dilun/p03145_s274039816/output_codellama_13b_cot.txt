The variable a, b and c are initialized to 3, 4 and 5, respectively.
The code then prints the value of a*b//2, which is 10.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
print(a*b//2)

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 4 5
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
