The variable S is initialized to "RRS".
The variable cur_l is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the number of R's in the string.
The variable max_l is initialized to 0, which will be used to store the maximum number of R's in the string.
The code iterates through the string S, character by character.
When it encounters an R, it increments cur_l by 1.
When it encounters an R, it checks if cur_l is greater than max_l. If it is, it sets max_l to cur_l.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of max_l, which is 2.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>

def func(x):
    if x == 0:
        return 0
    else:
        return x + func(x - 1)

print(func(10))

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The function func takes an integer x as input and returns the sum of x and the result of func(x-1).
The function is called with x=10.
The function iterates through the input x, starting with x=10.
When x=10, the function returns 10+func(9), which is 10+10-1=19.
When x=9, the function returns 9+func(8), which is 9+9-1=17.
When x=8, the function returns 8+func(7), which is 8+8-1=15.
When x=7, the function returns 7+func(6), which is 7+7-1=12.
When x=6, the function returns 6+func(5), which is 6+6-1=11.
When x=5, the function returns 5+func(4), which is 5+5-1=9.
When x=4, the function returns 4+func(3), which is 4+4-1=7.
When x=3, the function returns 3+func(2), which is 3+3-1=5.
When x=2, the function returns 2+func(1), which is 2+2-1=3.
When x=1, the function returns 1+func(0), which is 1+0-1=0.
When x=0, the function returns 0+func(0), which is 0+0-1=0.
The function returns 19.
