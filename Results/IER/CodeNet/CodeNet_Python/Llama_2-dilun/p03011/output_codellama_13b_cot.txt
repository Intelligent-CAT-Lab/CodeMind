The variables a, b and c are initialized to 1, 3 and 4, respectively.
The code then prints the sum of a, b and c, which is 8.
The code then prints the difference between the sum and the maximum of a, b and c, which is 4.
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b,c=map(int,input().split())
print(a+b+c-max(a,b,c))
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 3 4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
