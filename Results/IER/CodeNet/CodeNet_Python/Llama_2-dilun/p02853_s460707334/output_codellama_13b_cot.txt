The variable x and variable y are initialized to 1 and 1, respectively.
The code then checks if x is equal to 1. If it is, it adds 300000 to result.
The code then checks if y is equal to 1. If it is, it adds 300000 to result.
The code then checks if x is equal to 1 and y is equal to 1. If it is, it adds 400000 to result.
The code then prints the final value of result, which is 400000.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

x, y = map(int, input().split())

result = 0

if x == 1:
    result += 300000
elif x == 2:
    result += 200000
elif x == 3:
    result += 100000

if y == 1:
    result += 300000
elif y == 2:
    result += 200000
elif y == 3:
    result += 100000
    
if x == 1 and y == 1:
    result += 400000
    
print(result)

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 1
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
