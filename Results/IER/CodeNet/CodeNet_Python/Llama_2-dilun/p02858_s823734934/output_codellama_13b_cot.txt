The variable MOD is initialized to 10^9 + 7, which is 1000000007.
The variables H, W and T are initialized to 2, 2 and 1, respectively.
The gcd of H and T is calculated and stored in ga. The gcd of W and T is calculated and stored in gb.
The variable H is divided by ga and the variable W is divided by gb.
The variable ans is calculated as (2^H + 2^W - 1 + gcd(H, W) - 2) % MOD.
The variable ans is then raised to the power of ga*gb and the result is modulo MOD.
The final result is 1.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
from fractions import gcd
MOD = 10**9 + 7
H, W, T = map(int, input().split())
ga, gb = gcd(H, T), gcd(W, T)
H //= ga
W //= gb
ans = (pow(2, H, MOD) + pow(2, W, MOD) - 1 + pow(2, gcd(H, W)) - 2) % MOD
print(pow(ans, ga*gb, MOD))

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 2 1
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
