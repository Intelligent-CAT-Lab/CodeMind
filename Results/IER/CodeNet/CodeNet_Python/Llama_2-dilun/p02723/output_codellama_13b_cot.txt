The variable s is initialized to "sippuu".
The code checks if the 3rd and 4th characters of s are the same and if the 5th and 6th characters of s are the same.
If both conditions are met, the code prints "Yes".
If either condition is not met, the code prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
s = input()
if s[2] == s[3] and s[4] == s[5]:
    print("Yes")
else:
    print("No")
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```sippuu
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
