The variables w, h, x and y are initialized to 2, 3, 1 and 2, respectively.
The variables mx and my are initialized to 1 and 1, respectively.
The variable res is initialized to a list containing one element, which is 2*3/2.
The code checks if x is equal to mx and y is equal to my. If it is, it appends 1 to the list res. Otherwise, it appends 0 to the list res.
The code prints the first element of the list res, which is 2*3/2, and the second element of the list res, which is 1.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20 2 5```

The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
