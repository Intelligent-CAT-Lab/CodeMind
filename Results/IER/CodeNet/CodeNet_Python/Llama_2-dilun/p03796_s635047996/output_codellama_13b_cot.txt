The variable n is initialized to 3.
The function math.factorial is called to calculate the factorial of n, which is 6.
The variable ans is initialized to 6%(10**9+7), which is 6%1000000007.
The value of ans is printed.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import math
n=int(input())
s=math.factorial(n)
ans=s%(10**9+7)
print(ans)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
