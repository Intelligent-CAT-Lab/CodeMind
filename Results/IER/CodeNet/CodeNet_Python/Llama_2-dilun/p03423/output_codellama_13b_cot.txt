The code first prints the input, which is 8.
Then it divides the input by 3, which is 2.6666666666666666.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
print( int(input()) // 3)

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```8
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
