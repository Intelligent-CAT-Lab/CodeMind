The code first imports the sys module and sets the recursion limit to 10^7.
Then it defines a constant f_inf, which is the floating point infinity.
The code then defines a constant mod, which is 10^9 + 7.

The code then defines a function resolve, which takes a string t as input and returns a string res.
The function first replaces the string "?" in t with "D".
Then it prints the string res.

The code then calls the function resolve.
<<<Output>>>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import sys

sys.setrecursionlimit(10 ** 7)
f_inf = float('inf')
mod = 10 ** 9 + 7


def resolve():
    t = input()
    res = t.replace("?", "D")
    print(res)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    resolve()

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```PD?D??P
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
