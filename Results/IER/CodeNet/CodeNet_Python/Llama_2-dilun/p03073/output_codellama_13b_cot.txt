The code first reads the input and stores it in variable S.
The variable N is initialized to the length of S.
The variable zero_start is initialized to 0.
The variable zero_start_counter is initialized to 0.
The code then iterates through the characters in S.
For each character, it checks if the current character is different from the previous character.
If it is, it increments the variable zero_start_counter by 1.
Otherwise, it increments the variable zero_start by 1.
The variable zero_start is initialized to 0, so it will be 1 after the first iteration.
The variable zero_start_counter is initialized to 0, so it will be 1 after the first iteration.
The code then checks if the value of zero_start_counter is less than or equal to the value of one_start_counter.
If it is, it prints the value of zero_start_counter.
Otherwise, it prints the value of one_start_counter.
The value of zero_start_counter is 1, so it will be printed.
The value of one_start_counter is 0, so it will not be printed.
The code then prints the minimum value of zero_start_counter and one_start_counter, which is 1.

S = SI().strip()

N = len(S)

zero_start = 0

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```000
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
