The variable S is initialized to "abc".
The code checks if the length of S is 3. Since it is, it prints the reversed version of S, which is "cba".
If the length of S is not 3, it prints S, which is "abc".
<<<Output>>>
abc

Consider the following code:
<Code>
S = input()
if len(S) == 3:
    print(S[::-1])
else:
    print(S)

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```abc
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
