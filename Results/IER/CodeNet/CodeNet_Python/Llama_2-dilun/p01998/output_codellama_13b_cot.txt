The code first initializes the variable n to 3.
The code then initializes the array isPrime to [True] * (n + 3), which is [True] * 6.
The code then sets the value of isPrime[4] to False.
The code then sets the value of prePrime to -1.
The code then sets the value of ans to 0.
The code then sets the value of prePrime to 3.
The code then checks if prePrime + 2 == i, which is 3 + 2 == 5.
The code then checks if i > root, which is 5 > 3.
The code then sets the value of prePrime to 5.
The code then checks if prePrime + 2 == i, which is 5 + 2 == 7.
The code then checks if i > root, which is 7 > 3.
The code then sets the value of prePrime to 7.
