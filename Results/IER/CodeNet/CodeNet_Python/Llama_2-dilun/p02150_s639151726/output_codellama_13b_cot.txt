The variable a, variable b and variable x are initialized to 3, 1 and 5, respectively.
The variable MOD is initialized to 1e9+7, which is 1000000007.

The code checks if x is less than a. If it is, it calculates the remainder of x divided by a, which is 0.
If x is not less than a, it calculates the remainder of (x-b) divided by (a-b), which is 1.
It then calculates the remainder of (x + b*k) divided by MOD, which is 1.
The code prints the final value of res, which is 1.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
#! /usr/bin/env python3

a, b, x = map(int, input().split())
MOD = int(1e9+7)

if x < a:
    res = x % MOD
else:
    k = (x-b) // (a-b)
    res = (x + b*k)
    res %= MOD
print(res)


<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 1 5
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
