The variable h, variable a and variable b are initialized to 100, 2 and 4, respectively.
The code then prints the number of times the condition (h%(a+c)==0) is True for all values of c in the range [2, 4].
The condition is met when h is 100, 102, 104, 106, 108, 110, 112, 114, 116, 118, 120, 122, 124, 126, 128, 130, 132, 134, 136, 138, 140, 142, 144, 146, 148, 150, 152, 154, 156, 158, 160, 162, 164, 166, 168, 170, 172, 174, 176, 178, 180, 182, 184, 186, 188, 190, 192, 194, 196, 198, 200.
The code prints the number of times the condition is True, which is 10.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
h, a, b = map(int, input().split())
print([(h%(a+c)==0) for c in range(b-a+1)].count(True))

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```100 2 4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
