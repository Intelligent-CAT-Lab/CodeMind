The variable n is initialized to 4.
The code checks if n is even or odd. If it is even, it calculates the value of ans as (n/2)/n.
If it is odd, it calculates the value of ans as ((n+1)/2)/n.
The code prints the value of ans, which is 0.5 in this case.
<<<Output>>>
0.5

Consider the following code:
<Code>
n = int(input())
if n%2 == 0:
    ans = (n/2)/n
else:
    ans = ((n+1)/2)/n
print(ans)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
