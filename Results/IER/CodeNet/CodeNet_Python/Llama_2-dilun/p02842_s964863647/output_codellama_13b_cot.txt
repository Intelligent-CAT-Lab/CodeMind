The variable N is initialized to 432.
The code then calculates the ceiling of N divided by 1.08, which is 4.
The code then checks if the floor of 4 multiplied by 1.08 is equal to N.
Since 4*1.08 is 4.32, which is not equal to 432, the code prints ":(".

Consider the following code:
<Code>
# coding:utf-8
import math
N = int(input())
x = math.ceil(N/1.08)
if math.floor(x*1.08) == N:
  print(x)
else:
  print(":(")
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```432
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
