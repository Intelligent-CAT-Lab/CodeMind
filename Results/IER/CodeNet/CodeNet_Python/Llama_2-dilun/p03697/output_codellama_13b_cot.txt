The variable a and variable b are initialized to 6 and 3, respectively.
The code then prints the output of the following expression:
[int(a)+int(b),'error'][int(a)+int(b)>=10]

The expression is evaluated as follows:
[int(a)+int(b),'error']

The first element of the tuple is the sum of a and b, which is 9.
The second element of the tuple is the string 'error'.

The expression is evaluated as follows:
[int(a)+int(b),'error'][int(a)+int(b)>=10]

The first element of the tuple is the sum of a and b, which is 9.
The second element of the tuple is the string 'error'.

The expression is evaluated as follows:
[9,'error'][9>=10]

The first element of the tuple is the sum of a and b, which is 9.
The second element of the tuple is the string 'error'.

The expression is evaluated as follows:
[9,'error'][9>=10]

The first element of the tuple is the sum of a and b, which is 9.
The second element of the tuple is the string 'error'.

The expression is evaluated as follows:
[9,'error'][9>=10]

The first element of the tuple is the sum of a and b, which is 9.
The second element of the tuple is the string 'error'.

The expression is evaluated as follows:
[9,'error'][9>=10]

The first element of the tuple is the sum of a and b, which is 9.
The second element of the tuple is the string 'error'.

The expression is evaluated as follows:
[9,'error'][9>=10]

The first element of the tuple is the sum of a and b, which is 9.
The second element of the tuple is the string 'error'.

The expression is evaluated as follows:
[9,'error'][9>=10]

The first element of the tuple is the sum of a and b, which is 9.
The second element of the tuple is the string 'error'.

The expression is evaluated as follows:
[9,'error'][9>=10]

The first element of the tuple is the sum of a and b, which is 9.
The second element of the tuple is the string 'error'.

The expression is evaluated as follows:
[9,'error'][9>=10]

The first element of the tuple is the sum of a and b, which is 9.
The second element of the tuple is the string 'error'.

The expression is evaluated as follows:
[9,'error'][9>=10]

The first element of the tuple is the sum of a and b, which is 9.
The second element of the tuple is the string 'error'.

The expression is evaluated as follows:
[9,'error'][9>=10]

The first element of the tuple is the sum of a and b, which is 9.
The second element of the tuple is the string 'error'.

The expression is evaluated as follows:
[9,'error'][9>=10]

The first element of the tuple is the sum of a and b, which is 9.
The second element of the tuple is the string 'error'.

The expression is evaluated as follows:
[9,'error'][9>=10]

The first element of the tuple is the sum of a and b, which is 9.
The second element of the tuple is the string 'error'.

The expression is evaluated as follows:
[9,'error'][9>=10]

The first element of the tuple is the sum of a and b, which is 9.
The second element of the tuple is the string 'error'.

The expression is evaluated as follows:
[9,'error'][9>=10]

The first element of the tuple is the sum of a and b, which is 9.
The second element of the tuple is the string 'error'.

The expression is evaluated as follows:
[9,'error'][9>=10]

The first element of the tuple is the sum of a and b, which is 9.
