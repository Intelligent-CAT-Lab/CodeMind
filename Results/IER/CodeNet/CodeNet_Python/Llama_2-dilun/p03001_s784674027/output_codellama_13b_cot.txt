The variables a, b, x and y are initialized to 2, 3, 1 and 2, respectively.
The code calculates the value of h, which is 1 if a/2 == x and b/2 == y, and 0 otherwise.
The code then prints the string representation of a*b/2 and h.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b,x,y = map(float,input().split())
h = 1 if a/2==x and b/2==y else 0
print(str(a*b/2) +'' + str(h))
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 3 1 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
