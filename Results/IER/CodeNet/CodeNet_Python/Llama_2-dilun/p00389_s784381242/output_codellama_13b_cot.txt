The variable N, variable K are initialized to 4, 2, respectively.
The variable ans is initialized to 1, which will be used to accumulate the number of times the loop is executed.
The variable s is initialized to 1, which will be used to calculate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The variable N is decremented by 1, which means the loop will iterate from 4 to 1.
The loop will continue to iterate until the condition N < m is met, which is when N is 1.
The variable s is incremented by m, which is the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The variable N is decremented by m, which is the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The variable ans is incremented by 1, which is the number of times the loop is executed.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 3.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, K = map(int, input().split())
ans = 1
s = 1
N -= 1
while 1:
    m = (s+K-1) // K
    if N < m:
        break
    s += m; N -= m
    ans += 1
print(ans)

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
