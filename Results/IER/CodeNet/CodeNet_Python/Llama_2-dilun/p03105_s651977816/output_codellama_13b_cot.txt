The variable A, B and C are initialized to 2, 11 and 4, respectively.
The code then prints the minimum of B//A and C, which is 1.
<<<Output>>>

[INST]
Consider the following code:
<Code>
A,B,C=map(int,input().split())
print(min(B//A,C))

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 11 4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
