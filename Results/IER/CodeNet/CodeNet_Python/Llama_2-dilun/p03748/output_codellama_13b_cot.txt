The code first reads the input as a string and splits it into two numbers N and M.
N and M are initialized to 2 and 3, respectively.
The code then initializes two arrays dp_T and dp_F to 0 and 1, respectively.
The code then iterates M times, which is 3 times in this case.
For each iteration, the code initializes two new arrays dp_T and dp_F to 0 and 1, respectively.
The code then calculates the sum of dp_T and dp_F for each state, which is the number of states that can be reached from the current state.
The code then calculates the sum of the states that can be reached from the current state, which is the number of states that can be reached from the current state.
The code then calculates the sum of the states that can be reached from the current state, which is the number of states that can be reached from the current state.
