The code first initializes n and m to 25 and 3, respectively.
The code then iterates over all possible combinations of -1, 0 and 1, each repeated m times.
The code then checks if the sum of the numbers is equal to n.
If it is, it prints the combination of -1, 0 and 1.
The code breaks out of the loop when it finds a combination that satisfies the condition.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
#! /usr/bin/env python

from itertools import product, starmap, dropwhile
from math import log

n = int(input())
m = int(log(n, 3)) + 2
for a in product([-1, 0, 1], repeat=m):
    if n == sum(starmap(lambda t, x: 3 ** t * x, zip(reversed(range(m)), a))):
        print("".join(map(lambda x: "-0+"[x + 1], dropwhile(lambda x: x == 0, a))))
        break

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```25
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
