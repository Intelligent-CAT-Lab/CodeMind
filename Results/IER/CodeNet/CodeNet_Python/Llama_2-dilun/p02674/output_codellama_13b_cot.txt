The variable n is initialized to 2.
The code checks if n is in the dictionary dic.
If it is, it prints the value of dic[n], which is 1.
If it is not, it prints -1.

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
