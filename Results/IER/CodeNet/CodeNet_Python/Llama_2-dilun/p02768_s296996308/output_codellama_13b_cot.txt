The variable n, variable a and variable b are initialized to 4, 1 and 3, respectively.
The variable ans is initialized to 2^4 - 1, which is 15.
The variable tmp_a is initialized to the result of the function mod_cmb(n, a, mod), which is 1.
The variable tmp_b is initialized to the result of the function mod_cmb(n, b, mod), which is 1.
The variable ans is then subtracted from the result of tmp_a and tmp_b, which is 13.
The result is then divided by mod, which is 1000000007, and the remainder is printed.
The result is 13 % 1000000007, which is 13.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>

def main():
    n, a, b = map(int, input().split())

    ans = pow(2, n, mod) - 1

    tmp_a = mod_cmb(n, a, mod)
    tmp_b = mod_cmb(n, b, mod)

    print((ans-tmp_a-tmp_b)%mod)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4 1 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
