The code first reads the input string S, which is "0??".
The code then initializes the variables max0, max1, amax0, amax1, mi0, mi1, h0 and h1.
max0 and max1 are initialized to 0, which will be used to store the maximum difference between the number of 0s and 1s in the string.
amax0 and amax1 are initialized to empty lists, which will be used to store the indices of the maximum difference.
mi0 and mi1 are initialized to 0, which will be used to store the minimum number of 0s and 1s in the string.
h0 and h1 are initialized to 0, which will be used to store the number of 0s and 1s in the string.

The code then iterates through the string S, character by character.
If the current character is "1", it increments h1 and checks if the difference between h1 and mi1 is greater than max1.
If it is, it sets max1 to h1-mi1 and stores the index of the character in amax1.
If the difference is equal to max1, it appends the index of the character to amax1.
If the current character is "0", it decrements h1 and checks if h1 is less than mi1.
If it is, it sets mi1 to h1 and stores the index of the character in amax1.
If the current character is neither "1" nor "0", it decrements h0 and checks if h0 is less than mi0.
If it is, it sets mi0 to h0 and stores the index of the character in amax0.
If the current character is "1", it increments h0 and checks if the difference between h0 and mi0 is greater than max0.
If it is, it sets max0 to h0-mi0 and stores the index of the character in amax0.
If the difference is equal to max0, it appends the index of the character to amax0.
If the current character is "0", it decrements h0 and checks if h0 is less than mi0.
If it is, it sets mi0 to h0 and stores the index of the character in amax0.

If max0 is less than max1, the code checks if the number of 0s in the string is odd.
If it is, it prints max1.
If it is not, it prints max1+1.
If max0 is greater than max1, the code checks if the number of 0s in the string is odd.
If it is, it prints max0.
If it is not, it prints max0+1.
If max0 and max1 are equal, the code checks if the number of 0s in the string is odd.
If it is, it prints max0.
If it is not, it prints max0+1.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())

A = [0]*N
B = [0]*N

for i in range(N):
    A[i], B[i] = map(int, input().split())

for i in range(N):
    if A[i] > B[i]:
        A[i], B[i] = B[i], A[i]

for i in range(N):
    print(A[i], B[i])

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 1 2 3```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The code first reads the input N, which is 3.
It then initializes the arrays A and B to all zeros.
It then iterates through the input, which is "1 2 3", and stores the values in the arrays A and B.
It then swaps the values in A and B
