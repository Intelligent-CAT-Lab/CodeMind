The variable n is initialized to 10.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 10 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 10.
For each number i in this range, it checks if n is divisible by i and if the quotient is less than 10. If it is, it prints "Yes" and exits the loop.
The condition is met when i is 1, 2, 5 and 10.
After the loop finishes, the code prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No

Consider the following code:
<Code>
n=int(input())
for i in range(1,10):
    if n%i==0 and n/i<10:
      print("Yes")
      exit()
print("No")

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
