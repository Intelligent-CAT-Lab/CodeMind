The code first reads the input n, which is 24.
The code then calls the function factorization, which calculates the prime factorization of n.
The function factorization returns a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the prime factor and the number of times it appears in the factorization.
The code then calls the function main, which is the main function of the program.
The function main calls the function factorization, which calculates the prime factorization of n.
The function factorization returns a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the prime factor and the number of times it appears in the factorization.
The function main then calculates the number of times each prime factor appears in the factorization.
The function main then prints the number of times each prime factor appears in the factorization.
The output is 3, which is the number of times the prime factor 2 appears in the factorization.

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```24
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
