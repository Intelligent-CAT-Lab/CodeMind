The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 21, 21 and 21, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 21.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [21, 21] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 21.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 21.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
print(48-int(input()))
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```21
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
