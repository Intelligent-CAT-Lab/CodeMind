The variable mod is initialized to 10^9 + 7.
The variable fac is initialized to a list containing 1 modulo mod.
The variable pw is initialized to a list containing 1 modulo mod.
The variable fac is then updated by appending 1 modulo mod to the list.
The variable pw is then updated by appending 1 modulo mod to the list.
The variable fac is then updated by appending the product of the previous value of fac and i modulo mod to the list.
The variable pw is then updated by appending the value of pow(fac[i], mod-2, mod) to the list.

The variables n and k are initialized to 5 and 3, respectively.
The code then prints the product of fac[n+k-1]*pw[n]*pw[k-1] modulo mod.

The output is 100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
