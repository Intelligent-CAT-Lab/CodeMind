The variable a and variable b are initialized to 3 and 2, respectively.
The code then calculates the quotient and remainder of a divided by b, and stores them in variables d and r, respectively.
The code then calculates the fractional part of a divided by b, and stores it in variable f.
The code then prints the output in the format "d r f", where d is the quotient, r is the remainder and f is the fractional part.
The output is "0 1 0.5".
<<<Output>>>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b = tuple(int(n) for n in input().split())

d,r = divmod(a,b)
f = a / b

print("{} {} {:.5f}".format(d,r,f))

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
