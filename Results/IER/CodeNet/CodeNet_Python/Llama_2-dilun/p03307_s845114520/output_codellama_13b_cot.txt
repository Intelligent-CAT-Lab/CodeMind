The variable N is initialized to 3.
The code checks if N is even. If it is, it prints N.
If it is not, it prints 2*N.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())
if N%2 == 0:
    print(N)
else:
    print(2*N)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
