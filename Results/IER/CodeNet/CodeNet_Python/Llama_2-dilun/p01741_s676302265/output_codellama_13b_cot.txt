The variable n is initialized to 1.000.
The code then prints the value of n+1, which is 2.000.
The code then prints the value of n*math.sqrt(2), which is 1.4142135623730951.
The code then checks if n+1 is less than n*math.sqrt(2). Since 2.000 is less than 1.4142135623730951, the code prints 2.000.
<<<Output>>>
2.000

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import math
n=float(input())
print(int(n)+1 if n*math.sqrt(2)<int(n)+1 else n*math.sqrt(2))
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1.000
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
