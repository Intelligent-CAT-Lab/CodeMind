The variable A and variable B are initialized to 2 and 3, respectively.
The code then creates a 100x100 grid with all elements initialized to 0.
The code then iterates through the range of B-1, which is [1, 2] in this case.
For each number b in this range, it calculates the remainder of b divided by 50 and stores it in y. It also calculates the quotient of b divided by 50 and stores it in x.
The code then sets the element at 2*y, 2*x to 1.
The code then iterates through the range of A-1, which is [1, 1] in this case.
For each number a in this range, it calculates the remainder of a divided by 50 and stores it in y. It also calculates the quotient of a divided by 50 and stores it in x.
The code then sets the element at 99-2*y, 2*x to 0.
The code then prints a 100x100 grid with all elements initialized to 0.
For each row, it prints a string with '.' if the element is 0 and '#' if the element is 1.
The output is:

.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.
