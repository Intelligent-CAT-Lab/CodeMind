The variable x is initialized to 46979.
The code then calculates the hour, minute and second of the time.
The hour is calculated by dividing x by 3600, which is 123.
The minute is calculated by dividing the remainder of the division by 60, which is 2.
The second is calculated by dividing the remainder of the division by 60, which is 97.
The code then prints the time in the format "hh:mm:ss", which is "123:02:97".
<<<Output>>>
123:02:97

Consider the following code:
<Code>
x = int(input())
y = int(input())
z = int(input())

if x == y and y == z:
    print("YES")
else:
    print("NO")
</Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 1 1```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The variable x is initialized to 1, the variable y is initialized to 1 and the variable z is initialized to 1.
The code then checks if x == y and y == z.
Since x == y and y == z are both True, the code prints "YES".
<<<Output>>>
YES
