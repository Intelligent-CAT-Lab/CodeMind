The input is 5 8.
The code splits the input into two strings, a and b.
The code then converts the strings to integers.
The code adds the two integers and prints the result.
The output is 13.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b=input().split(" ")
a=int(a)
b=int(b)
print(a+b)


<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 8
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
