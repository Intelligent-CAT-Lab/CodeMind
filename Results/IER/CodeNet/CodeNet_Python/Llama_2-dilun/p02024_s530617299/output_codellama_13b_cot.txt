The variable h, w, x and y are initialized to 4, 5, 2 and 3, respectively.
The code then prints the output based on the following conditions:
h*w%2==1 and (x+y)%2==1

The first condition checks if h*w is odd and x+y is odd.
The second condition checks if h*w is even and x+y is even.

The output is "Yes" when the first condition is true and the second condition is false.
The output is "No" when the first condition is false and the second condition is true.

The output is "Yes" when h*w is odd and x+y is odd.
The output is "No" when h*w is even and x+y is even.
