The function val(x) calculates the sum of digits of x.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 73 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 73.
For each number y in this range, it calculates the sum of digits of y+a, where a is 16.
It then checks if the number x is within the range [1, 1000] and if the sum of digits of x is equal to y.
If both conditions are met, it increments the counter cnt by 1.
The condition is met when y is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of cnt, which is 100.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def val(x):
    sum = 0
    while x > 0:
        sum += x%10
        x //= 10
    return sum

a,n,m = map(int, input().split())
cnt = 0

for y in range(1, 73):
    x = 1
    for t in range(1, n+1):
      x *= (y+a)
    if x <= m and val(x) == y:
        cnt += 1

print(cnt)

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```16 2 1000
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
