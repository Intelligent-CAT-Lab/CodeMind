The variable string is initialized to "ABC".
The code checks if string is equal to "ARC".
If it is, it prints "ABC".
If it is not, it prints "ARC".
<<<Output>>>
ABC

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
string = input()
if string == "ARC":
  print("ABC")
else:
  print("ARC")
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```ABC
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
