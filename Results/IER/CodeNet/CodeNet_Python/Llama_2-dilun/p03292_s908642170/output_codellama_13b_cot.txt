The variable a is initialized to a list of integers.
The input is split into a list of strings.
Each string is converted to an integer.
The list of integers is sorted.
The first, second and third elements of the sorted list are stored in a, b and c, respectively.
The output is calculated as a[1] - a[0] + b[2] - b[1].
The output is 10.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
a = [ int(i) for i in input().split() ]
a = sorted(a)
print( a[1] - a[0] + a[2] - a[1] )

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 6 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
