The code first initializes the variable n to 6.
If n is 2 or 3, the code prints the first element of the list dominoes and exits.
The code then initializes the variable dominoes to a list of strings.
The strings in the list are the elements of the list dominoes.
The code then initializes the variable dominoes to a list of lists.
Each element of the list is a string that is a line of the dominoes.
