The variable a, variable b and variable k are initialized to 8, 12 and 2, respectively.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to min(a,b) (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 12.
For each number val in this range, it checks if val is a divisor of both a and b. If it is, it adds val to the list ans.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the last element of the list ans, which is 6.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b,k = map(int,input().split())

ans = []
for val in range(1,min(a,b)+1):
    #print(val)
    if a % val == 0 and b % val ==0:
        ans.append(val)
        #print(val)

print(ans[-k])
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```8 12 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
