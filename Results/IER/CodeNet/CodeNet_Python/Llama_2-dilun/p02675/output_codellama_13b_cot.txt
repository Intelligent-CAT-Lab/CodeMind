The variable n is initialized to 16.
The code checks if n is equal to 3. If it is, it prints "bon".
Otherwise, it checks if n is in the list [2,4,5,7,9]. If it is, it prints "hon".
Otherwise, it prints "pon".
<<<Output>>>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
n=int(input())
if n==3:
    print("bon")
elif n in [2,4,5,7,9]:
    print("hon")
else:
    print("pon")

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```16
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
