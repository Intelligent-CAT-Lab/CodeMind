The variable a and variable b are initialized to 5 and 8, respectively.
The code then prints the difference between a and b, which is 3.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b = map(int,input().split())
print(a-b)


<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 8
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
