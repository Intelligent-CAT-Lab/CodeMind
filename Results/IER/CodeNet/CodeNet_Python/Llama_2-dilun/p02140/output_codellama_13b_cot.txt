The variable R, C, ay, ax, by, bx are initialized to 2, 2, 0, 0, 1, 1, respectively.
The variable MOD is initialized to 10**9+7.
The variable dists is initialized to a list of lists of integers, where each inner list has length C.
The variable dists[ay][ax] is initialized to 0.
The variable ptns is initialized to a list of lists of integers, where each inner list has length R.
The variable ptns[ay][ax] is initialized to 1.
The variable q is initialized to a deque containing a tuple (0, ax, ay).
The variable dxs is initialized to a list containing (1, 0, -1, 0).
The variable dys is initialized to a list containing (0, 1, 0, -1).
The variable ans_d is initialized to None.

The code enters a while loop that iterates while q is not empty.
The code pops the first element from q and stores it in d, x, y.
If ans_d is not None and d > ans_d, the code breaks the loop.
If (x, y) == (bx, by), the code sets ans_d to d.
If d > dists[y][x], the code continues.
If dists[y][x] == INF, the code continues.
If dists[y][x] is not INF, the code sets dists[y][x] to d.
The code iterates over the list dxs and the list dys.
For each element (dx, dy) in the list, the code calculates the new coordinates (nx, ny) by adding dx and dy to x and y, respectively.
If the new coordinates are not within the range [0, C-1] for x and [0, R-1] for y, the code continues.
If dists[ny][nx] is INF, the code continues.
If dists[ny][nx] is not INF, the code sets dists[ny][nx] to d+1.
The code sets q to contain (d+1, nx, ny).
The code sets dists[ny][nx] to d+1.
The code sets ptns[ny][nx] to ptns[y][x] + 1.
The code sets ptns[ny][nx] %= MOD.
The code iterates over the list (x, 0), (x, R-1), (0, y), (C-1, y).
For each element (nx, ny) in the list, the code calculates the new coordinates (nx, ny) by adding dx and dy to x and y, respectively.
If dists[ny][nx] is INF, the code continues.
If dists[ny][nx] is not INF, the code sets dists[ny][nx] to d+1.
The code sets q to contain (d+1, nx, ny).
The code sets dists[ny][nx] to d+1.
The code sets ptns[ny][nx] to ptns[y][x] + 1.
The code sets ptns[ny][nx] %= MOD.

The code prints the value of ans_d and ptns[by][bx] % MOD.

The output is 10 and 1.
