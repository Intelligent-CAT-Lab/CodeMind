The variable a and variable b are initialized to 3 and 7, respectively.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from b-a+1 to b+a, meaning it will consider numbers from 4 to 10.
For each number i in this range, it prints i and a space.
The code prints 4 5 6 7 8 9 10.
<<<Output>>>
4 5 6 7 8 9 10

Consider the following code:
<Code>
a, b = map(int,input().split())
for i in range(b-a+1,b+a):
    print(i,end=" ")

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 7
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
