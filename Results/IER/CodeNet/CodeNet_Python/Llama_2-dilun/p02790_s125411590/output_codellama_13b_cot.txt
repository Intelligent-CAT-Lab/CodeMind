The variable a and variable b are initialized to 4 and 3, respectively.
The variable a_string is initialized to 4*3, which is 12.
The variable b_string is initialized to 3*4, which is 12.
The variable answer is initialized to the sorted list of a_string and b_string.
The sorted list is [12, 12].
The code prints the first element of the sorted list, which is 12.
<<<Output>>>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b=input().split()
a_string=a*int(b)
b_string=b*int(a)
answer=sorted([a_string,b_string])
print(answer[0])
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
