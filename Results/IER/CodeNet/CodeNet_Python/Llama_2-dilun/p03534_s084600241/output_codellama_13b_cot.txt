The variable S is initialized to "abac".
The variable nums is initialized to a list of integers, where each integer is the number of times the letter 'a', 'b' or 'c' appears in the string S.
The list is sorted in ascending order.
The first element of the list is subtracted from the last element of the list.
The second element of the list is subtracted from the first element of the list.

The function check() is called. It checks if the first element of the list is 0 and the last element is greater than 1. If this is the case, the function returns False.
If the first element is greater than 1 or the last element is greater than 1, the function returns False.
If the first element is 0 and the last element is greater than 1, the function returns True.

The function check() returns True, so the output is "YES".

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
S = input()
nums = [S.count(x) for x in 'abc']
nums.sort()
nums[-1] -= nums[0]
nums[1] -= nums[0]

def check():
    if nums[1] == 0 and nums[-1] > 1:
        return False
    if nums[1] > 1 or nums[-1] > 1: 
        return False
    return True

print("YES" if check() else "NO")

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```abac
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
