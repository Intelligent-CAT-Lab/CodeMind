The variable A is initialized to the input string "0011".
The variable N is initialized to the length of A, which is 4.
The variable C0 is initialized to the number of times "0" appears in A, which is 2.
The variable C1 is initialized to the number of times "1" appears in A, which is 2.
The code then prints 2 * min(C0, C1), which is 2 * min(2, 2), which is 2 * 2, which is 4.

[INST]
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())
A = list(map(int, input().split()))

for i in range(N):
    if A[i] == 0:
        A[i] = 1

print(A)

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
