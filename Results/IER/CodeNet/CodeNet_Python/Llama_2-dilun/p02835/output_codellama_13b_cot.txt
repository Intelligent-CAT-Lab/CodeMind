The variables a, b and c are initialized to 5, 7 and 9, respectively.
The code then prints the string 'win' if the sum of a, b and c is less than 22, and prints the string 'bust' otherwise.
The sum of a, b and c is 21, so the code prints 'win'.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b,c = map(int, input().split())
print('win' if a+b+c<22 else 'bust')
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 7 9
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
