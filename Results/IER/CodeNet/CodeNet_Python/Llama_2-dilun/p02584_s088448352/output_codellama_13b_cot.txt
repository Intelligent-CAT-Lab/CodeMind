The variable x, k and d are initialized to 6, 2 and 4, respectively.
The variable k is converted to an integer.
The variable x is converted to an integer and the absolute value of x is calculated.
The condition is checked to see if the product of k and d is less than or equal to x.
If the condition is met, the value of x is subtracted from the product of k and d.
Otherwise, the value of k is decremented by the value of x divided by d.
The remainder of x is calculated and stored in x.
If the remainder is even, the value of d is subtracted from x.
Otherwise, the value of x is printed.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
x,k,d=input().split()
k=int(k)
x=int(x)
d=int(d)
x=int(abs(x))
if((k*d)<=x):
    print(x-(k*d))
else:
    k-=int(x/d)
    x%=d
    if(k%2):
        print(d-x)
    else:
        print(x)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```6 2 4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
