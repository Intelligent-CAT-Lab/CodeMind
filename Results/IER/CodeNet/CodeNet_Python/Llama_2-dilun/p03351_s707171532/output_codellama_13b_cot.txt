The variables a, b, c and x are initialized to 4, 7, 9 and 3, respectively.
The code checks if the absolute difference between a and c is less than or equal to x.
If it is, it prints "Yes".
Otherwise, it checks if the absolute difference between a and b is less than or equal to x and the absolute difference between b and c is less than or equal to x.
If it is, it prints "Yes".
Otherwise, it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
Yes

Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b,c,x=map(int,input().split())
if abs(a-c)<=x:
  print("Yes")
elif abs(a-b)<=x and abs(b-c)<=x:
  print("Yes")
else:
  print("No")

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4 7 9 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
