The code starts with an empty list sosu.
It then initializes now to 3.
The code enters a while loop that iterates while now ** 2 <= 10 ** 9.
The code then enters a for loop that iterates over the elements of sosu.
Inside the for loop, it sets flag to True.
It then checks if now % i == 0. If it is, it sets flag to False and breaks the for loop.
If flag is still True, it appends now to sosu.
It then increments now by 1.
The code then prints the elements of sosu.
The code then inserts 1 to the beginning of sosu.

The code then initializes S to 3.
It then initializes r to the square root of S.
It then initializes st1 to r and st2 to r.
It then sets mode to 0.

The code then enters a while loop that iterates while True.
Inside the while loop, it checks if st1 * st2 - S >= 0.
If it is, it sets cd to ( st1 * st2 ) - S.
It then enters a for loop that iterates over the elements of sosu.
Inside the for loop, it sets flag to False.
It then checks if cd % i == 0 and cd // i <= 10 ** 9 and st1 <= 10 ** 9 and st2 <= 10 ** 9.
If it is, it prints 0,0,st1,cd // i,i,st2.
It then sets flag to True and breaks the for loop.
If flag is still False, it breaks the while loop.

If mode is 0 and st1 * st2 < S, it sets st1 to 10 ** 9 and st2 to r.
If mode is 0 and st1 * st2 == S, it sets st1 to r and st2 to 10 ** 9.
If mode is 0 and st1 * st2 > S, it sets st1 to r and st2 to 10 ** 9.

If mode is 1 and st1 * st2 < S, it sets st1 to 10 ** 9 and st2 to r.
If mode is 1 and st1 * st2 == S, it sets st1 to r and st2 to 10 ** 9.
If mode is 1 and st1 * st2 > S, it sets st1 to r and st2 to 10 ** 9.

If st1 is 10 ** 9 and st2 is 10 ** 9, it sets mode to 1.
If st1 is 10 ** 9 and st2 is not 10 ** 9, it sets st2 to r.
If st1 is not 10 ** 9 and st2 is 10 ** 9, it sets st1 to r.
If st1 is not 10 ** 9 and st2 is not 10 ** 9, it sets st1 to r and st2 to r.

If st1 is not 10 ** 9 and st2 is not 10 ** 9, it sets st1 to r and st2 to r.
If st1 is 10 ** 9 and st2 is not 10 ** 9, it sets st2 to r.
If st1 is not 10 ** 9 and st2 is 10 ** 9, it sets st1 to r.

If st1 is not 10 ** 9 and st2 is not 10 ** 9, it sets st1 to r and st2 to r.
If st1 is 10 ** 9 and st2 is not 10 ** 9, it sets st2 to r.
If st1 is not 10 ** 9 and st2 is 10 ** 9, it sets st1 to r.

If st1 is not 10 ** 9 and st2 is not 10 ** 9, it sets st1 to r and st2 to r.
If st1 is 10 ** 9 and st2 is not 10 ** 9, it sets st2 to r.
If st1 is not 10 ** 9 and st2 is 10 ** 9, it sets st
