The variable N is initialized to 5.
The function fib is called with the value of N.
The function fib calculates the value of fib(5) by using the memoization technique.
The memoization technique is a technique that stores the results of previous calculations in a table.
The table is initialized with the values of fib(0) and fib(1), which are 0 and 1, respectively.
For each subsequent value of n, the function fib calculates the value of fib(n) by using the values of fib(n - 1) and fib(n - 2) from the table.
The function fib(5) is calculated by using the values of fib(4) and fib(3) from the table, which are 5 and 8, respectively.
The function fib(5) is then returned as the output of the code.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def fib(n):
    memo = [0] * n
    memo[0:2] = [2, 1]
    for i in range(2, n):
        memo[i] = memo[i - 1] + memo[i - 2]
    return memo[n - 1]


def solve():
    N = int(input())
    print(fib(N + 1))
    

solve()
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
