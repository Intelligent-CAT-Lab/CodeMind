The variable n and variable k are initialized to 4 and 2, respectively.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the number of solutions.
The variable d and variable s are initialized to 1 and 0, respectively.
The code enters a while loop that iterates while the condition s/d <= k and s <= d*k is true.
The code then enters a while loop that iterates while d*k < s.
The code then increments d by 1.
The code then increments s by d.
The code then increments ans by 1.
The code then checks if s+d > n. If it is, the loop breaks.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 2.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
n,k = map(int,input().split())

ans = 0
d,s = 1,0
while True:
    # s/d <= k
    # s <= d*k
    while d*k < s:
        d += 1
    if s+d > n:
        break
    s += d
    ans += 1

print(ans)

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
