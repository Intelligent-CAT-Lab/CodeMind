The input is 575.
The code converts the input to a string and stores it in variable s.
The code then checks if s is the same as its reverse.
The reverse of 575 is 575, so the condition is met and the code prints "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes

[INST]
Consider the following code:
<Code>
s = str(input())
if s == s[::-1]:
  print("Yes")
else:
  print("No")
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```575
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
