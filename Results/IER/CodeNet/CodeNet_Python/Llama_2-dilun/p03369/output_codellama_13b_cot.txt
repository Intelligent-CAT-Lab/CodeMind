The variable s is initialized to "oxo".
The code then prints the value of 700 + 100 * s.count("o"), which is 700 + 100 * 2, which is 720.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
s = input()
print(700+100*s.count("o"))
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```oxo
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
