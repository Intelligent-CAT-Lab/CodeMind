The variable L is initialized to 3.
The code then imports the sys module and the decimal module.
The input function is defined to read a line from standard input and return it as a string.
The variable d is initialized to the decimal value of L.
The code then prints the result of the expression (d/3) ** 3, which is 27.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import sys
input = lambda: sys.stdin.readline().rstrip()
from decimal import *

L = int(input())

d = Decimal(L)

print((d/3) ** 3)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
