The input is 2 1 1 0 0 0 0.
The variables I, O, T, J, L, S, Z are initialized to 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, respectively.
The function solve() is called.
The function solve() reads the input from the standard input and stores it in the variables I, O, T, J, L, S, Z.
The variable Ans is initialized to O, which is 1 in this case.
The variable six is initialized to the minimum of I, J and L, which is 1 in this case.
The variable Ans is updated to 3 * six, which is 3.
The variable I is updated to I - six, which is 1.
The variable J is updated to J - six, which is 0.
The variable L is updated to L - six, which is 0.
The variable Ans is updated to 2 * (I // 2 + J // 2 + L // 2), which is 2.
The variable rem is initialized to the sum of I % 2, J % 2 and L % 2, which is 2 in this case.
The variable Ans is updated to Ans + 1 if six > 0 and rem == 2, which is 3.
The function solve() returns 0.

The output of the code is 3.

[INST]
    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def solve():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    N = int(input())
    A = list(map(int, input().split()))
    B = list(map(int, input().split()))
    C = list(map(int, input().split()))
    D = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(N):
        if A[i] == B[i] == C[i] == D[i]:
            print(1)
        else:
            print(0)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
