The input is "ASSA".
The first if statement checks if the first and second characters are the same and the third and fourth characters are the same and the first character is not the same as the third character.
This condition is met when the input is "ASSA".
The second if statement checks if the first and third characters are the same and the second and third characters are the same and the first character is not the same as the second character.
This condition is met when the input is "ASSA".
The third if statement checks if the first and third characters are the same and the second and third characters are the same and the first character is not the same as the third character.
This condition is met when the input is "ASSA".
The else statement is not executed.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
S = input()

if S[0] == S[1] and S[2] == S[3] and S[0]!= S[2]:
    print("Yes")
elif S[0] == S[2] and S[1] == S[3] and S[0]!= S[1]:
    print("Yes")
elif S[0] == S[3] and S[1] == S[2] and S[0]!= S[2]:
    print("Yes")
else:
    print("No")

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```ASSA
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
