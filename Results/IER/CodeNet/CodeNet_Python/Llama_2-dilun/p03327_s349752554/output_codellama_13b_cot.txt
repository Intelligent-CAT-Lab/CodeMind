The variable n is initialized to 999.
The code checks if n is less than or equal to 999. If it is, it prints "ABC". Otherwise, it prints "ABD".
<<<Output>>>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
n = int(input())

if n <= 999:
    print("ABC")
else:
    print("ABD")
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```999
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
