The variable n and variable k are initialized to 5 and 2, respectively.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from k+1 to n+1, meaning it will consider numbers from 3 to 5.
For each number b in this range, it calculates the value of b*n//b + max(0, (n%b)-k+1) and stores it in val.
If k==0, it subtracts 1 from val.
The code then adds val to ans.
The final value of ans is 10.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import sys
input = lambda : sys.stdin.readline().rstrip()
sys.setrecursionlimit(max(1000, 10**9))
write = lambda x: sys.stdout.write(x+"\n")


n,k = list(map(int, input().split()))
ans = 0
for b in range(k+1, n+1):
    val = (b-k) * (n//b) + max(0, (n%b)-k+1)
    if k==0:
        val -= 1
    ans += val
#     print(b,val)
print(ans)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
