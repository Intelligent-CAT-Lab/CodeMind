The variable N is initialized to 8.
The code then calculates the square root of N, which is 2.8284271247462.
The code then iterates from 1 to the square root of N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 2.8284271247462.
For each number i in this range, it checks if N is divisible by i. If it is, it adds i and N//i to the list factors.
The code then iterates through the list factors and calculates the sum of all the numbers that are not 1.
The code prints the final value of the sum, which is 3.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import math

N = int(input())

factors = []
d = math.floor(N**(1/2))
for i in range(1,d+1):
	if N%i==0:
		factors.append(i)
		factors.append(N//i)

ans = 0
for f in factors:
	if f == 1:
		continue
	s,t = divmod(N,f-1)
	if s == t:
		ans += f-1

print(ans)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
