The variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized to 5, 7 and 5, respectively.
The code checks if a is equal to b and b is not equal to c. If it is, it prints "Yes".
The code checks if b is equal to c and a is not equal to b. If it is, it prints "Yes".
The code checks if a is equal to c and a is not equal to b. If it is, it prints "Yes".
If none of the above conditions are met, it prints "No".

Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b,c = map(int,input().split())
if a == b and b!= c:
  print("Yes")
elif b == c and a!= b:
  print("Yes")
elif a == c and a!= b:
  print("Yes")
else:
  print("No")
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 7 5
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
