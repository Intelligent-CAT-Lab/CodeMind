The variable A and variable B are initialized to 2 and 2, respectively.
The variable n is initialized to 200, which is 200 * 100 // 8.
The variable m is initialized to 201, which is (200 + 1) * 100 // 8.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from n to m (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 200 to 201.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i * 8 // 100 == A and i // 10 == B. If it is, it sets the variable f to True and sets the variable ans to i. It then breaks out of the loop.
The code prints the value of ans if f is True, which is 201. Otherwise, it prints -1.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
A, B = map(int, input().split())
f = False
ans = 0
n = A * 100 // 8
m = (A + 1) * 100 // 8
for i in range(n, m + 1):
  if i * 8 // 100 == A and i // 10 == B:
    f = True
    ans = i
    break
print(ans if f else -1)

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
