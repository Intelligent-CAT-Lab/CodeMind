The variable a is initialized to the string "+-++".
The variable e is initialized to the number of "+" in the string.
The variable f is initialized to the number of "-" in the string.
The code then prints the difference between e and f, which is 2.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
a=input()
e=a.count("+")
f=a.count("-")
print(e-f)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```+-++
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
