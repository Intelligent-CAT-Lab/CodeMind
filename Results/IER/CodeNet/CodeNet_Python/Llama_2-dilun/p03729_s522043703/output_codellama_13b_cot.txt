The input is ```rng gorilla apple```.
The code first splits the input into three strings A, B and C.
Then it checks if the last character of A is the same as the first character of B and the last character of B is the same as the first character of C.
If it is, it prints "YES".
If it is not, it prints "NO".
<<<Output>>>
NO

Consider the following code:
<Code>
A, B, C = input().split()

if A[-1] == B[0] and B[-1] == C[0]:
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```rng gorilla apple
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
