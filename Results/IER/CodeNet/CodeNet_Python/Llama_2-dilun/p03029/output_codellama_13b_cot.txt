The variable a and variable p are initialized to 1 and 3, respectively.
The code then prints the result of the following calculation:
(3*a+p)//2
The result is 2.
<<<Output>>>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
a, b = map(int, input().split())
print(a*b)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
