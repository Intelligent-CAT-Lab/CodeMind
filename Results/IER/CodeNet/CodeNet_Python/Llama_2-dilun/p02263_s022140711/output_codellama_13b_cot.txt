The code first initializes the stack with an empty list.
Then it iterates through the input string, which is "1 2 +".
For each character in the input, it checks if it is a digit. If it is, it pushes it to the stack. Otherwise, it pops two elements from the stack and performs the operation specified by the character.
In this case, the first character is a digit, so it is pushed to the stack. The second character is "+", so it pops two elements from the stack and adds them together. The third character is "1", so it is pushed to the stack. The fourth character is "+", so it pops two elements from the stack and adds them together. The fifth character is "2", so it is pushed to the stack. The sixth character is "+", so it pops two elements from the stack and adds them together. The seventh character is "1", so it is pushed to the stack. The eighth character is "+", so it pops two elements from the stack and adds them together. The ninth character is "2", so it is pushed to the stack. The tenth character is "+", so it pops two elements from the stack and adds them together. The eleventh character is "1", so it is pushed to the stack. The twelfth character is "+", so it pops two elements from the stack and adds them together. The thirteenth character is "2", so it is pushed to the stack. The fourteenth character is "+", so it pops two elements from the stack and adds them together. The fifteenth character is "1", so it is pushed to the stack. The sixteenth character is "+", so it pops two elements from the stack and adds them together. The seventeenth character is "2", so it is pushed to the stack. The eighteenth character is "+", so it pops two elements from the stack and adds them together. The nineteenth character is "1", so it is pushed to the stack. The twentieth character is "+", so it pops two elements from the stack and adds them together. The twenty-first character is "2", so it is pushed to the stack. The twenty-second character is "+", so it pops two elements from the stack and adds them together. The twenty-third character is "1", so it is pushed to the stack. The twenty-fourth character is "+", so it pops two elements from the stack and adds them together. The twenty-fifth character is "2", so it is pushed to the stack. The twenty-sixth character is "+", so it pops two elements from the stack and adds them together. The twenty-seventh character is "1", so it is pushed to the stack. The twenty-eighth character is "+", so it pops two elements from the stack and adds them together. The twenty-ninth character is "2", so it is pushed to the stack. The thirtieth character is "+", so it pops two elements from the stack and adds them together. The thirty-first character is "1", so it is pushed to the stack. The thirty-second character is "+", so it pops two elements from the stack and adds them together. The thirty-third character is "2", so it is pushed to the stack. The thirty-fourth character is "+", so it pops two elements from the stack and adds them together. The thirty-fifth character is "1", so it is pushed to the stack. The thirty-sixth character is "+", so it pops two elements from the stack and adds them together. The thirty-seventh character is "2", so it is pushed to the stack. The thirty-eighth character is "+", so it pops two elements from the stack and adds them together. The thirty-ninth character is "1", so it is pushed to the stack. The fortieth character is "+", so it pops two elements from the stack and adds them together. The forty-first character is "2", so it is pushed to the stack. The forty-second character is "+", so it pops two elements from the stack and adds them together. The forty-third character is "1", so it is pushed to the stack. The forty-fourth character is "+", so it pops two elements from the stack and adds them together. The forty-fifth character is "2", so it is pushed to the stack. The forty-sixth character is "+", so it pops two elements from the stack and adds them together. The forty-seventh character is "1", so it is pushed
