The variable num_year is initialized to 0.
The variable t_maney is initialized to 100.
The variable x is initialized to 103.
The code enters a while loop that iterates until t_maney is greater than or equal to x.
The code then increments the variable num_year by 1.
The code then calculates the new value of t_maney by multiplying the current value of t_maney by 1.01.
The code prints the final value of num_year, which is 10.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import math

num_year = 0
t_maney = 100
x = int(input())

while t_maney < x:
    num_year += 1
    t_maney = math.floor(t_maney*1.01)

print(num_year)

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```103
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
