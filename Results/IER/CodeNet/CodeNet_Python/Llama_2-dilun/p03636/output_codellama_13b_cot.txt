The variable a is initialized to "internationalization".
The variable b is initialized to an empty string.
The variable c is initialized to an empty string.
The code then concatenates the strings a, b and c to form a single string.
The code then prints the sum of a, the length of b and c.
The output is "internationalization10internationalization".

Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,*b,c = input()
print(a+str(len(b))+c)

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```internationalization
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
