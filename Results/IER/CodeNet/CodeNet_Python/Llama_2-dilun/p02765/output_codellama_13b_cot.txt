The variable n and variable r are initialized to 2 and 2919, respectively.
The code then checks if n is less than 10. If it is, it adds 100 to r and multiplies the result by 10 minus n.
If n is not less than 10, it simply prints r.
The output is 2919 + 100 * (10 - 2) = 2919 + 80 = 2999.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
n,r = [int(x) for x in input().split()]

if n < 10:
    print(r + (100 * (10 - n)))
else:
    print(r)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 2919
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
