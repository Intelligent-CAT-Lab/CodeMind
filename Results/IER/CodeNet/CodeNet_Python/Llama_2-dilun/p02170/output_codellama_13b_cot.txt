The code first reads the input and stores it in variables n, k and a.
The code then calculates the value of A, which is a*100*n^mod-2*mod.
The code then calculates the value of inv, which is n^mod-2*mod.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from k-1 to 0, which means it will consider numbers from 1 to n-1.
For each number i in this range, the code calculates the value of lst[i], which is the sum of numbers from i+1 to i+n+1.
The code then calculates the value of lst[i+1], which is the sum of numbers from i+1 to k.
The code then calculates the value of lst[i+n+1], which is the sum of numbers from i+n+1 to k.
The code then calculates the value of lst[i], which is the sum of lst[i+1] and lst[i+n+1].
The code then calculates the value of lst[i] modulo mod.
The code then prints the value of lst[0]-lst[1] modulo mod.
The code then returns.

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 1 50
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
