The variable n is initialized to 8.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the number of times the variable tmp is multiplied by 3.
The variable tmp is initialized to 1.
The code enters a loop that iterates while n is greater than tmp.
The variable tmp is multiplied by 3 and the variable ans is incremented by 1.
The code checks if n is greater than tmp. If it is, the loop continues. If it is not, the loop terminates.
The code prints the final value of ans, which is 3.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
n = int(input())

ans = 0
tmp = 1
while n > tmp:
    tmp *= 3
    ans+=1
print(ans)

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
