The variable A and variable B are initialized to 5 and 4, respectively.
The code checks if A is less than 9 and B is less than 9.
If both conditions are met, it prints "Yay!".
If either condition is not met, it prints ":(".

Consider the following code:
<Code>
A, B = list(map(int, input().split()))

if A < 9 and B < 9:
    print('Yay!')
else:
    print(':(')
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
