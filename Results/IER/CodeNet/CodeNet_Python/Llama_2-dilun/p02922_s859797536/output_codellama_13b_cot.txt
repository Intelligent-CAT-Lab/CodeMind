The variable A and variable B are initialized to 4 and 10, respectively.
The code calculates the quotient q and the remainder mod of B divided by A-1.
The code then checks if A is 2. If it is, it prints the value of B-1 and exits the program.
If A is not 2, the code checks if the remainder mod is greater than 1. If it is, it prints the value of q+1. Otherwise, it prints the value of q.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
A, B = map(int, input().split())
q, mod = divmod(B, A-1)
if A == 2:
    print(B-1)
    exit(0)
if mod > 1:
    print(q+1)
else:
    print(q)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4 10
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
