The variable N, variable X and variable M are initialized to 6, 2 and 1001, respectively.
The variable List is initialized to [2] and the variable X is initialized to 2.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to N-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 5.
For each number i in this range, the variable X is squared and the remainder is calculated by dividing it by M.
If the remainder is equal to the value of X in the List, the code breaks out of the loop.
If the remainder is not equal to the value of X in the List, the variable X is added to the List.
After the loop finishes, the code calculates the sum of the values in the List and prints it.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
N,X,M = map(int,input().split())

List = [X]

for i in range(N-1):
    X = X**2 % M
    if X in List:
        #配列の何番目か
        num = i + 1
        #同じ数字
        key = List.index(X)
        break
    List.append(X)

ans = sum(List)
if len(List) == N:
    print(ans)

else:
    loop = (N - len(List)) // (num - key)
    add = (N - len(List)) % (num - key)

    ans += (N - len(List)) // (num - key) * sum(List[key:num])
    ans += sum(List[key:key+((N - len(List)) % (num - key))])

    print(ans)

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```6 2 1001
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
