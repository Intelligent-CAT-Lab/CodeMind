The variable n is initialized to 20.
The variable N is initialized to 20//15, which is 1.
The code prints the output 800*20-200*1, which is 1500.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
n = int(input())
N = n//15
print(800*n-200*N)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
