The code first reads the input string s from the user.
It then calculates the length of the string l.
It then creates a dictionary alpha2 that maps each character in the alphabet to its index.
It then creates a list memo of lists, where each list memo[i] stores the indices of all the occurrences of the character i in the input string s.
It then calculates the modulo of 10^9+7, which is 1000000007.
It then iterates through the input string s and stores the indices of all the occurrences of each character in the list memo.
It then creates a 2D array dp of lists, where each list dp[i][j] stores the number of ways to get from the beginning of the string to the index j, using only the characters in the range [i, j).
It then initializes the first row of dp to 1, which is the number of ways to get from the beginning of the string to the end of the string.
It then iterates through the rows of dp and calculates the number of ways to get from the beginning of the string to the index j, using only the characters in the range [i, j).
It then calculates the sum of the number of ways to get from the beginning of the string to the index j, using only the characters in the range [i, j) for each j in the range [i+1, l+1).
It then calculates the number of ways to get from the beginning of the string to the index j, using only the characters in the range [i, j) for each j in the range [i+1, l+1).
It then calculates the sum of the number of ways to get from the beginning of the string to the index j, using only the characters in the range [i, j) for each j in the range [i+1, l+1).
It then calculates the number of ways to get from the beginning of the string to the index j, using only the characters in the range [i, j) for each j in the range [i+1, l+1).
