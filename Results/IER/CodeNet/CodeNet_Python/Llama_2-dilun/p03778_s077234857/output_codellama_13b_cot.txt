The variable W, variable a and variable b are initialized to 3, 2 and 6, respectively.
The code checks if W is within the range [0, 100000], which is true.
The code checks if a is within the range [0, 100000], which is true.
The code checks if b is within the range [0, 100000], which is true.

The code then calculates the value of move, which is 0.

The code prints the value of move, which is 0.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import sys
W,a,b = map(int,input().split())
if W < 0 or W > 100000:
    sys.exit()
if a < 0 or a > 100000:
    sys.exit()
if b < 0 or b > 100000:
    sys.exit()

move = 0
if W + a < b:
    move = b - (W + a)
if W + a > b and W + a < W + b:
    move = 0
if a > b and a < W + b:
    move = 0
if a > W + b and W + a > W + b:
    move = a - (W + b)
print(move)

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 2 6
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
