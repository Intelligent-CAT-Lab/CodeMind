The variables A, B, H and M are initialized to 3, 4, 9 and 0, respectively.
The code calculates the height h of the triangle as 30*H+M/2, which is 30*9+0/2 = 27.
The code calculates the base m of the triangle as 6*M, which is 6*0 = 0.
The code calculates the absolute value of the difference between the height and the base, which is abs(27-0) = 27.
The code calculates the x-coordinate of the vertex of the triangle as A*A+B*B-2*A*B*(math.cos(math.radians(27))) = 3*3+4*4-2*3*4*(math.cos(math.radians(27))) = 24-2*3*4*math.cos(math.radians(27)) = 24-2*3*4*math.cos(math.radians(27)).
