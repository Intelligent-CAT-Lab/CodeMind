The variable n, variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized to 6, 3, 2 and 1, respectively.
The code then prints the value of n-(c+a-c+b-c), which is 6-(1+3-1+2-1), which is 6-4, which is 2.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
n, a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
print(n-(c+a-c+b-c))

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```6 3 2 1
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
