The variable k is initialized to 3.
The code then calls the ceil() function of the math module, which returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to the input.
The code then multiplies the result of the ceil() function by the input divided by 2.
The code then prints the result.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import math
k=int(input())
print(math.ceil(k/2)*(k//2))
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
