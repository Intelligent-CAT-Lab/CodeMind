The variable a and variable b are initialized to 4 and 3, respectively.
The code checks if a is less than or equal to b. If it is, it prints the string a repeated b times.
If it is not, it prints the string b repeated a times.
In this case, a is less than b, so the code prints the string 4 repeated 3 times, which is 444.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b=map(int,input().split())
if a<=b:
    print(str(a)*b)
else:
    print(str(b)*a)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
