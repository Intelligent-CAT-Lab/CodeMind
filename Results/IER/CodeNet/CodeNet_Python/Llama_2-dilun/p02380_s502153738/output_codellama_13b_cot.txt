The variables a, b and C are initialized to 4, 3 and 90, respectively.
The code then converts the value of C from degrees to radians by multiplying it by pi and dividing it by 180.
The code then uses the law of cosines to calculate the value of c.
The code then calculates the value of height by multiplying the value of b by the sine of C.
The code then calculates the value of size by multiplying the value of a by the value of height and dividing it by 2.
The code then calculates the value of length by adding the values of a, b and c.
The code then prints the values of size, length and height.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
from math import sqrt, sin, cos, pi

a, b, C = map(float, input().split())

#度からラジアンへ変換する
C = (C * pi) / 180

#余弦定理を使って計算する
c = sqrt(a**2 + b**2 - 2*a*b*cos(C))
height = b * sin(C)
size = a * height * (1/2)
length = a + b + c

#出力する
print('{:.8f}'.format(size))
print('{:.8f}'.format(length))
print('{:.8f}'.format(height))

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4 3 90
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
