The variable N, variable X and variable D are initialized to 3, 4 and 2, respectively.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the answer.
The code checks if X and D are both 0. If they are, it sets ans to 1.
If X is 0, it sets ans to N**2-N*(N+1)//2+1.
If D is 0, it sets ans to (N+1).
If both X and D are not 0, it checks if D is less than 0. If it is, it sets X to -X and D to -D.
It then calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of abs(X) and abs(D). It sets X to abs(X)//gcd and D to abs(D)//gcd.
It initializes a dictionary LR with default value of list. It sets LR[0] to [(0, 0)].
It iterates from 1 to N+1. For each number i, it calculates Li, the sum of i**2 and i*(i+1)//2, and Ri, the sum of i**2 and i*(i+1)//2.
It sets LR[(i*X)%D] to [(Li+i*X//D, Ri+i*X//D)].
It iterates over the values in LR. For each value V, it sorts the list V and sets lp, the minimum value, and rp, the maximum value.
It iterates over the list V. For each pair (l, r), it checks if rp is less than l. If it is, it sets lp to l and rp to r. Otherwise, it sets rp to the maximum of r and rp.
It sets ans to the sum of rp-lp+1.
It prints the final value of ans, which is 10.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import sys
readline = sys.stdin.readline
from collections import defaultdict

def gcd(x, y):
    if y == 0:
        return x
    else:
        return gcd(y, x % y)

N, X, D = map(int, readline().split())

ans = 0
if X == D == 0:
    ans = 1
elif X == 0:
    ans = N**2-N*(N+1)//2+1
elif D == 0:
    ans = (N+1)
else:
    if D < 0:
        X = -X
        D = -D
    g = gcd(abs(X), abs(D))
    X //= g
    D //= g
    
    LR = defaultdict(list)
    LR[0].append((0, 0))
    for i in range(1, N+1):
        Li, Ri = (i-1)*i//2, i*N - i*(i+1)//2
        LR[(i*X)%D].append((Li+i*X//D, Ri+i*X//D))
    
    for V in LR.values():
        V.sort()
        lp, rp = (0, 0)
        for l, r in V[1:]:
            if rp < l:
                ans = (ans + rp-lp+1)
                lp, rp = l, r
            else:
                rp = max(r, rp)
        ans = (ans + rp-lp+1)
