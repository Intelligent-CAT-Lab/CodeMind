The code first reads the input string s and stores it in variable n.
It then calculates the number of occurrences of each character in s using Counter.
It then checks if the number of 1s in the string is even or odd.
If it is even, it prints -1 and exits.
If it is odd, it checks if the number of 1s is odd.
If it is odd, it prints -1 and exits.
If it is even, it checks if the number of 1s is even.
If it is even, it prints -1 and exits.
If it is odd, it prints the answer.

The code then initializes a Bit object with size n+2.
It then iterates over the string s and adds 1 to the Bit object for each character that is 1.
It then calculates the sum of the Bit object for each character that is 1.
It then calculates the sum of the Bit object for each character that is 0.
It then calculates the difference between the sum of the Bit object for each character that is 1 and the sum of the Bit object for each character that is 0.
It then prints the difference.
