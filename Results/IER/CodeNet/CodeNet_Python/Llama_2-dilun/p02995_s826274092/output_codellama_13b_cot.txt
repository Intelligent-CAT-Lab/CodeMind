The variable A, B, C and D are initialized to 4, 9, 2 and 3, respectively.
The function gcd(x, y) calculates the greatest common divisor of x and y.
The variable CD is initialized to C * D // gcd(C, D), which is 18 // 6 = 3.
The variable a is initialized to A - (A // C + A // D - A // CD), which is 4 - (4 // 2 + 4 // 3 - 4 // 3) = 4 - 4 = 0.
The variable b is initialized to B - (B // C + B // D - B // CD), which is 9 - (9 // 2 + 9 // 3 - 9 // 3) = 9 - 9 = 0.
The code then prints the difference between b and a, which is 0 - 0 = 0.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def gcd(x,y):
	x, y = max(x,y), min(x,y)
	while(y):
		x, y = y, x%y
	return x
A,B,C,D = map(int,input().split())
A -= 1
CD = C*D // gcd(C,D)
a = A - (A//C + A//D - A//CD)
b = B - (B//C + B//D - B//CD)
print(b-a)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4 9 2 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
