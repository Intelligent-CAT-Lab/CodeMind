The variable n is initialized to the length of the input string s.
The variable cnt is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of Bs in the input string.
The variable total is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of the number of Bs in the input string.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider each character in the input string.
If the current character is B, it will increase the value of cnt by 1. Otherwise, it will increase the value of total by cnt.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of total, which is 10.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
#AGC029A https://atcoder.jp/contests/agc029/tasks/agc029_a
import sys
#import collections

#n= int(input())
#s= input()
#tmp = input().split()
#n,m = list(map(lambda a: int(a), tmp))
s= input()

n=len(s)

cnt=0
total=0
for i in range(0,n):
	if(s[i]=="B"):
		cnt+=1
	else:
		total+=cnt
print(total)

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```BBW
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
