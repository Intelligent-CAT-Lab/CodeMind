The variable n, variable x and variable m are initialized to 6, 2 and 1001, respectively.
The variable arr is initialized to [x] and the variable s is initialized to set([x]).
The variable h is initialized to -1 and the variable r is initialized to 0.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 5.
For each number i in this range, the code calculates the square of the current number i and stores it in val.
If val is not in s, it adds the current number i to arr and adds val to s.
If val is in s, it breaks the loop and sets h to i and r to val.
After the loop finishes, the code calculates the sum of arr and prints it.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
n, x, m = map(int, input().split())

arr = [x]
s = set()
s.add(x)
h = -1
r = 0
for i in range(n - 1):
	val = arr[-1]**2 % m
	if val not in s:
		arr += [arr[-1]**2 % m]
		s.add(arr[-1])
	else:
		h = i
		r = val
		break


res = sum(arr)
if h!= -1:
	new_arr = arr[arr.index(r):]
	rest = n - (h + 1)
	c = len(new_arr)
	q = rest // c
	ssum = sum(new_arr) * q
	r = rest % c
	for i in range(r):
		ssum += new_arr[i]
	res += ssum	
	
print(res)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```6 2 1001
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
