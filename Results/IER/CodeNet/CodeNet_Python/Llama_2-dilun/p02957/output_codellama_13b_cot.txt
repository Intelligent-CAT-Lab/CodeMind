The variable A and variable B are initialized to 2 and 16, respectively.
The code calculates the square of A and B, and subtracts the square of B from the square of A.
The result is divided by 2*(A-B), which is 2*(2-16) = -12.
The code then checks if the result is an integer. If it is, it prints the result. If it is not, it prints "IMPOSSIBLE".
The result is 0.5, which is an integer, so the code prints 0.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
A,B=map(int,input().split())
x=(A**2-B**2)/(2*(A-B))
if x%1==0:
    print(int(x))
else:
    print('IMPOSSIBLE')
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 16
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
