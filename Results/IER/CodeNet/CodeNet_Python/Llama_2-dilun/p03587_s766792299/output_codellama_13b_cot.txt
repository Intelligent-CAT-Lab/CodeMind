The variable S is initialized to the input string "111100".
The code then prints the number of times the character '1' appears in the input string.
The output is 4.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
S = input()
print(S.count('1'))
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```111100
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
