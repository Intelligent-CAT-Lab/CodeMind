The variable s is initialized to the input string ABA.
The code then checks if the first, second and third characters of s are the same.
If they are, it prints "No".
Otherwise, it prints "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes

Consider the following code:
<Code>
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
s = list(input())

if s[0] == s[1] == s[2]:
    print("No")
else:
    print("Yes")


<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```ABA
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
