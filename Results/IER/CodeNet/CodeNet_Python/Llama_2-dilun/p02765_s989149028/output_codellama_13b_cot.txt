The variable n and variable r are initialized to 2 and 2919, respectively.
The code checks if n is less than 10. If it is, it adds 100 to r and subtracts 10 from n.
The code then prints r.
The output is 2929.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
n, r = map(int, input().split())

if n < 10:
  print(r+100*(10-n))
else:
  print(r)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 2919
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
