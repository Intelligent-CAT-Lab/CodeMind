The code first reads the input from the standard input, which is the keyboard.
The input is a single line containing a single integer, which is 2 in this case.
The code then splits the input into a list using the split() method of the string object.
The first element of the list is the integer 2.
The code then converts the integer to a float using the int() method.
The code then prints the result of 2 to the power of 3, which is 8.
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import sys
for n in sys.stdin:
	n = int(n.split()[0])
	print(n ** 3)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
