The code first takes the input as a string s.
Then it uses the regular expression r'(m|e)mew(e|w)', which means'm' or 'e' followed by'mew' followed by 'e' or 'w'.
The code then uses the re.sub() function to replace the matched pattern with '\\1\\2', which means the first and second characters of the matched pattern.
The code then checks if the new string is equal to the original string. If it is, the code prints 'Rabbit'.
Otherwise, the code prints 'Cat'.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import re
s=input()
while s!=re.sub(r'(m|e)mew(e|w)','\\1\\2',s):s=re.sub(r'(m|e)mew(e|w)','\\1\\2',s)
print(['Rabbit','Cat'][s=='mew'])
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```mmemewwemeww
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
