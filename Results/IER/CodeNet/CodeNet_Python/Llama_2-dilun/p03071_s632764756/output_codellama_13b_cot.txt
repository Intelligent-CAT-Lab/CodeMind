The variable a and variable b are initialized to 5 and 3, respectively.
The function resolve() is called.
The function resolve() calculates the maximum of 2*a-1, a+b and 2*b-1.
The maximum is 2*a-1, which is 9.
The function resolve() prints 9.
<<<Output>>>
9

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def resolve():
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    print(max(2*a-1, a+b, 2*b-1))
resolve()
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
