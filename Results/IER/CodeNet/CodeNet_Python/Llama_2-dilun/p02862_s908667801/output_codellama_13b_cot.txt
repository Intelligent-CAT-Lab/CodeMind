The variable x and y are initialized to 3 and 3, respectively.
The variable mod is initialized to 10^9 + 7, which is 1000000007.
The variable n is initialized to (x+y)//3, which is 1.
The code checks if (x+y)%3 is 0, which is true in this case.
The variable x is decreased by 1 and the variable y is decreased by 1.
The code checks if x or y is less than 0, which is false in this case.
The code then enters a function called cmb, which calculates the value of ans.
The function cmb takes three parameters: n, r and mod.
n is initialized to x+y, which is 6.
r is initialized to 0, which is the number of times the code will move.
mod is initialized to 10^9 + 7, which is 1000000007.
The function cmb calculates the value of ans by iterating from 2 to 6 (inclusive).
For each number i in this range, it calculates the value of g1[n] and g2[r] and g2[n-r].
The value of g1[n] is calculated by multiplying g1[-1] by i and then dividing the result by mod.
The value of g2[r] is calculated by multiplying g2[-1] by inverse[-1] and then dividing the result by mod.
The value of g2[n-r] is calculated by multiplying g2[-1] by inverse[-1] and then dividing the result by mod.
The function cmb then returns the value of ans, which is 12.
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import math
x, y = map(int, input().split())

mod = 10**9 +7
n = (x+y)//3	# 移動回数

if ((x+y)%3):
	print('0')
	exit()

x -= n
y -= n

if (x<0 or y<0):
	print('0')
	exit()

def cmb(n, r, mod):
    if ( r<0 or r>n ):
        return 0
    r = min(r, n-r)
    return g1[n] * g2[r] * g2[n-r] % mod
 
N = x+y
g1 = [1, 1]
g2 = [1, 1]
inverse = [0, 1]
 
for i in range( 2, N + 1 ):
    g1.append( ( g1[-1] * i ) % mod )
    inverse.append( ( -inverse[mod % i] * (mod//i) ) % mod )
    g2.append( (g2[-1] * inverse[-1]) % mod )
 
ans = cmb(x+y,x,mod)
print(ans)

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
