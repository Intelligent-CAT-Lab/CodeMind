The variable x is initialized to 7.
The variable s is initialized to 0, which will be used to store the quotient of x divided by 11.
The variable cnt is initialized to 0, which will be used to store the final result.
The variable x is divided by 11 and the quotient is stored in s.
The variable cnt is updated to s*2.
The variable x is subtracted by s*11.
The code checks if x is 0. If it is, it does nothing.
If x is less than or equal to 6, the variable cnt is updated to cnt+1.
If x is less than 11, the variable cnt is updated to cnt+2.
If x is not 0, 6 or 11, the code prints 'error'.
The variable cnt is printed.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
x = int(input())

s = x//11

cnt = s*2

x -= s*11

if x == 0:
    pass
elif x <= 6:
    cnt += 1
elif x < 11:
    cnt += 2
else:
    print('error')

print(cnt)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```7
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
