The variable n is initialized to 2.
The variable ans is initialized to 1.
The variable sub is initialized to 1.
The variable sub2 is initialized to 1.
The code enters a loop that iterates n times.
For each iteration, the variable ans is multiplied by 10.
The variable ans is then divided by (10**9+7) and the remainder is stored in ans.
The variable sub is multiplied by 9 and then divided by (10**9+7) and the remainder is stored in sub.
The variable sub2 is multiplied by 8 and then divided by (10**9+7) and the remainder is stored in sub2.
The variable ans is then decreased by 2*sub-sub2.
The final value of ans is printed.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
n=int(input())
ans=1
sub=1
sub2=1
for i in range(n):
    ans*=10
    ans%=(10**9+7)
    sub*=9
    sub%=(10**9+7)
    sub2*=8
    sub2%=(10**9+7)
ans-=2*sub-sub2
print(ans%(10**9+7))

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
