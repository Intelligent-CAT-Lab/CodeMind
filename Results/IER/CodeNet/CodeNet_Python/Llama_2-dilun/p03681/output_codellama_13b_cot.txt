The variable N and variable M are initialized to 2 and 2, respectively.
The variable diff is initialized to N-M, which is 0 in this case.
The code checks if the absolute value of diff is greater than 1. If it is, it prints 0.
Otherwise, it checks if diff is 0. If it is, it prints the product of factorial(N) and factorial(M) multiplied by 2 and divided by MAX.
Otherwise, it prints the product of factorial(N) and factorial(M) divided by MAX.

The product of factorial(N) and factorial(M) is 24.
The product of factorial(N) and factorial(M) divided by MAX is 24.
The product of factorial(N) and factorial(M) multiplied by 2 and divided by MAX is 48.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
from math import factorial
MAX = 10**9+7
N, M = map(int, input().split())
diff = N-M
if abs(diff)>1:
    print(0)
elif diff == 0:
    print(factorial(N)*factorial(M)*2%MAX)
else:
    print(factorial(N)*factorial(M)%MAX)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
