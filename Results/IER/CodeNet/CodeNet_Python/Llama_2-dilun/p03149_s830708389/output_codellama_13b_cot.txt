The variable n is initialized to the list of numbers 1, 7, 9 and 4.
The code calculates the sum of the number of 1s, 9s, 7s and 4s in the list.
The code then checks if the sum is equal to 1.
If it is, the code prints "YES".
If it is not, the code prints "NO".
<<<Output>>>
NO

Consider the following code:
<Code>
n = list(map(int, input().split()))
check = sum(x==1 for x in n) * sum(x==9 for x in n) * sum(x==7 for x in n) * sum(x==4 for x in n)
if check == 1:
  print("YES")
else:
  print("NO")
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 7 9 4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
