<<<Analysis>>>
The variable A and variable B are initialized to 5 and 5, respectively.
The code checks if B is greater than or equal to A. Since B is equal to A, the code prints A, which is 5.
<<<Output>>>
5

Consider the following code:
<Code>
A, B = input().split()
A = int(A)
B = int(B)

if B >= A:
    print(A)
else:
    print(A-1)

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 5
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
