The variable n is initialized to 10.
The variable yes is initialized to True.
The variable primesand10 is initialized to a list containing the prime numbers from 10 to 81.
The code checks if n is less than or equal to 10. If it is, it prints "Yes" and terminates.
Otherwise, it checks if n is less than or equal to 81. If it is, it iterates through the list primesand10 and checks if n is divisible by any of the prime numbers. If it is, it breaks the loop and prints "No". Otherwise, it prints "Yes" and terminates.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
n = int(input())
yes = True
primesand10=[10,11,13,17,19,23,29,31,37,41,43,47,53,59,61,67,71,73,79,83,89,97]
if n <= 10:
  yes = True
elif n <= 81:
  for prime in primesand10:
    if n%prime == 0:
      yes = False
      break
else:
  yes = False

if yes:print("Yes")
else: print("No")

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
