The code first reads the input and stores it in variable n.
The code then initializes a list a with the first element as 0.
The code then iterates from 1 to 50000 and appends the sum of the previous element and the current element to the list a.
The code then reads the input again and stores it in variable n.
The code then uses the bisect module to find the index of n in the list a.
The code then creates a list r with the first element as 1 and the rest elements as 0.
The code then iterates from the index of n to the end of the list a.
For each element ai in this range, the code calculates the sum of the elements in the list r from the index of ai to the end of the list r.
If the sum is less than n, the code swaps the elements at the index of ai and the index of the sum.
The code then checks if the sum is still less than n. If it is, the code swaps the elements at the index of ai and the index of the sum again.
The code continues to swap the elements until the sum is greater than or equal to n.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of r.
