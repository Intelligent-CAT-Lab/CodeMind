The input is 3 and 20.
The code first converts the input to a list, then extracts the first and second elements of the list, which are 3 and 20.
The code then calculates the bit length of the quotient of 20 divided by 3, which is 4.
<<<Output>>>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import math

n = list(map(int,input().split()))
X = n[0]
Y = n[1]

k = (Y//X).bit_length()
print(k)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 20
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
