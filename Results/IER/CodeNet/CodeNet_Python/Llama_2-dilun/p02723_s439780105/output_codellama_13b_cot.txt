The variable s is initialized to "sippuu".
The code checks if the third and fourth characters of s are the same and if the fifth and sixth characters of s are the same.
If they are, the code prints "Yes".
If they are not, the code prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No

Consider the following code:
<Code>
s = input()
if s[2] == s[3] and s[4] == s[5]:
    ans = 'Yes'
else:
    ans = 'No'

print(ans)

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```sippuu
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
