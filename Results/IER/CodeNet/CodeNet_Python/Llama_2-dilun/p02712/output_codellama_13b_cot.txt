The variable N is initialized to 15.
The variable ans is initialized to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 15.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is divisible by 5 or 3. If it is not, it adds i to ans.
The condition is met when i is 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 105.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())

ans = 0
for i in range(1, N + 1):
    if i % 5!= 0 and i % 3!= 0:
        ans += i

print(ans)

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```15
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
