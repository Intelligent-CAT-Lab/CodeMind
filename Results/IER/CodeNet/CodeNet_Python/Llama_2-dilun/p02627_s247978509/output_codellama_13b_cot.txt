The variable x is initialized to the ASCII value of the first character of the input.
The code then checks if x is greater than or equal to 97, which is the ASCII value of 'a'. If it is, it prints 'a'. Otherwise, it prints 'A'.
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
x = ord(input())
if x >= 97:
    print('a')
else:
    print('A')
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```B
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
