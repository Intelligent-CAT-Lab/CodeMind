The variable s is initialized to 3776.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to len(s)-1, meaning it will consider each character in the string s.
For each character i in this range, it checks if the character i+1 is the same as the character i. If it is, it prints "Bad" and exits the program.
After the loop finishes, the code prints "Good".
<<<Output>>>
Bad

Consider the following code:
<Code>
s = input()
for i in range(len(s)-1):
    if s[i] == s[i+1]:
        print("Bad")
        exit()
print("Good")

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3776
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
