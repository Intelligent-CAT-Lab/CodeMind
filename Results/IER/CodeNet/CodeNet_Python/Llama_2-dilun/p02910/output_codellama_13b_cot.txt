The variable s is initialized to "RUDLUDR".
The variable odd is initialized to ["R", "U", "D"].
The variable even is initialized to ["L", "U", "D"].

The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to the length of s (inclusive), which is 10 in this case.
For each index i in this range, it checks if s[i] is not in odd. If it is, it prints "No" and exits the program.

The code then enters another loop that iterates from 1 to the length of s (inclusive), which is 10 in this case.
For each index j in this range, it checks if s[j] is not in even. If it is, it prints "No" and exits the program.

The code finally prints "Yes".

Consider the following code:
<Code>
s = input()
odd = ["R", "U", "D"]
even = ["L", "U", "D"]

for i in range(0,len(s),2):
	if s[i] not in odd:
		print("No")
		exit()
		
for j in range(1,len(s),2):
	if s[j] not in even:
		print("No")
		exit()
		
print("Yes")	
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```RUDLUDR
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
