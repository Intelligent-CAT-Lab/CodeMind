    Consider the following code:
<Code>
a, b, x = map(int, input().split())
print(b // x - (a - 1) // x)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4 8 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
