The variable N, variable A, variable B and variable C are initialized to 1, 25, 25 and 50, respectively.
The variable MOD is initialized to 10 ** 9 + 7.
The variable com is initialized to a Comb object with the following parameters:
- num: 2 * N
- mod: MOD
The variable inv is initialized to an Inv object with the following parameters:
- s: None
- mod: MOD
The variable IL is initialized to an Inv object with the following parameters:
- s: inv
- mod: A + B
The variable IC is initialized to an Inv object with the following parameters:
- s: inv
- mod: 100 - C
The variable PA is initialized to a list of integers with length N + 1.
The variable PB is initialized to a list of integers with length N + 1.
For each number i in the range [1, N + 1], the variable PA[i] is initialized to PA[i - 1] * A % MOD.
For each number i in the range [1, N + 1], the variable PB[i] is initialized to PB[i - 1] * B % MOD.
The variable ans is initialized to 0.
The code then iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 2.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in IL[N + i].
The code checks if IL[N + i] is within the range [A, B], which is [25, 25] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to ans. The condition is met when i is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25.
