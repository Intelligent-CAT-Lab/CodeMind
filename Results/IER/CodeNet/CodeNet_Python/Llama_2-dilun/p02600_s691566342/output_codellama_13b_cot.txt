The variable x is initialized to 725.
The code checks if x is less than or equal to 599. If it is, it sets result to 8.
If x is not less than or equal to 599, the code checks if x is less than or equal to 799. If it is, it sets result to 7.
If x is not less than or equal to 799, the code checks if x is less than or equal to 999. If it is, it sets result to 6.
If x is not less than or equal to 999, the code checks if x is less than or equal to 1199. If it is, it sets result to 5.
If x is not less than or equal to 1199, the code checks if x is less than or equal to 1399. If it is, it sets result to 4.
If x is not less than or equal to 1399, the code checks if x is less than or equal to 1599. If it is, it sets result to 3.
If x is not less than or equal to 1599, the code checks if x is less than or equal to 1799. If it is, it sets result to 2.
If x is not less than or equal to 1799, the code sets result to 1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of result, which is 3.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
x = int(input())
result = 0

if x <= 599:
    result = 8
elif x <= 799:
    result = 7
elif x <= 999:
    result = 6
elif x <= 1199:
    result = 5
elif x <= 1399:
    result = 4
elif x <= 1599:
    result = 3
elif x <= 1799:
    result = 2
else:
    result = 1

print(result)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1000
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
