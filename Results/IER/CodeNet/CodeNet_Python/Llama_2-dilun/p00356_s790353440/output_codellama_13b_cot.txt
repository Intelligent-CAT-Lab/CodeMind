The code first imports the math module.
The function intersection takes two integers x and y as input and returns their greatest common divisor (gcd).
If gcd is 1, it returns x + y. Otherwise, it returns the product of the gcd of x and y and the gcd of x and y divided by the gcd minus 1.
The code then prints the output of the function intersection, which is 10.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import math
def intersection(x,y):
    g = math.gcd(x, y)
    if g == 1:
        return x + y
    return intersection(x//g, y//g) * g - (g-1)
print(intersection(*map(int, input().split())))

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4 4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
