The code first reads the input from the standard input.
The input is "RRS".
The code then checks if the input is "RRR". If it is, it prints 3.
If it is not, it checks if "RR" is in the input. If it is, it prints 2.
If it is not, it checks if "R" is in the input. If it is, it prints 1.
If it is not, it prints 0.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import sys

readline = sys.stdin.readline
MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7
INF = float('INF')
sys.setrecursionlimit(10 ** 5)


def main():
    s = input()

    if s == "RRR":
        print(3)
    elif "RR" in s:
        print(2)
    elif "R" in s:
        print(1)
    else:
        print(0)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```RRS
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
