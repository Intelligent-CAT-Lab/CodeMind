The input is 36.
The code first converts the input to a list of integers.
The list is then reversed and the last element is set to 0.
The code then iterates through the list and calculates the sum of the elements.
If the current element is less than 5, the sum is added to the answer.
If the current element is 5 and the next element is less than 5, the sum is added to the answer and the next element is incremented by 1.
The final element is added to the answer.
The output is 10.

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```36
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
