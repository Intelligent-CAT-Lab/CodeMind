The variable N and variable K are initialized to 3 and 5, respectively.
The variable MOD is initialized to 10^9 + 7.

The variable D is initialized to a list of lists. The length of each inner list is K+1.
The first inner list is initialized to [0]*(K+1), which is a list of K+1 zeros.
The first inner list is initialized to [0]*(K+1), which is a list of K+1 zeros.

The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N+1.
For each number n in this range, the code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to K+1.
For each number k in this range, the code calculates the sum of D[n-1][k-1] and k*D[n-1][k].
The sum is then divided by MOD and the remainder is stored in D[n][k].

After the loop finishes, the code prints the sum of D[N], which is 100.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, K = map(int, input().split())
MOD = 10**9 + 7

D = [[0]*(K+1) for i in range(N+1)]
D[0][0] = 1

# nはn個のボールをいれるのを1から順番に考える
for n in range(1, N+1):
    D0 = D[n-1]
    # kはkこの箱にnこれいた場合の数
    for k in range(1, K+1):
        # 前回D[n-1][k-1]はk-1個の箱にn-1個入れてるので、それにn個めを新しい箱に入れるとD0[k-1]を足すことになる
        # 前回D[n-1][k-1]はk-1個の箱にn-1個入れてて、それぞれにn個めを1個足してくとそのパターンはk*D0[k]個ある
        # 頭ヨ
        D[n][k] = (D0[k-1] + k * D0[k]) % MOD
print(sum(D[N]) % MOD)

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 5
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
