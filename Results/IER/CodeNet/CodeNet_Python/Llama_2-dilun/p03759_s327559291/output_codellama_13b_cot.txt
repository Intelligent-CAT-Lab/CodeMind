The variable a, b and c are initialized to 2, 4 and 6, respectively.
The code then prints the output of the code, which is "NO".

Consider the following code:
<Code>
a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
print("YES" if b - a == c - b else "NO")
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 4 6
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
