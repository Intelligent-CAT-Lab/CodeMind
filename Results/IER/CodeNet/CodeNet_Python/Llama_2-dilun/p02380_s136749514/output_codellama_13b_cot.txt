The variable A, variable B and variable DEGREE are initialized to 4, 3 and 90, respectively.
The variable rad is initialized to math.radians(DEGREE), which is 0.154794309.
The variable S is initialized to A*B*math.sin(rad)/2.0, which is 0.000000000.
The variable C is initialized to math.sqrt(A*A+B*B-2*A*B*math.cos(rad)), which is 0.000000000.
The variable h is initialized to 2*S/A, which is 0.000000000.
The code prints the following output:
```0.000000000 0.000000000 0.000000000```

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
from math import sqrt
 
A,B,C,D = map(int,input().split())
 
if A*B*C*D == 0:
    print("0")
else:
    print("1")

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 2 3 4```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The variable A, variable B, variable C and variable D are initialized to 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively.
The code checks if A*B*C*D is equal to 0. If it is, it prints "0". Otherwise, it prints "1".
The condition is met when A*B*C*D is equal to 0, which is when A, B, C and D are all 0.
The code prints "0".
