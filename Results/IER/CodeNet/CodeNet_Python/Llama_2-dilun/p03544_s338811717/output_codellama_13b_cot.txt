The variable n is initialized to 5.
The variable a is initialized to [2, 1].
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 4.
For each number i in this range, it appends the sum of the last two elements of a to a.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the last element of a, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
n=int(input())
a=[2,1]
for i in range(n-1):
    a.append(a[len(a)-2]+a[len(a)-1])
print(a[len(a)-1])
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
