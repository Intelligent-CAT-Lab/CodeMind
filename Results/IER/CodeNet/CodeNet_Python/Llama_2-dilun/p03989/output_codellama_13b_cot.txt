The variable n and variable k are initialized to 3 and 1, respectively.
The variable mod is initialized to 924844033.
The variable rng is initialized to 2010.
The variable fctr is initialized to [1].
The variable finv is initialized to [1].
For each value of i in the range [1, rng], the variable fctr is updated by appending the value fctr[-1] * i % mod to it.
For each value of i in the range [1, rng], the variable finv is updated by appending the value pow(fctr[i], mod - 2, mod) to it.
The function cmb is called with the parameters n and k.
If the condition (n - k) * 2 <= n is met, the variable x is initialized to (n - k) * 2.
The variable ans is initialized to 0.
For each value of i in the range [x + 1], if i % 2 == 0, the variable ans is updated by adding cmb(x, i) * fctr[n - i] to it.
Otherwise, the variable ans is updated by subtracting cmb(x, i) * fctr[n - i] from it.
The variable ans is updated by modulo-ing it by mod.
The function cmb is called with the parameters n and k.
If the condition (n - k) * 2 <= n is met, the variable x is initialized to (n - k) * 2.
