The variable N is initialized to 3.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 100000 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 100000.
For each number k in this range, the code checks if 2 * N == k * (k - 1). If it is, it sets can_be_ans to True and breaks out of the loop.
If the condition is not met, the code checks if 2 * N < k * (k - 1). If it is, it breaks out of the loop.
If the condition is not met, the code prints "No".
If the condition is met, the code prints "Yes" and prints k.
The code then initializes a 2D array s_grid to all zeros.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to k + 1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 3.
For each number i in this range, the code enters a nested loop that iterates from 1 to k - i (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 2.
For each number j in this range, the code sets s_grid[i - 1][i - 1 + j] to (i - 1) * k - i * (i - 1) // 2 + 1 + j.
For each number j in this range, the code sets s_grid[i + j][i - 1] to (i - 1) * k - i * (i - 1) // 2 + 1 + j.
The code then prints k - 1 and prints " ".join(map(str, row)) for each row in s_grid.
The output is:
