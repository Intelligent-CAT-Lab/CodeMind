The variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized to 2, 2 and 0, respectively.
The variable L is initialized to a list of lists, where each inner list contains a single element.
The first inner list is initialized to [0], the second inner list is initialized to [1] and the third inner list is initialized to [2].
The code then enters a loop that iterates until the length of L is greater than 1.
In each iteration, the code adds the first element of L to the first element of L and removes the first element of L.
The code then sorts the remaining elements of L.
The code then prints the first element of L, which is 'a' in this case.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b,c = map(int,input().split())

L = [[0] for _ in range(a)] + [[1] for _ in range(b)] + [[2] for _ in range(c)]
while len(L) > 1:
  L[0] += L.pop()
  L.sort()
print(''.join(('a','b','c')[i] for i in L[0]))
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 2 0
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
