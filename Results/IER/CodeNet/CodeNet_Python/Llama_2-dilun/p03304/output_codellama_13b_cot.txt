The variable n, variable m and variable d are initialized to 2, 3 and 1, respectively.
The code checks if d is positive, which is true in this case.
The code then calculates 2*(n-d)*(m-1)/n**2, which is 2*(2-1)*(3-1)/2**2, which is 2*1*2/4, which is 1.
The code then prints 1.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
n,m,d=map(int,input().split())
if d>0:
  print(2*(n-d)*(m-1)/n**2)
else:
  print((m-1)/n)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 3 1
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
