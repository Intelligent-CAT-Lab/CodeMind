The code first reads the input string S from stdin.
The code then converts the input string to a list of integers.
The code then checks if the list is a permutation of itself.
If it is, it prints 1 and exits.

The code then calls the function solve_naive, which is a naive solution to the problem.
The function iterates over all possible permutations of the input string and counts the number of permutations that are not a permutation of itself.
The function returns the number of such permutations.

The code then checks if the length of the input string is less than 6.
If it is, it prints the number of permutations that are not a permutation of itself.
