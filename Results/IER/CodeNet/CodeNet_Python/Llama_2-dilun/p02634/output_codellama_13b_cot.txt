The variable a, b, c and d are initialized to 1, 1, 2 and 2, respectively.
The variable mod is initialized to 998244353.
The variable dp is initialized to a list of lists, where each inner list is initialized to a list of zeros.
The inner list of dp[a][b] is initialized to 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from a to c+1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 3.
For each number i in this range, the code enters another loop that iterates from b to d+1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 3.
In this loop, the code calculates the value of dp[i][j] by multiplying dp[i][j] by j and then subtracting dp[i][j] by dp[i][j] by i*j.
The code then prints the value of dp[c][d], which is 1.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b,c,d=map(int,input().split())
mod=998244353
dp=[(d+2)*[0]for _ in range(c+2)]
dp[a][b]=1
for i in range(a,c+1):
    for j in range(b,d+1):
        dp[i][j]%=mod
        dp[i+1][j]+=dp[i][j]*j
        dp[i][j+1]+=dp[i][j]*i
        dp[i+1][j+1]-=dp[i][j]*i*j
print(dp[c][d])

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 1 2 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
