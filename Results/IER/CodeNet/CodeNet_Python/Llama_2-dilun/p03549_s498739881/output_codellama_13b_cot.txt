The variable N and variable M are initialized to 1 and 1, respectively.
The code then calculates the value of t, which is 1900*M + 100*(N-M).
The value of t is 1900*1 + 100*(1-1), which is 1900.
The code then calculates the value of p, which is 2**M.
The value of p is 2**1, which is 2.
The code then calculates the final value of the expression, which is 1900*2.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def main():
    N, M = (int(i) for i in input().split())
    t = 1900*M + 100*(N-M)
    p = 2**M
    print(t*p)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 1
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
