The variable n and m are initialized to 2 and 3, respectively.
The code then prints the output of the following expression:
1/(1/n+1/m)
The output is 1/2.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def main():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    print(1/(1/n+1/m))


main()

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
