The input is 6.
The code initializes a list of lists, edge, to store the edges of the graph.
The code then initializes the list of edges for the first 5 nodes.
The code then initializes the distance list, dist, to store the distances from the first node to the other nodes.
The code initializes the check list to false to indicate that the distance list has not been calculated for each node.
The code initializes the priority queue, pq, to store the nodes in order of increasing distance.
The code calculates the distance from the first node to the second node, which is 0.
The code adds the pair (0, 1) to the priority queue.
The code iterates through the priority queue until it finds a node that has not been checked.
The code calculates the distance from the second node to the third node, which is 1.
The code adds the pair (1, 2) to the priority queue.
The code iterates through the priority queue until it finds a node that has not been checked.
