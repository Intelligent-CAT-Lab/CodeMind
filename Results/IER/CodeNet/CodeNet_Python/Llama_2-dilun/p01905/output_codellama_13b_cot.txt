The variable N and variable M are initialized to 2 and 0, respectively.
The variable a is initialized to an empty list.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to M (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 0.
For each number i in this range, it appends the number to the list a.
The variable num is initialized to N - M, which is 2 - 0, which is 2.
The variable ans is initialized to 0.
The code enters a while loop that iterates while num is not 0.
The code adds 1 to ans and subtracts 1 from num.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 1.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, M = map(int, input().split())
a = []
for i in range(M):
    a.append(int(input()))
num = N - M
ans = 0
while(num):
    ans += 1
    num -= 1
print(ans - 1)

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 0
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
