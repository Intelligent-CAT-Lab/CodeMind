The variable n is initialized to 123456789.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the characters of n.
For each character, it calculates the sum of the digits and stores it in tmp.
The code then checks if tmp is 0, which is the case when the sum of digits is 0.
If it is, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No

Consider the following code:
<Code>
n = input()
tmp = 0
for i in range(len(n)):
  tmp = (tmp + int(n[i])) % 9

print("Yes") if tmp == 0 else print("No")
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```123456789
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
