The variable s is initialized to the string "bac".
The code then sorts the string and joins the sorted string into a single string.
The code then checks if the sorted string is "abc".
Since the sorted string is "bac", the condition is not met and the code prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
s=input()
if "".join(sorted(s))=="abc":
  print("Yes")
else:
  print("No")
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```bac
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
