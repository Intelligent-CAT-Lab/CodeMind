<<<Analysis>>>
The variable a and variable b are initialized to 2 and 900, respectively.
The code checks if 500 * a is greater than or equal to b.
Since 500 * 2 is 1000, which is greater than 900, the condition is met and the code prints 'Yes'.
<<<Output>>>
Yes

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
a, b = map(int, input().split())

if 500 * a >= b:
  print('Yes')
else:
  print('No')
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 900
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
