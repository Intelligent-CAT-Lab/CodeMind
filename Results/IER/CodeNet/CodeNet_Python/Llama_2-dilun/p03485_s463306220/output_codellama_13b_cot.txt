The variable a and variable b are initialized to 1 and 3, respectively.
The code calculates the mean of a and b, which is 2.
The code then uses the ceil() function to round the mean to the nearest integer, which is 2.
The code then prints the result, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import math

a, b = map(int, input().split())
mean = (a+b)/2
ans = math.ceil(mean)

print(ans)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
