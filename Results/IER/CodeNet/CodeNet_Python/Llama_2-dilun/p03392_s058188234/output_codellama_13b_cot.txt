<<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the collections module and sets the recursion limit to 10^6.
It then defines a variable MOD, which is 998244353.
It then defines a variable ABC, which is "abc".index.
It then defines a variable S, which is the input string.
It then defines a variable N, which is the length of the input string.

The code then defines a function bruteforce, which takes the input string as an argument.
The function uses a set called used to keep track of the keys that have been used.
It then uses a recursive function dfs to iterate through the input string and check if the key is already used.
If the key is not used, it adds it to the set used.
The function then checks if the key is in the set used.
If it is, it returns.
Otherwise, it swaps the characters at the current index and the next index.
It then calls the recursive function dfs again.

The code then checks if the length of the input string is less than or equal to 3.
If it is, it calls the function bruteforce with the input string as an argument.
Otherwise, it checks if the frequency of the first character, the second character, and the third character is equal to the length of the input string.
If it is, it prints 1.
Otherwise, it initializes a 3x3 matrix P and a 3x3 matrix Q.
It then sets the value of P[0][0][0], P[1][1][0], and P[2][2][0] to 1.
It then iterates through the input string and sets the value of Q[p][q][r] to 0 for each p, q, and r.
It then iterates through the 3x3 matrix P and sets the value of Q[k][(q+k)%3][r | (p == k)] to the value of P[p][q][r] modulo MOD for each k, q, and r.
It then iterates through the 3x3 matrix Q and sets the value of P[p][q][r] to the sum of the values of P[i][r][1] for each i, p, and q.
It then checks if all the characters in the input string are different.
If they are, it adds 1 to the value of P[p][q][r].
It then checks if the value of P[p][q][r] modulo MOD is equal to the value of S[i] for each i.
If it is, it prints the value of P[p][q][r] modulo MOD.

The code then prints the value of P[p][q][r] modulo MOD.
