The variable MOD is initialized to 10 ** 9 + 7.
The variables N and M are initialized to 2 and 6, respectively.
The variable f is initialized to an empty list.
The variable p is initialized to 2.
The code enters a loop that iterates while p * p <= M. This means that the loop will iterate while p is less than or equal to M.
In the loop, the code checks if M is not divisible by p. If it is, p is incremented by 1 and the loop continues.
Otherwise, the code calculates the number of times M is divisible by p and adds it to the list f.
The variable p is then incremented by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if M is not equal to 1. If it is, f is appended with 1.
The variable ans is initialized to 1.
The code enters a loop that iterates over the elements in f.
In the loop, the variable c is initialized to 1.
The code enters a loop that iterates over the range of i.
In the loop, the code checks if M is divisible by p. If it is, c is incremented by 1.
The variable M is then divided by p.
The code checks if the loop has finished. If it has, the loop finishes.
Otherwise, the code checks if M is not equal to 1. If it is, the loop continues.
Otherwise, the code checks if M is divisible by p. If it is, c is incremented by 1.
The variable M is then divided by p.
The code checks if the loop has finished. If it has, the loop finishes.
Otherwise, the code checks if M is not equal to 1. If it is, the loop continues.
Otherwise, the code checks if M is divisible by p. If it is, c is incremented by 1.
The variable M is then divided by p.
The code checks if the loop has finished. If it has, the loop finishes.
Otherwise, the code checks if M is not equal to 1. If it is, the loop continues.
Otherwise, the code checks if M is divisible by p. If it is, c is incremented by 1.
The variable M is then divided by p.
