The variable N, variable K and variable M are initialized to 3, 2 and 1, respectively.
The variable T is initialized to a list of integers, each of which is the difference between the number of divisors of N and the number of divisors of N + 1.
The variable A is initialized to a list of integers, each of which is 1 if the index is less than the sum of the elements in T, and the index of T if the index is greater than or equal to the sum of the elements in T.
The variable dp is initialized to the list A.
The variable dp is then iterated K times, and each time the variable dp is multiplied by the cumulative sum of dp from the end to the beginning, and the result is divided by mod.
