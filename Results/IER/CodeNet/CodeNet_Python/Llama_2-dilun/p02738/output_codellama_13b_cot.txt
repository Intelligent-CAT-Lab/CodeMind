The variable n and variable M are initialized to 1 and 998244353, respectively.
The variable l is initialized to n*3+1, which is 1*3+1 = 4.
The variable d is initialized to zeros((l,n*5),int64), which is a 4x5 array of zeros.
The first element of d is initialized to 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to l (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 4.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the value of d[i] by using the following formula:
d[i] = ((d[i-3]*k+roll(d[k],-1))*j+roll(d[j],1))%M
where k and j are the previous two elements of d, and roll(d[j],1) is the result of rolling d[j] by 1.
The code then prints the sum of the last row of d, which is 1+1+1+1 = 4.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
from numpy import*
n,M=map(int,input().split())
l=n*3+1
d=zeros((l,n*5),int64)
d[0][0]=1
for i in range(1,l):j,k=i-1,i-2;d[i]=((d[i-3]*k+roll(d[k],-1))*j+roll(d[j],1))%M
print(sum(d[-1][:l])%M)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 998244353
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
