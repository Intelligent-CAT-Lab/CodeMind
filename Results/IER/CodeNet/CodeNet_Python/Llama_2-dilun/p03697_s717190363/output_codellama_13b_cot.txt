<<<Analysis>>>
The variable A and variable B are initialized to 6 and 3, respectively.
The code checks if A + B is less than 10. Since A + B is 9, the condition is met.
The code prints 9.
<<<Output>>>
9

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
A,B = map(int,input().split())

if A + B < 10:
	print(A + B)
else:
	print("error")
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```6 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
