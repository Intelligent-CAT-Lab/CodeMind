The variable a and variable b are initialized to 20 and 2, respectively.
The code then prints the product of a and b, which is 400.
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b = map(int, input().split())
print (a * b)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
