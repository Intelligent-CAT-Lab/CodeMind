<<<Analysis>>>
The variable a and variable b are initialized to 5 and 8, respectively.
The code checks if a*b is greater than or equal to 0. If it is, it prints the quotient of a and b.
If it is not, it prints the negative of the quotient of a and b.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b=map(int,input().split() )
if a*b>=0:
    print(a//b)
else:
    print(-(-a//b))

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 8
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
