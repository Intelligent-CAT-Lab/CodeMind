The variables w, h and c are initialized to 10, 20 and 5, respectively.
The code calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of w and h, which is 5 in this case.
The code then calculates the cost of the construction, which is the product of the width and height of the construction divided by the GCD.
The code prints the cost, which is 5 * 20 // 5 = 10.
<<<Output>>>
10

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import math

w, h, c = map(int, input().split())

size = math.gcd(w, h)
cost = w // size * h // size * c
print(cost)

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10 20 5
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
