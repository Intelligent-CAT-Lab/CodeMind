The variable a, b and c are initialized to "rng", "gorilla" and "apple", respectively.
The code checks if the last character of a is the same as the first character of b and the last character of b is the same as the first character of c.
If it is, it prints "YES".
If it is not, it prints "NO".
<<<Output>>>
NO

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b,c=map(str,input().split())
if a[-1]==b[0] and b[-1]==c[0]:
    print("YES")
else:
    print("NO")
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```rng gorilla apple
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
