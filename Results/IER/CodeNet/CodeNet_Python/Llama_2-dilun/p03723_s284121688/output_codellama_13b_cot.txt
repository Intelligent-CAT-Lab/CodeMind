The variable a, b and c are initialized to 4, 12 and 20, respectively.
The variable d is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code enters a while loop that iterates while a, b and c are all even numbers.
The code checks if a, b and c are equal. If they are, it prints -1 and breaks the loop.
Otherwise, it adds 1 to d and calculates the sum of a, b and c.
It then calculates the sum of half of a, half of b and half of c.
It sets a, b and c to the sum of half of a and half of b, half of a and half of c, and half of b and half of c, respectively.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of d, which is 10.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b,c=map(int,input().split())
d=0
while a%2==0 and b%2==0 and c%2==0:
    if a==b==c:
        print(-1)
        break
    d+=1
    ha=a//2
    hb=b//2
    hc=c//2
    a=hb+hc
    b=ha+hc
    c=ha+hb
else:print(d)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4 12 20
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
