The variable n and variable m are initialized to 1 and 6, respectively.
The code then enters a function called resolve().
In the function, the variable cnt is initialized to 0.
The code then checks if 2*n <= m. This is equivalent to checking if 2 <= m/n.
If this condition is met, the code adds n to cnt and subtracts m/2 from m.
This is equivalent to adding n to cnt and subtracting m/4 from m.
The code then adds m/4 to cnt.
If the condition is not met, the code adds m/2 to cnt.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of cnt, which is 3.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import sys


def input(): return sys.stdin.readline().strip()


def solve():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    cnt = 0
    if 2*n <= m:
        cnt += n
        m -= n * 2
        cnt += m // 4
    else:
        cnt += m // 2
    print(cnt)
solve()
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 6
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
