The variable a, b and c are initialized to 1, 3 and 2, respectively.
The code then prints "Yes" if c is greater than or equal to a and less than or equal to b, which is true in this case.
<<<Output>>>
Yes

Consider the following code:
<Code>
a, b, c = map(int, raw_input().split())

print "Yes" if c >= a and c <= b else "No"

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 3 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
