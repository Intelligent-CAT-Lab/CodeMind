The variable K is initialized to 101.
The code checks if K is divisible by 7. If it is, it calculates the value of L as 9 * K // 7, which is 101 * 9 // 7, which is 101 * 1, which is 101.
If K is not divisible by 7, it calculates the value of L as 9 * K, which is 9 * 101, which is 909.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to L (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 101.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the surplus of i modulo L, which is 101 in this case.
If the surplus is 1, it breaks the loop and prints the value of i, which is 101.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 101.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())

for i in range(1, N+1):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        continue
    print(i)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The variable N is initialized to 10.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N+1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 11.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is divisible by 2. If it is, it continues to the next iteration.
If i is not divisible by 2, it prints i.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of i, which is 11.
