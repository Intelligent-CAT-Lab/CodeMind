<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n, variable a and variable b are initialized to 10, 3 and 5, respectively.
The code calculates the minimum of a and b, which is 3.
The code calculates the maximum of a and b, which is 5.
The code calculates the minimum of a+b-n, which is 0.
The code prints the minimum and maximum, which are 3 and 0, respectively.
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
n, a, b = map(int, input().split())

maximum = min(a,b)
minimum = max(0, a+b-n)

print(maximum, minimum)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10 3 5
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
