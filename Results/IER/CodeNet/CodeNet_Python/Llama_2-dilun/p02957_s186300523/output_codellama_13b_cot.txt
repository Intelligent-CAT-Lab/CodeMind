The variable a and variable b are initialized to 2 and 16, respectively.
The variable buf is initialized to a + b, which is 18.
The code then checks if buf is evenly divisible by 2. If it is, it prints the value of buf // 2, which is 9.
If it is not, it prints "IMPOSSIBLE".
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
a, b = map(int, input().split())

buf = a + b

if buf % 2 == 0:
	print(buf // 2)
else:
	print("IMPOSSIBLE")
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 16
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
