The variable a, variable b and variable k are initialized to 8, 12 and 2, respectively.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 100 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 100.
For each number i in this range, it checks if both a and b are divisible by i. If they are, it adds i to the list res.
The code then sorts the list res in descending order and prints the kth element of the list, which is 100.
<<<Output>>>
100

Consider the following code:
<Code>
a, b, k = map(int, input().split())

res = []
for i in range(1, 101):
    if a % i == 0 and b % i == 0:
        res.append(i)

res.sort(reverse=True)
print(res[k-1])

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```8 12 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
