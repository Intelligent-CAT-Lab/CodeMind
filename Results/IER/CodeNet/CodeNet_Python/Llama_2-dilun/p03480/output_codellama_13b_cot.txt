The code takes the input as a string s.
The code then calculates the length of the string s, which is 3 in this case.
The code then iterates from 0 to 2 (inclusive), meaning it will consider the substrings of length 0, 1 and 2.
For each substring, it checks if the substring is equal to the next substring. If it is, it returns the length of the substring.
If the substring is not equal to the next substring, it returns the maximum length of the substring and the next substring.
In this case, the substring of length 0 is equal to the next substring of length 1, so the length of the substring is 1.
The substring of length 1 is not equal to the next substring of length 2, so the length of the substring is 2.
The substring of length 2 is not equal to the next substring of length 0, so the length of the substring is 0.
The code then returns the minimum of the three lengths, which is 1.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
#!/usr/bin/env python3
#ABC83 D

import sys
import math
from bisect import bisect_right as br
from bisect import bisect_left as bl
sys.setrecursionlimit(1000000000)
from heapq import heappush, heappop,heappushpop
from collections import defaultdict
from itertools import accumulate
from collections import Counter
from collections import deque
from operator import itemgetter
from itertools import permutations
mod = 10**9 + 7
inf = float('inf')
def I(): return int(sys.stdin.readline())
def LI(): return list(map(int,sys.stdin.readline().split()))

s = input()
n = len(s)
res = inf
for i in range(n-1):
    if s[i]!= s[i+1]:
        res = min(res,max(n-i-1,i+1))
if res == inf:
    print(n)
else:
    print(res)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```010
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
