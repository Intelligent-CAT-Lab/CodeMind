The variable a, b and c are initialized to 4, 5 and 3, respectively.
The code checks if a is less than b. If it is, it checks if c is less than a. If it is, it prints c and b. If it is not, it checks if b is less than c. If it is, it prints a and c. If it is not, it prints b and a.
If a is not less than b, it checks if c is less than b. If it is, it prints c and a. If it is not, it checks if a is less than c. If it is, it prints b and c. If it is not, it prints b and a.

The code prints 3 5 and 5 3.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
a, b, c = map(int, input().split())

if a < b:
    if c < a:
        print(c, b)
    elif b < c:
        print(a, c)
    else:
        print(a, b)
else:
    if c < b:
        print(c, a)
    elif a < c:
        print(b, c)
    else:
        print(b, a)

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4 5 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
