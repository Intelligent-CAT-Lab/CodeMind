The variables a, b and x are initialized to 2, 2 and 4, respectively.
The code then imports the math module.
The code then calculates the value of h, which is x/a**2.
The code then checks if h is greater than or equal to b/2. If it is, it calculates the value of V, which is 2*((a**2)*b - x)/a**3.
The code then calculates the value of ans, which is the degrees of the atan function applied to V.
The code then prints the value of ans, which is 109.49999999999998.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b,x = map(int,input().split())

import math

# ans =math.degrees(math.atan(a*(b**2)/(2*x)))
h = x/a**2


if h>=b/2:
    V = 2*((a**2)*b - x)/a**3
    ans = math.degrees(math.atan(V))
else:
    V=a*(b**2)/(2*x)
    ans =math.degrees(math.atan(V))

print(ans)

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 2 4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
