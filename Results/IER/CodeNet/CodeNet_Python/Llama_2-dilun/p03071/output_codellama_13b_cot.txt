<<<Analysis>>>
The variable A and variable B are initialized to 5 and 3, respectively.
The code then creates a list with three elements, which are A+B, 2*A-1 and 2*B-1.
The code then prints the maximum element of the list, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10

Consider the following code:
<Code>
A, B = map(int, input().split())

list = [A+B, 2*A-1, 2*B-1]
print(max(list))


<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
