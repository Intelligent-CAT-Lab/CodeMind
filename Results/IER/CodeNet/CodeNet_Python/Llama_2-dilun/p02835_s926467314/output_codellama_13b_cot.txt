The variable A is initialized to a list containing the numbers 5, 7 and 9.
The code then prints the string 'bust' if the sum of the numbers in A is greater than or equal to 22, otherwise it prints the string 'win'.
The sum of the numbers in A is 21, so the code prints 'win'.
<<<Output>>>
win

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
A = list(map(int,input().split()))
print('bust' if sum(A)>=22 else 'win')
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 7 9
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
