The variable a, b and c are initialized to 2, 4 and 6, respectively.
The code checks if b-a==c-b, which is 2-2==6-4, which is 0==2, which is False.
The code then prints "NO".
<<<Output>>>
NO

Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b,c=map(int,input().split())
if b-a==c-b:
  print('YES')
else:
  print('NO')
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 4 6
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
