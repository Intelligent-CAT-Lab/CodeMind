The variable A, B, C and D are initialized to 0, 75, 25 and 100, respectively.
The code checks if the difference between the minimum of B and D and the maximum of A and C is greater than or equal to 0.
If it is, it prints the difference.
If it is not, it prints 0.
In this case, the difference is 0, so the code prints 0.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
A, B, C, D = map(int, input().split())
if min(B, D) - max(A, C) >= 0:
    print(min(B, D) - max(A,C))
else:
    print(0)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```0 75 25 100
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
