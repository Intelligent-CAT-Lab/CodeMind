The variable n is initialized to 3.
The variable a is initialized to 1 and the variable b is initialized to 1.
The variable i is initialized to 0.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 3.
In each iteration, the variable a is set to b and the variable b is set to a+b.
The variable i is incremented by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the value of a, which is 4.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
n=int(input())
a=1
b=1
i=0
while i<n:
    a,b=b,a+b
    i+=1
print(a)

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
