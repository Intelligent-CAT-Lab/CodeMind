The code first reads the input string S, which is "1111".
It then checks if the string is "0" or "1" or its reverse is "1".
If it is, it prints -1 and exits.
Otherwise, it initializes a list edges, which will store the edges of the graph.
It then iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), which is 4 in this case.
For each number i in this range, it checks if S[i] is '1'.
If it is, it sets the base to i + 1.
The base is the number that will be used to calculate the edges.
For each number i in this range, it adds (base, i + 1) to the list edges.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the edges of the graph.
The output is:
```(1, 2)
(2, 3)
(3, 4)
```

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1111
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
