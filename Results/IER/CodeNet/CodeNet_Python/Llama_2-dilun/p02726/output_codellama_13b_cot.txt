The variable n, x and y are initialized to 5, 2 and 4, respectively.
The variable ans is initialized to a list of zeros with length n-1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n-1, meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 4.
For each number i in this range, it enters another loop that iterates from i+1 to n, meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 5.
For each number j in this range, it calculates the absolute difference between j and y, and the absolute difference between i and x, and adds 1 to the result.
It then stores the result in ans[min(a,b)-1], where a is the absolute difference between j and y, and b is the absolute difference between i and x.
The code then prints the final value of ans, which is [0, 1, 1, 2, 2].

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
n,x,y = [int(n) for n in input().split()]


ans = [0] * (n-1)

for i in range(n-1):
    for j in range(i+1,n):
        a=j-i
        b=abs((y-1)-j)+abs(i-(x-1))+1
        ans[min(a,b)-1]+=1
for i in ans:
	print(i)

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 2 4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
