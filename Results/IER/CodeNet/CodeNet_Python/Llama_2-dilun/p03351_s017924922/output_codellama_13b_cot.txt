The variable a, b, c and d are initialized to 4, 7, 9 and 3, respectively.
The code checks if abs(a - c) <= d, which is abs(4 - 9) <= 3. Since abs(4 - 9) = 5, which is greater than 3, the condition is not met.
The code then checks if abs(a - b) <= d and abs(b - c) <= d, which is abs(4 - 7) <= 3 and abs(7 - 9) <= 3. Since abs(4 - 7) = 3, which is less than 3, and abs(7 - 9) = 2, which is less than 3, the condition is met.
Therefore, the output is "Yes".

Consider the following code:
<Code>
a, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())

if abs(a - c) <= d:
  print('Yes')
  
elif abs(a - b) <= d and abs(b - c) <= d:
  print('Yes')
  
else:
  print('No')
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4 7 9 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
