The variable a and variable b are initialized to 3 and 1, respectively.
The code then prints "Yes" if a % 2!= 0 and b % 2!= 0, which is true in this case.
<<<Output>>>
Yes

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
a, b = map(int, input().split())
print("Yes" if a % 2!= 0 and b % 2!= 0 else "No")

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 1
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
