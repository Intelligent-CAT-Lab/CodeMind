The variable S is initialized to the string "ABA".
The code then checks if S is equal to "AAA" or "BBB".
Since it is not, the code prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
S = str(input())

if S == 'AAA' or S == 'BBB':
    print('No')
else:
    print('Yes')
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```ABA
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
