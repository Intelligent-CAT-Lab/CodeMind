The variable N is initialized to 4.
The code checks if N is 1 or 2. If it is, it prints 0.
Otherwise, it checks if N is even. If it is, it prints N//2-1.
Otherwise, it prints N//2.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())
if N == 1 or N == 2:
    print(0)
else:
    if N % 2 == 0:
        print(N//2-1)
    else:
        print(N//2)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
