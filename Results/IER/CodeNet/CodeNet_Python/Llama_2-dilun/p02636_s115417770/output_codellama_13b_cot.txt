The code first initializes the variables n, size and MOD. n is the length of the input string, size is the length of the string divided by 2, and MOD is 998244353.
The code then creates two numpy arrays, dp_can and dp_cnt, which will be used to store the dynamic programming table.
The code then initializes the first row of dp_can to 1, and the first column of dp_cnt to 1.
The code then iterates from n to 1, and for each number i, it calculates the sum of the numbers in the first row of dp_cnt, and stores it in dp_can.
The code then iterates from size to 0, and for each number j, it calculates the sum of the numbers in the first column of dp_cnt, and stores it in dp_can.
The code then iterates from size to 0, and for each number k, it calculates the sum of the numbers in the first row of dp_cnt, and stores it in dp_can.
