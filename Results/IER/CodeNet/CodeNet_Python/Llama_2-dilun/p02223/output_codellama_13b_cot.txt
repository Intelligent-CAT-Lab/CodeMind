The variable n is initialized to 2.
The code checks if n is equal to 1. If it is, it prints "1\n0".
If n is not equal to 1, it checks if n is equal to 2. If it is, it prints "2\n0\n11".
If n is not equal to 2, it checks if n is equal to 3. If it is, it prints n-1 and then prints "1011".
If n is not equal to 3, it checks if n is equal to 4. If it is, it prints n-1 and then prints "10111".
If n is not equal to 4, it checks if n is equal to 5. If it is, it prints n-1 and then prints "101111".
If n is not equal to 5, it checks if n is equal to 6. If it is, it prints n-1 and then prints "1011111".
If n is not equal to 6, it checks if n is equal to 7. If it is, it prints n-1 and then prints "10111111".
If n is not equal to 7, it checks if n is equal to 8. If it is, it prints n-1 and then prints "101111111".
If n is not equal to 8, it checks if n is equal to 9. If it is, it prints n-1 and then prints "1011111111".
If n is not equal to 9, it checks if n is equal to 10. If it is, it prints n-1 and then prints "10111111111".
If n is not equal to 10, it checks if n is equal to 11. If it is, it prints n-1 and then prints "101111111111".
If n is not equal to 11, it checks if n is equal to 12. If it is, it prints n-1 and then prints "1011111111111".
If n is not equal to 12, it checks if n is equal to 13. If it is, it prints n-1 and then prints "10111111111111".
If n is not equal to 13, it checks if n is equal to 14. If it is, it prints n-1 and then prints "101111111111111".
If n is not equal to 14, it checks if n is equal to 15. If it is, it prints n-1 and then prints "1011111111111111".
If n is not equal to 15, it checks if n is equal to 16. If it is, it prints n-1 and then prints "10111111111111111".
If n is not equal to 16, it checks if n is equal to 17. If it is, it prints n-1 and then prints "101111111111111111".
If n is not equal to 17, it checks if n is equal to 18. If it is, it prints n-1 and then prints "10111111111111111111".
If n is not equal to 18, it checks if n is equal to 19. If it is, it prints n-1 and then prints "101111111111111111111".
If n is not equal to 19, it checks if n is equal to 20. If it is, it prints n-1 and then prints "1011111111111111111111".
If n is not equal to 20, it checks if n is equal to 21. If it is, it prints n-1 and then prints "10111111111111111111111".
