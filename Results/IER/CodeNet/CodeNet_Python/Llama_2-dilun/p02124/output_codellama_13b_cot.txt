The variable input() returns the input as a string.
The variable int(input()) returns the input as an integer.
The variable int(int(input()) / 100) returns the input as an integer divided by 100.
The variable int(int(input()) / 100) is then converted to a string by the function str().
The variable "ai1333" is then concatenated with the string returned by the function str().
The variable "3" is then repeated the number of times returned by the function int().
The variable "3" is then concatenated with the string returned by the function str().
