The variable N is initialized to 111.
The variable X is initialized to 0.
The variable P is initialized to 0.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 10 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 10.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the product of i and 111, and stores it in P.
The code checks if X is less than N and N is less than or equal to P. If it is, it prints P. The condition is met when i is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of X, which is 111.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
N=int(input())
X=P=0
for i in range(10) :
  P=i*111
  if X < N and N <= P :
    print(P)
  X=P
    
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```111
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
