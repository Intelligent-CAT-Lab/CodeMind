The code first initializes the stack to an empty list.
Then it iterates through the input string, which is "1 2 +".
For each character in the input, it checks if it is one of the operators "+", "-" or "*".
If it is, it pops the top two elements from the stack and adds them together.
The result is then pushed back onto the stack.
If the character is not one of the operators, it is simply added to the stack.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of the stack, which is "3".

Consider the following code:
<Code>

def func(x):
    if x == 0:
        return 0
    else:
        return x + func(x-1)

print(func(10))

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The code first defines a function called func, which takes an integer x as an argument.
If x is equal to 0, the function returns 0.
Otherwise, it returns x plus the result of calling func with x-1.
The function is then called with x=10, which results in the output 55.
<<<Output>>>
