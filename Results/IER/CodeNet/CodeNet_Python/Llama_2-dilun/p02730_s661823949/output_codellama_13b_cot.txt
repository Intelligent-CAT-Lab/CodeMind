The code checks if the string s is palindrome.
The code checks if the first half of the string is palindrome.
The code checks if the second half of the string is palindrome.
If both halves are palindrome, the string is palindrome.
If the first half is palindrome but the second half is not, the string is not palindrome.
If the first half is not palindrome but the second half is palindrome, the string is not palindrome.
If neither half is palindrome, the string is not palindrome.

The input is "akasaka".
The first half of the string is "akasaka".
The second half of the string is "akasaka".
The first half is palindrome, so the string is palindrome.
<<<Output>>>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def check(s):
    for i  in range(len(s)//2):
        if s[i]!= s[len(s)-i-1]:
            return False
    return True

if __name__ == '__main__':
    s = input()
    if check(s):
        if check(s[0:len(s)//2]):
            if check(s[(len(s)//2)+1:len(s)]):
                print("Yes")
            else:
                print("No")
        else:
            print("No")
    else:
        print("No")

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```akasaka
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
