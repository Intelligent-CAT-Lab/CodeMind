The variable x is initialized to 90.
The variable n is initialized to 1.
The code enters a loop that iterates while 360 * n % x!= 0.
The code increments n by 1 each time the condition is met.
The code prints the final value of n * 360 // x, which is 10.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
x = int(input())
n = 1
while 360 * n % x!= 0:
    n += 1
print(n * 360 // x)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```90
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
