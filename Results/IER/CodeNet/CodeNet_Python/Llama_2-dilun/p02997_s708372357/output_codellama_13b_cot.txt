The variable n and variable k are initialized to 5 and 3, respectively.
The variable edges is initialized to a list of pairs of integers, where the first element of each pair is 1 and the second element is a number from 2 to n.
The variable cnt is initialized to (n-1)*(n-2)//2, which is 5*4//2 = 10.
The variable ans is initialized to n-1, which is 4.
The code checks if cnt is less than k, which is 3 in this case. If it is, it prints -1.
Otherwise, it iterates through all pairs of numbers i and j in the range [2, n] and increments ans by 1 if cnt is greater than k.
It then adds the pair [i, j] to the list edges.
After the loop finishes, the code prints ans, which is 4, and then prints all pairs in the list edges.
The output is:
4
1 2
1 3
1 4
1 5

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
#132_E
n,k=map(int,input().split())
edges=[[1,i] for i in range(2,n+1)]
cnt=(n-1)*(n-2)//2
ans=n-1
if cnt<k:
    print(-1)
else:
    for i in range(2,n):
        for j in range(i+1,n+1):
            if cnt>k:
                cnt-=1
                ans+=1
                edges.append([i,j])
            else:
                break
    print(ans)
    for edge in edges:
        print(*edge)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
