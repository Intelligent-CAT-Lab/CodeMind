The variable a and variable b are initialized to 12 and 4, respectively.
The code then prints the maximum value of 0 and a-2b.
The maximum value is 0, because a-2b is negative.
<<<Output>>>
0

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b=map(int,input().split())
print(max(0,a-2*b))
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```12 4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
