The variable N is initialized to 3.
The code checks if N is even or odd. If it is even, it enters the first branch of the if statement.
In the first branch, it creates an empty list called edge.
Then it iterates from 1 to N + 1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 4.
For each number s in this range, it calculates the number of numbers t such that s >= t or t == N - s + 1.
If the condition is met, it adds the pair (s, t) to the list edge.
The condition is met when s is 1, 2 or 3 and t is 2, 3 or 4.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the length of the list edge, which is 3.
Then it iterates through the list edge and prints each pair (s, t) in the list.

The output is:
```
3
(1, 2)
(2, 3)
(3, 4)
```

Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())

if N % 2 == 0:
    edge = []
    for s in range(1, N + 1):
        ng = N - s + 1
        for t in range(1, N + 1):
            if s >= t or t == ng:
                continue
            edge.append((s, t))
else:
    edge = []
    for s in range(1, N + 1):
        ng = N - s
        for t in range(1, N + 1):
            if s >= t or t == ng:
                continue
            edge.append((s, t))

print(len(edge))
for s, t in edge:
    print(s, t)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
