The variables a and b are initialized to -13 and 3, respectively.
The code checks if a+b>=a-b and a+b>=a*b.
Since a+b>=a-b is true, the code prints a+b.
The code checks if a-b>=a+b and a-b>=a*b.
Since a-b>=a+b is true, the code prints a-b.
The code checks if a*b>=a+b and a*b>=a-b.
Since a*b>=a+b is true, the code prints a*b.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b=map(int,input().split())
if a+b>=a-b and a+b>=a*b:
    print(a+b)
elif a-b>=a+b and a-b>=a*b:
    print(a-b)
else:
    print(a*b)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```-13 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
