The variable a and variable b are initialized to 1 and 3, respectively.
The code then creates a dictionary with keys 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12, and values "a", "c", "a", "b", "a", "b", "a", "a", "b", "a", "b" and "a", respectively.
The code checks if the value of the dictionary at key a is the same as the value of the dictionary at key b. If it is, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
The condition is met when a is 1 and b is 3, which is the case in this example.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b=map(int,input().split())
mydict = {1:"a", 2:"c", 3:"a", 4:"b", 
          5:"a", 6:"b", 7:"a", 8:"a", 9:"b", 10:"a", 11:"b", 12:"a"}
if mydict[a] == mydict[b]:
  print("Yes")
else:
  print("No")
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
