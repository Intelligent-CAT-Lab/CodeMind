The code first reads the input string x^2+3x+2.
It then calculates the length of the input string, which is 10.
The code then initializes a variable cur to 0 and a list P to [0]*6, which is an empty list.
The code then calls the function expr(), which will be explained later.

The function expr() will be called recursively.
The first call of expr() will be made when the condition cur == L is met, which means the input string has been completely read.
The function expr() will then be called recursively until the condition cur == L is met again.

The function expr() will first call the function num(), which will calculate the value of the first term of the input string.
The function num() will then call the function term(), which will calculate the value of the second term of the input string.
The function term() will then call the function num(), which will calculate the value of the third term of the input string.
The function term() will then call the function expr(), which will calculate the value of the fourth term of the input string.
The function expr() will then call the function num(), which will calculate the value of the fifth term of the input string.
The function expr() will then call the function term(), which will calculate the value of the sixth term of the input string.
The function term() will then call the function expr(), which will calculate the value of the seventh term of the input string.
The function expr() will then call the function num(), which will calculate the value of the eighth term of the input string.
The function expr() will then call the function term(), which will calculate the value of the ninth term of the input string.
The function term() will then call the function expr(), which will calculate the value of the tenth term of the input string.
The function expr() will then call the function num(), which will calculate the value of the eleventh term of the input string.
The function expr() will then call the function term(), which will calculate the value of the twelfth term of the input string.
The function term() will then call the function expr(), which will calculate the value of the thirteenth term of the input string.
The function expr() will then call the function num(), which will calculate the value of the fourteenth term of the input string.
The function expr() will then call the function term(), which will calculate the value of the fifteenth term of the input string.
The function term() will then call the function expr(), which will calculate the value of the sixteenth term of the input string.
The function expr() will then call the function num(), which will calculate the value of the seventeenth term of the input string.
The function expr() will then call the function term(), which will calculate the value of the eighteenth term of the input string.
The function term() will then call the function expr(), which will calculate the value of the nineteenth term of the input string.
The function expr() will then call the function num(), which will calculate the value of the twentieth term of the input string.
The function expr() will then call the function term(), which will calculate the value of the twenty-first term of the input string.
The function term() will then call the function expr(), which will calculate the value of the twenty-second term of the input string.
The function expr() will then call the function num(), which will calculate the value of the twenty-third term of the input string.
The function expr() will then call the function term(), which will calculate the value of the twenty-fourth term of the input string.
The function term() will then call the function expr(), which will calculate the value of the twenty-fifth term of the input string.
The function expr() will then call the function num(), which will calculate the value of the twenty-sixth term of the input string.
The function expr() will then call the function term(), which will calculate the value of the twenty-seventh term of the input string.
The function term() will then call the function expr(), which will calculate the value of the twenty-eighth term of the input string.
The function expr() will then call the function num(), which will calculate the value of the twenty-ninth term of the input string.
The function expr() will then call the function term(), which will calculate the value of the thirtieth term of the input string.
The function term() will then call the function expr(), which will calculate the value of the thirty-first term of
