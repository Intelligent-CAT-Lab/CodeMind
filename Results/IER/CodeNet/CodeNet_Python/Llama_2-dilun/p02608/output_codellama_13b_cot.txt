The variable n is initialized to 20.
The variable cnt is initialized to an empty list.
The code then iterates over the range from 1 to 100, and for each number x, it iterates over the range from 1 to 100, and for each number y, it iterates over the range from 1 to 100, and for each number z, it calculates the sum of x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + x*y + y*z + z*x, and if the sum is less than or equal to n, it adds the sum to the list cnt.
The code then iterates over the range from 1 to n, and for each number i, it prints the number of times i appears in the list cnt.

The output is:
```
1
4
9
16
25
36
49
64
81
100
```

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import collections
n=int(input())
cnt=[]
for x in range(1,101):
  for y in range(1,101):
    for z in range(1,101):
      a=x**2+y**2+z**2+x*y+y*z+z*x
      if a<=n:
        cnt.append(a)
c=collections.Counter(cnt)
for i in range(1,n+1):
  print(c[i])
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
