The variable a, b, c and d are initialized to 1, 2, 1 and 1, respectively.
The variable ans is initialized to -1000000000000000000, which is the largest possible integer.
The code then calculates the maximum value of a * c, a * d, b * c and b * d.
The maximum value is 2, which is the product of a and c.
The code then prints the value of ans, which is 2.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
a, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())
ans = -1000000000000000000
ans = max(ans, a * c, a * d, b * c, b * d)
print(ans)

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 2 1 1
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
