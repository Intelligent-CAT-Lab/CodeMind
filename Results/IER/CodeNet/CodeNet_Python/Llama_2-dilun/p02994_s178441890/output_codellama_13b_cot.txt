The variable n and variable l are initialized to 5 and 2, respectively.
The code checks if l is greater than or equal to 0. If it is, it prints the value of l * (n - 1) + (n - 1) * n // 2.
The code checks if l + n - 1 is less than 0. If it is, it prints the value of l * (n - 1) + (n - 1) * n // 2 - (n - 1).
The code checks if l is greater than 0. If it is, it prints the value of l * n + (n - 1) * n // 2.

The code prints the value of l * (n - 1) + (n - 1) * n // 2, which is 10.
The code prints the value of l * (n - 1) + (n - 1) * n // 2 - (n - 1), which is 10.
The code prints the value of l * n + (n - 1) * n // 2, which is 10.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
n, l = map(int, input().split())

if l >= 0:
    print(l * (n - 1) + (n - 1) * n // 2)
elif l + n - 1 < 0:
    print(l * (n - 1) + (n - 1) * n // 2 - (n - 1))
else:
    print(l * n + (n - 1) * n // 2)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
