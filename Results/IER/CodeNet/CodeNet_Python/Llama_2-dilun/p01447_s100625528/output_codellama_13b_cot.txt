The code first imports the math module.
Then it prints the ceiling of the logarithm of the input number divided by the logarithm of 3.
The input number is 8, so the output is 2.
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import math
print(math.ceil(math.log(int(input()))/math.log(3)))
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
