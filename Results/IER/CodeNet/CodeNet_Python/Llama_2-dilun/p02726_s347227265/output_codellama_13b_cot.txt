The variable n, x and y are initialized to 5, 2 and 4, respectively.
The variable D is initialized to a list of zeros, which will be used to store the number of pairs of numbers that are at a distance of 1, 2, 3,..., n-1 from each other.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n-1, meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 4.
For each number i in this range, it enters another loop that iterates from i+1 to n, meaning it will consider numbers from 2 to 5.
For each pair of numbers (i, j), the code calculates the distance between them, which is the absolute value of the difference between i and x, plus the absolute value of the difference between j and y, plus 1.
The code then stores the minimum of these two distances in the variable dist.
The code then increments the value of D[dist] by 1.

After the inner loop finishes, the code prints the value of D[i] for each number i in the range 1 to n-1.

The output is:
1 1 1 1 1
2 1 1 1 1
3 1 1 1 1
4 1 1 1 1
5 1 1 1 1

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
n,x,y = map(int,input().split())
x,y = x-1,y-1

D = [0 for _ in range(n+1)]
    
for i in range(n-1):
    for j in range(i+1,n):
        dist1 = j-i
        dist2 = abs(i-x) +1 + abs(j-y)
        dist = min(dist1,dist2)
        D[dist] = D[dist]+1


    
for i in range(1,n):
    print(D[i])
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 2 4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
