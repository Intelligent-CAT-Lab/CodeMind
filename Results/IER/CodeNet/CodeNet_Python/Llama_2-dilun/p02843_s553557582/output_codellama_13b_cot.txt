The variable n is initialized to 615.
The variable f is initialized to a list of 0s with length n+1.
The first element of f is initialized to 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n+1, meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 616.
For each number x in this range, it enters another loop that iterates from 100 to 106, meaning it will consider numbers from 100 to 106.
If x-i is greater than or equal to 0 and f[x-i] is equal to 1, it sets f[x] to 1.
The condition is met when x is 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105 and 106.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of f[n], which is 1.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
n = int(input())
f = [0]*(n+1)
f[0] = 1
for x in range(1, n+1):
	for i in range(100, 106):
		if x-i >= 0 and f[x-i] == 1:
			f[x] = 1
print(f[n])
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```615
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
