The variable x is initialized to 7.
The variable ans is initialized to (7 // 11) * 2, which is 14.
The variable sub is initialized to 7 % 11, which is 4.
The code checks if sub is greater than or equal to 7. If it is, it adds 2 to ans, which is 16.
The code checks if sub is between 0 and 6. If it is, it adds 1 to ans, which is 17.
The code prints the final value of ans, which is 17.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
x = int(input())

ans = (x // 11) * 2
sub = x % 11
if sub >= 7:
    ans += 2
elif 0 < sub <= 6:
    ans += 1

print(ans)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
