The variables a, b, c and d are initialized to 2, 1, 3 and 4, respectively.
The code then calculates the sum of a+b-c-d, a+c-b-d, a+d-b-c, b+c-a-d, b+d-a-c and c+d-a-b.
The code then prints the minimum of the absolute values of these sums.
The minimum is 1, which is the absolute value of a+d-b-c.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
a, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())
x = [a+b-c-d, a+c-b-d, a+d-b-c, b+c-a-d, b+d-a-c, c+d-a-b]
print(min(map(abs, x)))


<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 1 3 4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
