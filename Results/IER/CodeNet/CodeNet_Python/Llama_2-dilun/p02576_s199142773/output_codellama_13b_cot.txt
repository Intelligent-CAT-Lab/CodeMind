The variable N, variable X and variable T are initialized to 20, 12 and 6, respectively.
The function MI() returns a list of three integers, which are 20, 12 and 6.
The code then checks if N is divisible by X. If it is, it calculates the answer as (N//X+1)*T. If it is not, it calculates the answer as N//X*T.
The answer is 120.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def MI(): return map(int, input().split())
N,X,T=MI()
if N%X!=0:
  ans=(N//X+1)*T
else:
  ans=N//X*T
print(ans)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20 12 6
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
