The variables a, t and r are initialized to 180, 120 and 90, respectively.
The code then calculates the product of t and r, which is 10800.
It then calculates the quotient of the product and a, which is 6.
The code then prints the quotient, which is 6.
<<<Output>>>
6

Consider the following code:
<Code>

a,b,c = [int(i) for i in input().split()]

print(a*b*c)


<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10 20 30
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
