The variable n, a, b, c and d are initialized to 5, 1, 5, 2 and 4, respectively.
The code then calculates the difference between a and b, which is 4.
The code then initializes the list segs to contain one element, which is [[-d * (n - 1), -c * (n - 1)]].
The code then iterates from 1 to n - 1, which means it will iterate 4 times.
For each iteration, it appends a new element to the list segs, which is [[segs[-1][0] + c + d, segs[-1][1] + c + d]].
The code then initializes a boolean variable ok to False.
The code then iterates from 0 to n - 1, which means it will iterate 4 times.
For each iteration, it checks if the current element in the list segs is within the range [b, b + 1].
If it is, it sets ok to True.
If ok is True, the code prints "YES".
If ok is False, the code prints "NO".

After the loop finishes, the code prints "YES".

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
n, a, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())
a, b = 0, b - a
segs = [[-d * (n - 1), -c * (n - 1)]]
for _ in range(n - 1):
	segs.append([segs[-1][0] + c + d, segs[-1][1] + c + d])
ok = False
for i in range(n):
	if segs[i][0] <= b <= segs[i][1]:
		ok = True
if ok:
	print("YES")
else:
	print("NO")
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 1 5 2 4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
