The variable n, variable a and variable b are initialized to 8, 3 and 4, respectively.
The code checks if n is divisible by (a + b). If it is, it prints the result of (n // (a + b)) * a + n % (a + b).
If it is not, it prints the result of (n // (a + b)) * a + a.
The result of (n // (a + b)) * a + n % (a + b) is 12, which is printed.
The result of (n // (a + b)) * a + a is 12, which is printed.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
if n % (a + b) <= a:
    print((n // (a + b)) * a + n % (a + b))
else:
    print((n // (a + b)) * a + a)

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```8 3 4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
