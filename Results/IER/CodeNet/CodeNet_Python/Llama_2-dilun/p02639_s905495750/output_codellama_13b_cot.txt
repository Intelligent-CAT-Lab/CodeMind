The variable x is initialized to a list of integers.
The input is split into a list of strings.
The strings are then converted to integers.
The variable i is initialized to 0.
The code iterates through the list x.
If the value of x[i] is 0, the code prints the value of i+1.
The code iterates through the list x again.
If the value of x[i] is 0, the code prints the value of i+1.
The code iterates through the list x again.
If the value of x[i] is 0, the code prints the value of i+1.
