The variable n and variable m are initialized to 3 and 100, respectively.
The code then creates a list of strings, each of which is initialized to "0".
The code then iterates from n//2 + 1 to n, which is 2 in this case.
For each number i in this range, the code sets the i-th element of the list to str(m).
The code then prints the list as a string.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

n,m = map(int,input().split())

points = ["0"] * n

for i in range(n//2 + 1, n):
    points[i] = str(m)

print(" ".join(points))
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 100
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
