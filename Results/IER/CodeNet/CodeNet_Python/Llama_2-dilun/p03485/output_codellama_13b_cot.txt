The variable a and variable b are initialized to 1 and 3, respectively.
The code calculates the average of a and b, which is 2.
The code then rounds the average to the nearest integer, which is 2.
The code checks if the average is greater than the rounded value, which is false.
The code then prints the rounded value, which is 2.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b=map(int,input().split())
c = (a+b)/2
d = int(c)
if c-d>0:
  print(d+1)
else:
  print(d)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
