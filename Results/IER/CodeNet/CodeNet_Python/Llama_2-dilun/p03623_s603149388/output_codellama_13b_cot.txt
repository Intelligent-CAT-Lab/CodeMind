The variable x, variable a and variable b are initialized to 5, 2 and 7, respectively.
The absolute value of x-a is calculated and stored in variable p.
The absolute value of x-b is calculated and stored in variable q.
If p is less than q, the code prints "A". Otherwise, it prints "B".
<<<Output>>>
A

Consider the following code:
<Code>
x, a, b = map(int,input().split())
p = abs(x-a)
q = abs(x-b)
if p < q:
    print("A")
else:
    print("B")
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 2 7
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
