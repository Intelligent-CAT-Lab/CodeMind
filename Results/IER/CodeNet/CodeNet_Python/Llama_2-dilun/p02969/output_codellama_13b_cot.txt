The variable r is initialized to 4.
The code then prints 3*(4**2), which is 3*16, which is 48.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
r=int(input())
print(3*(r**2))
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
