The code starts with a function called search.
The function takes two parameters x and y, which are initialized to 0.
The function then calculates the minimum and maximum values of x and y, which are 0 and 0, respectively.
The function then calculates the value of f, which is 0.
The function then calculates the value of f1, which is 1.
The function then calculates the value of f2, which is 0.
The function then calculates the value of p, which is 0.
The function then enters a while loop that will continue until the condition is met.
The condition is that the current values of x_min, y_min, x_max, y_max, f, f1 and f2 satisfy the following conditions:
x_min <= x and x <= x_max and
y_min <= y and y <= y_max

The function then returns the value of p%3 + 1, which is 1.

The function then prints the value of search(x, y), which is 1.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def search(x, y):
    x_min = 0
    y_min = 0
    x_max = 0
    y_max = 0
    f = 0
    f1 = 1
    f2 = 0
    p = 0
    while(True):
        if ( x_min <= x and x <= x_max and
             y_min <= y and y <= y_max  ): return p%3 + 1
        f = f1 + f2
        if ( p % 4 == 0 ):  x_max += f  # east
        elif ( p % 4 == 1 ): y_max += f # north
        elif ( p % 4 == 2 ): x_min -= f # west
        else:  y_min -= f               # south
        f2 = f1
        f1 = f
        p = p + 1

x,y = map(int, input().split())
print(search(x, y))

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```0 0
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
