The variable n, variable a and variable b are initialized to 10, 3 and 5, respectively.
The code then calculates the minimum of a and b, which is 3.
The code then calculates the difference between a and b and n, which is 2.
If the difference is negative, it is set to 0.
The code then prints the minimum of a and b and the difference between a and b and n.
The output is 3 2.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
# coding: utf-8
# Your code here!

n, a, b = map(int,input().split())

ma = min(a,b)
mi = (a+b)-n

if mi < 0:
    mi = 0

print(ma,mi)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10 3 5
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
