The variable a, b, c, x and y are initialized to 1500, 2000, 1600, 3 and 2, respectively.
The variable l is initialized to an empty list.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 10^7 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 10000000.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of c*i*2, a*max(0,x-i) and b*max(0,y-i) and stores it in s.
The code then appends s to the list l.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the minimum value of l, which is 1500.
<<<Output>>>

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b,c,x,y=map(int,input().split())
l=[]
for i in range(10**7):
    s=c*i*2+a*max(0,x-i)+b*max(0,y-i)
    l.append(s)
print(min(l))

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1500 2000 1600 3 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
