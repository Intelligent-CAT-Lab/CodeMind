The variable n is initialized to 4.
The code checks if n is even or odd. If n is even, it prints the value of n//2-1, which is 1. If n is odd, it prints the value of n//2, which is 2.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
n = int(input())

if n % 2 == 0:
	print(n//2-1)
else:
	print(n//2)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
