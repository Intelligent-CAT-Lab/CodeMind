The variable B and variable W are initialized to 2 and 1, respectively.
The variable mod is initialized to 1e9 + 7.
The function doubling takes two integers n and m as input and returns the value of y, which is calculated as follows:
y = 1
base = n
while m!= 0:
    if m % 2 == 1:
        y *= base
        y %= mod
    base *= base
    base %= mod
    m //= 2
The function inved takes an integer a as input and returns the value of x, which is calculated as follows:
x, y, u, v, k, l = 1, 0, 0, 1, a, mod
while l!= 0:
    x, y, u, v = u, v, x - u * (k // l), y - v * (k // l)
    k, l = l, k % l
The variable fact is initialized to [1 for i in range(B+W+1)], which is a list of 1s.
The variable invf is initialized to [1 for i in range(B+W+1)], which is a list of 1s.
For each integer i in the range [B+W, 0, -1], the value of fact[i] is calculated as follows:
fact[i] = (fact[i-1] * (i+1)) % mod
The value of invf[i] is calculated as follows:
invf[i] = inved(fact[i])
The variable bina is initialized to [1 for i in range(B+W+1)], which is a list of 1s.
The variable invb is initialized to [1 for i in range(B+W+1)], which is a list of 1s.
For each integer i in the range [B+W, 0, -1], the value of bina[i] is calculated as follows:
bina[i] = (bina[i-1] * 2) % mod
The value of invb[i] is calculated as follows:
invb[i] = inved(bina[i])
If B == W, the code prints the value of invf[2].
If B > W, the code prints the value of invf[2] for each integer i in the range [W, 0, -1].
Then, the code calculates the value of P, which is the value of invf[2].
For each integer i in the range [W+1, B+1], the code calculates the value of F as follows:
F = (fact[i-2] * invf[i-1-W] * invf[W-1]) % mod
F *= invb[i]
F %= mod
F += P
F %= mod
The code prints the value of F.
Then, the code calculates the value of P as the value of F.
If B < W, the code prints the value of invf[2] for each integer i in the range [B, 0, -1].
Then, the code calculates the value of P, which is the value of invf[2].
For each integer i in the range [B+1, W+1], the code calculates the value of F as follows:
F = (fact[i-2] * invf[i-1-B] * invf[B-1]) % mod
F *= mod - 1
F %= mod
F *= invb[i]
F %= mod
F += P
F %= mod
The code prints the value of F.
Then, the code calculates the value of P as the value of F.
For each integer i in the range [W+1, B+W+1], the code calculates the value of F as follows:
F = invf[i-1-B] * invf[B-1]
F %= mod
F *= fact[i-2]
F %= mod
F *= mod - 1
F += (fact[i-2] * invf[i-1-W] * invf[W-1]) % mod
F %= mod
F *= invb[i]
F %= mod
F += P
F %=
