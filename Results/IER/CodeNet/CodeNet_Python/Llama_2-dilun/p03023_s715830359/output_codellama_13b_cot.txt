The variable n is initialized to 3.
The code then prints the value of n minus 2 multiplied by 180.
The value of n minus 2 is 1, and 1 multiplied by 180 is 180.
Therefore, the output is 180.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
n = int(input())
print((n-2) *180)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The variable n is initialized to 10.
The code then prints the value of n minus 2 multiplied by 180.
The value of n minus 2 is 8, and 8 multiplied by 180 is 1440.
Therefore, the output is 1440.
