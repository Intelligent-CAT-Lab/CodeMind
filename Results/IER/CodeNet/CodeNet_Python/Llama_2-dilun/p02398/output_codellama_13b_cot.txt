The variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized to 5, 14 and 80, respectively.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from a to b (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 5 to 14.
For each number i in this range, it checks if c is divisible by i. If it is, it adds 1 to ans. The condition is met when c is divisible by 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 10.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b,c=map(int,input().split())
ans=0
for i in range(a,b+1):
    if c%i==0:
        ans+=1
print(ans)

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 14 80
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
