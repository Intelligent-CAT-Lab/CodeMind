The variable H and variable A are initialized to 10 and 4, respectively.
The code then prints the ceiling of H divided by A, which is 2.5.
<<<Output>>>
2.5

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import math
H, A = map(int, input().split())
print(math.ceil(H/A))
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10 4
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
