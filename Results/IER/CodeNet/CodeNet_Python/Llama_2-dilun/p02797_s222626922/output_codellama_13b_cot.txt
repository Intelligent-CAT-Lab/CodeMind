The variable n, k and s are initialized to 4, 2 and 3, respectively.
The variable num is initialized to 998245637.
The variable arr is initialized to a list of length k, which is 2 in this case.
The variable arr2 is initialized to a list of length (n-k), which is 2 in this case.
The variable arr is filled with the value of s, which is 3 in this case.
The variable arr2 is filled with the value of num, which is 998245637 in this case.
The code prints the elements of arr and arr2.
The output is:
```3 3 3 998245637```

Consider the following code:
<Code>
n, k, s = map(int, input().split())
num = 998245637
arr = [s]*k
arr2 = [num]*(n-k)
print(*(arr+arr2))

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4 2 3
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
