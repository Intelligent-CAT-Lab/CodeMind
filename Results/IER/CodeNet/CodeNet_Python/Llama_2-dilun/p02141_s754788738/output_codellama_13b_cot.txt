The variables W, H, w, h, x, y are initialized to 6000, 5000, 20, 10, 400, 300, respectively.
The code then uses the lambda function to convert the input to integers and multiply each by 2.
The variables X1, X2, Y1, Y2 are initialized to -W/2, W/2, -H/2, H/2, respectively.
The variables x1, y1 are initialized to the maximum of x - w/2 and X1, and the maximum of y - h/2 and Y1.
The variables x2, y2 are initialized to the minimum of x + w/2 and X2, and the minimum of y + h/2 and Y2.
The variables mx, my are initialized to the average of x1 and x2, and the average of y1 and y2, respectively.
The code then prints the value of my / mx, which is 0.000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
