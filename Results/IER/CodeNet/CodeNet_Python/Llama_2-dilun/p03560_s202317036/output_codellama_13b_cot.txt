The code first initializes the variable k to the input value 6.
It then creates an empty list for each of the first k numbers.
The code then iterates through the first k numbers and appends two elements to each list.
The first element is the number itself, and the second element is 1.
If the number is not 1, the code also appends an element with the number 10 times the number itself and 0.
The code then creates a deque (double-ended queue) with the first element 1.
The code then iterates through the deque and calculates the minimum distance between the current element and the previous element.
If the current element is 0, the code breaks out of the loop.
Otherwise, the code checks if the distance between the current element and the previous element is less than the distance between the current element and the previous element plus the distance between the previous element and the next element.
If it is, the code updates the distance between the current element and the previous element.
If the distance between the current element and the previous element is 0, the code appends the current element to the deque.
Otherwise, the code appends the previous element to the deque.
The code then prints the minimum distance between the first element and the last element.

The minimum distance is 1, which is the distance between the first element 1 and the last element 6.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import sys
from collections import deque
sys.setrecursionlimit(10**6)
k=int(input())
g=[[] for i in range(k)]
for i in range(k):
  g[i].append(((i+1)%k,1))
  if i:
    g[i].append((10*i%k,0))
q=deque([1])
res=[float('inf')]*k
res[1]=1
while q:
  v=q.popleft()
  if v==0:
    break
  for c,d in g[v]:
    if res[c]<=res[v]+d:
      continue
    res[c]=res[v]+d
    if d:
      q.append(c)
    else:
      q.appendleft(c)
print(res[0])

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```6
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
