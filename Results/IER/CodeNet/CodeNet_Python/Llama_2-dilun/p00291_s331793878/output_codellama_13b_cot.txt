The variables a, b, c, d, e and f are initialized to 3, 1, 4, 0, 4 and 1, respectively.
The code then prints 1 if a+5*b+10*c+50*d+100*e+500*f>=1000 else 0.
The condition is met when a+5*b+10*c+50*d+100*e+500*f>=1000, which is true when a=3, b=1, c=4, d=0, e=4 and f=1.
The code then prints 1.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b,c,d,e,f = map(int, input().split())
print(1 if a+5*b+10*c+50*d+100*e+500*f>=1000 else 0)

<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 1 4 0 4 1
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
