The variable N and M are initialized to 1 and 6, respectively.
The code then checks if 2 * N <= M, which is 2 * 1 <= 6, which is True.
The code then calculates ans as N + (M - 2 * N) // 4, which is 1 + (6 - 2 * 1) // 4, which is 1 + 4 // 4, which is 1.
The code then prints the value of ans, which is 1.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
def INT():
    return int(input())

def MI():
    return map(int, input().split())

def LI():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))

N, M = MI()

if 2 * N <= M:
    ans = N + (M - 2 * N) // 4
    
else:
    ans = M // 2
    
print(ans)

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 6
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
