The variable a is initialized to the input string.
The variable l is initialized to the length of the input string.
The variable i is initialized to 0.
The variable ans is initialized to 0.
The code enters a while loop that iterates while i is less than l.
Inside the loop, the variable lenj is initialized to 0.
The code enters another while loop that iterates while i is less than l and a[i] is equal to J.
Inside the loop, the variable lenj is incremented by 1.
The code increments i by 1.
The code checks if i is less than l and a[i] is equal to J.
If it is, the code increments lenj by 1.
The code increments i by 1.
The code checks if i is less than l and a[i] is equal to O.
If it is, the code increments leno by 1.
The code increments i by 1.
The code checks if i is less than l and a[i] is equal to I.
If it is, the code increments leni by 1.
The code increments i by 1.
The code checks if i is less than l.
If it is, the code increments i by 1.
The code checks if lenj is greater than or equal to leno and leni is greater than or equal to leno.
If it is, the code sets ans to be the maximum of ans and leno.
The code prints the final value of ans, which is 3.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
a=raw_input()
l=len(a)
i=ans=0
while i<l:
	lenj=leno=leni=0
	while i<l and a[i]=="J":
		lenj+=1
		i+=1
	while i<l and a[i]=="O":
		leno+=1
		i+=1
	while i<l and a[i]=="I":
		leni+=1
		i+=1
	if lenj>=leno and leni>=leno:
		ans=max(ans,leno)
print ans
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```OJJOOIIOJOI
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
