The variable N, variable K are initialized to 3 and 10, respectively.
The function input() is used to read the input from the standard input.
The variables N and K are then passed to the function mi() to return a list containing the values of N and K.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 3.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is greater than or equal to K. If it is, it adds 1 to ans. Otherwise, it adds the value of pow(1/2, math.ceil(math.log2(K/i))) to ans.
The condition is met when i is 1, 2 and 3.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 1.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
import sys
import math
def input(): return sys.stdin.readline().strip()

mi = lambda: map(int, input().split())

N, K = mi()

ans = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
  if i >= K:
    ans += 1
  else:
    ans += pow(1/2, math.ceil(math.log2(K/i)))

print(ans/N)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 10
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
