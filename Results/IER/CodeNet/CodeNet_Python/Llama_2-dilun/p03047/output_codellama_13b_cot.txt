The variable N and variable K are initialized to 3 and 2, respectively.
The code then prints the value of N minus the value of K minus 1.
The value of N minus the value of K minus 1 is 3-2-1, which is 0.

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
N,K = map(int,input().split())

print(N-(K-1))
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 2
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
