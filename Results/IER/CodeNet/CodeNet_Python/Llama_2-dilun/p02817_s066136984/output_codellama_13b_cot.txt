The input is ```oder atc```
The code splits the input into two lists, a and b.
The code then adds the two lists together and prints the result.
The result is ```oder atc```

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
a, b = [x for x in input().split()]
print( b+a )
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```oder atc
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
