The variables a, s, d and f are initialized to 0, 0, 0 and 1, respectively.
The code calculates the difference between d and f, which is 1, and adds it to s, which is 0, to get x3, which is 1.
The code calculates the sum of f and d, which is 1, and subtracts it from a, which is 0, to get y3, which is 1.
The code calculates the difference between a and f, which is 0, and adds it to s, which is 0, to get x4, which is 0.
The code calculates the sum of s and d, which is 1, and subtracts it from a, which is 0, to get y4, which is 1.
The output is (1, 1, 0, 1).

    Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,s,d,f=map(int,input().split())
x3=d-f+s
y3=f+d-a
x4=a-f+s
y4=s+d-a
print(x3,y3,x4,y4)
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```0 0 0 1
```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
