<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes input from the user in the form of two numbers separated by a space.
The input is then split into two variables A and B using the split() method.
The variables A and B are then converted to integers using the int() method.
The code then calculates the sum of A and B and takes the modulo of 24.
The modulo operation returns the remainder of the division of A and B by 24.
The code then prints the result of the modulo operation.
