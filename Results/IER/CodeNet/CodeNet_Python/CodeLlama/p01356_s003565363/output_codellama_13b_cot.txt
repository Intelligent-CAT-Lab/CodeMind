  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module and defines the readline and write functions.
The solve function is then defined, which takes no arguments.
The function first maps the input to the variables N, M, A, B, P, and Q.
The function then checks if A and B are both equal to 1, and if so, it calculates the minimum number of moves required to reach M.
If A and B are not both equal to 1, the function calculates the minimum number of moves required to reach M using the following algorithm:
1. It calculates the number of moves required to reach M using the first half of the moves.
2. It calculates the number of moves required to reach M using the second half of the moves.
3. It calculates the minimum number of moves required to reach M using the first half of the moves and the second half of the moves.
4. It calculates the minimum number of moves required to reach M using the first half of the moves and the second half of the moves, but with the constraint that the number of moves required to reach M using the first half of the moves is less than or equal to the number of moves required to reach M using the second half of the moves.
5. It calculates the minimum number of moves required to reach M using the first half of the moves and the second half of the moves, but with the constraint that the number of moves required to reach M using the first half of the moves is greater than or equal to the number of moves required to reach M using the second half of the moves.
The function then writes the minimum number of moves required to reach M to the output.
