  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first initializes a list called sknList with three elements: 300000, 200000, and 100000.
The code then reads two integers x and y from the input using the map function.
The code then initializes a variable called prize to 0.
The code then checks if x and y are both equal to 1. If they are, the code adds 400000 to the prize.
The code then checks if x is less than or equal to 3. If it is, the code adds the element at index x-1 of the sknList to the prize.
The code then checks if y is less than or equal to 3. If it is, the code adds the element at index y-1 of the sknList to the prize.
The code then prints the value of the prize.
<<<Output>>>
400000
