  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first reads the input from the user and stores it in a variable called t.
The length of the input is stored in a variable called n.
The code then iterates over the input string t and checks each character.
If the character is '?', it appends 'D' to the output list ans.
If the character is not '?', it appends the character to the output list ans.
Finally, the code joins the elements of the output list ans into a string and prints it.
