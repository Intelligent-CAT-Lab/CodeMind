<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user in the form of three integers separated by spaces.
The input is then stored in a list called a, b, and c.
The code then checks if the absolute difference between b and c is divisible by 2.
If it is, the code prints "Alice".
If it is not, the code prints "Borys".
<<<Output>>>
Borys
