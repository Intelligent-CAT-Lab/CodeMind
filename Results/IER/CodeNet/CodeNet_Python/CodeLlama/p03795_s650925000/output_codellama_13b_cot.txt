<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input from the user and stores it in the variable n.
The variable N is then initialized to the integer division of n by 15.
The code then prints the expression 800*n-200*N.
<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will be 800*20-200*20/15, which is 800*20-200*1=1600-200=1400.
