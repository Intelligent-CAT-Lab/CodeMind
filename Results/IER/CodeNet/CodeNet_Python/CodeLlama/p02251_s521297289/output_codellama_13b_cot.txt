<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input n from the user.
It then initializes a variable c to 0.
The code then performs the following operations:
1. c += n//25: This calculates the integer division of n by 25 and adds the result to c.
2. n %= 25: This calculates the remainder of n divided by 25 and assigns the result back to n.
3. c += n//10: This calculates the integer division of n by 10 and adds the result to c.
4. n %= 10: This calculates the remainder of n divided by 10 and assigns the result back to n.
5. c += n//5: This calculates the integer division of n by 5 and adds the result to c.
6. c += n%5: This calculates the remainder of n divided by 5 and adds the result to c.
The code then prints the final value of c.

The input 100 will be processed as follows:
1. n = 100
2. c = 0
3. c += n//25 = 0
4. n %= 25 = 0
5. c += n//10 = 0
6. n %= 10 = 0
7. c += n//5 = 0
8. c += n%5 = 0
9. print(c) = 0

The output of the code will be 0.
