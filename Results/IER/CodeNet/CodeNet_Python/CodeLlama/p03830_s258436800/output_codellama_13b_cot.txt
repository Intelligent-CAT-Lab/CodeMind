  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first reads the input from stdin and stores it in the variable N.
The code then initializes a dictionary called prime, which will be used to store the number of prime factors of each number from 1 to N.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 3.
For each number n in this range, it calculates the prime factorization of n using the factorize_dict function.
The function returns a dictionary where each key is a prime factor of n and each value is the power of that prime factor.
The code then updates the prime dictionary by adding the power of each prime factor to the corresponding key.
After the loop finishes, the code calculates the product of all the values in the prime dictionary and prints the result.
