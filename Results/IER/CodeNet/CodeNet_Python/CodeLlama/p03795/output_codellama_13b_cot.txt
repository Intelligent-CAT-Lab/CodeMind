<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input N from the user.
It then calculates the value of 800*N, which is 800 times the input N.
It then calculates the value of 200*(N//15), which is 200 times the integer division of N by 15.
Finally, it subtracts the result of the second calculation from the result of the first calculation.
<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will be 800*N - 200*(N//15).
For the input 20, the output will be 800*20 - 200*(20//15) = 800*20 - 200*1 = 1600 - 200 = 1400.
