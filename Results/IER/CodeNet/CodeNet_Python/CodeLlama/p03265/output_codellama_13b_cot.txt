<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in four integers as input, which are assigned to the variables a, s, d, and f.
The code then calculates the values of x3 and y3 using the formulae:
x3 = d - f + s
y3 = f + d - a
The code then calculates the values of x4 and y4 using the formulae:
x4 = a - f + s
y4 = s + d - a
Finally, the code prints the values of x3, y3, x4, and y4.
