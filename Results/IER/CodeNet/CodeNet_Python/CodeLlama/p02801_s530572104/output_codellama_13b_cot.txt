<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user and stores it in the variable C.
The code then defines two lambda functions, alpha2num and num2alpha, which are used to convert between letters and numbers.
The code then converts the input letter to a number using the alpha2num function and stores it in the variable a.
The code then checks if the number is equal to 26, and if it is, it sets the number to 0.
The code then adds 1 to the number and converts it back to a letter using the num2alpha function and stores it in the variable b.
The code then prints the letter stored in the variable b.
<<<Output>>>
b
