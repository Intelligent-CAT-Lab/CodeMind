  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input S and assigns it to the variable S.
The code then initializes the variables X1, Y1, X2, Y2, X3, and Y3 to 0.
The code then calculates the square root of S and assigns it to the variable tmp.
The code then checks if tmp**2 is greater than or equal to S. If it is, it assigns tmp to X2 and Y3. Otherwise, it assigns tmp+1 to X2 and Y3.
The code then calculates the difference between X2**2 and S and assigns it to rest.
The code then checks if rest is equal to 0. If it is, it assigns X3 and Y2 to 0. Otherwise, it checks if rest is less than 10**9. If it is, it assigns X3 to 1 and Y2 to rest. Otherwise, it enters a loop that iterates from 2 to the square root of rest+2. For each i in this range, it checks if rest is divisible by i. If it is, it assigns X3 to i and Y2 to rest//i.
The code then prints the values of X1, Y1, X2, Y2, X3, and Y3.
