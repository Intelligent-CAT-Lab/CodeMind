  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers A and B as input, and then checks if B is divisible by A. If it is, the code prints -1 and exits.
If B is not divisible by A, the code calculates the value of _k = -(-B//A), which is the largest integer less than or equal to B/A.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from _k to _k+10^7, and for each value of k, it calculates the values of bn and an using the formulae bn = k*A/B and an = (k*A)%B/A.
The code then calculates the value of n = bn + an + (k*A)%B, and if n is greater than k, it prints k*A and exits.
If the loop finishes without printing anything, the code prints -1.
<<<Output>>>
-1
