  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input X from the user, which is "TSTTSS" in this case.
It then initializes an empty stack using the deque data structure.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the characters in X.
For each character i in X, it checks if it is 'S' or 'T'.
If it is 'S', it appends the character to the left side of the stack.
If it is 'T', it checks if the stack is empty. If it is not empty, it pops the leftmost character from the stack and checks if it is 'T'. If it is, it appends the popped character to the left side of the stack, and then appends the current character to the left side of the stack. If the stack is empty, it simply appends the current character to the left side of the stack.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the length of the stack.
