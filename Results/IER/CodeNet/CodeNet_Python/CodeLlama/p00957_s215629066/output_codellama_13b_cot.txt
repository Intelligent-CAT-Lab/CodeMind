  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports several modules, including collections, itertools, sys, math, and decimal.
It then sets the recursion limit to 1000000 and defines two variables, l and k, as the input values.
The code then initializes two lists, DP1 and DP2, with 200 elements each.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to l (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 200.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in DP1[i].
The code also calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in DP2[i].
If i is greater than or equal to k, the code adds the value of DP2[i - k] to DP1[i].
After the loop finishes, the code prints the sum of the elements in DP1.
<<<Output>>>
1000000
