  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the math module and defines the PI constant.
It then reads two integers N and K from the input using the map() function.
The code then calculates the area of a regular polygon with N sides and K vertices using the formula provided in the comments.
The formula is derived from the formula for the area of a regular polygon with n sides and r as the radius.
The code then prints the calculated area.
