<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, n and m, and stores them in variables n and m, respectively.
The code then checks if both n and m are greater than or equal to 2. If they are, it calculates the product of (n - 2) and (m - 2) and prints the result.
If only one of n and m is greater than or equal to 2, the code checks if the other variable is greater than 1. If it is, it calculates the difference between the variable and 2 and prints the result.
If neither n nor m is greater than or equal to 2, the code prints 1.
