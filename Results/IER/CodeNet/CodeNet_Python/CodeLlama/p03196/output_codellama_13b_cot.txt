  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input n and p from the user.
n is initialized to 3 and p is initialized to 24.
The function factorization is called with argument p.
The function factorization first initializes an empty list arr.
The function then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to the square root of p (inclusive).
For each number i in this range, it checks if p is divisible by i.
If it is, it calculates the number of times i divides p and stores it in cnt.
It then appends [i, cnt] to arr.
The function then checks if temp is not equal to 1.
If it is, it appends [temp, 1] to arr.
If arr is still empty, it appends [p, 1] to arr.
The function then returns arr.
The function factorization returns [[2, 2], [3, 1]].
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the elements of the list returned by factorization.
For each element [i, cnt] in the list, it checks if cnt is greater than or equal to n.
If it is, it multiplies ans by i raised to the power of cnt//n.
The code then prints the final value of ans, which is 8.
<<<Output>>>
8
