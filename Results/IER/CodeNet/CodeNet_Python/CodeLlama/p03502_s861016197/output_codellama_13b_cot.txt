<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user and stores it in the variable n.
The variable _sum is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of the digits of n.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the length of n (which is 2 in this case).
For each digit i in n, it adds the value of i to _sum.
After the loop finishes, the code calculates the remainder of n divided by _sum.
If the remainder is 0, the code prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
