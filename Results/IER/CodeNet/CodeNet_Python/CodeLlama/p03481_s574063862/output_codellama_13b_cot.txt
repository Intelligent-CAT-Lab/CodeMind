<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers X and Y as input, separated by a space.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to store the final answer.
The variable seki is initialized to X, which is 3 in this case.
The code enters a loop that iterates while seki is less than or equal to Y, which is 20 in this case.
In each iteration, the code multiplies seki by 2 and adds 1 to ans.
The loop finishes when seki exceeds Y, which is 20.
The code then prints the final value of ans, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
