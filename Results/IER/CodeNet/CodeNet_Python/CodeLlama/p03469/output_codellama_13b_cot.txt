<<<Analysis>>>
The code first prints the string '2018' to the console.
Then it takes the input from the user, which is '2017/01/07'.
The code then takes a slice of the input string starting from the 4th index (inclusive) to the end of the string (exclusive).
The resulting string is '17/01/07'.
The code then concatenates the string '2018' with the sliced string, resulting in the final output '201817/01/07'.
<<<Output>>>
201817/01/07
