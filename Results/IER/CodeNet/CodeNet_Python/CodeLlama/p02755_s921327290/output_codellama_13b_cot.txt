<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, a and b, and initializes ans to -1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 1000, meaning it will consider taxes from 0 to 1000.
For each tax in this range, it calculates the 8% and 10% of the tax and checks if they are equal to a and b, respectively.
If the condition is met, the code sets ans to the current tax and breaks out of the loop.
The code then prints the final value of ans, which is 200.
<<<Output>>>
200
