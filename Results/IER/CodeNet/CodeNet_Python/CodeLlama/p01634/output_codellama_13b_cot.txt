  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first prompts the user to enter a password.
The password is then stored in the variable a.
The code then checks the length of the password.
If the length is less than 6, the code prints "INVALID".
If the length is greater than or equal to 6, the code enters a loop that iterates over each character in the password.
For each character, the code checks if it is a digit, lowercase letter, or uppercase letter.
If the character is a digit, the code increments the variable m.
If the character is a lowercase letter, the code increments the variable n.
If the character is an uppercase letter, the code increments the variable l.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if any of the variables m, n, or l are equal to 0.
If any of them are equal to 0, the code prints "INVALID".
If all of them are greater than 0, the code prints "VALID".
<<<Output>>>
INVALID
