  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input S and K as a string and an integer, respectively.
The code then converts K to an integer and sets it to the minimum of K and 300.
The code then initializes a list a and sets val to 0.
The code then iterates through the string S and checks if each character is a 0 or not.
If it is a 0, the code appends val to a and sets val to 0.
If it is not a 0, the code increments val by 1.
The code then checks if val is not equal to 0 and appends it to a if it is.
The code then sets m to the length of a.
The code then sets K to the minimum of the sum of the elements of a and K.
The code then initializes a 2D list dp with K+1 rows and K+1 columns.
The code then sets the elements of the first row and column of dp to 1.
The code then initializes lists b and c with the elements of a.
The code then iterates through the elements of b and adds the previous element to each element.
The code then sets the first element of b to 0.
The code then iterates through the elements of c and adds the next element to each element.
The code then iterates through the elements of dp and sets ndp to a 2D list with K+1 rows and K+1 columns.
The code then iterates through the elements of ndp and sets the elements to the sum of the elements of dp.
The code then sets the elements of dp to the elements of ndp.
The code then prints the element at the first row and first column of dp.
