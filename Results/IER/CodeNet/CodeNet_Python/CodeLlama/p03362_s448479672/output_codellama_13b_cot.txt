  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first initializes the variable M to 55555, which is the upper limit of the range of numbers to be considered.
It then calculates the square root of M and rounds it up to the nearest integer, which is 74.
The code then initializes an array S with 0s, which will be used to store the numbers that are not prime.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to m (inclusive), which is 74 in this case.
For each number i in this range, it enters another loop that iterates from i*2 to M (inclusive), which is 148 in this case.
For each number j in this range, it sets S[j] to 1, which means that j is not prime.
The code then reads the input N from the user, which is 5 in this case.
It then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to M (inclusive), which is 55555 in this case.
For each number i in this range, it checks if S[i] is 0 and if i is divisible by 5.
If both conditions are met, it prints i and increments the variable cnt by 1.
If cnt is equal to N, the code quits.
