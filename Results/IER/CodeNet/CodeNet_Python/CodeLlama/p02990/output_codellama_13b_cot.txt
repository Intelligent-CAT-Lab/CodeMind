  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the bisect and sys modules.
The sys module is used to set the recursion limit to 10^9.
The code then defines a function called main, which is the entry point of the program.
The main function takes two inputs, N and K, and splits them into two integers using the map function.
The MOD variable is set to 10^9+7.
The code then defines two functions, comb and between.
The comb function calculates the binomial coefficient of two integers, n and r, modulo MOD.
The between function calculates the number of integers between n and k, inclusive, that are divisible by i.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to K+1.
For each value of i, the code checks if i is greater than K or i is greater than N-K+1.
If either of these conditions is true, the code prints 0.
Otherwise, the code calculates the value of ans using the comb and between functions.
The ans value is then printed.
