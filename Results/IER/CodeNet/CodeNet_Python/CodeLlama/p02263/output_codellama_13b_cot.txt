  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user and splits it into a list of strings using the split() method.
The list is stored in the variable n.
The code then initializes an empty list called s.
The code enters a loop that iterates over the elements of the list n.
For each element i in n, the code checks if it is an operator (+, -, or *) and performs the corresponding operation on the top two elements of the stack s.
If the element is not an operator, the code converts it to an integer and pushes it onto the stack s.
After the loop finishes, the code pops the final element of the stack s and prints it.
