  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input N from the user.
It then defines a function p_deg_le that takes two arguments, pfac and n, and returns the number of prime factors in pfac with degree greater than or equal to n.
The code then defines a list P of the first 20 prime numbers.
It then calculates the factorial of N and stores it in a dictionary pfac, where each key is a prime factor and each value is its power.
It then sorts the dictionary pfac in descending order of the powers of the prime factors.
It then calculates the product of the prime factors raised to their powers and stores it in a variable fact.
It then calculates the number of factors of N that are of the form p1^4 * p2^4 * p3^2, p1^14 * p2^4, p1^24 * p2^2, and p1^74.
It then prints the sum of these numbers.
