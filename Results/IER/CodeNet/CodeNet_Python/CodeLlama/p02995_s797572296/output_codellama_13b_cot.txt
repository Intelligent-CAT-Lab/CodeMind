  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the math module, which provides mathematical functions.
The code then defines a function called gcd, which calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers.
The function takes two arguments, a and b, and returns their greatest common divisor.
The code then defines variables a, b, c, and d, which are initialized to the values provided by the user.
The code then calculates the greatest common divisor of c and d, and stores it in the variable gcd_.
The code then calculates the value of cc, which is the product of c and d divided by the greatest common divisor.
The code then calculates the values of mm1, mm2, and mmc, which are the quotients of b, a, and cc, respectively, divided by c and d.
The code then calculates the values of A1 and A2, which are the difference between b and the sum of mm2, mm1, and mmc, and the difference between a and the sum of mm2, mm1, and mmc, respectively.
The code then prints the difference between A1 and A2.
