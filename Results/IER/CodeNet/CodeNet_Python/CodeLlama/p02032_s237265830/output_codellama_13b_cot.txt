  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the copy module and defines two functions: make_divisors and main.
The make_divisors function takes an integer n as input and returns a list of its divisors in ascending order.
The main function takes an integer N as input, calls the make_divisors function with N as input, and stores the result in a variable called yakusu.
It then initializes two variables, min_times and max_times, to 0 and the length of yakusu - 1, respectively.
The code then enters a loop that iterates through the elements of yakusu in reverse order, starting from the second-to-last element.
For each element i in this loop, the code checks if i is already in the result list. If it is, it skips the current iteration and moves on to the next element.
If i is not in the result list, the code appends the result of calling the make_divisors function with i as input to the result list.
The code then increments min_times by 1 and continues the loop.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the values of min_times and max_times.
