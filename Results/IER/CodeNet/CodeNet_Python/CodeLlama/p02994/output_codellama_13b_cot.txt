  <<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called resolve() that takes no arguments.
The function first takes input from the user in the form of two space-separated integers N and L.
The function then initializes two variables, Ts, which is an empty list, and offset, which is set to L-1.
The function then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N+1.
For each iteration, the function appends the value of i+offset to the list Ts.
The function then checks if the absolute value of i+offset is less than the current value of absmin.
If it is, the function updates absmin and mini to the current value of i+offset.
After the loop finishes, the function prints the sum of all elements in Ts minus the value of mini.
