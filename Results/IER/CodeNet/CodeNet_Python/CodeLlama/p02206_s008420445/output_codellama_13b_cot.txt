  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs, n and k, from the user.
n is set to 1 and k is set to 1.
The code then initializes l and r to 0 and k+1, respectively.
The code enters a while loop that runs until the difference between r and l is greater than 1.
The code calculates the midpoint of l and r, which is m.
The code then calculates the result of the expression m and stores it in res.
The code then calculates the result of the expression m//2 and stores it in t.
The code then calculates the result of the expression t//2 and stores it in res.
The code then checks if t is equal to 0. If it is, the code breaks out of the loop.
The code then checks if res is greater than k. If it is, the code sets r to m.
If res is less than or equal to k, the code sets l to m.
The code then prints the value of l.
