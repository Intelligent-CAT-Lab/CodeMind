<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes the input as a string, splits it into a list of integers using the split() method, and then maps each element of the list to an integer using the map() function.
The resulting list is then sorted in descending order using the sorted() function with the reverse parameter set to True.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the sorted list and prints each element followed by a space.
The loop ends with a comma, which is not printed.
