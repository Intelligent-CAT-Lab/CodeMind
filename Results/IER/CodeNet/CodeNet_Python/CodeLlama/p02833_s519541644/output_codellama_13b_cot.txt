<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input N from the user.
It then checks if N is odd by dividing it by 2 and checking if the remainder is 1. If it is, the code prints 0 and exits.
If N is even, the code sets ans to 0 and divides N by 2.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 1000.
For each iteration, it calculates the number of times N can be divided by 5 to the power of i (5**i), and adds it to ans.
The loop exits when N is less than 5**i.
The code then prints the final value of ans and exits.
<<<Output>>>
