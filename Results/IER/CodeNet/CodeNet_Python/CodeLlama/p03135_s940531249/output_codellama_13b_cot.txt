  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module, which is used to read input from the standard input stream.
The code then defines a function called solve, which takes two arguments, T and X, and prints their quotient.
The code then defines a function called main, which reads two integers from the standard input stream using the next function from the iterate_tokens function, and passes them to the solve function.
The iterate_tokens function uses the split function to split the input into a list of words, and then uses a generator expression to iterate over the list and yield each word.
The code then calls the main function if the module is being run as the main program.
