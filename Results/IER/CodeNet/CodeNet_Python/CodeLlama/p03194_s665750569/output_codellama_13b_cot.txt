  <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable P are initialized to 3, 24, respectively.
The variable rt is initialized to the floor of the square root of P, which is 4.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to rt+1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 2 to 5.
For each number i in this range, it checks if P is divisible by i. If it is, it adds the current number i to cnt. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4 and 5.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 1.
