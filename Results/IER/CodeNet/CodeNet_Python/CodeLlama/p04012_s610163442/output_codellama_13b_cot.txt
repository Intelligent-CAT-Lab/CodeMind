<<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the defaultdict class from the collections module.
The variable w is initialized to the input string "abaccaba".
The variable d is initialized to a defaultdict object with an integer as the default value.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the characters in the string w.
For each character key in w, the code increments the value of the corresponding key in the defaultdict object d.
The code then enters another loop that iterates over the values in the defaultdict object d.
For each value in d, the code checks if the value is odd. If it is, the code prints "No" and exits the program.
If the value is even, the code continues to the next iteration.
If the loop finishes without finding any odd values, the code prints "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
