  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first defines two functions: getInv and getCmb.
getInv takes an integer N as input and returns an array of size N+1, where the element at index i is the inverse of i modulo MOD.
getCmb takes an integer N as input and returns an array of size N+1, where the element at index i is the number of combinations of i objects taken k at a time.
The solve function takes four integers N, A, B, and K as input and returns the number of ways to choose a subset of size K from a set of size N, such that the sum of the elements in the subset is equal to K.
The code then reads in four integers from standard input and passes them to the solve function.
<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will be the number of ways to choose a subset of size K from a set of size N, such that the sum of the elements in the subset is equal to K.
Since the input is 4 1 2 5, the output will be the number of ways to choose a subset of size 5 from a set of size 4, such that the sum of the elements in the subset is equal to 5.
The code will first calculate the inverse of each element in the range [1,4] modulo MOD, which is 998244353.
It will then calculate the number of combinations of each element in the range [1,4] taken 5 at a time, which is 1.
It will then calculate the number of ways to choose a subset of size 5 from a set of size 4, such that the sum of the elements in the subset is equal to 5.
The code will then print the output, which is 1.
