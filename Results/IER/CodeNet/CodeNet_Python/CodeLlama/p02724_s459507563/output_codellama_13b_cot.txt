<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input X as an integer and then prints the result of the expression X // 500 * 1000 + X % 500 // 5 * 5.
The expression can be broken down as follows:

* X // 500: This calculates the integer division of X by 500, which is 2.
* 1000: This is a constant value that is multiplied by the result of the previous expression.
* X % 500: This calculates the remainder of X divided by 500, which is 24.
* X % 500 // 5: This calculates the remainder of X divided by 5, which is 4.
* 5: This is a constant value that is multiplied by the result of the previous expression.

Therefore, the final output of the code is 2000 + 4 = 2004.
<<<Output>>>
2004
