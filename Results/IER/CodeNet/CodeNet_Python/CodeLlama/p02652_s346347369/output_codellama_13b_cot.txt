  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input string S as input.
It then calculates the length of the string N.
The code then uses the itertools.accumulate function to calculate the cumulative sum of the string S.
The accumulate function takes a function as an argument, which in this case is a lambda function that returns 1 if the character is '1' and -1 if it is '0'.
The resulting list A is then created by adding a 0 to the beginning of the list.
The code then calculates the maximum value of A, which is 1.
The code then calculates the current value of A, which is also 1.
The code then calculates the difference between the maximum value of A and the current value of A, which is 0.
The code then creates two empty lists D and E.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the characters of the string S in reverse order.
For each character, the code checks if it is a '?' and if the cumulative sum of the character and the previous characters is greater than or equal to the difference between the maximum value of A and the current value of A.
If the condition is met, the code adds 2 to the difference between the maximum value of A and the current value of A.
The code then appends the difference between the maximum value of A and the current value of A to the list D.
The code then appends the difference between the maximum value of A and the current value of A to the list E.
The code then prints the minimum of the maximum value of D minus the minimum value of D and the maximum value of E minus the minimum value of E.
