<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input string S from the user and strips any leading or trailing whitespace.
The length of the string S is then calculated and stored in variable K.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to the length of the string S-1.
For each index i in this range, the code checks if the character at index i is different from the character at index i+1.
If the characters are different, the code calculates the length of the longest common prefix of the string S and the reverse of the string S.
The length of this prefix is then stored in variable ln.
The code then updates variable K to be the minimum of ln and K.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of K, which is the length of the longest common prefix of the string S and its reverse.
