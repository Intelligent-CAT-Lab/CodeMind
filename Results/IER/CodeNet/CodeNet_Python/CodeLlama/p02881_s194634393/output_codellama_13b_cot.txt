<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input n from the user.
The variable ans is initialized to 10^12, which is a large number.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to the square root of n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 3.
For each number k in this range, it checks if n is divisible by k. If it is, it calculates the value of m as n//k + k - 2.
The code then checks if m is less than the current value of ans. If it is, it updates ans to m.
The loop finishes and the code prints the final value of ans, which is 9.
<<<Output>>>
9
