  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input N and M as integers and initializes variables ah, bh, ans1, ans2 to 0.
The code then enters a while loop that iterates until bh is less than or equal to 0.
In each iteration, the code calculates the minimum of N and ah and stores it in ap.
The code then subtracts ap from bh and stores the result in bh.
If bh is less than or equal to 0, the code breaks out of the loop.
The code then calculates the minimum of M and bh and stores it in bp.
The code then subtracts bp from ah and stores the result in ah.
If ah is less than or equal to 0, the code breaks out of the loop.
The code then increments ans1 by 1.
The code then enters another while loop that iterates until ah is less than or equal to 0.
In each iteration, the code calculates the minimum of M and bh and stores it in bp.
The code then subtracts bp from ah and stores the result in ah.
If ah is less than or equal to 0, the code breaks out of the loop.
The code then increments ans2 by 1.
The code then prints the minimum of ans1 and ans2.
