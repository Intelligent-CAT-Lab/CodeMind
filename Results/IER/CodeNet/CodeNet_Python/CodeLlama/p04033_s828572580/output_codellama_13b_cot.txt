<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user in the form of two space-separated integers.
The variables a and b are initialized to the first and second integers, respectively.
The code then checks if a is positive. If it is, it prints 'Positive'.
If a is not positive, the code checks if a is negative and b is positive. If both conditions are met, it prints 'Zero'.
If none of the above conditions are met, the code checks if the difference between b and a is even. If it is, it prints 'Negative'.
If none of the above conditions are met, it prints 'Positive'.
<<<Output>>>
Positive
