  <<<Analysis>>>
The variable K is initialized to 101, and the variable L is initialized to 9 * K // 7, which is 101.
The variable ans is initialized to -1, and the variable n is initialized to 10.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to L (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 101.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the surplus of n % L, which is 101 % 101, and stores it in surplus.
The code checks if surplus is equal to 1, and if it is, it sets ans to i and breaks out of the loop.
Since surplus is never equal to 1, the loop finishes and the code prints the final value of ans, which is -1.
<<<Output>>>
-1
