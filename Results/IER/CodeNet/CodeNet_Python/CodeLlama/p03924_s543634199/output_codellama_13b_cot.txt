  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first reads two integers n and m from standard input using the LI() function.
The code then initializes a 2D array dp with n+1 rows and n+1 columns, with all elements initialized to 0.
The code then sets dp[1][1] to 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates m times.
For each iteration, the code initializes a new 2D array new_dp with n+1 rows and n+1 columns, with all elements initialized to 0.
The code then enters a nested loop that iterates over all possible values of j and k, where j ranges from 1 to n+1 and k ranges from 1 to j+1.
The code calculates the value of new_dp[j][j] using the formula new_dp[j][j] += dp[j][k] * k % mod.
The code calculates the value of new_dp[j][k] using the formula new_dp[j][k] += dp[j][k] * (j - k) % mod.
The code calculates the value of new_dp[j+1][k] using the formula new_dp[j+1][k] += dp[j][k] * (n - j) % mod.
The code then sets dp equal to new_dp.
The code then prints the value of dp[n][n] using the print() function.
