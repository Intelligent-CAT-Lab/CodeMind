<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input N and K from the user.
It then initializes t, n, and a to 1.
The code then enters a while loop that runs until the condition N < a is met.
In each iteration, the code calculates n as (K+a-1)//K.
It then adds n to a and adds 1 to t.
The loop stops when N < a is no longer met.
The code then prints the final value of t.
