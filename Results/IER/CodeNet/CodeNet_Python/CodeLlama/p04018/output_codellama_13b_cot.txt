  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input string and stores it in a list called w.
The length of the list is calculated and stored in the variable n.
The variable t is initialized to -1.
The function Z is defined, which takes a string as input and returns a list of integers representing the length of the longest prefix that is also a suffix of the string.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n/2, meaning it will consider all possible substrings of length 1 to n/2.
For each substring, the code checks if it is a prefix of the original string and if it is also a suffix. If it is, the code increments the variable cnt.
If t is still -1 after the loop finishes, the code prints 1 and 1.
If t is 1, the code prints n and 1.
Otherwise, the code prints 2 and cnt.
