<<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the math module and defines a function ij(x) that takes an integer x as input.
The function ij(x) returns a tuple (i, n//i) if n/i is equal to n//i, where n is the input integer.
The code then takes an integer input n from the user and calculates its square root using the math.sqrt() function.
The code then calls the ij(x) function with the integer square root of n as input, and stores the result in a variable.
The code then calculates the sum of the elements in the tuple returned by ij(x) and subtracts 2 from it.
The code finally prints the result.
