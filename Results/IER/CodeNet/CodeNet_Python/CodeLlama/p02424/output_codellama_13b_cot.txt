  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, a and b, and splits them into their binary representations.
The code then performs bitwise operations on these binary representations:

* a & b: This operation performs a bitwise AND on the two binary representations. It sets each bit to 1 if the corresponding bits in both a and b are 1, and 0 otherwise.
* a | b: This operation performs a bitwise OR on the two binary representations. It sets each bit to 1 if the corresponding bits in either a or b are 1, and 0 otherwise.
* a ^ b: This operation performs a bitwise XOR on the two binary representations. It sets each bit to 1 if the corresponding bits in a and b are different, and 0 otherwise.

The code then formats the results of these operations as 32-bit binary strings and prints them.
