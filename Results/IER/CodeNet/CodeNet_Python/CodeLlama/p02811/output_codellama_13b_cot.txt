<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes input from the user in the form of two integers, K and X.
The code then calculates the product of K and 500 and checks if it is greater than or equal to X.
If the condition is met, the code prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".

In this case, the input is 2 and 900, respectively.
The product of 2 and 500 is 1000, which is less than 900.
Therefore, the output of the code is "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
