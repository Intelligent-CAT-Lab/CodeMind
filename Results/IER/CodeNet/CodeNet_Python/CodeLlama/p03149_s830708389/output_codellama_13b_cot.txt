<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input as a list of integers using the map() function.
The list is then converted to a set using the set() function.
The code then calculates the sum of the elements in the set that are equal to 1, 9, 7, and 4 using the sum() function.
The code then checks if the product of these sums is equal to 1.
If it is, the code prints "YES", otherwise it prints "NO".

In this case, the input is [1, 7, 9, 4], which is a set of 4 elements.
The sum of the elements that are equal to 1 is 1, the sum of the elements that are equal to 9 is 1, the sum of the elements that are equal to 7 is 1, and the sum of the elements that are equal to 4 is 1.
The product of these sums is 1, which is equal to 1.
Therefore, the output of the code is "YES".
<<<Output>>>
YES
