  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input n from the user and calculates 2^n, which is stored in variable m.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to m-1 (inclusive).
For each iteration, it initializes a list temp with n zeros.
It then sets j to the current iteration number and sets count to 0.
The code then enters a while loop that iterates while j is greater than 0.
If j is odd, it sets the corresponding element of temp to 1.
It then divides j by 2 and increments count.
The while loop ends when j is 0.
The code then initializes an empty list temp2 and iterates over the elements of temp.
If an element is 1, it appends the corresponding index to temp2.
It then prints the current iteration number, followed by a colon, followed by the elements of temp2.
If the current iteration number is 0, it only prints the colon and the elements of temp2.
