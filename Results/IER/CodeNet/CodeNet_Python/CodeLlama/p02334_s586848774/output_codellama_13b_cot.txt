  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first initializes two lists, fac and pw, and sets the value of mod to 10^9 + 7.
The code then appends 1 to both lists.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 2000.
For each iteration, the code appends the product of the previous value in fac and the current iteration number to fac.
The code then enters another loop that iterates from 1 to 1001.
For each iteration, the code appends the power of the current iteration number in fac to pw.
The code then takes the input from the user, which is 5 and 3.
The code then prints the product of fac[n+k-1], pw[n], and pw[k-1] modulo mod.
