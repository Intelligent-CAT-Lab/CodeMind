<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called input() that reads a line from the standard input and returns it without the trailing newline character.
The function resolve() is defined, which takes no arguments and performs the following steps:
1. It reads a line from the standard input and splits it into two integers, n and m, using the split() method.
2. It initializes a variable cnt to 0.
3. It checks if 2*n is less than or equal to m. If it is, it adds n to cnt, subtracts n*2 from m, and adds m//4 to cnt.
4. If the condition in step 3 is not met, it adds m//2 to cnt.
5. It prints the value of cnt.

The code then calls the resolve() function.
