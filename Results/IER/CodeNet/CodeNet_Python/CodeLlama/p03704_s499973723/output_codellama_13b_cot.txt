  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module and defines the read and readline functions from it.
The code then defines a function f(i,d) that takes two arguments, i and d.
The function calculates the sum of the digits of i and checks if it is equal to d.
If it is, the function returns the value of i.
If it is not, the function returns 0.
The code then defines a variable d and assigns it the value of the input.
The code then defines a variable ans and assigns it the value of 0.
The code then defines two dictionaries, d1 and d2, and initializes them with values.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to 18 (inclusive).
For each value of i in this range, the code calls the f(i,d) function and adds the result to the variable ans.
The code then checks if d is divisible by 10^9-10^8.
If it is, the code calculates the value of r and adds it to the variable ans.
Finally, the code prints the value of ans.
<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will depend on the input given.
If the input is 63, the output will be 1.
If the input is any other number, the output will be 0.
