<<<Analysis>>>
The code first converts the input string to an integer using the int() function.
The code then uses the // operator to divide the integer by 3600, which gives the number of hours.
The code then uses the % operator to get the number of minutes, which is the result of dividing the integer by 60 and taking the remainder.
The code then uses the % operator again to get the number of seconds, which is the result of dividing the integer by 60 and taking the remainder.
The code then uses the sep parameter of the print() function to specify the separator between the hours, minutes, and seconds.
