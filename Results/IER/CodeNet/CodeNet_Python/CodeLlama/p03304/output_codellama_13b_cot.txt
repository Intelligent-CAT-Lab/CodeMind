<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in three inputs: n, m, and d.
n and m are integers, and d is an integer that can be positive, negative, or zero.
The code then checks if d is greater than zero. If it is, it calculates the expression 2*(n-d)*(m-1)/n**2 and prints the result.
If d is not greater than zero, the code calculates the expression (m-1)/n and prints the result.
<<<Output>>>
