<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs, n and k, from the user.
n is assigned the value 2, and k is assigned the value 2.
The code then calculates the expression k*(k-1)**(n-1) and prints the result.
The expression can be evaluated as follows:
k = 2
k-1 = 1
(k-1)**(n-1) = 1**(2-1) = 1
k*(k-1)**(n-1) = 2*1 = 2
Therefore, the output of the code is 2.
<<<Output>>>
