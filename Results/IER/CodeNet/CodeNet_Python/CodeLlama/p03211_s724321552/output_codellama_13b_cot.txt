  <<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function B() that takes no arguments.
The function first assigns the input string S to the variable S.
The function then initializes a variable minA to a large value (1000000000000000).
The function then enters a loop that iterates from 3 to the length of S (inclusive).
For each iteration, the function calculates the absolute difference between the substring of S from the current index minus 3 to the current index and the number 753.
If the absolute difference is less than the current value of minA, the function updates minA to the new value.
The function then prints the final value of minA.

<<<Output>>>
The output of the code would be 1, as the absolute difference between the substring of S from the current index minus 3 to the current index and the number 753 is 1.
