  <<<Analysis>>>
The input is a list of three integers: 3, 1, and 4.
The code assigns the first element of the list to the variable a, the second element to the variable b, and the third element to the variable c.
The code then calculates the sum of b and c and stores it in the variable oishii.
The code calculates the sum of a and b and stores it in the variable gedoku.
The code calculates the sum of c and stores it in the variable doku.
The code checks if doku - gedoku is greater than 1, and if so, it adds 1 to gedoku and stores the result in the variable tabereru_doku. Otherwise, it stores the value of doku in the variable tabereru_doku.
The code then prints the value of tabereta_doku + b.
