<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input, a, b, and c.
The code then checks if the condition (c-a-b)**2-4*a*b>0 is true.
This condition is true when the difference between c and a is greater than the sum of a and b, and the square of this difference is greater than 4 times the product of a and b.
In this case, the condition is true when c is 9, a is 2, and b is 3.
The code then prints 'Yes' to the console.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
