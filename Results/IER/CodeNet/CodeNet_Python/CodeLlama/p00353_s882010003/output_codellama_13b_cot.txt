<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three inputs: m, f, and b.
The variable m is initialized to 1000, variable f is initialized to 3000, and variable b is initialized to 3000.
The code checks if b is less than or equal to m, which is true in this case.
If the condition is true, the code prints 0.
If the condition is false, the code checks if b is less than or equal to m + f, which is also true in this case.
If the condition is true, the code prints b - m, which is 3000 - 1000 = 2000.
If the condition is false, the code prints "NA".
