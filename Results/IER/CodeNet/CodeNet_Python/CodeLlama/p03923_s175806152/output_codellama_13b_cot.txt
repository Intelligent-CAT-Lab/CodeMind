  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user in the form of two space-separated integers, n and a.
The code then defines two functions, pow and binaryOne.
The pow function takes two integers, a and b, and returns a^b.
The binaryOne function takes two integers, n and multi, and returns the largest integer less than or equal to n that is a power of multi.
The code then defines a function, binaryTwo, which takes three integers, n, maxi, and multi, and returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to 0 that satisfies the equation a*i + maxi*(i + 1) - subt >= n, where i is an integer between 0 and multi - 1, and subt is the largest integer less than or equal to n that is a power of maxi - 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 40, and for each iteration, it calculates the value of ans using the following formula:
ans = min(ans, a*i + maxi*(i + 1) - subt)
The loop ends when the value of ans is less than 1e18.
The code then prints the final value of ans.
<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will be 1, since the value of ans will be 1 when the loop ends.
