  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in three inputs: n, m, and k.
n and m are used to initialize a list t with n*m+1 elements, all set to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n+1.
For each iteration, the code calculates the values of a and b based on the current value of i.
The code then enters a nested loop that iterates from 0 to m-1.
For each iteration, the code sets the value of t[a] to 1 and increments a by b.
After the nested loop finishes, the code checks if t[k] is equal to 0.
If it is, the code prints "No". Otherwise, it prints "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
