  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the necessary libraries, including sys, numpy, and math.
It then reads the input from stdin and splits it into four variables: N, M, L, and R.
The code then sets the recursion limit to 10^7 and initializes the variables U, MOD, and U.
It then calculates the factorial and its inverse using the formulae provided in the code.
The code then calculates the combination of N choose M and stores it in comb.
It then calculates the power series of (1-x)^(N+1) and stores it in Q.
It then defines a function f(R) that calculates the sum of the terms in the power series.
The code then calculates the answer by subtracting the value of f(L-1) from the value of f(R).
Finally, the code prints the answer.
<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will depend on the input provided.
For the input 4 2 3 7, the output will be 1.
