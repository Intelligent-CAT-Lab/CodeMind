  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input as a list of integers using the map() function.
The list is then sorted in descending order using the max() function.
The code then checks the index of the maximum value in the list and prints the corresponding letter.
The index of the maximum value in the list is 2, which corresponds to the letter "C".
<<<Output>>>
C
