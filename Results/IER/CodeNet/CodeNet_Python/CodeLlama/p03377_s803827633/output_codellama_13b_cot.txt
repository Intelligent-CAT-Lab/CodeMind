<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user in the form of three space-separated integers.
The first integer is stored in variable a, the second integer is stored in variable b, and the third integer is stored in variable x.
The code then checks if x is greater than or equal to a and less than or equal to a + b.
If the condition is met, the code prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'.
<<<Output>>>
YES
