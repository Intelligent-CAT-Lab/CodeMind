<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in four integers H, W, X, and Y as input.
The first line of the code calculates the product of H and W, and then multiplies it by X + Y.
The second line checks if the result of this calculation is odd or even.
If the result is odd, the code prints "No", otherwise it prints "Yes".

In this case, the input is 3, 5, 1, and 4.
The calculation is (3 * 5) * (1 + 4) = 30 * 5 = 150.
Since 150 is even, the code prints "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
