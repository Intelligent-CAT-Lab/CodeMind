  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input from the user and assigns it to the variables x and y.
The code then checks if y is equal to 0. If it is, it calculates the absolute value of x and assigns it to ans.
If y is not equal to 0, the code checks if x is less than or equal to -y. If it is, it calculates the absolute value of x and assigns it to ans.
If x is greater than -y but less than 0, it calculates the absolute value of x and adds y to it and assigns it to ans.
If x is greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to y, it calculates the absolute value of y and subtracts x from it and assigns it to ans.
If x is greater than y, it calculates the absolute value of y and subtracts x from it and assigns it to ans.
If y is less than 0, it calculates the absolute value of y and adds x to it and assigns it to ans.
The code then prints the value of ans.
