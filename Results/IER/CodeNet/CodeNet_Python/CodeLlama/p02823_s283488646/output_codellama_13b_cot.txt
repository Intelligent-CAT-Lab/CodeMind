  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module and defines the input function as sys.stdin.readline.
The code then reads the input from the user and maps it to the variables N, A, and B.
The code then checks if the absolute difference between A and B is even or odd.
If it is even, the code prints the absolute difference divided by 2.
If it is odd, the code checks if A-1 is less than N-B.
If it is, the code prints (A-1)+1+(B-A-1)//2.
If it is not, the code prints (N-B)+1+(B-A-1)//2.
