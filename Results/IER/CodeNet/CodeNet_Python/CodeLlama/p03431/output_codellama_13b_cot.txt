  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes two inputs, n and k, from the user.
It then initializes a list f with the value 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to k-1.
For each iteration, it calculates the value of f[i] as (-~i*f[i]%p)%p.
The code then calculates the sum of the product of f[i]*f[-2-i]^(-1)%p for i in range(n-1,k).
The code then prints the final value of the sum.
