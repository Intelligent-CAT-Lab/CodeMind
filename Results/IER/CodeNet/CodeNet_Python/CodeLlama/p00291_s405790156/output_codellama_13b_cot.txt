  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in 6 integers as input and assigns them to variables c1, c5, c10, c50, c100, and c500, respectively.
The code then calculates the sum of these variables and stores it in the variable sum.
The code then checks if the sum is greater than or equal to 1000. If it is, it prints 1. Otherwise, it prints 0.
