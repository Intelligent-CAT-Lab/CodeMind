  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input N from the user.
The code then initializes a variable can_be_ans to False, which will be used to check if the input N can be represented as the sum of two squares.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 10000 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 10000.
For each number k in this range, it checks if 2 * N is equal to k * (k - 1). If it is, it sets can_be_ans to True and breaks out of the loop.
If 2 * N is less than k * (k - 1), it breaks out of the loop.
If can_be_ans is still False after the loop finishes, the code prints "No".
If can_be_ans is True, the code prints "Yes" and the value of k.
The code then initializes a 2D list s_grid with k rows and k - 1 columns, and sets each element to 0.
The code then enters another loop that iterates from 1 to k + 1 (inclusive).
For each number i in this range, it enters another loop that iterates from 1 to k - i (inclusive).
For each pair of numbers (i, j) in this range, it sets the element at row i - 1 and column i - 1 + j of s_grid to (i - 1) * k - i * (i - 1) // 2 + 1 + j.
It also sets the element at row i + j and column i - 1 to (i - 1) * k - i * (i - 1) // 2 + 1 + j.
After the loops finish, the code prints the elements of s_grid, with each row separated by a newline character.
