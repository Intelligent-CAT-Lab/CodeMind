  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input n from the user.
It then initializes a 2D list lr_cnt with 10 rows and 10 columns, each initialized to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 25.
For each number i in this range, it converts it to a string str_i and extracts the first and last digits using slicing.
It then increments the value of lr_cnt[start][end] by 1, where start and end are the first and last digits of the number i.
The code then enters another loop that iterates over the rows and columns of lr_cnt, and for each cell, it calculates the product of the cell value and the transpose of the cell.
The product is then added to the variable ans.
After the loops finish, the code prints the final value of ans.
