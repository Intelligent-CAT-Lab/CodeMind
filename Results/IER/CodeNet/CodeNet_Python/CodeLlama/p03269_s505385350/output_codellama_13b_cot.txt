  <<<Analysis>>>
The variable L is initialized to 4, which is the input given.
The variable s is initialized to the binary representation of L, which is 100.
The variable l is initialized to the length of s, which is 3.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to l-1, meaning it will consider the first 3 bits of the binary representation of L.
For each bit i in this range, it appends two elements to the list ans. The first element is a list containing the current bit number i+1, the next bit number i+2, and the power of 2 corresponding to the current bit number. The second element is a list containing the current bit number i+1, the next bit number i+2, and 0.
The code then enters another loop that iterates from 1 to l, meaning it will consider the remaining bits of the binary representation of L.
For each bit k in this range, it checks if the current bit is 1. If it is, it appends another element to the list ans. The element is a list containing the current bit number 1, the next bit number k+1, and the power of 2 corresponding to the current bit number.
The code then prints the length of ans, which is 10.
