  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input n and initializes an empty list s.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 2^n-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 2^n-1.
For each number i in this range, it appends a string representation of i to s, followed by a colon.
The code then enters another loop that iterates from 0 to n-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider the bits of i.
For each bit j in this range, if the j-th bit of i is set, it appends a space followed by the decimal representation of j to s.
Finally, the code appends a newline character to s.
The code repeats this process for all numbers from 0 to 2^n-1.
After the loop finishes, the code joins the elements of s into a single string and prints it.
