  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes in three integers A, B, and C as input.
The code then calculates the maximum value of A, B, and C using the max() function.
The code then calculates the sum of the differences between the maximum value and the other two values.
The code then checks if the sum of the differences is equal to 0, 1, or 2.
If the sum is equal to 0, the code prints 0.
If the sum is equal to 1, the code prints 1.
If the sum is equal to 2, the code prints 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
