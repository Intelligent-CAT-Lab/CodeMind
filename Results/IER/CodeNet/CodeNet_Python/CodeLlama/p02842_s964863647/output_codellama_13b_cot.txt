<<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the math module, which provides mathematical functions.
The variable N is initialized to the integer value of the input, which is 432.
The variable x is initialized to the ceiling of N divided by 1.08, which is 464.
The code then checks if the floor of x multiplied by 1.08 is equal to N.
Since 464 multiplied by 1.08 is 482.72, which is not equal to 432, the code prints ":(".
