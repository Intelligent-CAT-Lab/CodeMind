<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input string and converts it into a list of characters using the list() function.
The variable c is initialized to 1, which will be used to count the number of distinct substrings in the input string.
The variable n is initialized to an empty string, which will be used to store the current substring.
The variable k is initialized to the first character of the input string, which will be used to compare with the current character in the loop.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the remaining characters in the input string, starting from the second character.
For each character i in the loop, the code appends the current character to the variable n and checks if the current character is different from the previous character. If it is, the code increments the variable c and resets the variable n to an empty string.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of c, which is 4.
<<<Output>>>
4
