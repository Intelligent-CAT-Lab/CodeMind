<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized to 15, which is the input given.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 15.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is divisible by 3 and 5. If both conditions are false, it adds i to sum.
The condition is met when i is 1,2,4,7,8,11,13 and 14.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum, which is 55.
<<<Output>>>
55
