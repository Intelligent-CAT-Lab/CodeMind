  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first initializes the variables N, X, Y, and Z to 3, 5, 7, and 5, respectively.
The code then calculates the value of m = 2^(X+Y+Z) = 2^15 = 32768.
The code initializes an array S of length m to all zeros.
The code then initializes the variables L, ss, and tt to the maximum value of X, Y, and Z, which is 7 in this case.
The code then calculates the values of Z0, Y0, and X0, which are 2^6, 2^12, and 2^14, respectively.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to m-1.
For each value of i, the code checks if i & Z0, i & Y0, and i & X0 are all true. If they are, the code adds i to the set ss.
The code then calculates the value of MASK = 2^(X+Y+Z) - 1 = 2^15 - 1 = 32767.
The code then calculates the value of MOD = 10^9 + 7 = 1000000007.
The code then initializes the value of S[0] to 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to N-1.
For each value of i, the code initializes an array T of length m to all zeros.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to m-1.
For each value of s, the code checks if s is in ss. If it is, the code continues to the next iteration.
The code then calculates the value of b = (s << 1) | 1 = (s << 1) + 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to L+1.
For each value of k, the code calculates the value of t = (b << (k-1)) & MASK.
The code then adds S[s] to T[t] and takes the result modulo MOD.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from L+1 to 10.
For each value of k, the code adds S[s] to T[0] and takes the result modulo MOD.
The code then sets S to T.
The code then initializes the variable ans to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to m-1.
For each value of s, the code checks if s is in ss. If it is, the code continues to the next iteration.
The code then adds S[s] to ans and takes the result modulo MOD.
The code then calculates the value of ans = (pow(10, N, MOD) + MOD - ans) % MOD.
The code then prints the value of ans.
