<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input as a string and splits it into a list of strings using the split() method.
The list is then converted to a list of integers using the int() function.
The list is then sorted using the sorted() function.
The code then compares the sorted list to a predefined list [1,4,7,9] using the == operator.
If the two lists are equal, the code sets the variable ans to 'YES', otherwise it sets it to 'NO'.
Finally, the code prints the value of ans.
<<<Output>>>
YES
