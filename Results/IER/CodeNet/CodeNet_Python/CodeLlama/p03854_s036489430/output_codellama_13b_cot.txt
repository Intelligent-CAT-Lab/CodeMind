  <<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function examC() that takes no arguments.
The function first initializes a variable St to an empty string.
The function then initializes a list t with the values "dream", "dreamer", "erase", and "eraser".
The function then initializes a variable i to the length of the string St minus 1.
The function then initializes a variable cur to an empty string.
The function then enters a while loop that iterates from i to 0 (inclusive).
For each iteration, the code appends the character at position i in the string St to the variable cur.
The code then checks if the string cur is in the list t.
If it is, the code sets the variable cur to an empty string.
The code then checks if the length of the string cur is 0.
If it is, the code sets the variable ans to "YES".
If it is not, the code sets the variable ans to "NO".
The code then prints the variable ans.

The code then calls the function examC() with no arguments.

The input to the code is a string "erasedream".

<<<Output>>>
