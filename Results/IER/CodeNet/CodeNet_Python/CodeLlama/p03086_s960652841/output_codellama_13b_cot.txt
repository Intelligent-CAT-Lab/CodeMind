The code imports the re module, which provides regular expression functionality.
The variable S is initialized to the input string "ATCODER".
The code then splits the input string into a list of substrings using the regular expression "[^ATGC]", which matches any character that is not A, T, G, or C.
The resulting list is stored in the variable splitted.
The code then iterates over the list of substrings and finds the maximum length of any substring.
The maximum length is stored in the variable max_length.
Finally, the code prints the value of max_length.
