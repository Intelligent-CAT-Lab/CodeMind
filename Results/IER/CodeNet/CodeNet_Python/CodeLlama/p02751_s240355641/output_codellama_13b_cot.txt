  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs, n and m, and initializes a list ans with the values 0 and 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to the minimum of n and m.
For each iteration, the code calculates the value of k as 2^i and x as 2^k - 1.
The code then creates a list slide with the values of ans shifted left by k bits.
The code then creates a new list new_ans by combining the values of slide and ans using the bitwise OR operator.
The code then extends new_ans with the values of slide and ans using the bitwise XOR operator.
The code then assigns the value of ans to new_ans.
If n is greater than m, the code multiplies the values of ans by 2^(n-m).
If n is less than m, the code shifts the values of ans left by m-n bits.
The code then calculates the values of ans by taking the bitwise XOR of the values of ans and the values of ans shifted right by 1 bit.
The code then prints the values of ans as a binary string with a length of 2^m - 1.
