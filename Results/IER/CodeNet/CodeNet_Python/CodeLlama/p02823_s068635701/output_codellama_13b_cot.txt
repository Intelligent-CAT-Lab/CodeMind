  <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n, variable a and variable b are initialized to 5, 2 and 4, respectively.
The variable diff is initialized to 4 - 2 = 2.
The code checks if diff is divisible by 2, which it is not.
The code then checks if a is less than n - b + 1, which is 5 - 4 + 1 = 2.
The code checks if diff is greater than 0, which it is.
The code prints a + (diff-1)//2, which is 2 + (2-1)//2 = 2 + 1 = 3.
