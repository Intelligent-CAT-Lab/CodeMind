  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first prompts the user to input a number n, which is 3 in this case.
The code then enters a loop that iterates n times, meaning it will consider 3 inputs.
For each input, it stores the input in a list called ss.
The code then calculates the sum of the lengths of the strings in ss and stores it in m.
The code then defines a function called overlap, which takes two indices c and d and returns the maximum overlap between the strings at indices c and d.
The code then defines a list of lists called ov, which stores the overlap between each pair of strings.
The code then defines a list of lists called memo, which stores the memoization of the overlap between each pair of strings.
The code then defines a function called rec, which takes two indices c and cs and returns the maximum overlap between the strings at indices c and d, using memoization.
The code then defines a function called naive_rec, which takes two indices c and cs and returns the maximum overlap between the strings at indices c and d, without memoization.
The code then calculates the maximum overlap between all pairs of strings using the rec function.
The code then calculates the sum of the lengths of the strings in ss minus the maximum overlap.
The code then prints the result.
