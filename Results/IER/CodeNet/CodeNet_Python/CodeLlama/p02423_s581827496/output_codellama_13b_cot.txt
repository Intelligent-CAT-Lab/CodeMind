  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input x from the user.
It then prints x in binary format using the f-string format specifier.
The code then translates the binary representation of x by swapping 0s and 1s.
The code then shifts the binary representation of x to the left by 1 bit and prints the last 32 bits.
Finally, the code shifts the binary representation of x to the right by 1 bit and prints the result.
