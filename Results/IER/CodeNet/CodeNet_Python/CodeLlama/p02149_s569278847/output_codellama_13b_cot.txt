The code first takes input from the user in the form of three integers separated by spaces.
The variables A, B, and C are initialized to these values.
The code then checks which of the three variables has the maximum value.
If A has the maximum value, the code prints "A".
If B has the maximum value, the code prints "B".
If C has the maximum value, the code prints "C".

The output of the code will depend on the values of A, B, and C.
