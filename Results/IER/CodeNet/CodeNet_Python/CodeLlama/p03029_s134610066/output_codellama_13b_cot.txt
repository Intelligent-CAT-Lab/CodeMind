<<<Analysis>>>
The code imports the math module and defines two variables a and p.
The input is then split into two integers, which are assigned to a and p, respectively.
The variable piece is then calculated as p + 3*a.
The code then uses the floor function to round down the value of piece to the nearest integer.
Finally, the code divides the rounded value by 2 and prints the result.

In this case, the input is 1 and 3, so a = 1 and p = 3.
The value of piece is then 3 + 3*1 = 7.
The rounded value of piece is 7/2 = 3.5, which is rounded down to 3.
The code then prints 3.
<<<Output>>>
3
