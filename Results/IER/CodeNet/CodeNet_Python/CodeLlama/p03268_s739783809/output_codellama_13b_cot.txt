  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the floor and ceil functions from the math module.
It then takes input N and K from the user.
The code then initializes ans to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive).
For each value of a in this range, the code checks if 2a is divisible by K.
If it is not, the code skips to the next iteration of the loop.
If it is, the code calculates the difference between the floor of (N+a)/K and the ceiling of (a+1)/K.
The code then squares this difference and adds it to ans.
The code then prints the final value of ans.
