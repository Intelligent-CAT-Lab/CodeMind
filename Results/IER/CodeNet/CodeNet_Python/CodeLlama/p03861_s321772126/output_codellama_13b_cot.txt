<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function f(n,deno) that returns the integer part of n divided by deno, plus 1.
The code then reads three integers a, b, and x from the input, using the list(map(int, input().split())) function.
The code then prints the result of f(b,x) - f(a-1, x), which is the difference between the integer part of b divided by x, plus 1, and the integer part of a-1 divided by x, plus 1.
