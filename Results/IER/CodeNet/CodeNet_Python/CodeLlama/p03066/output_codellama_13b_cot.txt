  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs, N and X, and calculates the number of ways to arrange 1s and 2s in a string of length N such that the sum of the digits is less than or equal to X.

The code first calculates the factorials and inverses of the numbers from 0 to N+10 using the modfac function.

The code then calculates the number of ways to arrange 1s and 2s in a string of length N using the modnCr function.

The code then calculates the number of ways to arrange 1s and 2s in a string of length N such that the sum of the digits is less than or equal to X using the following logic:

* If the sum of the digits is less than X, the number of ways to arrange 1s and 2s is equal to the number of ways to arrange 1s and 2s in a string of length N.
* If the sum of the digits is equal to X, the number of ways to arrange 1s and 2s is 0.
* If the sum of the digits is greater than X and less than 2X, the number of ways to arrange 1s and 2s is equal to the number of ways to arrange 1s and 2s in a string of length N-1, if the last digit is a 2, and 0 otherwise.
* If X is odd and the sum of the digits is 2X, the number of ways to arrange 1s and 2s is equal to the number of ways to arrange 1s and 2s in a string of length N-1, if the last digit is a 2, and 0 otherwise.

The code then prints the final answer, which is the sum of the number of ways to arrange 1s and 2s in a string of length N such that the sum of the digits is less than or equal to X for all possible values of N and X.

<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will be the number of ways to arrange 1s and 2s in a string of length N such that the sum of the digits is less than or equal to X.
