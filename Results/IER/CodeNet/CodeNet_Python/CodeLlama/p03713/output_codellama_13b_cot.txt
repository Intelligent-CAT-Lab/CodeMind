  <<<Analysis>>>
The variable h and variable w are initialized to 3 and 5, respectively.
The variable ans is initialized to 10^10.
The code checks if either h or w is divisible by 3. If either is, the code sets ans to 0 and exits the loop.
If neither h nor w is divisible by 3, the code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to w (inclusive) and from 1 to h (inclusive).
For each iteration of the loop, the code calculates the sum of the squares of the numbers from 1 to w (or h) and stores it in Sa (or Sb).
The code then calculates the sum of the squares of the numbers from 1 to w (or h) and stores it in Sc.
The code calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum of Sa, Sb, and Sc and stores it in dif.
The code then updates ans to be the minimum of the current value of ans and the current value of dif.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans.
