<<<Analysis>>>
The code first converts the input string "ABA" into a list of characters.
The code then checks if the first, second, and third elements of the list are all equal to each other.
Since the first, second, and third elements of the list are all "A", the condition is met, and the code prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
