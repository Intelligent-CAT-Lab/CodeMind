The code takes in a string input from the user, which is split into three substrings A, B, and C using the split() method.
The code then concatenates the first characters of each substring (A[0], B[0], and C[0]) and converts the result to uppercase using the upper() method.
The final result is then printed.
<<<Output>>>
