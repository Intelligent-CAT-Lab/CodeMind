  <<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function main that takes two arguments N and k.
The function first initializes three variables p, p2, and memo to 0.
The function then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to N-1.
For each iteration, the loop calculates the value of p2 as k*(p2+1)//(k-1) - 2.
The loop also updates the value of p to be equal to p2.
The loop continues until the condition p2-1-p2//k != p is met.
The function returns the value of p2.

The code then checks if the module name is main, and if it is, it reads the input from the user and passes it to the main function.
The main function returns the output of the main function, which is the value of p2.

The output of the code will depend on the input given by the user.
