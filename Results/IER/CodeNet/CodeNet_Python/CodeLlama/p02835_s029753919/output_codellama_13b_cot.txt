<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in three integers A, B, and C as input, separated by spaces.
The variables A, B, and C are initialized to 5, 7, and 9, respectively.
The code then checks if the sum of A, B, and C is greater than 21.
Since 5+7+9 = 21, the condition is not met, and the code prints 'win'.
<<<Output>>>
win
