<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input n and k as integers and stores them in variables n and k, respectively.
The code then calculates the integer division of n by k, which is stored in rot.
The code then checks if k is equal to 1, n is equal to k, or n is divisible by k. If any of these conditions is met, the code sets x to 0.
If none of the above conditions are met, the code calculates the remainder of n divided by k, which is stored in t.
The code then prints the minimum of t and the absolute value of t minus k.
