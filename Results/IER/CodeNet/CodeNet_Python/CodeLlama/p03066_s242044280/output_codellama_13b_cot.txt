  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the necessary libraries, including sys, numpy, and math.
It then defines a function called cumprod, which calculates the cumulative product of an array.
The code then defines a function called make_fact, which calculates the factorial of a number and its inverse.
The code then defines three functions called F1, F2, and F3, which calculate the number of ways to reach a certain point in a cumulative sum.
The main function of the code is to calculate the sum of the number of ways to reach a certain point in a cumulative sum, which is calculated by calling the three functions F1, F2, and F3.
The code then takes the input from the user, which is a pair of integers N and X.
The code then calculates the answer by calling the main function and printing the result.
<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will be the number of ways to reach a certain point in a cumulative sum, which is calculated by calling the three functions F1, F2, and F3.
The output will be a single integer, which is the sum of the number of ways to reach a certain point in a cumulative sum.
