<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user and stores it in the variable s.
The variable ss is initialized to an empty string.
The variable p is initialized to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the characters in the string s.
For each character, it checks if the current character is "C" and if the previous character was "F". If both conditions are met, it sets the variable p to 2.
After the loop finishes, the code prints "Yes" if p is 2, and "No" otherwise.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
