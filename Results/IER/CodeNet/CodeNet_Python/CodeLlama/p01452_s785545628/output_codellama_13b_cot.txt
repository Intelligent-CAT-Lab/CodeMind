  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module and defines two functions, readline and write, which are used to read input from stdin and write output to stdout, respectively.
The code then defines a function called solve, which is the main function of the program.
The solve function first initializes the variables MOD, N, M, and K to the values read from stdin.
The code then calculates the value of L, which is the sum of N, M, and 2K.
The code then initializes two arrays, fact and rfact, which are used to store the values of the factorial and the reverse factorial of L.
The code then defines two functions, C and F, which are used to calculate the binomial coefficient and the falling factorial, respectively.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to K, and for each value of a, it calculates the value of b as K-a.
The code then calculates the value of ans using the formula given in the problem statement.
The code then prints the value of ans.
