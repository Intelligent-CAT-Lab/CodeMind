<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user and stores it in the variable n.
The variable n is then converted to an integer using the int() function.
The code then calculates the sum of the first two digits of n and stores it in a.
The code then calculates the sum of the last two digits of n and stores it in b.
The code then checks if b is equal to 0 or greater than 12.
If b is equal to 0 or greater than 12, the code checks if a is between 1 and 12.
If a is between 1 and 12, the code prints "MMYY".
If a is not between 1 and 12, the code prints "NA".
If b is not equal to 0 or greater than 12, the code checks if a is between 1 and 12.
If a is between 1 and 12, the code prints "AMBIGUOUS".
If a is not between 1 and 12, the code prints "YYMM".
<<<Output>>>
AMBIGUOUS
