  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input string and converts it into a list of characters using the list() function.
It then maps each character to its ASCII value using the ord() function and subtracts 97 from it to get the corresponding index in the alphabet.
The resulting list is stored in the variable S.
The code then initializes a list of 26 zeros called alpha and iterates over the list S.
For each element in S, it sets the corresponding index in alpha to 1.
If the length of S is not equal to 26, the code checks if there are any indices in alpha that are still 0. If there are, it appends the first such index to S and prints the resulting list of characters.
If the length of S is equal to 26, the code checks if there are any indices in alpha that are still 0. If there are, it finds the first such index and appends it to S. It then prints the resulting list of characters.
If neither of the above conditions are met, the code prints -1.
<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will depend on the input string. If the input string is "atcoder", the output will be "abcd".
