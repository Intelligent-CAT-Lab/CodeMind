  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first prompts the user to input an integer n.
The variable n is then initialized to the input value.
The variable l is initialized to an empty list.
The variable i is initialized to 1.
The code enters a while loop that iterates while n is greater than 0.
For each iteration, the code subtracts i from n and calculates the value of t as i(i-1)/2.
The code then appends the list [t+1, t+i+1] to l.
The variable i is then incremented by 1.
The loop continues until n is less than or equal to 0.
If n is less than 0, the code prints "No" and exits.
If n is greater than or equal to 0, the code prints "Yes".
The variable i is then decremented by 1.
The code then calculates the value of ans as [i+1, i, l[j][-1] for j in range(i)].
The code then appends the list [i, l[j] for j in range(i)] to ans for each j in range(i).
The code then joins the elements of ans using a space character and prints the result.
