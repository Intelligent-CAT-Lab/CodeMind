  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input K from the user.
If K is less than or equal to 500, the code prints K and then prints a 2D array of size KxK, where each element is a string representation of its row and column index.
If K is greater than 500, the code calculates KUP as ((K+1)//2+3)//4*4, which is the smallest multiple of 4 greater than K.
The code then initializes a 2D array ANS of size KUPxKUP and sets its elements to 0.
The code then sets the elements of ANS to the values of the indices of the array, with the first row and column containing the values 1 to KUP, and the second row and column containing the values KUP+1 to 2KUP.
The code then modifies the elements of ANS to have the values of the indices of the array, with the first row and column containing the values 1 to KUP, and the second row and column containing the values KUP+1 to 2KUP.
The code then prints the elements of ANS.
