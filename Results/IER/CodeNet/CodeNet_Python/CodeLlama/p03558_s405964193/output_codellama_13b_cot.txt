  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first defines a function bfs01 that takes in four arguments:
* s: the starting vertex
* t: the target vertex
* V: the number of vertices in the graph
* graph: the graph represented as a list of edges

The function then initializes some variables:
* INF: a large constant used to represent infinity
* q: a queue data structure used to keep track of the vertices to visit
* qc: the number of vertices in the queue
* l: an array used to keep track of the shortest distance from the starting vertex to each vertex

The function then adds the starting vertex to the queue and sets its distance to 0.

The function then enters a loop that iterates while the queue is not empty.
For each vertex u in the queue, the function iterates over all its neighbors v and updates their distances if necessary.
The function then removes u from the queue and adds its neighbors to the queue if they have not been visited before.

The function then returns the shortest distance from the starting vertex to the target vertex.

The code then defines a function small_multiple that takes in one argument:
* K: the number of vertices in the graph

The function then initializes a graph with K vertices and K-1 edges.
The function then calls the bfs01 function with the starting vertex set to 1, the target vertex set to 0, the number of vertices set to K, and the graph set to the graph initialized by the function.

The function then returns the result of the bfs01 function plus 1.

The code then defines a main function that takes in one argument:
* K: the number of vertices in the graph

The function then calls the small_multiple function with the argument K.

The function then prints the result of the small_multiple function.

<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will depend on the input given to the program.
If the input is 6, the output will be 11.
