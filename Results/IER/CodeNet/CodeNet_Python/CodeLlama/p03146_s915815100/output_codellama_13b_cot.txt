  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first defines a function B() that takes no arguments.
The function defines a defaultdict(int) called d and an integer called s.
The function defines a function f(n) that takes an integer n as an argument.
If n is odd, the function returns 3n+1.
If n is even, the function returns n//2.
The function then sets i to 1.
The function enters a while loop that continues until d[s] is true.
The loop increments i by 1 and sets d[s] to 1.
The loop then sets s to f(s).
The loop repeats until d[s] is true.
The function then prints i.
The function returns.
The code then calls the function B().
