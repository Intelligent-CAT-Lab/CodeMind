  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the defaultdict class from the collections module.
It then initializes a defaultdict object d with an integer as the default value.
The variable S is initialized to the input string.
The code then reverses the string S using the slicing notation.
The variable i is initialized to 1.
The variable x is initialized to 0.
The variable MOD is initialized to 2019.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the characters in the reversed string S.
For each character s in S, it calculates the value of x as (int(s)*i)%MOD.
It then increments i by 10 and takes the modulo of MOD.
The code then updates the value of d[x] by adding 1 to it.
The code then calculates the value of ans as the sum of the values of d[k]*(k-1)/2 for each key k in d.
Finally, the code prints the value of ans+d[0].
