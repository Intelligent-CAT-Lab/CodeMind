<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in three integers a, b, and x as input.
The first line of the code calculates the integer division of b by x, which is 4 // 2 = 2.
The second line of the code calculates the integer division of (a - 1) by x, which is (4 - 1) // 2 = 1.
The final line of the code subtracts the result of the second line from the result of the first line, which is 2 - 1 = 1.
The code then prints the result of the subtraction, which is 1.
