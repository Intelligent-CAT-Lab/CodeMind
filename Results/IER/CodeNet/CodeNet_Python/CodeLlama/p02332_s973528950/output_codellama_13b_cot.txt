  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the necessary libraries and sets the recursion limit to 10000001.
It then defines a function named main() which takes two inputs n and k.
The function first checks if n is greater than k, if it is, it prints 0 and exits.
If n is less than or equal to k, it calculates the value of a and b using the formula for factorials.
It then calculates the value of ans using the formula for division and modulo.
Finally, it prints the value of ans.

<<<Output>>>
