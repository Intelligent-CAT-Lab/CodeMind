  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module, which is used to read input from the standard input stream.
The code then reads a line of input from the standard input stream and splits it into three parts using the space character as a delimiter. The parts are assigned to the variables K, A, and B, respectively.
The code then converts the strings K, A, and B to integers using the long() function.
The code then checks if the difference between B and A is greater than or equal to 2. If it is, the code calculates the number of steps that can be taken by moving from A to B in a straight line, which is (b-a) - 1. It then calculates the number of leftover steps that need to be taken to reach the final destination, which is k - hitsteps.
The code then calculates the number of swaps needed to reach the final destination, which is (leftoversteps-rem)/2.
The code then calculates the number of biscuits needed to reach the final destination, which is swaps * (b-a).
The code then prints the final number of biscuits needed to reach the final destination, which is multbiscuits + rem + a.
If the difference between B and A is less than 2, the code simply prints k+1.
