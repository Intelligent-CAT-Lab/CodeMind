  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user in the form of two integers, n and d.
The code then checks if d is equal to 1. If it is, the code calculates the number of ways to connect n nodes in a graph and prints the result.
If d is not equal to 1, the code calculates the number of ways to connect n nodes in a graph with d edges and prints the result.
