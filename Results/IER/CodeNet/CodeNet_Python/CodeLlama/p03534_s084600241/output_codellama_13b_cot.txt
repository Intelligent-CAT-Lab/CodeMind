  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input string S and splits it into a list of characters.
The code then counts the number of occurrences of each character in the list and stores it in a list called nums.
The code then sorts the list nums in ascending order.
The code then subtracts the first element of nums from the last element of nums.
The code then subtracts the first element of nums from the second element of nums.
The code then defines a function called check that checks if the conditions are met.
The code then prints "YES" if the function check returns True, and "NO" otherwise.

<<<Output>>>
YES
