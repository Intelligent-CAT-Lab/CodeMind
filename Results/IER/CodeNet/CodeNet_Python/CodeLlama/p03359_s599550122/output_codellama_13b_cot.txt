<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs from the user, A and B, and converts them to integers.
The code then checks if B is greater than or equal to A.
If B is greater than or equal to A, the code prints A.
If B is less than A, the code prints A-1.

In this case, the input is 5 5, so A=5 and B=5.
The code checks if B is greater than or equal to A, which is true.
So, the output is 5.
<<<Output>>>
5
