  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes two inputs from the user, N and K, and then creates three lists: C, A, and B.
The lists are created by using the range function, which generates a sequence of numbers.
The first list, C, is created by using the range function to generate a sequence of numbers from K+2*N to K+3*N.
The second list, A, is created by using the range function to generate a sequence of numbers from K to K+N.
The third list, B, is created by using the range function to generate a sequence of numbers from K+N to K+2*N.

The code then creates an instance of the PMS class, which is a data structure that is used to solve the problem.
The PMS class is initialized with the lists A and B, and the variable issum is set to False.

The code then checks if the sum of the elements in the list A is less than or equal to the sum of the elements in the list C.
If this condition is not met, the code sets the variable ans to -1, which indicates that the problem cannot be solved.

If the condition is met, the code then checks if the number of odd numbers in the list A is less than the number of even numbers.
If this is the case, the code creates a new list, AA, by alternating the elements of the list A.
Otherwise, the code creates a new list, AA, by alternating the elements of the list A.

The code then iterates over the elements of the list AA, and for each element, it calculates the value of the variable bx, which is the difference between the element and the corresponding element in the list C.
The code then uses the PMS class to find the number of elements in the list B that are less than or equal to bx.
If this number is 0, the code sets the variable ans to -1, which indicates that the problem cannot be solved.
Otherwise, the code finds the element in the list B that is less than or equal to bx, and adds it to the list Ans.
The code then updates the PMS class to reflect the removal of the element from the list B.

Finally, the code checks if the variable ans is still equal to 1, which indicates that the problem can be solved.
If this is the case, the code prints the elements of the list Ans, which are the pairs of elements from the lists A and B that satisfy the conditions of the problem.
Otherwise, the code prints the variable ans, which is -1, which indicates that the problem cannot be solved.

<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will depend on the input given to the code.
If the input is 1 1, the output will be -1, which indicates that the problem cannot be solved.
This is because the sum of the elements in the list A is greater than the sum of the elements in the list C.
