The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if A <= sum_order <= B, which is true when sum_order is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
If the condition is met, the current number i is added to sum_1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
