  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input as two integers x and y, and then calculates their absolute values using the abs() function.
The code then checks the conditions in the if statements and prints the corresponding output based on the condition that is met.
The first condition is if 0 <= x < y, which is not met in this case.
The second condition is if 0 < y < x, which is not met in this case.
The third condition is if y == 0 and 0 < x, which is not met in this case.
The fourth condition is if x < y <= 0, which is not met in this case.
The fifth condition is if y < x < 0, which is not met in this case.
The sixth condition is if x == 0 and y < 0, which is not met in this case.
The seventh condition is if x < 0 < y, which is not met in this case.
The eighth condition is if y < 0 < x, which is not met in this case.
The code then exits without printing anything.
