  <<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called calc that takes an integer k as input.
The function first checks if k is equal to 1, and if so, it returns 1.
If k is not equal to 1, the function initializes a dictionary called d to store the values of the function for each value of n.
The function also initializes a deque called q to store the values of n and c.
The function then enters a while loop that iterates until q is empty.
In each iteration, the loop pops the first element of q and assigns it to n and c.
The function then calculates the values of a and b using the formulae (n * 10) % k and (n + 1) % k.
The function then checks if a and b are not in d or if the value of c is less than the value of d[a] or d[b], respectively.
If either of these conditions is true, the function updates the value of d[a] or d[b] and appends the corresponding values of n and c to the end of q.
The function then returns the value of d[0].

The code then calls the calc function with the input k = 6.
<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will be 4.
