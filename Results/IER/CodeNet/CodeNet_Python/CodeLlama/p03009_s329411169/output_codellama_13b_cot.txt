  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in three inputs: N, H, and D.
N is the number of elements in the array, H is the height of the pyramid, and D is the number of elements to be removed.
The code initializes a variable MOD to 10^9 + 7, which is used for modular arithmetic.
The code then initializes a variable fact to 1, which will be used to calculate the factorial of N.
The code then initializes a variable s to 0, which will be used to calculate the sum of the factorials of the elements in the array.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N+1, which means it will consider elements from 1 to N.
For each element i in this range, the code calculates the factorial of i and stores it in fact.
The code then calculates the sum of the factorials of the elements in the array and stores it in s.
The code then initializes a variable dp to an array of size H, which will be used to store the number of ways to arrange the elements in the array.
The code initializes the first element of dp to 1, which means there is only one way to arrange the elements in the array if there is only one element.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to H, which means it will consider the number of ways to arrange the elements in the array for each height of the pyramid.
For each height i in this range, the code calculates the number of ways to arrange the elements in the array and stores it in dp[i].
The code then calculates the number of ways to arrange the elements in the array for the current height and stores it in ret.
The code then checks if the current height is greater than or equal to D, which means the number of elements to be removed.
If it is, the code subtracts the number of ways to arrange the elements in the array for the current height minus the number of elements to be removed from the total number of ways to arrange the elements in the array.
The code then prints the final value of ret multiplied by fact modulo MOD.
