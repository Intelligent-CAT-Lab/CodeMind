<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input and stores them in variables n and m.
The code then checks if n and m are both equal to 1. If they are, the code prints 1.
If n and m are not both equal to 1, the code checks if the smaller of the two numbers is equal to 1. If it is, the code prints the larger number minus 2.
If neither of the above conditions are met, the code prints the product of the two numbers minus 2.

In this case, the input is 2 2, so n = 2 and m = 2. The code does not meet any of the above conditions, so it prints (2-2) * (2-2) = 0.
