The variable X is initialized to 6.
The function main() is called, which initializes the variables t and curr to 0.
The while loop starts, and the condition curr < X is checked. Since curr is 0 and X is 6, the condition is true, and the loop continues.
The loop increments t by 1 and adds t to curr. After the first iteration, t is 1 and curr is 1.
The condition curr < X is checked again, and since curr is now 1 and X is still 6, the condition is true, and the loop continues.
The loop increments t by 1 and adds t to curr. After the second iteration, t is 2 and curr is 3.
The condition curr < X is checked again, and since curr is now 3 and X is still 6, the condition is true, and the loop continues.
The loop increments t by 1 and adds t to curr. After the third iteration, t is 3 and curr is 6.
The condition curr < X is checked again, and since curr is now 6 and X is still 6, the condition is false, and the loop exits.
The function main() prints the value of t, which is 3.
