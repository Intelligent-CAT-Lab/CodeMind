  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the math module, which is not used in the code.
The code then reads two integers x and y from the input, separated by a space.
The code then initializes the mod variable to 10^9 + 7, which is a large prime number used for modular arithmetic.
The code then calculates the number of moves needed to reach the target position, which is (x+y)//3.
The code then checks if the number of moves is divisible by 3, and if not, it prints 0 and exits.
The code then subtracts the number of moves from x and y, and checks if they are both non-negative. If not, it prints 0 and exits.
The code then defines a function cmb(n, r, mod) that calculates the binomial coefficient (n choose r) modulo mod.
The code then initializes the g1, g2, and inverse arrays with values.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to N+1, where N is the sum of x and y.
The code calculates the values of g1, g2, and inverse for each iteration.
The code then calculates the final answer using the cmb function.
The code then prints the final answer.
