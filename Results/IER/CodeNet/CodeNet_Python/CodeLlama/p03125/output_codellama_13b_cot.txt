<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, x and y, from the user.
The code then checks if y is divisible by x.
If y is divisible by x, the code prints x+y.
If y is not divisible by x, the code prints y-x.

In this case, y is 12 and x is 4.
y is divisible by x, so the code prints x+y, which is 16.
<<<Output>>>
16
