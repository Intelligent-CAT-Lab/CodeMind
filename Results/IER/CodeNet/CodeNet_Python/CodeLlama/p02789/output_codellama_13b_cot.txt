<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user and splits it into a list of integers using the split() method.
The list is then assigned to the variable a.
The code then checks if the first element of the list (a[0]) is equal to the second element of the list (a[1]).
If the condition is met, the code prints 'Yes', otherwise it prints 'No'.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
