  <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized to 127.
The list l is initialized to [1, 6, 9, 6 ** 2, 9 ** 2, 6 ** 3, 9 ** 3].
The list l is sorted.
The variable INF is initialized to 10 ** 3.
The list dp is initialized to [0] + [INF] * N.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 127.
For each number n in this range, it iterates through the list l and checks if n - f is greater than or equal to 0. If it is, it updates the value of dp[n] to the minimum of dp[n] and dp[n - f] + 1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of dp[-1], which is the last element of the list dp.
