  <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to the input string "1222".
The variable op_cnt is initialized to the length of n minus 1, which is 3.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 2^op_cnt (inclusive), meaning it will consider 8 different combinations of operators.
For each combination, it creates a list of operators (initially all '-') and replaces the last operator with '+' if the corresponding bit in the combination is 1.
For example, for the first combination (i=0), the list of operators is ['-', '-', '-']. For the second combination (i=1), the list of operators is ['-', '-', '+'].
The code then creates a string formula by concatenating the numbers and operators, and checks if the formula evaluates to 7 using the eval() function.
The formula for the first combination is "1-2-3-4", which does not evaluate to 7.
The formula for the second combination is "1-2-3+4", which does evaluate to 7.
The code prints the formula and breaks out of the loop.
<<<Output>>>
1-2-3+4=7
