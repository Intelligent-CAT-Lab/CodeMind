  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first initializes two variables N and M to 2 and 998244353, respectively.
It then initializes a 2D list DP with 6000 rows and 6000 columns, each initialized to -1.
The code then defines a function P(n,k) that takes two integers n and k as input.
The function checks if n is less than 0 or k is less than 1, and if so, returns 0.
If DP[n][k] is not -1, it returns DP[n][k].
If k is 1, it sets DP[n][k] to 1 and returns 1.
Otherwise, it sets DP[n][k] to the sum of P(n,k-1) and P(n-k,k) modulo M.
It then enters a loop that iterates from 5500 to 1, and for each iteration, it calls the function P(i+1,j+1) for each j in the range from 0 to i.
It then initializes a list X with 0 and sets DP[0][0] to 1.
It then enters another loop that iterates from 5500 to 1, and for each iteration, it appends 0 to X and sets DP[i][i] to the sum of DP[j][j] and DP[i-j][i-j] modulo M for each j in the range from 0 to i.
It then initializes a list Y with 0 and enters a loop that iterates from 10800 to 1, and for each iteration, it appends Y[i] to Y and sets Y[i] to the sum of Y[i] and X[i>>1] modulo M.
It then initializes a variable P to 0 and enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N+1, and for each iteration, it sets P to the sum of P and X[i] modulo M.
If 2*i is greater than N, it sets P to the difference of P and Y[2*i-N] modulo M.
It then prints P.

The output of the code will be 1000000000.
