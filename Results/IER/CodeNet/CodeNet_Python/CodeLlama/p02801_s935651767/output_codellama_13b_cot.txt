The code takes a single character as input using the input() function.
The ord() function is then used to convert the character to its ASCII code.
The +1 operation is then performed on the ASCII code to increment it by 1.
The chr() function is then used to convert the resulting ASCII code back to a character.
The print() function is then used to print the resulting character.
