  The output of the code is:

C) Hello, Alice!
   Hello, Bob!

Explanation:
The code defines a function called `greet` that takes a string as an argument and prints a greeting message. The function is then called twice with different arguments, resulting in two separate greeting messages being printed. Therefore, the output of the code is option C) Hello, Alice! Hello, Bob!
