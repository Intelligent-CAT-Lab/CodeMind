<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input n from the user.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the number of times the input n is divisible by 25, 10, 5, and 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the tuple (25, 10, 5, 1).
For each element x in the tuple, the code calculates the quotient of n by x and stores it in ans.
The code then calculates the remainder of n by x and stores it in n.
The loop repeats until the tuple is exhausted.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is the number of times the input n is divisible by 25, 10, 5, and 1.
