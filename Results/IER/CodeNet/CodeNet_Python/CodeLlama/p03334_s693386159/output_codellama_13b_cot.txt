  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the necessary libraries: math, itertools, and numpy.
It then defines a function called helper, which takes two arguments: N and D.
The function first checks if D is odd, and if it is, it initializes a grid of size (N,N) with all elements set to False.
It then sets the elements in the grid to True at positions (i,j) where i is even and j is odd, and sets the elements to False at positions (i,j) where i is odd and j is even.
If D is even, the function initializes a grid of size (N,N) with all elements set to True.
If D is a multiple of 4, the function recursively calls itself with arguments (N,D//4) and returns the result.
The function then returns the grid.

The code then defines a function called main, which takes three arguments: N, D1, and D2.
It first calls the helper function with arguments (N*2, D1) and stores the result in a variable called g1.
It then calls the helper function with arguments (N*2, D2) and stores the result in a variable called g2.
It then computes the intersection of g1 and g2 and stores the result in a variable called ans.
It then iterates over the non-zero elements of ans and prints their indices.

The code then calls the main function with arguments 2, 1, and 2.
