  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first defines three functions: getN, getNM, and getList. These functions are not used in the code, so they can be ignored.
The code then calls the getN function, which returns the integer value of the input. The input is 4, so the value of N is 4.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 10000 (inclusive). The loop checks if the current value of i (which is 1) multiplied by the next value of i (which is 2) divided by 2 is greater than or equal to N (which is 4). Since 1*2/2 = 1, which is less than 4, the loop continues.
The loop continues until the value of i is 10000, at which point the condition is met. The value of M is set to 10000, and the value of upper is set to 10000*(10000+1)/2 = 50005000. The loop breaks.
The code then enters another loop that iterates from 1 to M (inclusive). The loop checks if the current value of i (which is 1) is not equal to the value of diff (which is 50005000 - 4 = 50004996). Since 1 is not equal to 50004996, the loop continues.
The loop continues until the value of i is 10000, at which point the condition is met. The loop prints the value of j (which is 2) to the console.
The code then prints the sum of the elements in the list tar (which is empty), the value of M (which is 10000), the value of upper (which is 50005000), and the value of diff (which is 50004996).
The code then checks if the value 1628 is in the list tar (which is empty). Since it is not, the code does not print anything.
