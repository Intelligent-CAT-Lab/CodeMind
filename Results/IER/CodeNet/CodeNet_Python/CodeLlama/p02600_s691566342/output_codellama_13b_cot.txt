  <<<Analysis>>>
The variable x is initialized to 725, which is an integer.
The variable result is initialized to 0.
The code then enters a series of if-elif statements that check if x is less than or equal to certain values.
If x is less than or equal to 599, the result is set to 8.
If x is less than or equal to 799, the result is set to 7.
If x is less than or equal to 999, the result is set to 6.
If x is less than or equal to 1199, the result is set to 5.
If x is less than or equal to 1399, the result is set to 4.
If x is less than or equal to 1599, the result is set to 3.
If x is less than or equal to 1799, the result is set to 2.
If none of the above conditions are met, the result is set to 1.
The code then prints the final value of result, which is 4.
