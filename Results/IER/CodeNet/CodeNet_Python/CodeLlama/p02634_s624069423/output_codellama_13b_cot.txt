  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in four integers as input, a, b, c, and d.
The code then initializes a 2D list dp with dimensions (c, d) and sets dp[a-1][b-1] to 1.
The code then checks if a=c and b=d, and if so, it prints 1 and exits.
If a=c but b!=d, it prints (a**(d-b))%mod and exits.
If b=d but a!=c, it prints (b**(c-a))%mod and exits.
If none of the above conditions are met, the code enters a nested for loop that iterates over y from a-1 to c-1 and x from b-1 to d-1.
For each iteration, the code calculates dp[y][x] as dp[y][x-1]*(y+1) + dp[y-1][x]*(x+1) - dp[y-1][x-1]*x*y.
The code then sets dp[y][x] to dp[y][x]%mod.
Finally, the code prints dp[-1][-1]%mod.
