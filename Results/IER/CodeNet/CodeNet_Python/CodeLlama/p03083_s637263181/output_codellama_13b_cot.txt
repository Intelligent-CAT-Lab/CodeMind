  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the factorial function from the math module and defines two variables B and W, which are initialized to 2 and 1, respectively.
The code then defines a function comb that calculates the binomial coefficient of two integers n and r.
The function comb first checks if n is greater than or equal to r, and if it is, it calculates the numerator and denominator of the binomial coefficient using the factorial function.
The function comb then returns the result of the numerator divided by the denominator.
The code then defines two lists, ans and ans_change, which are initialized to 0.
The code then calculates the value of change, which is the binomial coefficient of B-1 and 0, and stores it in change.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to W+1.
For each value of i, the code calculates the value of change2, which is the binomial coefficient of B+i-1 and 0, and stores it in change2.
The code then updates the values of ans_change[1], ans_change[B+i], and ans_change[B+i+1] based on the values of change and change2.
The code then updates the value of change based on the value of i.
The code then enters another loop that iterates from 0 to B+W+1.
For each value of i, the code updates the value of ans[i] based on the values of ans[i-1] and ans_change[i].
The code then calculates the value of x, which is 2^B+W, and stores it in x.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to B+W+1.
For each value of y in ans[1:], the code calculates the value of y^mod-2 and stores it in y.
The code then prints the value of y.
