<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes the input as a string and splits it into three parts using the "/" character as a delimiter.
The first part is assigned to variable A, the second part is assigned to variable B, and the third part is assigned to variable C.
The code then checks if the value of A is less than or equal to 2018. If it is, the code prints "Heisei".
If the value of A is equal to 2019 and the value of B is less than or equal to 4, and the value of C is less than or equal to 30, the code prints "Heisei".
If none of the above conditions are met, the code prints "TBD".

In this case, the input is "2019/04/30", so the value of A is 2019, the value of B is 04, and the value of C is 30.
The code meets the second condition, so it prints "Heisei".
<<<Output>>>
Heisei
