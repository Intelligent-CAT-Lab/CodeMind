  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in four integers as input, a, b, c, and x.
The code first checks if the absolute difference between a and c is less than or equal to x. If this condition is met, the code prints "Yes".
If the first condition is not met, the code checks if the absolute difference between a and b is less than or equal to x and the absolute difference between b and c is less than or equal to x. If this condition is met, the code prints "Yes".
If neither of the above conditions are met, the code prints "No".

<<<Output>>>
No
