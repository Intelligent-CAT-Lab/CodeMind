  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module, which is used to exit the program.
The variable N is initialized to the input given by the user, which is 2 in this case.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 3500 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 3500.
For each number h in this range, it enters another loop that iterates from h to 3500 (inclusive).
For each number n in this range, the code checks if the expression 4*n*h-N*h-N*n is greater than 0. If it is, it checks if the expression (N*h*n)%(4*n*h-N*h-N*n) is equal to 0. If it is, it calculates the value of w as (N*h*n)/(4*n*h-N*h-N*n) and prints the values of h, n, and w.
The code then exits the program using the sys.exit() function.
<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will be the values of h, n, and w that satisfy the conditions in the code. Since the input is 2, the only possible values of h and n are 1 and 2, respectively. The value of w will be 1.
The output will be:
1 2 1
