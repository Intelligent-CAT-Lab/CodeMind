  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the math module, which provides mathematical functions such as factorial.
The code then defines a function called combination that takes two integers i and j as input and returns the binomial coefficient C(i, j) = i! / (j! \* (i - j)!).
The code then defines a function called main that takes two integers n and k as input and calculates the number of ways to choose k elements from a set of n elements.
The code then checks if k is less than or equal to n, and if it is, it calculates the number of ways to choose k elements from a set of n elements.
The code then prints the final answer.
