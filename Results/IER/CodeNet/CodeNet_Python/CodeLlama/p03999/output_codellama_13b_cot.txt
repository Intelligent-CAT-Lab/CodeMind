  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes the input string "125" and stores it in the variable s.
The code then initializes the variable ans to 0.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 2^(length of s - 1) - 1, which is 2^2 - 1 = 3.
For each iteration, the code initializes the variable pat to the first character of s, which is "1".
The code then enters a nested loop that iterates from 1 to the length of s - 1, which is 2.
For each iteration, the code checks if the current iteration is odd by checking if i >> j & 1 is true. If it is, the code adds a "+" to pat.
The code then adds the current character of s to pat and increments the index.
The code then evaluates pat using the eval() function and adds the result to ans.
The code repeats this process for each iteration of the outer loop.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 125.
<<<Output>>>
125
