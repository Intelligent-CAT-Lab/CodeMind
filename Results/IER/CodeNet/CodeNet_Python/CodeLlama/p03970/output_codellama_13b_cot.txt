The code first takes the input as a string and stores it in variable S.
The variable A is initialized to 'CODEFESTIVAL2016'.
The variable cnt is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of mismatches between the two strings.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the length of the string A.
For each character i in A, it checks if the corresponding character in S is the same. If it is not, it increments the value of cnt.
The loop finishes when all characters in A have been checked.
The code then prints the final value of cnt, which is the number of mismatches between the two strings.
