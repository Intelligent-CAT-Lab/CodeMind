<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input H and R from the user.
H is initialized to -3 and R is initialized to 3.
The code then checks if H is greater than or equal to 0.
Since H is less than 0, the code enters the elif block.
In this block, the code checks if H+R is greater than 0.
Since H+R is 0, the code enters the elif block.
In this block, the code checks if H+R is equal to 0.
Since H+R is 0, the code prints 0.
<<<Output>>>
0
