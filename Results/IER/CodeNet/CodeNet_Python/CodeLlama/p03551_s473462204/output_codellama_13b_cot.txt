<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs, n and m, from the user.
The variable submit is initialized to m*1900+(n-m)*100.
The code then prints the value of submit*2**m.

In this case, the input is 1 1, so n=1 and m=1.
The value of submit is 1900+(1-1)*100=1900.
The value of submit*2**m is 1900*2**1=3800.

<<<Output>>>
3800
