  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the necessary libraries, including sys, math, collections, and decimal.
It then sets the recursion limit to 1000000 and defines a constant MOD equal to 10^9 + 7.
The input function is defined to read a line of input from stdin and strip any trailing whitespace.
The NI function is defined to read an integer from stdin.
The NMI function is defined to read a list of floats from stdin.
The NLI function is defined to read a list of integers from stdin.
The SI function is defined to read a line of input from stdin.
The make_grid function is defined to create a 2D grid of integers with the specified height, width, and number.
The make_adjlist_d function is defined to create an adjacency list for a directed graph with the specified number of nodes and edges.
The make_adjlist_nond function is defined to create an adjacency list for an undirected graph with the specified number of nodes and edges.
The cmb function is defined to calculate the number of combinations of n items taken r at a time.
The main function is defined to read two lines of input from stdin, split them into two strings, and print the product of the two strings as an integer.
The code then checks if the module is being run directly, and if so, calls the main function.
