  <<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function inpl() that takes no arguments and returns a list of integers.
The function uses the map() function to convert the input string into a list of integers.
The input string is obtained by calling the input() function.
The input() function reads a line of text from the standard input and returns it as a string.
The map() function applies the int() function to each element of the input string, which converts each element to an integer.
The list() function is used to convert the map object into a list.
The function inpl() is then called to get the list of integers.
The list of integers is then unpacked into the variables W, H, w, h, x, and y.
The code then calculates the ratio of b to a and prints it.
The ratio is calculated by dividing b by a.
The value of b is calculated by taking the minimum of H//2 and y + h//2, and then adding the maximum of -H//2 and y-h//2.
The value of a is calculated by taking the minimum of W//2 and x + w//2, and then adding the maximum of -W//2 and x-w//2.
<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will be 1.5
