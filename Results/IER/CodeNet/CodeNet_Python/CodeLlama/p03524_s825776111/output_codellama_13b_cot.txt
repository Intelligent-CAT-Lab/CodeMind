<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input string S from the user.
It then calculates the number of occurrences of each letter in the string using the count() method.
The variables a, b, and c are initialized to the number of occurrences of the letters "a", "b", and "c", respectively.
The code then checks if the difference between the maximum and minimum number of occurrences of any letter is greater than or equal to 2.
If this condition is met, the code prints "NO", otherwise it prints "YES".
<<<Output>>>
YES
