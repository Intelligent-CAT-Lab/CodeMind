The code first takes the input from the user and assigns it to the variables n and k.
The function solve is then called with the arguments n and k.
The function solve first checks if n is equal to 1 or k is equal to 1, and if so, it returns 1.
If neither of these conditions are met, the function solve calls the function fac_gen with the arguments k-2 and m-1, where m is equal to n*k.
The function fac_gen generates a list of factorials of the numbers from k-2 to m-1.
The function build_comb_list is then called with the arguments comb, m-2, and k-2.
The function build_comb_list modifies the list comb by multiplying each element by a power of the previous element.
The function solve_dp is then called with the arguments n, k, and comb.
The function solve_dp calculates the number of ways to arrange n objects in k groups using dynamic programming.
The function solve_dp returns the number of ways to arrange the objects in the groups.
The function solve returns the number of ways to arrange the objects in the groups.
