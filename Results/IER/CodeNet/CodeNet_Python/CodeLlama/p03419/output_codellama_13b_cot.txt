<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user in the form of two integers n and m, separated by a space.
The variables n and m are then initialized to the values of the input.
The code then checks if either n or m is equal to 1. If so, it prints 1 if n * m is equal to 1, otherwise it prints the maximum of n and m minus 2.
If neither n nor m is equal to 1, the code prints the product of n and m minus 4.
