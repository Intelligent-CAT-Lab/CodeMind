  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module and defines the input function as sys.stdin.readline.
It then reads the input from the user and splits it into two integers n and k.
The code then calculates n_k and n_mod_k, which are n divided by k and n modulo k, respectively.
The code then defines a function mod_k that takes an integer x as input and returns the result of n_k if x is not 0 and x is less than or equal to n_mod_k, or n_k + 1 if x is 0 and n_mod_k is equal to k.
The code then initializes ans to 0 and enters a loop that iterates from 0 to k-1.
For each iteration, the code calculates a_mod, b_mod, and c_mod, which are the modulo of i, -i, and -i modulo k, respectively.
The code then checks if (b_mod + c_mod) modulo k is equal to 0, and if it is, it adds the product of mod_k(a_mod), mod_k(b_mod), and mod_k(c_mod) to ans.
Finally, the code prints the value of ans.
<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will depend on the input given by the user.
If the user enters 3 2 as input, the output will be 12.
