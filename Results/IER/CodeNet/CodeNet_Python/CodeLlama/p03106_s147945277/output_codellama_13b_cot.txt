  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three inputs a, b, and k.
The code then initializes an empty list ans.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to the minimum of a and b.
For each value of val in this range, the code checks if a and b are divisible by val.
If they are, the code appends val to ans.
The code then prints the kth element of ans.
