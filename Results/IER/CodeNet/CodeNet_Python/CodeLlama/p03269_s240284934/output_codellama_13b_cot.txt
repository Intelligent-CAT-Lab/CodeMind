  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input L and initializes an empty list xs.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 21 to 21, meaning it will consider only one number.
The code checks if 2^m is greater than L, where m is the current iteration number. If it is, it breaks out of the loop.
If 2^m is not greater than L, the code appends two tuples to xs: (m+1, m+2, 0) and (m+1, m+2, 1 << m).
The code then sets b to 1 << m and x to L - b.
The code then enters another loop that iterates from m-1 to -1, meaning it will consider only one number.
The code checks if x is greater than or equal to 1 << i, where i is the current iteration number. If it is, it appends a tuple to xs: (i+1, m+1, b).
The code then sets x to x - (1 << i) and b to b + (1 << i).
The code then prints the final value of m + 1 and the length of xs.
The code then prints each tuple in xs.
<<<Output>>>

(1, 2, 0)
