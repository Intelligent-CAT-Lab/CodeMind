  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input S and K as a string and an integer, respectively.
It then converts K to an integer and sets it to the minimum of K and 300.
The code then initializes a list a and sets val to 0.
It then iterates through the string S and checks if each character is a 0 or not.
If it is a 0, it appends val to a and sets val to 0.
If it is not a 0, it increments val by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if val is not equal to 0 and appends it to a if it is.
The code then sets m to the length of a.
It then sets K to the minimum of the sum of a and K.
The code then initializes a 3D list dp with dimensions (m+1) x (K+1) x (K+1).
It then sets the values of dp[m][j][j] to 1 for all j from 0 to K.
The code then initializes two lists b and c with the values of a.
It then iterates through the list a and adds the values of b and c.
It then sets the values of dp[i][j][k] to the sum of dp[i+1][j+l][k] and dp[i+1][j][k+l] for all l from max(0,k-j) to K-j and for all j from 0 to min(K,k+c[i]).
It then prints the value of dp[0][0][0].
