<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in three integers x, a, and b as input.
The code calculates the absolute difference between x and a, and the absolute difference between x and b.
The code then checks if the absolute difference between x and a is less than the absolute difference between x and b.
If it is, the code prints 'A', otherwise it prints 'B'.
<<<Output>>>
A
