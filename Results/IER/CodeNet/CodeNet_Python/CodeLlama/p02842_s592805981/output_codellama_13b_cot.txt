<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input N from the user.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 50000 (inclusive).
For each number i in this range, it calculates the value of N multiplied by 1.08 and compares it to the current value of i.
If the two values are equal, the code prints the value of i and exits the program.
If the loop finishes without finding a match, the code prints the string ":(".
