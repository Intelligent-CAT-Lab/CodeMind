  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in three inputs: N, H, and D.
N is the number of elements in the array, H is the number of elements to be processed, and D is the number of elements to be skipped.
The code initializes two arrays, fact and fact_cum, to store the factorials of the numbers from 1 to N and their cumulative sum, respectively.
The code then initializes two arrays, ap and ap_cum, to store the values of the array and their cumulative sum, respectively.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to H, meaning it will consider the first H elements of the array.
For each element n in this range, the code calculates the value of the element using the formula:
x = ap_cum[n-1] - ap_cum[n-D-1] + fact_cum[N] * ap[n-1]
The code then updates the values of ap and ap_cum using the formula:
ap[n] = x
ap_cum[n] = (ap_cum[n-1] + x)%MOD
The code then calculates the final answer using the formula:
ans = ap[H] * fact[N] * pow(fact_cum[N],MOD-2,MOD)
The code then prints the final answer.
