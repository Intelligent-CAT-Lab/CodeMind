  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module and defines the input function as sys.stdin.readline.
The code then maps the input to the variables N, A, B, C, and D.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to N-1.
For each iteration, the code calculates the left and right boundaries of the range using the formulae C*i + A - D*(N-i-1) and D*i + A - C*(N-i-1) + 1, respectively.
The code checks if B is within the range [l, r] and prints "YES" if it is.
If B is not within the range, the code prints "NO".
<<<Output>>>
YES
