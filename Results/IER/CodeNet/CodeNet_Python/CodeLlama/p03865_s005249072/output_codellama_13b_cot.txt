<<<Analysis>>>
The code first reads a line of input from stdin using the readline() method of the sys module. The input is stored in the variable s.
The length of the input string is calculated using the len() function and stored in the variable n.
The code then checks if the first and last characters of the input string are the same using the == operator. If they are, the variable move is set to 1. Otherwise, move is set to 0.
The code then calculates the value of move as (n - move) % 2.
Finally, the code prints "First" if move is 1, and "Second" otherwise.
