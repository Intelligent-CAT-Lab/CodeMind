  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in four integers as input and stores them in variables a, b, c, and d.
The code then checks if a and b are equal to each other, and if c and d are equal to each other.
If either of these conditions is met, the code prints "yes".
If none of these conditions are met, the code prints "no".

<<<Output>>>
yes
