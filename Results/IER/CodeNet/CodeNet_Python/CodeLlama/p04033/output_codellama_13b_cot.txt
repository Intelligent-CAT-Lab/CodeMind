  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first defines a few lambda functions to make the code more concise.
The variable a and b are initialized to the values of the first two numbers in the input, which are 1 and 3, respectively.
The code then checks if a is less than or equal to 0 and if 0 is less than or equal to b.
If both conditions are true, the code prints 'Zero'.
If b is less than 0, the code calculates the difference between b and a and checks if the result is odd or even.
If the result is odd, the code prints 'Negative', and if it is even, it prints 'Positive'.
If neither of the above conditions are true, the code prints 'Positive'.
<<<Output>>>
Positive
