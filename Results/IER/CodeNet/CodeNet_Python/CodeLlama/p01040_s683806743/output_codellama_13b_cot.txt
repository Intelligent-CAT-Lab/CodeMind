  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first defines a function check_uruu that takes an integer y as input and returns True if y is a leap year, False otherwise.
The code then defines two lists nouruu and uruu, which contain the number of days in each month of a non-leap year and a leap year, respectively.
The code then maps the input to variables Y1, M1, D1, Y2, M2, and D2.
The code then initializes a list L with 2800*366 elements, each initialized to 0.
The code then initializes an index variable idx to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 2800, which is the number of years in a cycle of 2800 years.
For each year y in this range, the code checks if y is a leap year using the check_uruu function. If it is, the code sets l to the list uruu, otherwise it sets l to the list nouruu.
The code then enters another loop that iterates from 1 to the number of months in the current year (12 for a non-leap year and 13 for a leap year).
For each month m in this range, the code calculates the number of days in the current month using the list l.
The code then calculates the index of the 13th day of the current month using the formula idx + 12.
If the index of the 13th day is a Saturday, the code sets the corresponding element in the list L to 1.
The code then checks if the current year and month match the input values Y1, M1, and Y2, M2, respectively. If they do, the code calculates the sum of the elements in the list L up to the index of the 13th day of the current month and adds it to the variable ans1 or ans2, respectively.
The code then increments the index variable idx by the number of days in the current month.
The code then prints the difference between ans2 and ans1.
