<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user and splits it into a list of integers using the map() function.
The list is then passed to the sum() function to calculate the sum of the elements.
The code then checks if the sum is greater than or equal to 22 and prints 'bust' if it is, otherwise it prints 'win'.

In this case, the input is 5 7 9, which is split into a list [5, 7, 9]. The sum of this list is 21, which is less than 22, so the code prints 'win'.
<<<Output>>>
win
