  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input string S from the user.
The function AtoZ is defined, which takes a string as input.
The function then iterates through the string from the front to the back, and checks if the character at each position is "A". If it finds an "A", it breaks out of the loop.
The function then iterates through the string from the back to the front, and checks if the character at each position is "Z". If it finds a "Z", it breaks out of the loop.
The function then calculates the length of the substring between the first "A" and the last "Z", and returns this length.
The function AtoZ is then called with the input string S, and the output is stored in the variable ans.
The code then prints the value of ans.
