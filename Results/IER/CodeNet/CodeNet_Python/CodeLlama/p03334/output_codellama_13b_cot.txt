  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the necessary libraries: math, itertools, and numpy.
It then defines a function called judge, which takes an integer D as input and returns a function that takes two integers x and y as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the point (x,y) is in the first quadrant.
The function judge first checks if D is divisible by 4, and if so, it returns a function that checks if the sum of the x and y coordinates is even.
If D is not divisible by 4, it returns a function that checks if the x coordinate is even.
The code then defines two functions j1 and j2, which are the functions returned by the judge function for the input D1 and D2, respectively.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over all points (x,y) in the first quadrant of a square with side length 2N.
For each point, it checks if it satisfies the condition of both j1 and j2, and if so, it prints the point and increments the counter cnt.
If cnt reaches N*N, the loop breaks.
<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will be a list of points (x,y) that satisfy the condition of both j1 and j2.
Since the input is 2 1 2, the output will be a list of points in the first quadrant of a square with side length 2*2=4.
The points that satisfy the condition of both j1 and j2 are (0,0), (0,2), (2,0), and (2,2).
Therefore, the output of the code will be:
0 0
0 2
2 0
2 2
