The output of the code will be a list of points (x,y) that satisfy the condition of both j1 and j2.
Since the input is 2 1 2, the output will be a list of points in the first quadrant of a square with side length 2*2=4.
The points that satisfy the condition of both j1 and j2 are (0,0), (0,2), (2,0), and (2,2).
Therefore, the output of the code will be:
0 0
0 2
2 0
2 2
