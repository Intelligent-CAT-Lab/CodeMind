  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three inputs a, b, and k.
The code then enters a loop that iterates k times.
For each iteration, the code checks the value of turn.
If turn is 0, the code checks if a is even.
If a is even, the code adds a//2 to b and subtracts a//2 from a.
If a is odd, the code subtracts 1 from a and adds a//2 to b, then subtracts a//2 from a.
The code then sets turn to 1.
If turn is 1, the code checks if b is even.
If b is even, the code adds b//2 to a and subtracts b//2 from b.
If b is odd, the code subtracts 1 from b and adds b//2 to a, then subtracts b//2 from b.
The code then sets turn to 0.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final values of a and b.
