<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes input as two integers h and r, separated by a space.
The code then checks if h + r is equal to 0, greater than 0, or less than 0.
If h + r is equal to 0, the code prints 0.
If h + r is greater than 0, the code prints 1.
If h + r is less than 0, the code prints -1.

In this case, the input is -3 and 3, so h + r is equal to 0.
The code will print 0.
<<<Output>>>
0
