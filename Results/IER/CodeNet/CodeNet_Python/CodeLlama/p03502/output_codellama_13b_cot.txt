<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input from the user and stores it in the variable n.
The variable list_N is initialized to a list of the individual digits of the input number.
The variable num is initialized to 0, which will be used to store the sum of the digits of the input number.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the list of digits and adds each digit to the variable num.
The code checks if the input number is divisible by the sum of its digits. If it is, the variable ans is set to "Yes", otherwise it is set to "No".
The code then prints the value of the variable ans.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
