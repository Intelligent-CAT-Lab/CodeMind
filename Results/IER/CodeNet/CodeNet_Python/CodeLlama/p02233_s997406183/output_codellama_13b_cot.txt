<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a list fib with 45 elements, all set to 0.
The first two elements of the list are set to 1.
The user is prompted to input a number n.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to 45 (inclusive).
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of the previous two elements of the list and stores it in the current element.
The loop finishes when i reaches 45.
The code then prints the value of the nth element of the list, which is the final result.
