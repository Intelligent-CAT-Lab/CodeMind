  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the factorial function from the math module.
It then reads two integers n and m from the input, separated by a space.
The code then defines a variable mod equal to 10^9 + 7, which is a large prime number used for modular arithmetic.
The code then checks if the absolute difference between n and m is greater than 1, and if so, it prints 0 and exits.
If the absolute difference is less than or equal to 1, the code checks if the sum of n and m is even, and if so, it calculates the product of the factorials of n and m, multiplies it by 2, and takes the result modulo mod.
If the sum of n and m is odd, the code calculates the product of the factorials of n and m and takes the result modulo mod.
The code then prints the final result.
