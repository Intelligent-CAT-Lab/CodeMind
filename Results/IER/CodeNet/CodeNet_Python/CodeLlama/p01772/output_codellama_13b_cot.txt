  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input string s from the user.
It then initializes a variable ans to an empty string, which will be used to store the output.
The code also initializes a variable flag to False, which will be used to keep track of whether the first "A" has been encountered.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each character c in the input string s.
For each character c, the code checks if c is "A" and if flag is False. If both conditions are met, the code sets flag to True.
The code then checks if c is "Z" and if flag is True. If both conditions are met, the code appends "AZ" to ans and sets flag to False.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if ans is empty. If it is, the code prints -1. Otherwise, the code prints ans.
<<<Output>>>
AZ
