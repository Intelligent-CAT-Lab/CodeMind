  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first initializes the variable t to 1, which is the number of test cases.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the range of t, which is 1 in this case.
For each iteration, the code prompts the user to input three integers x, y, and z, separated by spaces.
The code then calculates the maximum and minimum values of x, y, and z, and stores them in variables ma and mi, respectively.
The code then checks if x is the maximum value, and if so, it calculates the difference between x and the minimum value of the other two numbers, and stores it in a variable m.
The code then calculates the difference between x and the maximum value of the other two numbers, and stores it in a variable n.
The code then calculates the sum of m and n, and stores it in a variable ans.
The code then checks if the difference between m and n is odd, and if so, it adds 2 to ans.
The code then prints the value of ans.
