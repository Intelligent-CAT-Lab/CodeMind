<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input string S from the user.
It then converts the string S into a list ls using the list() function.
The code then initializes a variable ans to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the length of the list ls.
For each index i in the list, the code enters another loop that iterates over the remaining indices in the list starting from i.
The inner loop checks if the character at the current index j is one of the four nucleotides A, T, C, or G.
If it is, the code increments a variable cnt by 1.
If the current index j is the last index in the list, the code checks if cnt is greater than the current value of ans and updates ans accordingly.
If the current index j is not the last index in the list, the code checks if cnt is greater than the current value of ans and updates ans accordingly.
If the current character at index j is not one of the four nucleotides A, T, C, or G, the code breaks out of the inner loop and updates ans to the current value of cnt.
After the outer loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans.
