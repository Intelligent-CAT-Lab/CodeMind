  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first reads a string from standard input and stores it in the variable s.
The length of the string is calculated and stored in the variable n.
The variable n2 is initialized to n//2, which is 5 in this case.
The variable ans is initialized to n2*(n2+1)+n%2*(n2+1), which is 26.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the characters of the string s.
For each character c, if it is not equal to "1", the code increments the variable rem by 1.
If rem is even and i is even, the code subtracts 1 from ans.
If (i-rem) is even, the code increments the variable rem by 1.
The loop finishes when all the characters of the string have been processed.
The code then prints the final value of ans, which is 26.
<<<Output>>>
26
