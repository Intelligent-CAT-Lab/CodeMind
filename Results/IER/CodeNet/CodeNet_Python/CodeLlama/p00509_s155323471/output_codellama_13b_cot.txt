  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first maps the input to two variables n and c.
The code then checks if c is less than 0. If it is, it prints '9'*(2*n) if n is greater than 1, else it prints '11'.
If c is not less than 0, the code sets k to int('9'*n)+1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates until it finds a prime number x.
The code calculates x by calling the palindrome function with k and c as arguments.
The palindrome function first calculates a = 10*k + c.
It then enters a loop that iterates until k is 0.
In each iteration, it calculates a = 10*a + (k % 10) and k //= 10.
The code then checks if x is prime by calling the isPrime function with x as an argument.
If x is prime, the code prints x and breaks out of the loop.
If x is not prime, the code continues to iterate until it finds a prime number.
