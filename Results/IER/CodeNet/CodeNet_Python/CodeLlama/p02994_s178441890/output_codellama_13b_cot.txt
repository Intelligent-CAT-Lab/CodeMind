  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs, n and l, from the user.
n is assigned the value 5 and l is assigned the value 2.
The code then checks the value of l.
If l is greater than or equal to 0, the code prints the value of l multiplied by (n - 1) plus (n - 1) multiplied by n divided by 2.
If l is less than 0 and l plus n minus 1 is less than 0, the code prints the value of l multiplied by (n - 1) plus (n - 1) multiplied by n divided by 2 minus (n - 1).
If l is less than 0 and l plus n minus 1 is greater than or equal to 0, the code prints the value of l multiplied by n plus (n - 1) multiplied by n divided by 2.
