  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module and defines a function called factorization.
The factorization function takes an integer n as input and returns an array of arrays, where each subarray contains two elements: the first element is a prime factor of n, and the second element is the power to which that factor is raised.
The main function first takes an integer n as input and checks if it is equal to 1. If it is, it prints 0 and exits.
If n is not equal to 1, it calls the factorization function with n as input and stores the result in a variable called nfac.
The main function then enters a loop that iterates over the elements of nfac. For each element, it calculates the number of times that factor appears in the factorization of n, and stores the result in a variable called c.
The loop then enters another loop that iterates from 1 to c. For each iteration, it subtracts 1 from the power of the factor in nfac, and increments a variable called r by 1.
After the loop finishes, the main function prints the value of r.
