<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers X and Y as input, separated by a space.
The variable count is initialized to 1.
The code enters a while loop that continues until the condition X*2 > Y is met.
In each iteration, the value of X is doubled and the value of count is incremented by 1.
The loop breaks when X*2 > Y, which is when X is greater than or equal to 20.
The code then prints the final value of count, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
