<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes input from the user in the form of two space-separated integers N and K.
The list comprehension [int(i) for i in input().split()] is used to convert the input string into a list of integers.
The variable N is assigned the value of the first element of the list, and K is assigned the value of the second element.
The code then prints the value of N-K+1.
