  <<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function solve that takes three arguments n, d, and x.
The function performs the following operations:
1. Initialize ans to 0.
2. While n is greater than 0, perform the following steps:
a. Add d + (2 * n - 1) * x / 2 to ans.
b. Set d to ((n + 1) * d + 5 * x / 2) / n.
c. Set x to (n + 2) / n * x.
d. Decrement n by 1.
3. Return ans.

The code then takes input from the user and splits it into three numbers using the map function.
The input is then passed to the solve function, which returns the result.
The result is then formatted to 10 decimal places using the format function and printed.
