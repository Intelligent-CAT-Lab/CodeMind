  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input as a list of digits and reverses it.
The variable lb is initialized to 0, which will be used as the lower bound of the search range.
The variable ub is initialized to the length of the list, which will be used as the upper bound of the search range.
The function check is defined, which takes an integer x as input and returns True if x is a valid number, and False otherwise.
The function check works by subtracting the sum of the digits of x from x, and checking if the result is non-negative.
The while loop starts by calculating the midpoint of the search range, which is (lb+ub)//2.
The function check is then called with the argument 9*mid, and if it returns True, the upper bound is set to mid, and if it returns False, the lower bound is set to mid.
The loop continues until the upper bound is less than or equal to the lower bound, at which point the final value of ub is printed.
