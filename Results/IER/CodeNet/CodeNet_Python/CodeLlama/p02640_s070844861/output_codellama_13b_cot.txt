<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs, n and m, from the user.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n+1.
For each value of i, the code calculates the value of f as 2*i + 4*(n-i).
The code checks if f is equal to m. If it is, the code prints 'Yes' and breaks out of the loop.
If the loop completes without finding a match, the code prints 'No'.

In this case, the input is n = 3 and m = 8.
The loop iterates from 0 to 3+1 = 4.
For each value of i, the code calculates f as follows:

* For i = 0, f = 2*0 + 4*(3-0) = 2*0 + 4*3 = 8
* For i = 1, f = 2*1 + 4*(3-1) = 2*1 + 4*2 = 6
* For i = 2, f = 2*2 + 4*(3-2) = 2*2 + 4*1 = 4
* For i = 3, f = 2*3 + 4*(3-3) = 2*3 + 4*0 = 2

None of these values is equal to 8, so the code prints 'No'.
<<<Output>>>
No
