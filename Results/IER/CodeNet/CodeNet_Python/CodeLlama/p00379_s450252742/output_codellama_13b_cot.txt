  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in three inputs: a, n, and m.
a is initialized to 16, n is initialized to 2, and m is initialized to 1000.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from a to the square root of m (inclusive), which is 10.
For each number i in this range, it calculates i^n, which is 2^2 = 4.
The code checks if 1 <= 4 <= m, which is true.
It then calculates the sum of the digits of 4, which is 1.
The code checks if the sum of the digits of 4 is equal to i - a, which is 10 - 16 = -6.
Since the condition is not met, the code continues to the next iteration.
The loop finishes and the code prints the final value of ans, which is 0.
