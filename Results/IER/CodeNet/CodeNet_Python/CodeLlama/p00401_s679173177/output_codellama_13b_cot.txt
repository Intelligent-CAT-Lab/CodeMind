<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input n from the user.
It then initializes a variable c to 0.
The code enters a while loop that runs while n is greater than 1.
In each iteration, the code shifts n to the right by 1 bit using the >> operator.
The code also increments c by 1 in each iteration.
The loop stops when n becomes 1.
The code then prints the value of 1 shifted left by c bits using the << operator.
