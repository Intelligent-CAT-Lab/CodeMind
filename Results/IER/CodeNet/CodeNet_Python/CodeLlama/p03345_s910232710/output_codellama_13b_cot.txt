  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module and sets the recursion limit to 10^8.
The input function is then defined as a lambda function that reads a line from stdin and splits it into a list of integers.
The main function is defined, which takes in four integers A, B, C, and K as input.
The function calculates the difference between A and B and stores it in ans.
The function then checks if K is even or odd and prints the corresponding value of ans.
The code then checks if the module name is "__main__" and if so, calls the main function.
