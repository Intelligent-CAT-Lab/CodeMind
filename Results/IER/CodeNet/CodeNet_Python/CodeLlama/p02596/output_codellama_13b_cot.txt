  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first reads an integer k from standard input using the readline() function.
The code then checks if k is divisible by 10, and if so, it prints -1 and exits.
If k is not divisible by 10, the code checks if k % 10 is in the list [0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8]. If it is, the code prints -1 and exits.
If k % 10 is not in the list, the code checks if k % 10 is equal to 1. If it is, the code multiplies k by 7 and stores the result in tmp.
The code then enters a loop that iterates until the length of tmp is equal to the number of digits in k.
In each iteration, the code checks if the number of 7s in tmp is equal to the number of digits in tmp. If it is, the code prints the value of ans + the number of digits in tmp - 1 and exits.
If the number of 7s in tmp is not equal to the number of digits in tmp, the code checks if tmp // 10 % 10 is less than or equal to 7. If it is, the code calculates the number num to be 7 - tmp // 10 % 10.
If tmp // 10 % 10 is equal to 8, the code calculates num to be 9.
If tmp // 10 % 10 is equal to 9, the code calculates num to be 8.
The code then multiplies k by num and stores the result in tmp2.
The code then adds tmp2 to tmp // 10 and stores the result in tmp.
The code then increments ans by 1.
The code then checks if ans is greater than k. If it is, the code prints -1 and exits.
The code then repeats the loop until the length of tmp is equal to the number of digits in k.

If k % 10 is not equal to 1, the code checks if k % 10 is equal to 3. If it is, the code multiplies k by 9 and stores the result in tmp.
The code then enters a loop that iterates until the length of tmp is equal to the number of digits in k.
In each iteration, the code checks if the number of 7s in tmp is equal to the number of digits in tmp. If it is, the code prints the value of ans + the number of digits in tmp - 1 and exits.
If the number of 7s in tmp is not equal to the number of digits in tmp, the code calculates the number num to be ((tmp // 10 % 10) * 3 - 1) % 10.
The code then multiplies k by num and stores the result in tmp2.
The code then adds tmp2 to tmp // 10 and stores the result in tmp.
The code then increments ans by 1.
The code then checks if ans is greater than k. If it is, the code prints -1 and exits.
The code then repeats the loop until the length of tmp is equal to the number of digits in k.

If k % 10 is not equal to 3, the code checks if k % 10 is equal to 7. If it is, the code multiplies k by 1 and stores the result in tmp.
The code then enters a loop that iterates until the length of tmp is equal to the number of digits in k.
In each iteration, the code checks if the number of 7s in tmp is equal to the number of digits in tmp. If it is, the code prints the value of ans + the number of digits in tmp - 1 and exits.
If the number of 7s in tmp is not equal to the number of digits in tmp, the code calculates the number num to be ((tmp // 10 % 10) * 7 + 1) % 10.
The code then multiplies k by num and stores the result in tmp2.
The code then adds tmp2 to tmp // 10 and stores the result in tmp.
The code then increments ans by 1.
The code then checks if ans is greater than k. If it is, the code prints -1 and exits.
The code then repeats the loop until the length of tmp is equal to the number of digits in k.

If k % 10 is not equal to 7, the code checks if k % 10 is equal to 9. If it is, the code multiplies k by 3 and stores the result in tmp.
The code then enters a loop that iterates until the length of tmp is equal to the number of digits in k.
In each iteration, the code checks if the number of 7s in tmp is equal to the number of digits in tmp. If it is, the code prints the value of ans + the number of digits in tmp - 1 and exits.
If the number of 7s in tmp is not equal to the number of digits in tmp, the code calculates the number num to be ((tmp // 10 % 10) + 3) % 10.
The code then multiplies k by num and stores the result in tmp2.
The code then adds tmp2 to tmp // 10 and stores the result in tmp.

If k % 10 is not equal to 9, the code prints -1 and exits.
