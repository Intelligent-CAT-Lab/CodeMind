<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input from the user and stores it in variable a.
The code then checks if the remainder of a divided by 7 is equal to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 0, respectively.
If any of these conditions are met, the corresponding day of the week is printed.
Since the input is 1, the remainder of 1 divided by 7 is 1, which satisfies the condition if a%7==1. Therefore, the code prints "fri".
<<<Output>>>
fri
