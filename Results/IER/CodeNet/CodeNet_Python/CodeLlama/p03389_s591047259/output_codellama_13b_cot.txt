  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user and splits it into a list of integers using the split() method.
The list is then sorted in descending order using the sort() method with the reverse parameter set to True.
The code then calculates the difference between the first two elements of the list, the first element and the third element, and stores it in n1.
The code then calculates the difference between the first element and the second element, and stores it in n2.
The code then calculates the difference between the second element and the third element, and stores it in n0.
The code then checks if the sum of n1 and n2 is even or not. If it is even, it prints the sum of n1 and n2 divided by 2. If it is odd, it prints the sum of n1, n2 and 1 divided by 2 and then adding 1.
