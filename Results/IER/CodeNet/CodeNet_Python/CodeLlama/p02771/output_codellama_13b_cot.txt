<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input, separated by spaces.
The variables a, b, and c are initialized to the values of the input.
The code then checks if a is equal to b and b is not equal to c. If this condition is met, the code prints "Yes".
The code then checks if b is equal to c and a is not equal to b. If this condition is met, the code prints "Yes".
The code then checks if a is equal to c and a is not equal to b. If this condition is met, the code prints "Yes".
If none of the above conditions are met, the code prints "No".

In this case, the input is 5 7 5.
a is equal to b, but b is not equal to c, so the first condition is not met.
b is not equal to c, so the second condition is not met.
a is equal to c, but a is not equal to b, so the third condition is not met.
Therefore, the code prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
