<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an input from the user, which is a string of digits.
The variable n is initialized to this input.
The variable tmp is initialized to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the length of the input string (i.e., the number of digits).
For each digit in the input, it calculates the sum of the previous value of tmp and the current digit, and then takes the remainder of this sum when divided by 9.
The code then checks if the final value of tmp is equal to 0. If it is, the code prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".

In this case, the input is "123456789", which has 9 digits.
The code iterates over each digit and calculates the sum of the previous value of tmp and the current digit.
The final value of tmp is 0, so the code prints "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
