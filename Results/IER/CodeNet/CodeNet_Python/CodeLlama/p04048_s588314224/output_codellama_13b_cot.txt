  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs, n and x, and initializes x to the minimum of x and n-x.
The code then enters a loop that iterates until the condition new_x == 0 is met.
In each iteration, the code calculates the remainder of n divided by x, which is stored in new_x.
The code then calculates the quotient of n divided by x, which is stored in new_n.
The code then updates the value of n and x based on the values of new_x and new_n.
The code also updates the value of ans, which is used to keep track of the total number of iterations.
The loop exits when new_x is 0, and the code prints the final value of ans plus x times new_n times 3.
