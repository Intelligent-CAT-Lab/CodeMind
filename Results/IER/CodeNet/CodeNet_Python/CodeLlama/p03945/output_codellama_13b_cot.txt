The code defines a lambda function that takes a string as input and returns the number of times the substring "WB" and "BW" appear in the string.
The input to the lambda function is obtained by calling the built-in input() function.
The output of the lambda function is then printed using the print() function.

The input to the code is "BBBWW".

The lambda function first counts the number of times the substring "WB" appears in the input string. This is done by calling the count() method of the string object with the substring "WB" as an argument.
The result of this count is then added to the number of times the substring "BW" appears in the input string. This is done by calling the count() method of the string object with the substring "BW" as an argument.
The final result is then returned by the lambda function.

The output of the code is therefore 2, which is the number of times the substring "WB" or "BW" appears in the input string "BBBWW".
