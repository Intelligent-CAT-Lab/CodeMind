  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in four inputs: h, w, a, and b.
The first line initializes the variables h, w, a, and b to the values provided by the user.
The second line initializes r1 and r2 to strings of 0s and 1s.
The third line prints r1 b times.
The fourth line prints r2 (h - b) times.

The output of the code will be a grid of 0s and 1s with dimensions h x w.
The first row will be a row of 1s, and the remaining rows will be rows of 0s.
The first column will be a column of 1s, and the remaining columns will be columns of 0s.

The number of rows and columns is determined by the values of h and w, respectively.
The number of 1s in each row and column is determined by the value of a.
The number of rows and columns with 1s is determined by the value of b.

The output of the code will be a grid of 0s and 1s with dimensions h x w, where the first row and column are filled with 1s, and the remaining rows and columns are filled with 0s.
