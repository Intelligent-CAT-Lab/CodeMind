  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable n.
The function factorize is defined, which takes an integer n as input and returns a list of its prime factors.
The function factorize first initializes the variable b to 2 and an empty list fct to store the prime factors.
It then enters a loop that iterates while b * b is less than or equal to n.
Inside the loop, it checks if n is divisible by b, and if it is, it appends b to the list fct and divides n by b.
After the loop finishes, it checks if n is greater than 1, and if it is, it appends n to the list fct.
The function factorize then returns the list fct.
The code then calls the function factorize with the input n and assigns the result to the variable x.
It then converts the list x to a string and joins the elements with a space character to create a string L.
Finally, it prints the string L.
