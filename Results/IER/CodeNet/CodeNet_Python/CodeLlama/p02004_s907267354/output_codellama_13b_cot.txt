  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module and defines two functions, readline and write, which are used to read input from stdin and write output to stdout, respectively.
The code then defines a function called solve, which takes no arguments.
The solve function first reads a line of input from stdin using the readline function and stores it in a variable called S.
The function then initializes two variables, ans and d, to 0 and 0, respectively.
The function then enters a loop that iterates over the characters in the string S.
For each character c in S, the function checks if c is equal to "R". If it is, it increments the value of d by 1 and then sets d to d modulo 4. If d is now equal to 0 and cur is equal to 4, the function increments ans by 1 and sets cur to 0.
If c is not equal to "R", the function decrements d by 1 and sets d to d modulo 4. If d is now equal to 0, the function sets cur to 0.
After the loop finishes, the function writes the value of ans to stdout using the write function.
<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will be 3, since the string "RRRRLLLLRRRR" contains 3 instances of the substring "RRRR".
