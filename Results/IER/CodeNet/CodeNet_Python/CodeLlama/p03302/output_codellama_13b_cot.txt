<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, separated by a space.
The variables a and b are initialized to the values of the two integers.
The code then checks if the sum of a and b is equal to 15, and if so, prints a plus sign.
The code then checks if the product of a and b is equal to 15, and if so, prints an asterisk.
If neither of these conditions are met, the code prints an x.

In this case, the input is 4 and 11, so the sum of a and b is 15, and the product of a and b is 44.
The code will therefore print a plus sign.
