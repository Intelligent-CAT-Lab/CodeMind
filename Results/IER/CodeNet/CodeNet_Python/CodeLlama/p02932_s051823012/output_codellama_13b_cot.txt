  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first defines two functions, kaijo and gyaku_kaijo, which are used to calculate the binomial coefficients.
The function kaijo calculates the binomial coefficient of n and k, while the function gyaku_kaijo calculates the binomial coefficient of n and k, but with the terms in the expansion reversed.
The code then defines a function nCr, which calculates the binomial coefficient of n and k using the kaijo and gyaku_kaijo functions.
The code then defines a function f, which calculates the sum of the terms in the expansion of (1+x)^N, where x is a variable, and N is a positive integer.
The function f uses the nCr function to calculate the binomial coefficients.
The code then defines a function F, which calculates the value of the function f at a given point x.
The code then takes the input N, M, L, and R, and uses the functions f and F to calculate the output.
<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will be a single integer, which is the value of the function F at the point x = R, minus the value of the function F at the point x = L-1.
The value of the function F at the point x = R will be calculated using the formula (1+x)^N, where x is R and N is the input N.
The value of the function F at the point x = L-1 will be calculated using the formula (1+x)^N, where x is L-1 and N is the input N.
The difference between these two values will be the output of the code.
