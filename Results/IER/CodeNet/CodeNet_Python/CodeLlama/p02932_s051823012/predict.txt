The output of the code will be a single integer, which is the value of the function F at the point x = R, minus the value of the function F at the point x = L-1.
The value of the function F at the point x = R will be calculated using the formula (1+x)^N, where x is R and N is the input N.
The value of the function F at the point x = L-1 will be calculated using the formula (1+x)^N, where x is L-1 and N is the input N.
The difference between these two values will be the output of the code.
