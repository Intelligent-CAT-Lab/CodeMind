<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes input from the user in the form of two numbers separated by a space.
The first number is stored in variable a and the second number is stored in variable b.
The code then checks if both numbers are between 0 and 10 (exclusive) using the if statement.
If the condition is met, the code prints the product of a and b.
If the condition is not met, the code prints -1.
<<<Output>>>
10
