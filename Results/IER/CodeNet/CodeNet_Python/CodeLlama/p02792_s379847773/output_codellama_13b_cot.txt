  <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized to 25, which is the input given to the code.
The variable count is initialized to a 2D list of 10x10, which will be used to store the number of times each digit appears in the first and last position of a number.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 25.
For each number i in this range, it converts it to a string s and then calculates the first and last digit of s.
The code then increments the count of the first and last digit in the corresponding position of the count array.
After the loop finishes, the code calculates the sum of the product of the counts of each digit in the first and last position.
The code then prints the final value of ans, which is the sum of the products of the counts of each digit in the first and last position.
