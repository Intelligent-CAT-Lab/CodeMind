<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, x and y, and stores them in variables x and y, respectively.
The code then calculates the absolute difference between x and y, which is abs(x-y).
The code then checks if the absolute difference is less than or equal to 1, which is the case when x and y are 2 and 1, respectively.
If the condition is met, the code prints "Brown", otherwise it prints "Alice".
<<<Output>>>
Brown
