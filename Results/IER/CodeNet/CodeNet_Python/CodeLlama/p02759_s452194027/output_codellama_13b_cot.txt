<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input n from the user and stores it in the variable n.
The code then calculates the average of n and 1 and rounds it down to the nearest integer using the floor division operator (//).
The code then prints the result.

In this case, the input is 5, so the code will calculate (5+1)//2 = 3.
<<<Output>>>
3
