<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user and stores it in the variable S.
The code then checks if the string "AA" is present in S. If it is, it prints "NO" and exits.
If "AA" is not present, the code replaces all occurrences of "KIH" with an empty string and all occurrences of "A" with an empty string.
The code then checks if the resulting string is equal to "BR". If it is, it prints "YES" and exits.
If the resulting string is not equal to "BR", the code prints "NO" and exits.
<<<Output>>>
YES
