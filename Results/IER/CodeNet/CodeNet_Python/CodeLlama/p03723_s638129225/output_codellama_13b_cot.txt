  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes in three integers a, b, and c as input.
The code then checks if a, b, and c are all equal and if a is even. If both conditions are met, the code prints -1 and exits.
If the conditions are not met, the code enters a while loop that continues until a, b, or c is odd.
In each iteration of the loop, the code calculates the average of a, b, and c and assigns it to a, b, and c.
The code then increments the variable res by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of res.
