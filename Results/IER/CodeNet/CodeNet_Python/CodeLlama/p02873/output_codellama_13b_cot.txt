  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first reads a line of input from stdin and stores it in the variable S.
The code then calculates the length of S and stores it in the variable n.
The code then initializes two lists, sho and dai, with n elements each.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the characters in S.
For each character, the code checks if it is ">" or "<".
If it is ">", the code sets the corresponding element in sho to 0.
If it is "<", the code sets the corresponding element in dai to 0.
If it is neither, the code sets the corresponding element in sho to the sum of the previous element in sho and 1.
The code then enters another loop that iterates over the characters in S in reverse order.
For each character, the code checks if it is ">" or "<".
If it is ">", the code sets the corresponding element in dai to 0.
If it is "<", the code sets the corresponding element in dai to the sum of the next element in dai and 1.
The code then calculates the maximum of each element in sho and dai and stores it in a new list called seq.
The code then prints the sum of the elements in seq.
