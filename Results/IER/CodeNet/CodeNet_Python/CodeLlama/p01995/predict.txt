The code first imports the bisect module from the standard library.
The code then defines a function main() which takes no arguments.
The function first initializes a variable s to the input string.
The code then initializes a variable alpha to the string "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz".
The code then initializes a variable l to the length of the input string.
The code then initializes a dictionary alpha2 with keys as the characters of the string alpha and values as their corresponding indices in the string alpha.
The code then initializes a list of lists memo with 26 empty lists.
The code then initializes a variable mod to 10^9+7.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the indices of the input string.
For each index i, the code appends the index to the list at the corresponding index in the list memo.
The code then initializes a list of lists dp with l+1 rows and l+1 columns.
The code then initializes a variable ans to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the indices of the input string.
For each index i, the code enters a loop that iterates over the indices of the input string.
For each index j, the code calculates the value of p as the product of the values of the elements at indices i and j in the list dp.
The code then checks if p is 0. If it is, the code continues to the next iteration.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the indices of the list memo.
For each index k, the code calculates the values of x and y as the indices of the first and last elements in the list memo[k] that are less than or equal to i and greater than or equal to j, respectively.
The code then checks if x is greater than y. If it is, the code continues to the next iteration.
The code then calculates the value of mx and my as the elements at indices x and y in the list memo[k], respectively.
The code then adds the value of p to the element at indices mx+1 and my in the list dp.
