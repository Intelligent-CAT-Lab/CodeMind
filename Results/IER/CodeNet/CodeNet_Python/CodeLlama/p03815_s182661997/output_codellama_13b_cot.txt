<<<Analysis>>>
The variable x is initialized to 7, which is the input given.
The variable N is initialized to 2*(x//11), which is 2*(7//11) = 2*0 = 0.
The code then checks the remainder of x divided by 11, which is 7%11 = 6.
The code checks if the remainder is 0, which it is not.
The code then checks if the remainder is less than or equal to 6, which it is.
The code then adds 1 to N, so N becomes 1.
The code then prints N, which is 1.
<<<Output>>>
1
