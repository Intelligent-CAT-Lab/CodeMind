  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in four integers as input: r, g, b, and n.
The code then initializes a variable count to 0.
The code then enters a nested loop that iterates from 0 to n/r (inclusive) and from 0 to (n-i*r)/g (inclusive).
For each iteration of the loop, the code calculates the value of k = n - i*r - j*g.
If k is divisible by b, the code increments the value of count by 1.
The code then prints the final value of count.

<<<Output>>>
0
