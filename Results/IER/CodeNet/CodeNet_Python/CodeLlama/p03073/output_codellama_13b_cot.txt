  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module and defines several functions for reading input from the standard input stream.
The code then sets the recursion limit to 10^7 and defines two constants, INF and MOD.
The code then defines a function LI_() that takes no arguments and returns a list of integers that are obtained by subtracting 1 from each element of the list returned by the function LI().
The code then defines a function LF() that takes no arguments and returns a list of floats that are obtained by converting each element of the list returned by the function LS() to a float.
The code then defines a function SI() that takes no arguments and returns a string that is obtained by reading a line from the standard input stream and stripping any leading or trailing whitespace.
The code then defines two functions, YN() and yn(), that take a boolean argument b and print "YES" or "NO" or "Yes" or "No" respectively if b is true or false.
The code then defines a variable S that is assigned the value of the string returned by the function SI().
The code then defines a variable N that is assigned the value of the length of the string S.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to N-1, meaning it will consider each character of the string S.
For each character i in this range, the code checks if the character is not equal to the character at the previous index i-1. If it is not equal, the code increments a counter variable zero_start_counter by 1.
The code then updates the value of the variable zero_start to the value of the variable zero_start plus 1 modulo 2.
The code then updates the value of the variable one_start_counter to the value of the variable N minus the value of the variable zero_start_counter.
The code then prints the minimum value of the variables zero_start_counter and one_start_counter.
