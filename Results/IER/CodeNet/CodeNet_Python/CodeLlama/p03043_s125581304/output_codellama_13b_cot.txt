  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys and math modules.
The input function is defined to read a line from stdin and strip the newline character.
The mi function is defined to map the input to integers and split them into a list.
The N and K variables are initialized to the first two elements of the list returned by mi.
The ans variable is initialized to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive).
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is greater than or equal to K.
If it is, it adds 1 to ans.
If it is not, it calculates the value of pow(1/2, math.ceil(math.log2(K/i))) and adds it to ans.
The loop finishes and the code prints the final value of ans divided by N.
