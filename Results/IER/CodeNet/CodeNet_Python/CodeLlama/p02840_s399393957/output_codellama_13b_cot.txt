The code first imports the sys module and the collections module.
The readline function is defined as a shortcut for the stdin.readline function.
The gcd function is defined to calculate the greatest common divisor of two numbers.
The N, X, and D variables are initialized to 3, 4, and 2, respectively.
The ans variable is initialized to 0.
The code then checks if X and D are both 0, and if so, sets ans to 1.
If X is 0 but D is not, the code calculates the number of integers between 1 and N that are divisible by D and adds 1 to ans.
If D is 0 but X is not, the code calculates the number of integers between 1 and N that are divisible by X and adds 1 to ans.
If neither X nor D are 0, the code calculates the greatest common divisor of X and D and divides both X and D by this value.
The code then initializes a dictionary called LR with a single key-value pair, where the key is 0 and the value is a list containing a single tuple with values (0, 0).
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 3.
For each number i in this range, the code calculates the values of Li and Ri using the formula (i-1)*i//2 and i*N - i*(i+1)//2, respectively.
The code then appends a tuple with values (Li+i*X//D, Ri+i*X//D) to the list associated with the key (i*X)%D in the LR dictionary.
The code then enters another loop that iterates over the values in the LR dictionary.
For each value in the dictionary, the code sorts the list of tuples associated with that value and sets lp and rp to the first tuple in the list.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the remaining tuples in the list.
If the right endpoint of the current tuple is less than the left endpoint of the previous tuple, the code adds the difference between the right endpoint and the left endpoint to ans and updates lp and rp to the current tuple.
If the right endpoint of the current tuple is greater than or equal to the left endpoint of the previous tuple, the code updates rp to the maximum of the right endpoint and the previous right endpoint.
After the inner loop finishes, the code adds the difference between the right endpoint and the left endpoint to ans and updates lp and rp to the current tuple.
After the outer loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 4.
