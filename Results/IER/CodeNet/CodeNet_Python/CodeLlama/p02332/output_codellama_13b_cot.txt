  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input N and K from the user.
The variable MOD is initialized to 10^9 + 7, which is a large prime number used for modular arithmetic.
The code then checks if K is less than N. If it is, it prints 0 and exits.
If K is not less than N, the code enters a loop that iterates from K to K-N (inclusive).
For each value v in this range, the code calculates the product of v and the previous value of ans, and stores the result in ans.
The product is calculated modulo MOD to avoid overflow.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans.
