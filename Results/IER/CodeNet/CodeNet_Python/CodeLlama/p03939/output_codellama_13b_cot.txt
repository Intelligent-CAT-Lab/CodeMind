  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module and uses it to read input from stdin.
It then maps the input to the variables N, d, and x using the map function.
The code then defines a function called main that takes in three arguments: N, d, and x.
The function first initializes a variable called ret to 0.
It then enters a while loop that iterates until N is 0.
In each iteration, the function adds d + (N-0.5) * x to ret.
It then updates the values of d and x using the following formulas:
d = d + (d/N) + (5*x)/(2*N)
x += 2*x/N
N -= 1
The function then returns the final value of ret.
The code then calls the main function with the input values of N, d, and x and prints the output.
