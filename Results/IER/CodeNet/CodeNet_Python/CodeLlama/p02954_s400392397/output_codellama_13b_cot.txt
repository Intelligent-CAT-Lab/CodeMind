  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input string and appends an 'R' to the end of it.
The length of the string is then calculated and stored in the variable l.
The code then initializes an array ans with l-1 elements, all set to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the characters of the input string.
For each character, the code checks if it is 'R' or 'L'.
If the character is 'R', the code increments the variable rcnt and sets the variable rpos to the current index.
If the character is 'L', the code increments the variable lcnt and sets the variable lpos to the current index.
The code also sets the variable flag to 1 if the character is 'L' and 0 if it is 'R'.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the elements of the array ans.
