  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the math module, which is not used in the code.
The code then initializes the variables H, W, A, and B to 2, 3, 1, and 1, respectively.
The code then initializes two lists, factorial and inv_factorial, to store the factorial and inverse factorial values of the numbers from 1 to H+W+1.
The code then defines a function f(h, w) that calculates the value of the binomial coefficient (h+w-2 choose h-1) modulo MOD.
The code then calculates the answer by summing the values of f(H-A, i) and f(A, W-i+1) for i from B+1 to W, and then prints the answer.
