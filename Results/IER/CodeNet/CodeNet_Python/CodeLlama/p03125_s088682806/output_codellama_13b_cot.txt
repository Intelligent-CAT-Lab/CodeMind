<<<Analysis>>>
The code imports the sys module and defines a function called main.
The function takes two arguments, a and b, which are integers.
The function returns the sum of a and b if b is not divisible by a, otherwise it returns the difference between b and a.
The code then checks if the module is being run directly (i.e., not imported as a module by another script) and if so, it calls the main function and prints its return value.
The input is read from stdin and split into two integers, a and b.
The main function is called with these two integers as arguments and its return value is printed.
