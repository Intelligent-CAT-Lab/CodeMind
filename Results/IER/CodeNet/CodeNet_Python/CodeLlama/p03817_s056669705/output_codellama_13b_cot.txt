The variable x is initialized to 7.
The variable s is initialized to x//11, which is 0.
The variable cnt is initialized to s*2, which is 0.
The variable x is decremented by s*11, which is 0.
The code checks if x is 0, and if it is, it does nothing.
The code checks if x is less than or equal to 6, and if it is, it increments cnt by 1.
The code checks if x is less than 11, and if it is, it increments cnt by 2.
The code prints the final value of cnt, which is 0.
