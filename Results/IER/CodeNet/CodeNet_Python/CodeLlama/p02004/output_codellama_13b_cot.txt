  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first defines a function f that takes a string n as input.
The function f returns the number of times the substring "RRRR" appears in the string n.
The function f does this by iterating over the characters in the string n and keeping track of the number of consecutive "R"s.
When the number of consecutive "R"s is 4, the function f increments a counter and resets the number of consecutive "R"s to 0.
The function f returns the final value of the counter.

The code then defines a function main that takes no arguments.
The function main reads a string from standard input using the function S().
The function main calls the function f with the string read from standard input as an argument.
The function main stores the result of the function f in a list called rr.
The function main repeats this process until the string read from standard input is "0".
The function main returns the list rr.

The code then calls the function main and prints the result to standard output.
