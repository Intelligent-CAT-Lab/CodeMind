  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports several modules, including sys, math, collections, itertools, array, and inspect.
It then sets the recursion limit to 1000000 using sys.setrecursionlimit(1000000).

The code then defines several functions, including chkprint, to_bin, li_input, gcd, gcd_list, lcm, lcm_list, wfs_d, dfs_d, sigma, comb, and bisearch.

The main function first takes input A, B, and C using li_input().
It then checks if B is greater than or equal to C, and if C is greater than or equal to A.
If both conditions are true, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".

<<<Output>>>
No
