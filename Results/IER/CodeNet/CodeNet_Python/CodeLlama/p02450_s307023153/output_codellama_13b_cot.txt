  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input n from the user.
It then creates a list nl of strings representing the numbers from 1 to n.
The code then defines a function perm that takes a list of strings as input and returns a list of lists of strings representing all the permutations of the input list.
The function works by recursively calling itself on the rest of the list after removing the first element.
The code then calls the function perm with the input list nl and prints the output.
