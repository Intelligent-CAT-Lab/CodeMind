  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input from the user and splits it into three variables: w, h, and c.
w is the width of the rectangle, h is the height, and c is the character that will be used to fill the center of the rectangle.
The code then converts the width and height to integers.
The code then defines three variables: end, center, and common.
End is a string that represents the top and bottom borders of the rectangle, with a length of w - 2 characters.
Center is a string that represents the center of the rectangle, with a length of w - 3 characters.
Common is a string that represents the sides of the rectangle, with a length of w - 2 characters.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to h (inclusive).
For each iteration, the code checks if the current iteration is 0, h - 1, or h // 2.
If it is, the code prints the corresponding variable (end, center, or common).
If it is not, the code prints the common variable.
