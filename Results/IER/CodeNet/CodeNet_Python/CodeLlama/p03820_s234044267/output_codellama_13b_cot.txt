  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the necessary libraries, including sys, numpy, and numba.
It then defines a function called main, which takes two arguments, N and K.
The function first subtracts 1 from K, and then initializes two variables, U and C.
U is set to 5000, and C is initialized to a 2D numpy array of size (U, U) with all elements set to 0.
The function then sets the first element of C to 1.
It then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to U (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 5000.
For each number n in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
