<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input string S from the user.
It then initializes two variables, alpha and Now, to "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ" and 0, respectively.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each character in the input string S.
For each character s in S, it finds the index of s in the string alpha using the find() method.
The code then checks if the current index is less than the previous index (Now).
If it is, it does nothing.
If it is not, it increments the variable ans by 1.
The code then updates the variable Now to the current index.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans.
