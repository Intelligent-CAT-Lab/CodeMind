  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the string module and the itertools module.
The code then defines a function called parse, which takes a parameter called pri.
The function defines a variable called code, which is a string containing the characters '+', '-', and '*'.
The function also defines a variable called cur, which is initialized to 0.
The function then defines two nested functions called number and expr.
The number function takes no parameters and returns an integer.
The expr function takes a parameter called level, which is an integer.
The function first checks if the current character in the input string is '('.
If it is, it increments the value of cur and then calls the expr function with a level of 0.
If the current character is not '(', the function checks if the current character is a digit.
If it is, it increments the value of cur and then returns the integer value of the current character.
If the current character is not a digit, the function checks if the current character is in the code string.
If it is, it increments the value of cur and then returns the result of the current character multiplied by the result of the expr function with a level of level+1.
If the current character is not in the code string, the function returns the result of the current character multiplied by the result of the expr function with a level of level+1.
The function then defines a variable called ans, which is initialized to -10**30.
The function then enters a loop that iterates over all possible values of pri, which are tuples of length 3 containing integers from 0 to 2.
For each value of pri, the function calls the parse function with the current value of pri.
The function then increments the value of ans by the result of the parse function.
The function then prints the value of ans.
