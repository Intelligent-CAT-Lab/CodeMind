The code first takes an integer input n from the user.
It then initializes an empty dictionary dic.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 50000 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 50000.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the value of p as i*1.08 and stores it in the dictionary as the key and i as the value.
The code checks if n is in the dictionary. If it is, it prints the value corresponding to n in the dictionary. If it is not, it prints ":(".
