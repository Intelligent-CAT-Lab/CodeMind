<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in three integers r, g, and b as input.
The code then calculates the expression (g * 10 + b) % 4.
The expression is calculated as follows:
g * 10 + b = 30 + 2 = 32
32 % 4 = 0
The code then checks if the result of the expression is equal to 0.
Since it is, the code prints "YES".
<<<Output>>>
YES
