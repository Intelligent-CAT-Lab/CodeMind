  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input l from the user.
The variable d is initialized to the maximum value of d such that 2**d is less than or equal to l.
The variable n is initialized to d+1, and m is initialized to 2*d.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n-1, and for each i, it appends two tuples to the list ans.
The first tuple is (i, i+1, 0), and the second tuple is (i, i+1, 2**(i-1)).
The code then enters a while loop that iterates while l is greater than 2**d.
Inside this loop, the code enters another loop that iterates from n-1 to 0 in decreasing order.
For each i, the code checks if l-2**(i-1) is greater than 2**d-1. If it is, the code appends a tuple (i, n, l-2**(i-1)) to the list ans, increments m by 1, decrements l by 2**(i-1), and breaks out of the inner loop.
After the while loop finishes, the code prints the values of n and m, and then iterates over the list ans and prints each tuple in it.
