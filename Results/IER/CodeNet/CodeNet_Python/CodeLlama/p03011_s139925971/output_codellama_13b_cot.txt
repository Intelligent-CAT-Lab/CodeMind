<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in three integers P, Q, and R as input, separated by spaces.
The map function is used to convert the input string into a list of integers.
The min function is used to find the minimum value of the list [P+Q, Q+R, R+P].
The output of the code is the minimum value of this list.

In this case, the input is 1 3 4, which means P=1, Q=3, and R=4.
The list [P+Q, Q+R, R+P] is [4, 7, 5], and the minimum value is 4.

<<<Output>>>
4
