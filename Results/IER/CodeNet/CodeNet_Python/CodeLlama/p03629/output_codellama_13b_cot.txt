  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first reads the input string from the user and stores it in the variable S.
The length of the input string is then calculated and stored in the variable len_s.
The code then converts the input string into a list of integers, where each integer represents the position of a letter in the alphabet (a=0, b=1, c=2, ..., z=25).
The variable int_s is then initialized to this list of integers.
The code then defines two functions:
* next_char_pos[from_idx][letter_idx] := the position of the next letter `letter_idx` from `from_idx`
* non_subseq_len[from_idx] := the length of the shortest "non subsequence" in S[from_idx:]

The code then enters a loop that iterates from len_s-1 to 0 (inclusive), meaning it will consider all possible starting positions in the input string.
For each starting position, the code iterates over all possible letters (a-z) and calculates the position of the next letter in the input string.
The code then checks if the current letter is the next letter in the input string, and if not, it updates the position of the next letter to the position of the next letter in the input string.
The code then updates the length of the shortest "non subsequence" in S[from_idx:] to the length of the shortest "non subsequence" in S[from_idx+1:] + 1.
The code also updates the answer letter and the next position of the answer letter.

After the loop finishes, the code prints the final answer, which is the shortest "non subsequence" in the input string.

<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will be the shortest "non subsequence" in the input string.
