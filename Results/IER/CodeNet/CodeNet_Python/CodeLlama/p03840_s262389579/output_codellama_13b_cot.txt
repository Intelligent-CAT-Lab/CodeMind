  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module and defines a function called solve.
The function takes no arguments and reads a line from the standard input using the readline method of the sys.stdin object.
The input is then split into 7 integers using the split method and stored in variables I, O, T, J, L, S, and Z.
The function then calculates the minimum of I, J, and L and stores it in a variable called six.
The function then calculates the sum of the first three variables and stores it in a variable called Ans.
The function then calculates the sum of the remaining variables and stores it in a variable called rem.
The function then checks if six is greater than 0 and rem is equal to 2, and if so, it adds 1 to Ans.
Finally, the function prints the value of Ans and returns 0.
