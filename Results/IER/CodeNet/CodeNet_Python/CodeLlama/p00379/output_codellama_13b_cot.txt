  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in three inputs: a, n, and m.
a is initialized to 16, n is initialized to 2, and m is initialized to 1000.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 50.
For each number y in this range, it calculates the value of x = (y + a)**n.
The code checks if 1 <= x <= m and if y is equal to the sum of the digits of x.
If both conditions are met, the code increments the variable ans by 1.
The loop finishes and the code prints the final value of ans.
