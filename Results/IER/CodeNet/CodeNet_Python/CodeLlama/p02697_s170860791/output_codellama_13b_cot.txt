<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs N and M from the user.
The first line of the code checks if N is even or not.
If N is even, the code enters the first if block.
In this block, the code iterates from 1 to (M+1)//2+1 and prints the values of i and N-i+1.
The second loop iterates from M-(M+1)//2 to M and prints the values of M-i and M+i+2.
If N is odd, the code enters the else block.
In this block, the code iterates from 1 to M+1 and prints the values of i and N-i.
<<<Output>>>
