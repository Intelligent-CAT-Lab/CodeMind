<<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the math module, which provides mathematical functions.
The variable n is initialized to the input given by the user, which is 5 in this case.
The variable rent is initialized to 100000.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n (exclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 4.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the new rent value by multiplying the current rent by 1.05 and then dividing it by 1000, rounding up to the nearest integer using the math.ceil function.
The code then multiplies the new rent value by 1000 to get the final rent value.
The loop finishes and the code prints the final rent value, which is 105000.
<<<Output>>>
105000
