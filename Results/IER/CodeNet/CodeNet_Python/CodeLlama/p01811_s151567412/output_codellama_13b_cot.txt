  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first prompts the user to input a string, which is stored in the variable s.
The variable p is initialized to "ABC", which is a string of length 3.
The variable used is initialized to an empty set.
The code then enters a while loop that continues until the string s is equal to the string p.
The loop first initializes the variable idx to 0, which is the index of the first character in the string s.
The loop then initializes the variable c to a list of 3 zeros.
The loop then enters a while loop that continues until the index idx is greater than or equal to the length of the string s.
The inner loop first checks if the substring s[idx:idx+3] is equal to the string p. If it is, the loop increments idx by 3 and continues.
If the substring is not equal to p, the loop increments the value of the element at index p.index(s[idx]) in the list c by 1 and increments idx by 1.
The loop then checks if the sum of the elements in c is equal to the length of the string s. If it is, the loop prints "No" and exits the program.
If the sum of the elements in c is not equal to the length of the string s, the loop replaces the first occurrence of "ABC" in the string s with the string p.
The loop then continues until the string s is equal to the string p.
The code then prints "Yes" and exits the program.
