<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input from the user and stores it in the variable N.
The code then checks if N is between 65 and 90 (inclusive), which is the ASCII code range for uppercase letters.
If the condition is met, the code prints 1.
If the condition is not met, the code checks if N is between 97 and 122 (inclusive), which is the ASCII code range for lowercase letters.
If the condition is met, the code prints 2.
If the condition is not met, the code prints 0.

In this case, the input is 67, which is not within the ASCII code range for either uppercase or lowercase letters. Therefore, the code prints 0.
<<<Output>>>
