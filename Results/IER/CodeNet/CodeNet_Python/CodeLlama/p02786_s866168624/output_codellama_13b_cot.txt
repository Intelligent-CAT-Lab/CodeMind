  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user and stores it in the variable h.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 10000000000 (inclusive).
For each iteration, the code calculates 2**i, where i is the current iteration number.
The code then checks if 2**i is greater than h. If it is, the code prints 2**i-1 and breaks out of the loop.
The loop will terminate when i is 32, since 2**32 is greater than 2.
