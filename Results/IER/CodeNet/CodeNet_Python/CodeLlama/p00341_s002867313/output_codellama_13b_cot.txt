<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input as a string and splits it into a list of integers using the map() function.
The list is then sorted using the sorted() function.
The code then checks if the first, fourth, and eighth elements of the list are equal to each other, and if the fifth and ninth elements are equal to each other.
If both conditions are met, the code prints "yes", otherwise it prints "no".

<<<Output>>>
yes
