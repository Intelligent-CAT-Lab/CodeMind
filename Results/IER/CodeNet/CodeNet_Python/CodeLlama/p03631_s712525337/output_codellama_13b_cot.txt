<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user and stores it in a variable s.
The code then checks if the string s is a palindrome, which means it reads the same backwards as forwards.
To do this, it checks if s is equal to its reverse, which is obtained by slicing the string from the end to the beginning and reversing it.
If the two strings are equal, the code prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
