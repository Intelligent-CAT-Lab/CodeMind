  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module and sets the recursion limit to 10^5.
It then defines several functions for input and output:
* LI(): returns a list of integers from the input
* LF(): returns a list of floats from the input
* LI_(): returns a list of negative integers from the input
* II(): returns an integer from the input
* IF(): returns a float from the input
* LM(func,n): returns a list of lists of integers or floats from the input
* mod: a variable for the modulo operation
* inf: a variable for infinity

The code then defines a function isCat(S) that takes a string S as input.
The function first checks if the length of S is 0, in which case it returns True.
If the length of S is not 0, it checks if the first and last characters of S are "m" and "w", respectively.
If they are not, the function returns False.
Otherwise, it initializes a variable c to 0 and an index variable i to 0.
It then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to the length of S-1.
For each iteration, it checks if the character at index i is "m", in which case it increments c.
If the character at index i is "w", it decrements c.
If c is 0 after an iteration, the loop breaks.
If c is not 0 after the loop, the function returns False.
Otherwise, it checks if the character at index 1 is "e", and if it is, it sets i to 0.
It then recursively calls isCat on the substring of S from index 1 to index i+1 and the substring of S from index i+2 to the end of S.
If both of these recursive calls return True, the function returns True.
Otherwise, it returns False.

The code then checks if the input is a cat by calling isCat on the input and printing "Cat" if it is, and "Rabbit" otherwise.
