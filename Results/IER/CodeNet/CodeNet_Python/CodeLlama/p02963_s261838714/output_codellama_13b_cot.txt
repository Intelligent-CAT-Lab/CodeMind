  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an input s from the user.
The code then checks if s is equal to 10**18, which is 100000000000000000. If it is, the code prints 0,0,0,1000000000,1000000000,0 and exits.
If s is not equal to 10**18, the code calculates y as s//1000000000+1, which is the integer part of s divided by 1000000000 plus 1.
The code then calculates x as 1000000000*y-s, which is 1000000000 times y minus s.
Finally, the code prints 0,0,1000000000,1,x,y.
