  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the defaultdict class from the collections module and initializes two variables n and k with the values 3 and 1, respectively.
The code then initializes two lists fctr and finv with the values [1] and [1], respectively.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to rng (in this case, 2010), and for each iteration, it calculates the factorial of i and stores it in fctr.
The code then enters another loop that iterates from 1 to rng, and for each iteration, it calculates the modular multiplicative inverse of i and stores it in finv.
The code then defines a function cmb that takes two integers n and k as input and returns the binomial coefficient of n and k.
The code then checks if (n-k)*2 is less than or equal to n, and if it is, it sets x to (n-k)*2 and initializes a variable ans to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to x+1, and for each iteration, it calculates the binomial coefficient of x and i and adds it to ans.
The code then prints the value of ans and exits the program.
The code then initializes a defaultdict dc with an integer value of 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to k+1, and for each iteration, it initializes a variable a to j and a variable b to k+j.
The code then initializes a variable cnt to 0 and enters a loop that iterates from a to n and b to n, and for each iteration, it increments cnt by 1.
The code then adds the value of cnt to the defaultdict dc with the key cnt.
The code then initializes a variable nn to (n-k)*2 and initializes a set cp with the value 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to nn+1, and for each iteration, it initializes a list dp with the value [0 for j in range(n+1)].
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to nn+1, and for each iteration, it initializes a list dp with the value dp[i-1][:].
The code then checks if i is not in cp, and if it is not, it enters a loop that iterates from 1 to min(i,n)+1, and for each iteration, it adds the value of dp[i-2][j-1] to dp[i][j] and sets dp[i][j] to the modular sum of dp[i][j] and dp[i-2][j-1].
The code then checks if i is in cp, and if it is, it enters a loop that iterates from 1 to min(i,n)+1, and for each iteration, it adds the value of dp[i-1][j-1] to dp[i][j] and sets dp[i][j] to the modular sum of dp[i][j] and dp[i-1][j-1].
The code then initializes a variable ans to 0 and enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n+1, and for each iteration, it checks if i is even, and if it is, it adds the value of fctr[n-i]*dp[nn][i] to ans, and if it is not, it subtracts the value of fctr[n-i]*dp[nn][i] from ans.
The code then prints the value of ans and exits the program.
