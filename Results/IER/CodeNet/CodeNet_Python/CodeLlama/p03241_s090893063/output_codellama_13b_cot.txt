  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module and defines two functions: input, which reads a line from standard input and removes the trailing newline character, and write, which writes a line to standard output.
The code then sets the recursion limit to the maximum of 1000 and 10^9.
The code then reads two integers, n and m, from standard input using the input function and splits them into a list of integers using the map function.
The code then initializes a variable ans to -1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to m+1.
For each i in this range, the code checks if i*i is greater than m+10. If it is, the code breaks out of the loop.
If i is a divisor of m, the code checks if m//i is greater than or equal to n. If it is, the code sets ans to the maximum of ans and i.
If i is greater than or equal to n, the code sets ans to the maximum of ans and m//i.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans.
