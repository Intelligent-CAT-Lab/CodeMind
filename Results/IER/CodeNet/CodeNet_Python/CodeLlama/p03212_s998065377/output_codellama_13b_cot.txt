  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input n and defines a recursive function dfs that takes a string s as input.
The function checks if the length of s is greater than n, and if so, returns 0.
If not, it checks if all the characters in s are in the set "753", and if so, returns 1.
If not, it iterates over the characters in "753" and calls dfs with s+c as the input.
The function returns the sum of the values returned by the recursive calls.
The code then calls dfs with the string "0" as the input and prints the result.

<<<Output>>>
