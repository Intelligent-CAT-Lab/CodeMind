  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user in the form of two integers n and k.
The variable edges is initialized to a list of lists, where each sublist contains two integers, representing an edge in a graph.
The variable cnt is initialized to the number of edges in the graph, which is (n-1)*(n-2)//2.
The variable ans is initialized to n-1, which will be used to store the number of edges in the graph after the algorithm is applied.
The code then checks if the number of edges in the graph is less than k, and if it is, it prints -1 and exits.
If the number of edges in the graph is greater than or equal to k, the code enters a nested loop that iterates over all possible edges in the graph.
For each edge, it checks if the number of edges in the graph is greater than k, and if it is, it adds the edge to the list of edges and updates the number of edges in the graph.
The loop continues until the number of edges in the graph is less than or equal to k.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the number of edges in the graph, which is stored in the variable ans.
It then prints each edge in the list of edges.
