  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in three inputs: a, b, and n.
The variable a is initialized to 19, b is initialized to 30, and n is initialized to 3.
The code calculates the absolute difference between a and b, which is 11.
The code then enters a nested loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive) for both x and y.
For each iteration of the loop, the code checks if b * x is divisible by y. If it is, the code calculates the new value of a, which is b * x // y.
The code then calculates the absolute difference between the new value of a and the original value of a, which is 11.
The code repeats this process for each iteration of the loop, and the minimum value of the absolute difference is stored in the variable score.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of score, which is 11.
<<<Output>>>
11
