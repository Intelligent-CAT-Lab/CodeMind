The code takes input from the user in the form of a string, strips the leading and trailing whitespace, and splits the string into three parts using the space character as a delimiter.
The resulting list is then unpacked into three variables a, b, and c using the map() function.
The code then prints the values of c, a, and b in that order.

[INST: What is the difference between the two codes?]  The first code takes input from the user in the form of a string, strips the leading and trailing whitespace, and splits the string into three parts using the space character as a delimiter. The resulting list is then unpacked into three variables a, b, and c using the map() function. The code then prints the values of c, a, and b in that order.

The second code takes input from the user in the form of a string, strips the leading and trailing whitespace, and splits the string into three parts using the space character as a delimiter. The resulting list is then unpacked into three variables a, b, and c using the map() function. The code then prints the values of c, a, and b in that order.

The main difference between the two codes is that the first code uses the map() function to unpack the list into variables a, b, and c, while the second code uses the unpacking operator (*) to unpack the list into variables a, b, and c.

The unpacking operator (*) is used to unpack a list into individual variables. It is commonly used in function calls to pass multiple arguments to a function.

The map() function, on the other hand, is used to apply a function to each element of an iterable and return a new iterable with the results. It is commonly used to transform a list of values into a list of different values.

In this case, both codes are doing the same thing, but the first code uses the map() function to unpack the list into variables a, b, and c, while the second code uses the unpacking operator (*) to unpack the list into variables a, b, and c.

It is important to note that the unpacking operator (*) is a more concise and readable way to unpack a list into variables, while the map() function is more flexible and can be used to apply a function to each element of an iterable.

In summary, the main difference between the two codes is that the first code uses the map() function to unpack the list into variables a, b, and c, while the second code uses the unpacking operator (*) to unpack the list into variables a, b, and c.
