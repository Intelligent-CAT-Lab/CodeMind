  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input n and k from the user.
n is 7 and k is 7.
The code then initializes an empty list r and enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 11.
For each number i in this range, it initializes a variable m to 0 and enters another loop that iterates from 1 to 5.
For each number j in this range, it initializes a variable t to 0 and enters another loop that iterates from 3 to 3.
For each number x in this range, it adds 7*(i+y) + (j+x) - 7 to t, where y is a variable that takes on the values 0, 1, and 2.
The code then checks if t % 11 is equal to k, which is 7 in this case. If it is, it adds 1 to m.
The code then appends m to r.
The code then calculates a and b using the formula a = n // 11 and b = n % 11.
The code then initializes a variable ans to 0.
The code then adds a*sum(r) to ans.
The code then checks if b < 1, and if it is, it subtracts r[-2] from ans.
The code then checks if b < 2, and if it is, it subtracts r[-1] from ans.
The code then checks if b >= 3, and if it is, it enters a loop that iterates from b-2 to 0 and adds r[i] to ans for each iteration.
The code then prints ans.
