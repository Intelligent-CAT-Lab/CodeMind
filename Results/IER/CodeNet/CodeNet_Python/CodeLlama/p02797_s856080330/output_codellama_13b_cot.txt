  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first maps the input to three variables: N, K, and S.
N is set to 4, K is set to 2, and S is set to 3.
The code then checks if S is equal to 10^9.
If it is, the code sets ans to a list of S repeated K times, followed by a list of 1 repeated N-K times.
If S is not equal to 10^9, the code sets ans to a list of S repeated K times, followed by a list of 10^9 repeated N-K times.
The code then prints the contents of ans.
<<<Output>>>
[3, 3, 1, 1]
