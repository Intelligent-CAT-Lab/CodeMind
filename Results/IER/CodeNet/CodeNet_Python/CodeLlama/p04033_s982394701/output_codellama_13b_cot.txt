  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module and defines the input function as sys.stdin.readline.
The code then defines a main function that takes two integers a and b as input.
The main function first checks if a is less than or equal to 0 and b is greater than or equal to 0. If this condition is met, the code prints "Zero" and returns.
The main function then checks if a is less than 0 and b is less than 0. If this condition is met, the code calculates the difference between b and a and checks if it is divisible by 2. If it is, the code prints "Negative" and returns.
If none of the above conditions are met, the code prints "Positive".
The code then defines the main function as the entry point of the program.
<<<Output>>>
Positive
