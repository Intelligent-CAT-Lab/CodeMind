The variable N is initialized to 15, which is the input given to the code.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 15.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is divisible by 5 and 3. If it is, it adds i to the variable ans.
The condition is met when i is 15.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 15.
<<<Output>>>
15
