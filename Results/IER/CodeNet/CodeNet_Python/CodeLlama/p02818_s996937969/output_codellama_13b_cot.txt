<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in three integers a, b, and k as input.
The first if statement checks if a is greater than or equal to k. If it is, the code prints a-k and b.
The elif statement checks if a+b is greater than or equal to k. If it is, the code prints 0 and a+b-k.
If neither of the above conditions are met, the code prints 0 and 0.

In this case, the input is 2, 3, and 3.
The first if statement is not met, as 2 is less than 3.
The elif statement is met, as 2+3 is greater than or equal to 3.
The code prints 0 and 5.
<<<Output>>>
0 5
