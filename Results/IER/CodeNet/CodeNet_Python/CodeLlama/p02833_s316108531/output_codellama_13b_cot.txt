<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input n from the user.
It then checks if n is odd by checking if n%2==1.
If n is odd, the code prints 0 and exits.
If n is even, the code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to log2(n).
For each iteration, the code calculates the number of times 5 can be divided into n without leaving a remainder.
The code then adds this number to cnt and increments i.
After the loop finishes, the code prints cnt.

In this case, n=12, which is even.
The loop iterates from 1 to log2(12) = 3.
For each iteration, the code calculates the number of times 5 can be divided into 12 without leaving a remainder.
The first iteration calculates the number of times 5 can be divided into 12 without leaving a remainder, which is 2.
The second iteration calculates the number of times 5 can be divided into 6 without leaving a remainder, which is 1.
The third iteration calculates the number of times 5 can be divided into 3 without leaving a remainder, which is 0.
The code then adds these numbers to cnt and increments i.
After the loop finishes, the code prints cnt, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>
