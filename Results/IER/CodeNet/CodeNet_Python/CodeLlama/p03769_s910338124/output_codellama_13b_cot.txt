  <<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function f(n) that takes an integer n as input.
The function has three cases:
1. If n is 1, it returns an empty list.
2. If n is even, it recursively calls f(n//2) and appends the length of the returned list plus 1 to the result.
3. If n is odd, it recursively calls f(n-1) and prepends the length of the returned list plus 1 to the result.
The code then takes an integer input n from the user and calls f(n+1) to get the result.
It then prints the length of the result and the result itself.
<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will depend on the input given to the function f(n).
For example, if the input is 7, the output will be:
7
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
