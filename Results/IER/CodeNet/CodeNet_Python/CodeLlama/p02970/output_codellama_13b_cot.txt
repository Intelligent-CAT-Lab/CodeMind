<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function solve() that takes two integers as input, n and d.
The function first splits the input into two integers using the map() function.
The function then calculates the value of n//(2*d+1) and prints the negative of that value using the print() function.
The code then checks if the module name is '__main__' and if it is, it calls the solve() function.
<<<Output>>>
