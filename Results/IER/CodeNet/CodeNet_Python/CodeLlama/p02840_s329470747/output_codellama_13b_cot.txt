  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first maps the input to three variables: N, X, and D.
N is set to 3, X is set to 4, and D is set to 2.
The code then checks if D is less than 0, and if it is, it sets X to -X and D to -D.
Since D is not less than 0 in this case, the code moves on to the next step.
The code then checks if D is equal to 0, and if it is, it creates a set called Sets and adds the numbers from 0 to N+1 to it.
The code then prints the length of Sets, which is 4, and exits the program.
Since D is not equal to 0 in this case, the code moves on to the next step.
The code then initializes a dictionary called Mode and sets it to a defaultdict with a list as its default value.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to N+1, and for each number i, it calculates the left and right boundaries of the current interval.
The left boundary is calculated as (i*X+D*i*(i-1)//2-i*X % D)//D, and the right boundary is calculated as (i*X+D*i*(2*N-1-i)//2-i*X % D)//D.
The code then adds the current number i to the dictionary Mode with the key i*X % D and the value (L, 1) and (R+1, -1).
The code then sorts the values in Mode based on the first element of each tuple.
The code then initializes a list called Data and appends the values in Mode to it.
The code then initializes a variable called ans and sets it to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the values in Data.
For each value, the code checks if the third element of the tuple is greater than 0, and if it is, it adds the difference between the second and first elements of the tuple to ans.
The code then prints the final value of ans, which is 2.
