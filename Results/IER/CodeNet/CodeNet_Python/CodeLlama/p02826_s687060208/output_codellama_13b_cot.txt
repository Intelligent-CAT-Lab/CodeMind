  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs, N and M, from the user.
N is an integer that represents the number of elements in the list A.
M is an integer that represents the modulo value.
The code initializes a list A with the values from 1 to N//2, and then multiplies it by 2.
If N is odd, the code adds (N+1)//2 to the list A.
The code then initializes a list d with 1 and 0s, where the length of d is 2N+1.
The code enters a loop that iterates over the elements of A.
For each element x in A, the code enters another loop that iterates over the range of N+1.
For each iteration of the inner loop, the code calculates d[i]%M and d[i+x]%M.
The code then adds d[i]%M to d[i+x]%M.
The code repeats these steps until the inner loop finishes.
The code then prints the sum of the first N elements of d, modulo M.
<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will be 1000000007.
