<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input from the user and stores it in variable a.
The code then checks if the value of a is less than 1200. If it is, it prints the string 'ABC'. Otherwise, it prints the string 'ARC'.
Since the input is 1000, the condition is not met, and the code prints 'ARC'.
<<<Output>>>
ARC
