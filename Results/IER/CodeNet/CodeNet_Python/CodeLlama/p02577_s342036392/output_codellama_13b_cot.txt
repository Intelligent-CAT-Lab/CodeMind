  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys and math modules.
The code then defines a few functions:
ins: reads a line from stdin and removes the trailing newline character.
ini: reads a line from stdin, converts it to an integer, and removes the trailing newline character.
inm: reads a line from stdin, splits it into a list of integers, and returns the list.
inl: reads a line from stdin, splits it into a list of integers, and returns the list.
out: takes a list of integers and joins them with newlines.
The code then reads an integer n from stdin using the ini function.
The code then prints "No" if n is not divisible by 9, and "Yes" otherwise.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
