<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in three integers as input, separated by spaces.
The variables a, b, and c are initialized to the values of the input.
The code then checks if any of the following conditions are true:
* a + b == c
* a + c == b
* b + c == a
If any of these conditions are true, the code sets the variable ans to "Yes".
Finally, the code prints the value of ans.

In this case, the input is 10 30 20, so the values of a, b, and c are 10, 30, and 20, respectively.
The code checks if any of the following conditions are true:
* 10 + 30 == 20 (false)
* 10 + 20 == 30 (false)
* 30 + 20 == 10 (true)
Since the last condition is true, the code sets ans to "Yes".

<<<Output>>>
Yes
