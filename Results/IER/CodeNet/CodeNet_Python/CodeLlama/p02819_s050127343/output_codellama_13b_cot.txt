<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input n from the user and initializes a variable prime_dc to 0.
The code then enters an infinite loop that iterates until the condition n-2 == prime_dc is met.
For each iteration, the code calculates the number of prime divisors of n using the for loop.
If the number of prime divisors is equal to n-2, the code breaks out of the loop and prints the value of n.
The code then exits the loop and prints the final value of n.
