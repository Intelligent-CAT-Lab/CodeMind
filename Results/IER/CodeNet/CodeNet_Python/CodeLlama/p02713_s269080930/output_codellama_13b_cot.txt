  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the math module, which provides a function for calculating the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers.
The code then defines a variable K and initializes it to the input value, which is 2 in this case.
The code then defines a variable ans and initializes it to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to K+1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 3.
For each number i in this range, it enters another loop that iterates from 1 to K+1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 3.
For each number j in this range, it enters another loop that iterates from 1 to K+1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 3.
For each number k in this range, it calculates the GCD of i and j, and then calculates the GCD of the result with k.
The code then adds the result of this calculation to the variable ans.
The code then prints the final value of ans.
