  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string input s and calls the solve function with s as an argument.
The solve function first calculates the length of the string n and then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n-1.
For each index i in this range, the code checks if the characters at indices i-1 and i are the same.
If they are, the function prints the indices i and i+1 and returns.
If the loop finishes without finding a match, the code enters another loop that iterates from 2 to n-2.
For each index i in this range, the code checks if the characters at indices i-2 and i are the same.
If they are, the function prints the indices i-1 and i+1 and returns.
If both loops finish without finding a match, the function prints -1 -1 and returns.
<<<Output>>>
-1 -1
