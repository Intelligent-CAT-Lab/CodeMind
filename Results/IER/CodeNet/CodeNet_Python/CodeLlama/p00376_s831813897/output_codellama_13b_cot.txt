<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, a and b, from the user.
The code then checks if a-b is equal to 0, if it is, it prints 0.
If a-b is not equal to 0, the code checks if a is greater than b, if it is, it prints a-b.
If a is less than b, the code prints b-a.

In this case, a=20 and b=30, so a-b is 10, which is not equal to 0.
Since a is less than b, the code prints b-a, which is 30-20=10.

<<<Output>>>
10
