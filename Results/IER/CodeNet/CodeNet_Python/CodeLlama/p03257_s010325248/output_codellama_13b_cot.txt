  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the fractions and sys modules.
The function lcm is defined, which calculates the least common multiple of two numbers.
The input N is read from the user and stored in the variable N.
If N is equal to 2, the code prints two lines of output and exits.
Otherwise, the code initializes a list lis with the value 2 and then enters a loop that iterates until the length of lis is greater than or equal to 2N.
The loop checks if the current number now is divisible by any of the numbers in lis. If it is not, the number is added to lis.
The code then initializes a 2D list ans with N rows and N columns, each initialized to 1.
The code then enters another loop that iterates over each row and column of ans.
For each cell, the code calculates the least common multiple of the values in the row and column using the lcm function.
If the sum of the row and column indices is odd, the code multiplies the current cell value by the last element of lis.
If the sum of the row and column indices is even, the code multiplies the current cell value by the second-to-last element of lis.
The code then prints the final value of ans.
<<<Output>>>
The output of the code depends on the value of N.
If N is equal to 2, the code prints two lines of output and exits.
Otherwise, the code prints a 2D list of integers, where each element is the least common multiple of the values in the row and column.
