The code first takes two inputs a and b from the user.
The function gcp is defined, which takes two arguments x and y.
The function performs the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of x and y.
The function returns the maximum of x and y.
The code then prints the output of the function gcp with the arguments a and b.
