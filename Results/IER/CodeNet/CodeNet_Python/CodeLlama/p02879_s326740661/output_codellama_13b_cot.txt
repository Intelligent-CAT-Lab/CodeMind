<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, separated by a space.
The variables a and b are initialized to the values of the input.
The code checks if a and b are within the range [1, 9] using the if statement.
If they are, the code prints the product of a and b.
If they are not, the code prints -1.

In this case, the input is 2 and 5, which are both within the range [1, 9].
The output of the code is therefore 10.
<<<Output>>>
