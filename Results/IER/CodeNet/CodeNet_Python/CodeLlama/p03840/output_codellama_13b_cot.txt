  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first maps the input to variables I, O, T, J, L, S, and Z.
The code then checks if I, J, and L are all non-zero. If they are, it calculates a and b.
If I, J, and L are all non-zero, a is calculated as ((I-1)//2 + (J-1)//2 + (L-1)//2)*2 + 3 + O.
If I, J, and L are all non-zero, b is calculated as (I//2 + J//2 + L//2)*2 + O.
The code then calculates the maximum of a and b and prints it.
