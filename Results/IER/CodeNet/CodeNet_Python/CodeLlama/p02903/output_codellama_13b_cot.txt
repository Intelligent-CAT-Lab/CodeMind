  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in four inputs: h, w, a, and b.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to h-1.
For each iteration, the code checks if the current iteration number i is less than b.
If it is, the code prints a string of a's followed by w-a's.
If it is not, the code prints a string of w-a's followed by a's.
The code then repeats this process for each iteration until the loop finishes.
