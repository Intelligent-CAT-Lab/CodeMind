  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input n from the user and then enters a nested loop that iterates from 1 to 3500.
The inner loop iterates from i to 3500.
The code checks if the expression 4*i*j-n*(i+j) is positive and if n*i*j is divisible by 4*i*j-n*(i+j).
If the condition is met, the code assigns the value of n*i*j//(4*i*j-n*(i+j)) to k.
The code then breaks out of both loops and prints the values of i, j, and k.

<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will depend on the input value of n.
If n is 2, the output will be 1, 2, 1.
If n is 3, the output will be 1, 3, 1.
If n is 4, the output will be 2, 4, 2.
If n is 5, the output will be 2, 5, 2.
If n is 6, the output will be 3, 6, 3.
If n is 7, the output will be 3, 7, 3.
If n is 8, the output will be 4, 8, 4.
If n is 9, the output will be 4, 9, 4.
If n is 10, the output will be 5, 10, 5.
