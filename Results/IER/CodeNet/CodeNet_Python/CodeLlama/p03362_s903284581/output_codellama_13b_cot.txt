  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first prompts the user to input a number n.
The variable p is initialized to [2], which is a list of prime numbers.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to 55556 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 2 to 55556.
For each number i in this range, it iterates through the list of prime numbers p and checks if i is divisible by any of them. If it is, it breaks out of the loop and moves on to the next number.
If i is not divisible by any of the prime numbers in p, it is added to the list p.
The code then enters another loop that iterates through the list of prime numbers p and checks if any of them are divisible by 5. If they are, they are added to the list l.
The code then converts the list l to a list of strings and joins them with spaces to form a single string.
The code finally prints this string.
