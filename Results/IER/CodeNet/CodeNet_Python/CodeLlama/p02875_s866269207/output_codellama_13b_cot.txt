  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first defines two functions, calc and cnk.
The calc function calculates the factorial of a number n and its inverse modulo a given modulus.
The cnk function calculates the binomial coefficient of two numbers n and r modulo a given modulus.
The code then takes an integer input n and a modulus mod.
The code then calculates the factorial and inverse of n+10 and stores them in f and inv, respectively.
The code then calculates the power of 3 to n modulo mod and stores it in ans.
The code then initializes an array p with the value 1 and appends 2 to it n//2+10 times.
The code then calculates the binomial coefficient of n and k for k from n//2+1 to n and stores the result in cur.
The code then subtracts cur from ans and stores the result in ans.
The code then prints the final value of ans.
