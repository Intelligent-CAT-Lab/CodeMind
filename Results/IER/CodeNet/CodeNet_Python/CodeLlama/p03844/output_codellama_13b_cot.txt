<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes input from the user in the form of a string.
The input string is split into three parts using the split() method.
The first part is assigned to variable A, the second part is assigned to variable s, and the third part is assigned to variable B.
The variables A and B are then converted to integers using the int() method.
The code then checks the value of variable s. If it is '+', it prints the sum of A and B. If it is '-', it prints the difference of A and B.
