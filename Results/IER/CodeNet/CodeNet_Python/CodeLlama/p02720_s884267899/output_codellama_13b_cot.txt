  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the deque data structure from the collections module.
The variable a is initialized to the input value 15.
The list1 is initialized to a deque containing the numbers 1 to 9.
The variable i is initialized to 1.
The code enters a while loop that iterates until i is greater than or equal to a.
The code checks if i is not equal to a, and if it is not, it performs the following operations:
1. It removes the first element from the list1 using the popleft() method.
2. It converts the removed element to a string and appends the string to the list1.
3. It increments the value of i by 1.
If i is equal to a, the code prints the first element of the list1 and breaks out of the loop.

<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will be 15.
