  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs N and K, and initializes MOD to 10^9 + 7.
The code then initializes p and q to 1.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to N-1.
For each iteration, the code calculates p and q as follows:
p = p * (N+K-1-i) % MOD
q = q * (i+1) % MOD
The loop finishes when i = N-1.
The code then prints the result of p * pow(q, MOD-2, MOD) % MOD.
<<<Output>>>
The output of the code is 1024.
