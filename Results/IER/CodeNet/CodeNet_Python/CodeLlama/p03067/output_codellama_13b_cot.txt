<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input, separated by spaces.
The variables a, b, and c are initialized to the values of the input.
The code then checks if the condition a < c < b or a > c > b is true.
In this case, the condition is true because 3 < 5 < 8.
The code then prints 'Yes' to the console.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
