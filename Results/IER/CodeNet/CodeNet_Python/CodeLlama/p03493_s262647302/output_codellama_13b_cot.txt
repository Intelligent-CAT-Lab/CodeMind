<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user and stores it in the variable stdin.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of occurrences of the character "1" in the input.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each character in the input string.
For each character, it checks if it is equal to the character "1". If it is, it increments the variable ans by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is the number of occurrences of the character "1" in the input.
<<<Output>>>
