<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, A and B, and splits them into two variables.
The code then calculates the maximum of three expressions: A+B, A-B, and A*B.
The expressions are evaluated as follows:
* A+B = -13 + 3 = 10
* A-B = -13 - 3 = -16
* A*B = -13 * 3 = -39
The maximum of these expressions is 10, so the code prints 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
