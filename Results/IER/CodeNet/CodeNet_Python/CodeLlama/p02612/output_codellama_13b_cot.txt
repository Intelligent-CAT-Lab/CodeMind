<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input from the user and stores it in the variable n.
The code then calculates the remainder of n divided by 1000 using the modulo operator (%).
The code checks if the remainder is not equal to 0, and if it is, it calculates the difference between 1000 and the remainder.
If the remainder is equal to 0, the code prints 0.
<<<Output>>>
100
