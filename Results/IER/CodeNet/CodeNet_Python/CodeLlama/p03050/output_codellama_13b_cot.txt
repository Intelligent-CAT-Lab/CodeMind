  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the math module, which provides mathematical functions.
The variable N is initialized to the input value 8.
The variable n is initialized to the square root of N, which is 2.
The variable plist is initialized to an empty list.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n+1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 3.
For each number i in this range, it checks if N is divisible by i. If it is, it adds i to the list plist.
The code also checks if i is not equal to the quotient of N divided by i. If it is, it adds the quotient to the list plist.
The loop finishes and the code enters another loop that iterates over the elements of the list plist.
For each element x in the list, it calculates the value of kari as N/x - 1.
The code then checks if kari is not equal to 0. If it is, it calculates the value of q as N/kari and the value of r as N%kari.
If q is equal to r, it adds kari to the variable ans.
The loop finishes and the code prints the final value of ans, which is 2.
