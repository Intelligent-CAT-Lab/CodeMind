  <<<Analysis>>>
The function ex_euclid takes two integers x and y as input and returns their greatest common divisor (gcd), the coefficients of the linear combination of x and y that produces the gcd, and the coefficients of the linear combination of x and y that produces the gcd.
The function uses the extended Euclidean algorithm to find the gcd of x and y.
The input to the function is 4 and 12.
The function first initializes the variables c0, c1, a0, a1, b0, and b1 to the values of x and y, respectively.
The function then enters a loop that iterates while c1 is non-zero.
In each iteration, the function updates the values of a0, a1, b0, and b1 using the following formulas:
a0 = a1
a1 = a0 - c0 // c1 \* a1
b0 = b1
b1 = b0 - c0 // c1 \* b1
c0 = c1
c1 = c0 % c1
The function repeats these updates until c1 is zero.
When c1 is zero, the function returns the values of c0, a0, and b0, which are the gcd, the coefficient of x in the linear combination that produces the gcd, and the coefficient of y in the linear combination that produces the gcd, respectively.
The function ex_euclid is then called with the input 4 and 12, and the output is stored in the variables c, a, and b.
The function prints the values of a and b.
