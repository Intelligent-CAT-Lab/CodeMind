  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes in two inputs, N and K, and stores them in variables N and K, respectively.
The code then checks if N is even or odd. If N is even, it checks if N/2 is greater than or equal to K. If it is, it prints "YES", otherwise it prints "NO".
If N is odd, it checks if N/2 + 1 is greater than or equal to K. If it is, it prints "YES", otherwise it prints "NO".
<<<Output>>>
NO
