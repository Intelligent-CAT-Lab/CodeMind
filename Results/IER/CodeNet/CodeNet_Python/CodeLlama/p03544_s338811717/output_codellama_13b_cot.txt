<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 5, which is the input given.
The list a is initialized with the values [2,1].
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n-1 (exclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 4.
For each number i in this range, it appends the sum of the last two elements of the list a to the list a.
The condition is met when i is 0,1,2,3 and 4.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of a[len(a)-1], which is 13.
<<<Output>>>
13
