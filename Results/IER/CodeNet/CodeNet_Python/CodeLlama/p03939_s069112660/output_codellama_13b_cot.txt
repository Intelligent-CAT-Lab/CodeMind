  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in three inputs: N, d1, and xx.
N is an integer, d1 and xx are floating point numbers.
The code initializes d and x to d1 and xx, respectively.
The code then enters a while loop that iterates until N is equal to 1.
In each iteration, the code calculates the sum of the following expression:
(2*d + (2*N-1)*x) / 2
The code then updates d and x using the following formulas:
d = d * (1 + 1/N)
d = d + x * 5/(2*N)
x = x * (1 + 2/N)
The code then decrements N by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of res + d + x/2.
