<<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the fractions module, which is used to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers.
The code then defines a function named dfs, which takes an integer n as input and returns a list of integers representing the number of times each prime factor of n appears in its prime factorization.
The function first initializes an empty list named table, and then sets i to 2.
The function then enters a loop that iterates while n is greater than or equal to i squared.
Inside the loop, the function checks if n is divisible by i, and if so, it increments the value of cnt by 1 and divides n by i.
If cnt is greater than 0, the function appends cnt to the table.
The function then increments i by 1 and repeats the loop.
After the loop finishes, the function checks if n is greater than 1, and if so, it appends 1 to the table.
The function then returns the table.
The code then defines a variable named dfs_list, which is set to the result of calling the dfs function with the GCD of a and b as input.
The code then prints the length of dfs_list plus 1.
