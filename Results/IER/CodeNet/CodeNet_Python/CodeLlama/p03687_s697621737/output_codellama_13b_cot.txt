  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input string S and stores it in a variable.
It then initializes a variable ans to a large value (10^9) and a list alphabet to contain all the lowercase letters of the English alphabet.
The code then iterates over each character in the alphabet and checks if it is present in the input string S. If it is not, it skips to the next character.
If the character is present in S, the code calculates the minimum number of steps required to remove all occurrences of that character from S.
The steps are calculated by repeatedly removing all occurrences of the character from S until S contains only that character.
The code then updates the variable ans to the minimum of the current value of ans and the number of steps required to remove all occurrences of the current character from S.
Finally, the code prints the value of ans, which is the minimum number of steps required to remove all occurrences of all characters from S.
<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will depend on the input string S. If S contains only one character, the output will be 0. If S contains multiple characters, the output will be the minimum number of steps required to remove all occurrences of all characters from S.
