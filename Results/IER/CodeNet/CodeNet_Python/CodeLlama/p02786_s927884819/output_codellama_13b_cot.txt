<<<Analysis>>>
The variable h is initialized to 2, which is the input given to the code.
The variable l is initialized to 0.
The code enters a loop that iterates while h is greater than 0.
In each iteration, the code multiplies l by 2 and adds 1 to it, storing the result in l.
The code then divides h by 2 and stores the result in h.
The loop continues until h is 0, at which point the code prints the final value of l, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>
