The code first takes in three integers as input, n, a, and b, and splits them into a list of integers using the split() method.
The code then defines a function called doit() that takes in three arguments: a, b, and mask.
The function first checks if the number of bits that are different between a and b is odd, and if it is, it returns "NO".
If the number of bits that are different between a and b is even, the function returns "YES" and calls the doit() function recursively.
The doit() function takes in three arguments: a, b, and mask.
The function first checks if the mask has a bit set to 0 and if the XOR of a and b has a bit set to 1 at the same position. If it does, it sets the differ variable to the position of the bit.
The function then checks if the mask has a bit set to 0 and if the position of the bit is not the same as the differ variable. If it does, it sets the same variable to the position of the bit.
If the same variable is not set to -1, the function returns a list of two integers, a and b.
If the same variable is set to -1, the function calls the doit() function recursively with the arguments a, a XOR (1 << same), and mask | (1 << differ).
The function then calls the doit() function recursively with the arguments a XOR (1 << same) XOR (1 << differ), b, and mask | (1 << differ).
The function returns the sum of the two lists returned by the recursive calls to doit().
The code then checks if the number of bits that are different between a and b is odd, and if it is, it returns "NO".
