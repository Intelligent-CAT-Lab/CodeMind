  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the necessary modules, including math and collections.
The MOD variable is set to 1000000007, which is used as a modulus for the final answer.
The prime_decomposition function is defined, which takes an integer n as input and returns a list of its prime factors in ascending order.
The solve function is defined, which takes an integer N as input and calculates the number of ways to arrange N objects in a row such that no two adjacent objects are the same color.
The main function is defined, which reads the input from stdin and calls the solve function with the input value.
The code then checks if the __name__ variable is set to "__main__", which indicates that the code is being run as the main program. If so, it calls the main function.
<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will depend on the input provided. If the input is 3, the output will be 6, which is the number of ways to arrange 3 objects in a row such that no two adjacent objects are the same color.
