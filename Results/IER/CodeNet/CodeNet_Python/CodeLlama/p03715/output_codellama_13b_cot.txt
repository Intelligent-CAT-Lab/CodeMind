  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input of two integers h and w, and then checks if either h or w is divisible by 3. If it is, the code prints 0 and exits.
The code then initializes res to the minimum of h and w.
The code then enters two loops. The first loop iterates from 1 to h, and for each value of hi, it calculates three values: b1, b2, and b3.
The code then calculates the minimum and maximum of these three values and subtracts the minimum from the maximum to get the value of res.
The second loop is similar to the first loop, but it iterates from 1 to w instead of h.
After both loops finish, the code prints the final value of res.
