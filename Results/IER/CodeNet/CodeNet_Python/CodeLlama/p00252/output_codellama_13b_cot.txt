<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user and stores it in the variable B.
The variable O is a list of strings, and it contains two elements: "1 1 0" and "0 0 1".
The code then checks if the input B is present in the list O.
Since the input B is "0 0 1", which is present in the list O, the code prints "Open".
<<<Output>>>
Open
