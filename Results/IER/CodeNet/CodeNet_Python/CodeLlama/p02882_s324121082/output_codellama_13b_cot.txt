  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the math module, which provides mathematical functions.
The code then reads in three integers from the input, which are stored in the variables a, b, and x.
The code then calculates the value of c as x/a.
The code then checks if c is greater than a*b/2. If it is, the code calculates the value of d as c*2/a.
If c is not greater than a*b/2, the code calculates the value of d as c*2/b.
The code then calculates the value of e as the arctangent of d/a.
Finally, the code prints the value of e in degrees.
