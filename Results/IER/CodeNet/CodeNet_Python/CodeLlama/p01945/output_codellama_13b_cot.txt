  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input as a string and stores it in the variable S.
The variable N is initialized to the index of the first occurrence of the character '*' in the string S.
The code then calculates the difference between the number of '(' and ')' in the substring of S from the beginning to the index N, and stores the absolute value in the variable P.
The code then calculates the difference between the number of '(' and ')' in the substring of S from the index N+1 to the end of the string, and stores the absolute value in the variable Q.
The code finally prints the minimum of P and Q.
