<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input from the user and appends 15 "o"s to the end of the string.
The code then initializes a variable count1 to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 14 (inclusive).
For each iteration, it checks if the character at the current index is "o". If it is, it increments count1 by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if count1 is greater than or equal to 8. If it is, it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".
<<<Output>>>
YES
