  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input as a string and splits it into a list of integers using the split() method.
The code then initializes the variables a, b, c, and d to the first four elements of the list.
The code then initializes the variable e to the fifth element of the list.
The code then initializes the variable f to the sixth element of the list.
The code then initializes the variable listx to an empty list.
The code then initializes the variable listy to an empty list.
The code then initializes the variable xy_max to 0.
The code then initializes the variable y_max to 0.
The code then initializes the variable noudo_max to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the elements of listx and listy.
The code checks if the sum of the current elements of listx and listy is greater than f.
If it is, the code breaks out of the loop.
The code then enters a nested loop that iterates over the elements of listy.
The code checks if the current element of listy is greater than the product of the current element of listx and the variable e.
If it is, the code breaks out of the loop.
The code then calculates the variable noudo as the ratio of the current element of listy to the sum of the current elements of listx and listy.
The code checks if the variable noudo is greater than or equal to the variable noudo_max.
If it is, the code updates the variables xy_max, y_max, and noudo_max.
The code then prints the message consisting of the values of xy_max, y_max, and noudo_max.
