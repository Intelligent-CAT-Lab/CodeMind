  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes the input string S as an argument.
The variable N is initialized to the length of S, which is 3 in this case.
The function dfs is defined, which takes two arguments: i and f.
The function dfs recursively calls itself with two different arguments:
1. i+1 and f+'+'+S[i+1]
2. i+1 and f+S[i+1]
The function returns the sum of the two recursive calls.
The function dfs is called with the arguments 0 and S[0], which is '1'.
The function returns the sum of the two recursive calls, which is 125.
<<<Output>>>
125
