<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an input from the user and stores it in the variable n.
The variable n is then checked to see if it is between 65 and 90, inclusive.
If it is, the code prints "1".
If it is not, the code checks if it is between 97 and 122, inclusive.
If it is, the code prints "2".
If it is not, the code prints "0".

In this case, the input is 67, which is not between 65 and 90, inclusive.
It is also not between 97 and 122, inclusive.
Therefore, the code prints "0".
<<<Output>>>
0
