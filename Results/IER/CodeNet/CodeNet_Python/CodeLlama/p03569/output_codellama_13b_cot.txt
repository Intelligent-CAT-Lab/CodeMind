  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input string S from the user.
It then initializes three variables: i, j, and c.
i is set to 0, j is set to the length of S minus 1, and c is set to 0.
The code then enters a while loop that continues until the condition i >= j is met.
Inside the loop, the code checks if the characters at positions i and j are the same.
If they are, the code increments i and decrements j.
If they are not, the code checks if the character at position i is 'x'.
If it is, the code increments i and increments c.
If the character at position j is 'x', the code decrements j and increments c.
If neither of these conditions is met, the code prints -1 and exits the program.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the value of c.
