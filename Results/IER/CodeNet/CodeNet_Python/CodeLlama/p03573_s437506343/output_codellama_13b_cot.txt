<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in a string input from the user, splits it into three parts using the split() method, and assigns the parts to variables a, b, and c.
The code then checks if a is equal to b, and if so, prints c.
If a is not equal to b, the code checks if a is equal to c, and if so, prints b.
If a is not equal to b and c, the code prints a.

In this case, the input is "5 7 5", so a is equal to b, and the code prints c, which is 5.
<<<Output>>>
5
