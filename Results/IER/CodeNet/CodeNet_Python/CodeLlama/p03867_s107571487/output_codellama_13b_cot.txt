  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module and defines two functions: input and write.
The input function reads a line from the standard input and removes the trailing newline character.
The write function writes a string to the standard output followed by a newline character.
The code then sets the recursion limit to 1000 or 10^9, whichever is larger.
The next line defines a function called fs that takes an integer n as input and returns a list of its divisors in ascending order.
The function first creates an empty set called s and then iterates from 1 to the square root of n (inclusive) and checks if n is divisible by i. If it is, it adds i and n/i to the set s.
The function then converts the set s to a list called l and returns l.
The code then defines two variables n and k, which are the input values.
The code then defines a variable M, which is 10^9+7.
The code then calls the function fs with n as input and stores the result in a variable called ds.
The code then defines a variable m, which is the length of ds.
The code then defines a list called nums, which has m elements.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to m-1 (inclusive).
For each i, the code calculates the value of val as pow(k, (ds[i]+1)//2, M).
The code then enters another loop that iterates from 0 to i-1 (inclusive).
For each j, the code checks if ds[i] is divisible by ds[j]. If it is, the code subtracts nums[j] from val and reduces the result modulo M.
The code then stores the value of val in nums[i].
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to m-1 (inclusive).
For each i, the code checks if ds[i] is even. If it is, the code adds ds[i]*nums[i]*inv2 to ans, where inv2 is pow(2, M-2, M).
If ds[i] is odd, the code adds ds[i]*nums[i] to ans.
The code then reduces the value of ans modulo M and prints it.
