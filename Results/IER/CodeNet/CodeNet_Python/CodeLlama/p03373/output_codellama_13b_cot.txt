  <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads the input from stdin and assigns it to the variables a, b, c, x, and y.
The variables a, b, and c are assigned the values 1500, 2000, and 1600, respectively.
The variables x and y are assigned the values 3 and 2, respectively.
The code then initializes the variable ans to 0.
The code then checks if 2 * c is less than or equal to a + b.
In this case, 2 * 1600 is less than 1500 + 2000, so the code enters the if block.
The code adds the minimum of x and y multiplied by 2 * c to ans.
The code then subtracts the minimum of x and y from x and y.
The code then checks if x is not 0 and if 2 * c is less than or equal to a.
In this case, x is not 0 and 2 * 1600 is less than 1500, so the code enters the if block.
The code adds 2 * c multiplied by x to ans.
The code then checks if y is not 0 and if 2 * c is less than or equal to b.
In this case, y is not 0 and 2 * 1600 is less than 2000, so the code enters the else block.
The code adds b multiplied by y to ans.
The code then prints the value of ans.
<<<Output>>>
