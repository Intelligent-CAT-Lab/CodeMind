<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs from the user, N and M.
The variable N is initialized to 2, and the variable M is initialized to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates M times, which is 0 times in this case.
The code then initializes an empty list a and sets num to N - M, which is 2 - 0 = 2.
The code then enters a while loop that iterates while num is greater than 0.
The loop increments ans by 1 and decrements num by 1.
The loop will run once, and the value of ans will be 1.
The code then prints the value of ans - 1, which is 0.
<<<Output>>>
