<<<Analysis>>>
The code first prompts the user to input a number n.
The variable sum is initialized to 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to n.
For each number i in this range, it multiplies the current value of sum by i.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum.
<<<Output>>>
120
