<<<Analysis>>>
The code imports the sys module and uses it to read input from stdin.
The variable N is initialized to the first line of input, which is 2 in this case.
The variable res is initialized to an empty string.
The code enters a loop that iterates while N is greater than 0.
For each iteration, it subtracts 1 from N and adds the corresponding letter of the alphabet (a, b, c, etc.) to the end of res.
The code uses the modulo operator (%) to determine the remainder when N is divided by 26.
The code uses the ord() function to convert the letter to its ASCII code and the chr() function to convert the ASCII code back to a letter.
The code uses the // operator to divide N by 26 and assign the result back to N.
The loop continues until N is 0, at which point the code prints the final value of res in reverse order.
