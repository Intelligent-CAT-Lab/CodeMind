  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input string S and calculates its length N.
It then initializes a 2D array dp with dimensions (N+1)x13, where each element is initialized to 0.
The code then sets the value of dp[0][0] to 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider strings of length 1 to N.
For each string i in this range, it checks if the last character is '?'. If it is, it iterates over the possible values of the last character (0 to 9) and calculates the number of strings of length i-1 that end with each of these values.
If the last character is not '?', it calculates the number of strings of length i-1 that end with the current character.
The code then updates the value of p, which is used to calculate the number of strings of length i-1 that end with the current character.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of dp[N][5], which is the number of strings of length N that end with the digit 5.
