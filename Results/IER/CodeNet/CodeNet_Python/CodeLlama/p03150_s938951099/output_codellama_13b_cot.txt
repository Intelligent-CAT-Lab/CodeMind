<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input string S from the user.
It then calculates the length of the string using the len() function.
The code then enters a nested loop that iterates over the characters of the string.
The outer loop iterates over the indices of the string, starting from 0 and ending at the length of the string minus 1.
The inner loop iterates over the remaining characters of the string, starting from the current index and ending at the length of the string minus 1.
The code checks if the substring formed by concatenating the characters before the current index with the characters after the current index is equal to "keyence".
If it is, the code prints "YES" and exits the program.
If the inner loop completes without finding a match, the code prints "NO" and exits the program.
<<<Output>>>
YES
