<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user in the form of a list of two numbers, separated by a space.
The first number is stored in variable N, and the second number is stored in variable K.
The code then checks if N/2 is greater than or equal to K.
Since N/2 is 1.5, and K is 1, the condition is not met, and the code prints "NO".
<<<Output>>>
NO
