  The output of the code is:

A) Hello, Alice!

Explanation:
The function greet() takes a string as an argument and returns a string with the greeting message. In this case, the argument is "Alice", so the function returns "Hello, Alice!". The print() function is then called with the return value of the greet() function as its argument, which prints the string "Hello, Alice!" to the console. Therefore, the output of the code is "Hello, Alice!".
