<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input from the user and stores it in the variable N.
The variable N is then converted to a list of characters using the list() function.
The code then extracts the first, second, third, and fourth elements of the list and stores them in variables a, b, c, and d, respectively.
The code then checks if any of the following conditions are met:
* a == b == c
* b == c == d
If any of these conditions are met, the code prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
