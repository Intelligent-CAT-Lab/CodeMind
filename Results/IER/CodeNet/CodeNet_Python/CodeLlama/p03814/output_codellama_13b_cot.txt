<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input string "QWERTYASDFZXCV" and stores it in the variable s.
The code then initializes two variables, a_index and z_index, to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the characters in the string s.
For each character, the code checks if it is equal to 'A'. If it is, it sets the value of a_index to the current index and breaks out of the loop.
The code then enters another loop that iterates over the characters in the string s in reverse order.
For each character, the code checks if it is equal to 'Z'. If it is, it sets the value of z_index to the current index and breaks out of the loop.
The code then prints the value of z_index - a_index + 1, which is the number of characters between the first occurrence of 'A' and the first occurrence of 'Z' in the string.
