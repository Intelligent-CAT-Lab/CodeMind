<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in three integers a, b, and c as input, separated by spaces.
The variables a, b, and c are initialized to 2, 4, and 6, respectively.
The code then calculates the difference between b and a, which is 2.
The code then calculates the difference between c and b, which is 2.
The code then checks if the difference between b and a is equal to the difference between c and b.
Since 2 is equal to 2, the code prints "YES".
<<<Output>>>
YES
