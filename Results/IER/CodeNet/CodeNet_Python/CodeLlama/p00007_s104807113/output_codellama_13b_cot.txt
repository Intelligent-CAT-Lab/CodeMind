  <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 5, which is the input given to the program.
The variable _debt is initialized to 100000, which is the initial debt.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n (exclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 4.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the interest on the debt using the formula _debt*0.05*0.001 and rounds it up to the nearest integer using math.ceil. It then multiplies the result by 1000 to convert it to an integer. Finally, it adds the result to _debt.
The loop finishes and the code prints the final value of _debt, which is 100000 + 5000 + 2500 + 1250 + 625 = 177500.
<<<Output>>>
177500
