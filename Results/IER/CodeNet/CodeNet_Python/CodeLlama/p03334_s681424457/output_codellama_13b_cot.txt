  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first reads the input and assigns it to the variables N, D1, and D2.
The code then calculates the values of p1 and p2 using the deg function, which calculates the degree of a number.
The code then defines a function called group that takes three arguments: x, y, and p.
The function checks if p is even or odd and returns the result accordingly.
The code then defines a list called pts that contains all the points that satisfy the condition that group(x, y, p1) == 0 and group(x, y, p2) == 0.
The code then iterates over the first N**2 points in the pts list and prints them.
