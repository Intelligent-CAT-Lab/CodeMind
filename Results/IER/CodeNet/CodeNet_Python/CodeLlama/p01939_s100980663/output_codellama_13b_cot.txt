  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes in two inputs, n and m, and initializes two variables, mod1 and mod2, to 10^9+7 and 998244353, respectively.
The code then sets mod to mod1.
The code then calculates (m+1)%mod and stores it in ans.
The code then checks if n is not equal to 1. If it is not, the code calculates a as m//(n-1) and stores it in a.
The code then calculates ((m+1)*(a+1)+(m+1)*a-(n-1)*a*(a+1))%mod and stores it in ans.
The code then prints ans.
