  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes in two inputs, nn and k, and then initializes n to be 2*nn and k to be k.
The code then takes in k pairs of integers, a and b, and stores them in a list called abli.
The code then calculates the modular inverse of 10^9+7 and stores it in cut.
The code then initializes a list called unused, which is a list of 0s and 1s, where 0 indicates that the number is not used and 1 indicates that the number is used.
The code then iterates through the list abli and sets the corresponding indices in unused to 0.
The code then calculates the accumulated sum of unused and stores it in unusedacum.
The code then defines two functions, modInverse and doubleFactorial.
The code then defines a function called isSandwiched, which checks if a number is sandwiched between two other numbers.
The code then defines a function called numberUnderterminedBetween, which calculates the number of undetermined numbers between two numbers.
The code then defines a function called pairCombinations, which calculates the number of pairs of numbers between two numbers.
The code then defines a function called g, which calculates the number of pairs of numbers between two numbers that are not sandwiched.
The code then calculates the number of undetermined numbers between 1 and n and stores it in undetermined.
The code then initializes a list called ggg, which is a list of lists, where each sublist contains the number of pairs of numbers between two numbers that are not sandwiched.
The code then initializes a list called nonSandwichedNums, which is a list of lists, where each sublist contains the numbers that are not sandwiched between two numbers.
The code then initializes a list called dp, which is a list of lists, where each sublist contains the number of pairs of numbers between two numbers that are not sandwiched.
The code then initializes a variable called ans to 0.
The code then iterates through the list nonSandwichedNums and calculates the number of pairs of numbers between two numbers that are not sandwiched.
The code then calculates the number of pairs of numbers between two numbers that are not sandwiched and stores it in dp.
The code then calculates the number of pairs of numbers between two numbers that are not sandwiched and stores it in ans.
The code then prints the value of ans.
