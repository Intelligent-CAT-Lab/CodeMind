<<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the math module, which provides functions for mathematical operations.
The code then reads two integers from the input, separated by a space, and assigns them to variables a and b, respectively.
The code then calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of a and b using the math.gcd() function.
The code then adds a+b to the gcd, and subtracts 1 from the result.
The code finally prints the result.
