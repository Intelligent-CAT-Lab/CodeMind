<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 5700, which is the input given to the code.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of the numbers.
The variable l is a list of numbers [10000, 5000, 1000, 500].
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 3 (inclusive), meaning it will consider the first 4 elements of the list l.
For each element i in this range, it calculates the quotient of n by the corresponding element of l, and stores the result in ans.
The code then calculates the remainder of n by the corresponding element of l, and stores the result in n.
The loop repeats until the end of the list is reached.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 5700.
<<<Output>>>
5700
