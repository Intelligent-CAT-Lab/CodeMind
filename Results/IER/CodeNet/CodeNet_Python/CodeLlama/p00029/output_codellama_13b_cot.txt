<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input as a string and splits it into a list of words using the split() method.
The list is then passed to the max() function with two arguments:
1. The key argument is set to a.count, which means that the maximum value will be determined based on the frequency of each word in the list.
2. The second argument is set to len, which means that the maximum value will be determined based on the length of each word in the list.

The output of the code will be the word that appears the most frequently in the list, followed by the word that has the longest length.

<<<Output>>>
