  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first checks if the module is being run directly (i.e., not being imported by another module). If it is, it reads three integers N, M, and K from the input and stores them in variables with the same name.
The code then enters a nested loop that iterates over all possible values of x and y, where x and y are integers between 0 and N and M, respectively.
For each pair of x and y, the code calculates the value of res = x * M + y * N - x * y * 2.
The code then checks if res is equal to K. If it is, the code prints "Yes" and exits the program.
If the loop completes without finding a match, the code prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
