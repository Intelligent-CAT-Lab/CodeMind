  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input k from the user.
The code then checks if k is equal to 1. If it is, the code prints 1 twice and exits.
If k is not equal to 1, the code calculates n as (k + 3) // 4 * 2.
The code then calculates l as 2 * n - k.
The code then prints n.
The code then enters a nested loop that iterates over the range of n.
The inner loop iterates over the range of n.
The code checks if j is even or if (i + j) % n is greater than or equal to n - l.
If either of these conditions is true, the code prints (i + j) % n + 1.
If both conditions are false, the code prints n + (i + j) % n + 1.
The code then prints a newline character.
