  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports several modules from the Python standard library, including sys, re, os, collections, math, itertools, operator, copy, string, and fractions.
It then defines several functions for input, including STR, INT, MAP, S_MAP, LIST, S_LIST, and input.
The input function reads a line from standard input and strips any trailing whitespace.
The STR, INT, MAP, S_MAP, LIST, and S_LIST functions are wrappers around the input function that convert the input to the specified type.
The code then sets the recursion limit to 10^9 and defines a few constants, including inf, mod, and pi.

The code then defines a variable s, which is set to the output of the STR function.
If the length of s is less than 26, the code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 25.
For each iteration, the code checks if the current character is in s.
If it is not, the code prints s followed by the current character and exits.
If the length of s is greater than or equal to 26, the code enters a loop that iterates from 25 to 0.
For each iteration, the code checks if the current character is in s.
If it is not, the code prints s up to the current index followed by the current character and exits.
If the loop completes without finding a character that is not in s, the code prints -1 and exits.
