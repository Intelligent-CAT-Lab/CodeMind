  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module and defines a function called good that takes a string as input and returns a list of booleans indicating whether each character in the string is a good character or not.
The function good works by first initializing a list z of zeros with the same length as the input string. It then iterates through the string and checks if each character is a good character by comparing it to the previous character. If the current character is a good character, it updates the value of z[i] to be the length of the current character.
The function good also checks if the current character is a good character by checking if it is a multiple of the current index. If it is, it sets the value of g[k*p-1] to False, where k is the current index and p is the length of the current character.
The code then defines a variable per and initializes it to -1. It then defines a variable w and initializes it to the input string. It then defines a variable n and initializes it to the length of the input string.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n/2+1. For each iteration, it checks if n is divisible by the current iteration. If it is, it sets per to the current iteration and breaks out of the loop.
If per is still -1 after the loop, the code prints 1 and exits.
If per is 1, the code prints n and exits.
If per is greater than 1, the code calls the function good on the input string and stores the result in a variable called gl. It then reverses the input string and calls the function good on the reversed string and stores the result in a variable called gr.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n-2. For each iteration, it checks if the current character is a good character in both gl and gr. If it is, it increments a variable called cnt.
The code then prints 2 and the value of cnt.
