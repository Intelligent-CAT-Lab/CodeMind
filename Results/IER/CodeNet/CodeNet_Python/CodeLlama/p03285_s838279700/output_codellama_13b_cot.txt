<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 11, which is the input given to the code.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider values of k from 0 to 10.
For each value of k, the code enters another loop that iterates from 0 to n-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider values of j from 0 to 10.
For each pair of values (k, j), the code checks if 4k+7j is equal to n. If it is, the code increments the variable cnt by 1.
The code checks if n is less than 4 or if cnt is equal to 0. If either of these conditions is met, the code prints "No". Otherwise, it prints "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
