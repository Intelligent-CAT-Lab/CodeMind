  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the numba library and the numpy library.
The code then defines two functions: mod_pow and prepare.
The mod_pow function takes three arguments: x, a, and MOD. It calculates x^a mod MOD using the modular exponentiation algorithm.
The prepare function takes two arguments: n and MOD. It calculates the factorials and the inverse factorials of the numbers from 0 to n using the modular exponentiation algorithm.
The code then defines a solve function that takes two arguments: n and a. It calculates the number of ways to arrange n objects in a row such that a objects are in the first a positions and the remaining objects are in the remaining positions.
The code then reads the input from the user and calls the solve function with the input values.
<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will be the number of ways to arrange 3 objects in a row such that 1 object is in the first position and the remaining 2 objects are in the remaining positions.
The number of ways to arrange 3 objects in a row such that 1 object is in the first position and the remaining 2 objects are in the remaining positions is 3.
Therefore, the output of the code will be 3.
