  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first defines two functions: gcd and printV.
The gcd function calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers.
The printV function takes two numbers and prints their ratio in the form of a fraction.
The code then reads a string S from the input.
It then initializes four variables: all, sub, p, and o.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the characters in S.
For each character, it checks if it is a decimal point, an opening parenthesis, or a closing parenthesis.
If it is a decimal point, it sets the variable o to the index of the character.
If it is an opening parenthesis, it sets the variable p to the index of the character and sets the variable sub to the value of all.
If it is a closing parenthesis, it sets the variable d to the length of S minus the index of the character minus 2 (for the parentheses).
If it is not a decimal point, an opening parenthesis, or a closing parenthesis, it appends the character to the variable all.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if p is -1.
If it is, it calls the printV function with the values of all and 10**d (10 to the power of d).
If it is not, it sets the variable l to the length of S minus the index of the opening parenthesis minus 2 (for the parentheses).
It then calls the printV function with the values of all minus sub and 10**d minus 10**l.
