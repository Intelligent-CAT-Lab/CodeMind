  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input string S as input.
It then calculates the length of the string L.
The code then initializes the variable cur to 0, which will be used to keep track of the current position in the string.
The code then initializes the variable P to a list of 6 zeros.
The code then defines two functions, expr and term.
The expr function takes the current operator op as input and calculates the term using the term function.
The term function calculates the value of the term and updates the value of the variable cur.
The num function calculates the value of the number and updates the value of the variable cur.
The code then calls the expr function to calculate the expression.
The code then defines a function f that takes a list of coefficients P and a variable x as input and returns the value of the polynomial.
The code then calculates the degree of the polynomial using the variable d.
The code then initializes a list R to store the roots of the polynomial.
The code then iterates through the range of values from 2000 to -2001 and checks if the value of the polynomial at that point is equal to 0. If it is, the value is added to the list R.
The code then joins the list R using the "".join() method and prints the result.
