The code takes two inputs, m and d, from the user.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the number of numbers that meet the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 22 to d (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 22 to 40.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the last digit d0 and the first digit d1.
The code checks if d0 is either 1 or 0, and if it is, it skips to the next iteration.
If d0 is not 1 or 0, the code checks if m is greater than or equal to d0 multiplied by d1. If it is, it adds 1 to ans and prints the current number i.
The condition is met when i is 22, 32, 42, 52, 62, 72, 82, 92, 102, 112, 122, 132, 142, 152, 162, 172, 182, 192, 202, 212, 222, 232, 242, 252, 262, 272, 282, 292, 302, 312, 322, 332, 342, 352, 362, 372, 382, 392, 402.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 34.
