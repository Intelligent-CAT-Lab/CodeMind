  <<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called contains3 that takes an integer n as input and returns True if n contains the digit 3, False otherwise.
The code then prompts the user to input an integer x and stores it in the variable x.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to x (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 30.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the number n = i + 1 and checks if n is divisible by 3 or if it contains the digit 3. If either condition is met, it appends the current number n to the string out.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of out, which is a string containing the numbers 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30.
<<<Output>>>
3 6 9 12 15 18 21 24 27 30
