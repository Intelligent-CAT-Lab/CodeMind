<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in three strings as input, separated by spaces.
The variable A, B, and C are initialized to the first, second, and third strings, respectively.
The code checks if the last character of A is the same as the first character of B, and if the last character of B is the same as the first character of C.
If both conditions are met, the code prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'.

In this case, the last character of 'rng' is 'g', which is the same as the first character of 'gorilla'. The last character of 'gorilla' is 'a', which is the same as the first character of 'apple'. Therefore, the output of the code is 'YES'.
<<<Output>>>
YES
