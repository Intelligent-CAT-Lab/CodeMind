  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys and string modules.
The variable alpha is initialized to the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyza'.
The variable tbl is initialized to the result of calling the maketrans function on the string alpha, which creates a translation table that maps each letter in alpha to the next letter in the alphabet.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the lines of input from sys.stdin.
For each line s in this loop, the code checks if the string 'the' or 'this' or 'that' is in s. If it is not, it translates s using the translation table tbl and prints the result.
The code then repeats this process for each line of input until it reaches the end of the input.
<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will be the input string with all occurrences of 'the' and 'this' and 'that' replaced with the next letter in the alphabet.
