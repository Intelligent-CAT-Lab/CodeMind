  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input as a string and converts it into a list of integers using the map() function.
The length of the list is stored in the variable n.
The code then initializes a 2D list dp with two rows and n+1 columns. The first row is initialized to [0,1], and the second row is initialized to [0,1].
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n-1.
For each iteration, the code calculates the minimum of two expressions and stores the result in dp[i+1][0].
The first expression is the minimum of dp[i][0] + x[i] and dp[i][1] + 10 - x[i].
The second expression is the minimum of dp[i][0] + x[i] + 1 and dp[i][1] + 9 - x[i].
The code then calculates the minimum of the two expressions and stores the result in dp[i+1][1].
The code then prints the value of dp[n][0].
<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will be 36.
