<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user in the form of two space-separated integers.
The first integer is stored in variable a, and the second integer is stored in variable b.
The code then calculates the sum of b and b, which is stored in variable c.
The code then checks if a-c is not equal to 0 and if a-c is greater than or equal to 0.
If both conditions are true, the code prints a-c. Otherwise, it prints 0.
<<<Output>>>
0
