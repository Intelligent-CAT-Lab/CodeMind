  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module and defines a function MI() that returns a map object containing the integers in the input string.
The code then reads the input from stdin and assigns the first two values to the variables N and K.
The code then checks if K is greater than the maximum possible value of K, which is ((N-1)*(N-2))//2. If it is, the code prints -1 and exits.
The code then prints the value of N-1+((N-1)*(N-2))//2-K, which is 3 in this case.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to N+1 and prints 1 and the current value of i.
The code then enters another loop that iterates from 2 to N and prints the current values of i and j.
The code then exits.
