  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in three integers a, b, and x as input.
The variable c is initialized to 0.
The code enters a while loop that iterates while x is greater than 0.
The loop checks if x is greater than 500. If it is, it adds the value of a to c if a is less than 2*b, otherwise it adds 2*b to c.
The loop then subtracts 1000 from x.
If x is less than or equal to 500, the loop adds the value of b to c if b is less than a, otherwise it adds a to c.
The loop then subtracts 500 from x.
The loop continues until x is less than or equal to 0.
The code then prints the final value of c.

<<<Output>>>
The output of the code would be 2400.
