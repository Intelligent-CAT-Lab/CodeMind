  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first defines a function called prime_factorization that takes an integer x as input and returns a dictionary of prime factors and their powers.
The function first divides x by 2 as much as possible and stores the result in cnt.
Then it iterates from 3 to the square root of x, incrementing by 2, and divides x by each number i as much as possible.
If x is not divisible by i, it moves on to the next number.
If x is divisible by i, it stores the prime factor i and its power in the dictionary ret.
If x is greater than 2, it is a prime number and is stored as a prime factor with power 1.
The function returns the dictionary ret.

The code then defines a function called main that takes no arguments.
It first prompts the user to input a number N and stores it in a variable called N.
It then calls the prime_factorization function with N as the argument and stores the result in a variable called facts.
It then constructs a string called ans that contains the number N followed by a colon and a space.
It then iterates over the keys and values in the dictionary facts and appends the prime factor and its power to the string ans.
Finally, it prints the string ans.

The code then checks if the module is being run directly (i.e., not being imported as a module) and, if so, calls the main function.
