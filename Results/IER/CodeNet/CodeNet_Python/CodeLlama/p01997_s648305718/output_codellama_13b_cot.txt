<<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the math module, which provides mathematical functions.
The code then reads two integers from the input, which are stored in variables a and b, respectively.
The code then checks if a is greater than b, and if it is, it prints the result of the expression 2/3*math.pi*a**2*b.
If a is not greater than b, the code prints the result of the expression 4/3*math.pi*b**3.
