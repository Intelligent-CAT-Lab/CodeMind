  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input n and converts it to a binary string nstr.
The code then initializes two dictionaries f and g with a single key-value pair.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to the length of nstr (inclusive).
For each iteration, the code checks the last digit of nstr and updates the values of f and g accordingly.
The code then prints the final value of f[len(nstr)], which is the output of the code.
