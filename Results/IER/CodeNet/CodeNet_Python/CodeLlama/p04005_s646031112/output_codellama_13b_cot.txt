<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input, A, B, and C, and splits them into individual variables.
The code then checks if all three variables are odd numbers by checking if their modulo with 2 is equal to 1.
If all three variables are odd, the code calculates the minimum of the products of any two of the variables (A * B, B * C, or C * A) and prints the result.
If any of the variables is even, the code prints 0.

In this case, the input is 3 3 3, which means A = 3, B = 3, and C = 3.
Since all three variables are odd, the code calculates the minimum of A * B = 9, B * C = 9, and C * A = 9, which is 9.
The code then prints 9.
<<<Output>>>
9
