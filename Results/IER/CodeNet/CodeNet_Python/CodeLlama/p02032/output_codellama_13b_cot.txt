  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module and sets the recursion limit to 10001.
It then defines a function called input() that reads a line from standard input and strips any whitespace from the end.
The resolve() function is defined, which takes no arguments.
The function first reads an integer n from standard input using the input() function.
It then imports the math module and defines two functions: make_prime_list_2() and prime_factorization_2().
The make_prime_list_2() function takes a single integer argument num and returns a list of all prime numbers less than or equal to num.
The prime_factorization_2() function takes a single integer argument num and returns a dictionary where each key is a prime factor of num and each value is the power of that prime factor.
The function then calls prime_factorization_2() with the argument n and stores the result in a variable d.
It then calculates the value of val by multiplying the values of each key in d and subtracting 1.
Finally, it prints the length of d and val-1.
<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will be 3 17, which is the length of the list of prime factors of 18 and the value of val-1.
