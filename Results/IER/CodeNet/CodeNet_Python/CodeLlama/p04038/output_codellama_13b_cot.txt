The code first imports the sys module and the numpy module.
It then defines a function called cumprod, which takes an array A and calculates the cumulative product of its elements.
The function also takes an optional argument MOD, which is set to 10^9 + 7 by default.
The code then defines a function called make_fact, which takes an integer U and calculates the factorial of U and its inverse.
The function also takes an optional argument MOD, which is set to 10^9 + 7 by default.
The code then defines a function called dp, which takes an integer n and calculates the number of ways to arrange n objects in a row, with each object being either a 0 or a 1.
The function also takes an optional argument MOD, which is set to 10^9 + 7 by default.
The code then defines a function called answer, which takes an integer n and calculates the number of ways to arrange n objects in a row, with each object being either a 0 or a 1, and with the first object being a 1.
The function also takes an optional argument MOD, which is set to 10^9 + 7 by default.
The code then defines a function called main, which takes two integers N and K as input and calculates the number of ways to arrange N objects in a row, with each object being either a 0 or a 1, and with the first object being a 1, and with each object being either a 0 or a 1, and with the first object being a 1, and with each object being either a 0 or a 1, and with the first object being a 1,
