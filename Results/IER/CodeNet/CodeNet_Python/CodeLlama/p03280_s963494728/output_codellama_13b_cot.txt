<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, separated by a space.
The first integer is assigned to variable A, and the second integer is assigned to variable B.
The code then prints the product of A and B, minus 1.

In this case, the input is 2 2, so A = 2 and B = 2.
The output of the code is (2-1)*(2-1) = 1*1 = 1.
