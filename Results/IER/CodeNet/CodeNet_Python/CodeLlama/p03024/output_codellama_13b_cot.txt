<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user and stores it in the variable x.
The variable a is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of 'x' characters in the input.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each character in the input string x.
For each character i in the input, it checks if i is equal to 'x'. If it is, it increments the variable a by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of a.
<<<Output>>>
YES
