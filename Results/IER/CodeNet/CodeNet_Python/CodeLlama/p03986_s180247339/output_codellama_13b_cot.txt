  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the deque data structure from the collections module.
The variable x is initialized to the input string "TSTTSS".
The variable n is initialized to the length of the input string, which is 7.
The variable st is initialized to an empty deque.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the characters of the input string.
For each character, it checks if it is "S". If it is, it appends "S" to the deque.
If it is not "S", it checks if the deque is empty. If it is, it appends "T" to the deque.
If the deque is not empty, it pops the last element from the deque and checks if it is "T".
If it is, it appends "T" to the deque twice.
If it is not "T", it continues to the next iteration of the loop.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the length of the deque.
