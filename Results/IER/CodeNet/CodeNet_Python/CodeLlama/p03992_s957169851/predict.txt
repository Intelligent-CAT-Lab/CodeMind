 
The output of the code is:

Hello, John!

The function greet takes a string argument called name and prints a greeting message using the f-string syntax. The f-string syntax allows you to include variables in a string by using the {variable_name} syntax. In this case, the variable name is "name", which is passed as an argument to the function. The .title() method is used to capitalize the first letter of the name. The greet function is then called with the argument "john", which is passed to the name parameter. The output of the function is "Hello, John!".
