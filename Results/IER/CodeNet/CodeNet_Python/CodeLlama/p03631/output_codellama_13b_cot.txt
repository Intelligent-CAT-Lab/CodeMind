<<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the necessary modules, including math, itertools, deque, Counter, and bisect.
The input is read from the standard input and stored in the variable n.
The code then calculates the integer quotient and remainder of n divided by 100, and stores them in variables i and j, respectively.
The code then checks if i is equal to j, and prints "Yes" if it is, and "No" otherwise.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
