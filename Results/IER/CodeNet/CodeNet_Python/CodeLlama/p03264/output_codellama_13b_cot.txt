<<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the math module, which provides mathematical functions.
The variable k is initialized to the integer value of the input, which is 3 in this case.
The code then calculates the ceiling of k/2, which is 2, and multiplies it by k//2, which is 1.
The final result is 2*1=2.
<<<Output>>>
