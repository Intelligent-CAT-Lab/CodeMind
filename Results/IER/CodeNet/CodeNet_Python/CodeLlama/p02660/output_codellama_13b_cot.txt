  <<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function prime_factorize(n) that takes an integer n as input and returns a list of its prime factors.
The function first checks if n is divisible by 2 and appends 2 to the list a if it is. It then sets f to 3 and enters a loop that iterates until f * f is greater than n.
Inside the loop, the code checks if n is divisible by f and appends f to the list a if it is. It then increments f by 2 and repeats the check.
If n is not divisible by any prime factor less than or equal to its square root, the code appends n to the list a.
The function then returns the list a.
The code then defines a variable n and sets it to the integer input by the user.
It then calls the prime_factorize function with n as an argument and stores the result in a variable res.
The code then checks the length of res and prints 1 if it is 1, otherwise it initializes a few variables and enters a loop that iterates over the elements of res.
Inside the loop, the code checks if the current element is equal to the previous element and increments a counter p if it is.
It then checks if p is not in the set l and adds it to the set if it is not.
It then clears the set l and sets p to 0 if the current element is not equal to the previous element.
It then increments the counter cnt and sets c to the current element.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the value of cnt.
