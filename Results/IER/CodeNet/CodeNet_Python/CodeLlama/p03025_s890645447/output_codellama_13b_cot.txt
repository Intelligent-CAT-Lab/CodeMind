  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first initializes the variables N, A, B, and C to 1, 25, 25, and 50, respectively.
It then initializes the MOD variable to 10^9 + 7.
The code then creates an instance of the Comb class with the arguments 2*N and MOD.
The Comb class is used to calculate the binomial coefficient (n choose k) for the given values of n and k.
The code then creates an instance of the Inv class with the argument MOD.
The Inv class is used to calculate the modular multiplicative inverse of a number.
The code then calls the invL method of the Inv class with the arguments A + B and 2*N.
The invL method calculates the modular multiplicative inverse of a number and returns a list of the multiplicative inverses of the first n numbers.
The code then calls the invx method of the Inv class with the argument 100 - C.
The invx method calculates the modular multiplicative inverse of a number and returns the result.
The code then initializes two lists, PA and PB, with the values 1 and 1, respectively.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N.
For each iteration, the code calculates the values of PA[i] and PB[i] using the modular multiplicative inverses of A and B.
The code then calculates the values of ans using the formula (N + i) * IC * 100 * PA[N] * PB[i] * IL[N + i] * com.com(N + i - 1, i) % MOD.
The code then adds the value of ans to the previous value of ans.
The code then prints the final value of ans % MOD.
