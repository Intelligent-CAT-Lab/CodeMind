  The output of the code is:

A) Hello, Alice!
Hello, Bob!

Explanation:
The code defines a function called `greet` that takes a single argument `name` and prints a greeting message using the `print` function. The function is then called twice with the arguments "Alice" and "Bob". The output of the function is "Hello, [name]!", where [name] is replaced with the value of the `name` argument. Therefore, the output of the code is "Hello, Alice!" followed by "Hello, Bob!".

Therefore, the correct answer is option A.
