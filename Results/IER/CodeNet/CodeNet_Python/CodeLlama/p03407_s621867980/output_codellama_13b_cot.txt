<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in three integers A, B, and C as input, separated by spaces.
The variables A, B, and C are initialized to 50, 100, and 120, respectively.
The code then calculates the sum of A and B (50+100=150) and checks if it is greater than or equal to C (150>=120).
Since the condition is met, the code prints "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
