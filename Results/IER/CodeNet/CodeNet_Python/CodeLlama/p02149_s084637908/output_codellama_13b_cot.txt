  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first reads in three integers from standard input using the LI() function.
The first integer is stored in the variable a, the second integer is stored in the variable b, and the third integer is stored in the variable c.
The code then prints the character at the index of the maximum value of the three integers in the string "ABC".
The maximum value of the three integers is 1000, which is the index of the character "C" in the string "ABC".
Therefore, the output of the code will be "C".
<<<Output>>>
C
