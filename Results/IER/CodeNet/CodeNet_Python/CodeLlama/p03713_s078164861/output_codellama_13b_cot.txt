  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports several modules from the Python standard library, including sys, re, collections, math, itertools, operator, copy, string, and bisect.
It then sets the recursion limit to 10^9 and defines some constants, including INF, MOD, and pi.
The code then reads in two integers, H and W, from standard input using the input() function.
It then defines a function called input() that returns the next line of input from standard input, and functions INT(), MAP(), and LIST() that return the next line of input as an integer, a list of integers, and a list of integers, respectively.
The code then defines a variable called ans and sets it to INF.
It then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to H+1, and for each value of h, it calculates three values: S1, S2, and S3.
It then calculates the minimum of the three values and updates the value of ans.
It then repeats the same process for the case where h is replaced by H-h.
Finally, it prints the value of ans.
<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will depend on the input given. If the input is 3 5, the output will be 10.
