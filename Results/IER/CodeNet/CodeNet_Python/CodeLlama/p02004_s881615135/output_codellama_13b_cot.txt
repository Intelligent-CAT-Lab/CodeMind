  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first reads a string from standard input and stores it in the variable s.
It then initializes the variables i, now, and ans to 0, 0, and 0, respectively.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the characters in the string s.
For each character, it checks if it is "R" or "L".
If it is "R", it increments the variable now by 1 and then increments the variable i by 1.
If it is "L", it decrements the variable now by 1 and then increments the variable i by 1.
The code then checks if the variable now is 0.
If it is, it enters another loop that iterates over the remaining characters in the string s.
For each character, it checks if it is "R".
If it is, it increments the variable now by 1.
If it is not, it decrements the variable now by 1.
The variable now is then modulo 4.
If the variable now is 0, the code increments the variable ans by 1.
The code then breaks out of the loop and continues the outer loop.
The code then prints the variable ans and returns.
