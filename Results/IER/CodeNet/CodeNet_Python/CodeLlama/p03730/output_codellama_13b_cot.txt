  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in three integers as input, a, b, and c.
The function foo is defined with three parameters, a, b, and c.
The function first initializes a set called seen to keep track of the numbers it has seen so far.
The function then calculates the remainder of a divided by b and assigns it to m.
The function then initializes i to m.
The function then enters a while loop that continues until i is in seen.
The function checks if i is equal to c. If it is, it prints "YES" and returns.
If i is not in seen, the function adds i to seen and sets i to (m + i) % b.
The function then repeats the while loop.
If the while loop exits without printing "YES", the function prints "NO".

The code then calls the function foo with the input parameters a, b, and c.

<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will be "YES" because the sequence of numbers generated by the function foo will eventually reach the value of c, which is 1 in this case.
