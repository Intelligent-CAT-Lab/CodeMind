  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes in the input W, H, and c as strings and converts them to integers using the int() function.
The code then enters a nested loop that iterates over the rows and columns of a grid with dimensions W and H.
The loop checks if the current position (i, j) is on the border of the grid, and if so, prints a '+' character.
If the current position is on the top or bottom row, but not on the border, the code prints a '-' character.
If the current position is on the left or right column, but not on the border, the code prints a '|' character.
If the current position is in the center of the grid, the code prints the character stored in the variable c.
If the current position is not on the border, top row, bottom row, left column, or right column, the code prints a '.' character.
After the loop finishes, the code prints a newline character.
