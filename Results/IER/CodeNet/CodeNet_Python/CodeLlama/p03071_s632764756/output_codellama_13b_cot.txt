The code defines a function called resolve that takes no arguments.
The function first maps the input to two variables a and b using the map function.
The function then prints the maximum of the following three expressions:
2*a-1, a+b, and 2*b-1.
The function then calls itself.
The input is 5 3.
The function maps the input to a=5 and b=3.
The function then prints the maximum of the following three expressions:
2*5-1=9, 5+3=8, and 2*3-1=5.
The maximum is 9.
<<<Output>>>
9
