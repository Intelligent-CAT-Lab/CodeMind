  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module and sets the recursion limit to 10^8.
It then defines several functions for reading input from the user, including ini, inm, inl, and ins.
The code then reads in two integers, n and x, from the user using the inm function.
The code then defines a function called solve, which is the main function of the program.
The solve function first checks if x is equal to 1 or 2n-1, and if so, it prints "No" and returns.
If x is not equal to 1 or 2n-1, the code creates a list called a, which will be used to store the solution.
The code then sets the middle element of a to x, and the elements to the left and right of the middle element to x-1 and x+1, respectively.
The code then sets y to 1 and iterates through the list a, starting at the second element.
For each element i in a, the code checks if i is equal to x-1, x, or x+1, and if so, it skips that element.
If the element is not equal to x-1, x, or x+1, the code sets the element to y, and then increments y by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints "Yes" and then prints the elements of a, separated by newlines.
