<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, separated by a space.
The first integer is assigned to variable n, and the second integer is assigned to variable m.
The code then prints the product of n and m, minus 1.

In this case, the input is 3 and 4, so the output would be (3 - 1) * (4 - 1) = 6.
<<<Output>>>
6
