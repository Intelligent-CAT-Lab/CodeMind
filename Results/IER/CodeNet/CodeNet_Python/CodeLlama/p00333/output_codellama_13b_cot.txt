<<<Analysis>>>
The code imports the gcd function from the math module.
The variables W, H, and C are initialized to 10, 20, and 5, respectively.
The code calculates the greatest common divisor of W and H using the gcd function.
The code then prints the result of the expression W*H*C//(g*g), where g is the greatest common divisor.
<<<Output>>>
