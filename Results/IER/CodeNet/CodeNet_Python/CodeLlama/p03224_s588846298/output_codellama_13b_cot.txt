  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input N from the user.
The variable Nlist is initialized to a list of numbers of the form k*(k-1)//2, where k ranges from 1 to 1000.
The code checks if N is in Nlist. If it is not, it prints 'No' and exits.
If N is in Nlist, the code prints 'Yes' and calculates the value of k, which is the index of N in Nlist.
The variable S is initialized to a list of lists, where each sublist has k-1 elements.
The code then populates S with the values of the Pascal's triangle, where each element is the sum of the two elements above it.
Finally, the code prints the value of k and the values of S, with each sublist separated by a space.
