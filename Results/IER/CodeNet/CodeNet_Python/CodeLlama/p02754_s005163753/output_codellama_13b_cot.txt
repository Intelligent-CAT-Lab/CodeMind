<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in three inputs: n, a, and b.
n is set to 8, a is set to 3, and b is set to 4.
The code checks if n is divisible by a + b.
n is not divisible by a + b, so the code enters the else block.
The code prints (n // (a + b)) * a + a, which is (8 // 7) * 3 + 3, which is 3 + 3, which is 6.
<<<Output>>>
6
