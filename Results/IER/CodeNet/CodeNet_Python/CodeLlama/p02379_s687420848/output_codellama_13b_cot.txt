<<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the math module, which provides mathematical functions such as square root.
The code then maps the input string to four variables x1, y1, x2, and y2, which are floats.
The code calculates the distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) using the Pythagorean theorem.
The code then prints the distance with six decimal places.
<<<Output>>>
