  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user in the form of two numbers separated by a space.
The first number is assigned to variable a and the second number is assigned to variable b.
The code then creates a list j containing the numbers from 2 to 13.
The code then checks if the index of a in the list j is greater than the index of b in the list j.
If it is, the code prints "Alice".
If the index of a in the list j is less than the index of b in the list j, the code prints "Bob".
If the index of a in the list j is equal to the index of b in the list j, the code prints "Draw".
<<<Output>>>
Bob
