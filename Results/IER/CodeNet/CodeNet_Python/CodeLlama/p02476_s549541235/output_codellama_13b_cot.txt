<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, separated by a space.
The first integer is assigned to variable a, and the second integer is assigned to variable b.
The code then prints the remainder of dividing a by b.

In this case, the input is 5 and 8, so the output will be 5 % 8 = 5.
<<<Output>>>
5
