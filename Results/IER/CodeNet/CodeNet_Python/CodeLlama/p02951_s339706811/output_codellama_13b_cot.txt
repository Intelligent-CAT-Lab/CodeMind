<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user in the form of a string, splits it into a list of integers using the map() function, and then assigns the first three elements of the list to the variables A, B, and C, respectively.
The code then calculates the difference between A and B and subtracts it from C, storing the result in the variable ans.
The code then checks if ans is greater than or equal to 0, and if it is, it prints the value of ans. If it is not, it prints 0.
