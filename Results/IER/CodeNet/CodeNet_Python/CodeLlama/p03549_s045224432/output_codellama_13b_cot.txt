<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs N and M from the user.
The first line of the code is a tuple assignment, where N and M are assigned to the first and second elements of the tuple returned by the map function, which splits the input string on whitespace and converts each element to an integer.
The second line of the code is a print statement that prints the result of the expression ((N-M)*100+M*1900)*2**M.
<<<Output>>>
1900
