  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first sets the recursion limit to 10^6.
It then defines several functions:
* int1: takes an integer x and returns x-1.
* p2D: takes a list of integers x and prints them on separate lines.
* II: reads a line from stdin and returns its integer value.
* MI: reads a line from stdin, splits it into integers, and returns a map object.
* LI: reads a line from stdin, splits it into integers, and returns a list.
* LLI: reads a line from stdin, splits it into integers, and returns a list of lists.
* SI: reads a line from stdin and returns it as a string.

The main function first reads an integer n from stdin and initializes a list of lists ans to n rows and n columns, with each element initialized to 0.
It then defines a list base with the values 1, 2, 4, 7, 12, 20, 29, 38, 52, 73.

The main function then enters a loop that iterates from 3 to n+1, meaning it will consider numbers from 3 to n.
For each number vn in this range, it calculates the maximum value of the sum of the elements in the ans list that are in the same row or column as vn.
It then sets the value of ans[vn-1][0] and ans[0][vn-1] to base[vn-2] * (mx + 1), where mx is the maximum value calculated in the previous step.
It then sets the value of ans[vn-1][vn-2] and ans[vn-2][vn-1] to base[vn-3] * (mx + 1).
Finally, it sets the value of ans[vn-1][j] and ans[j][vn-1] to base[j-1] * (mx + 1) for each j in the range 1 to vn-2.

After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is a list of lists.
