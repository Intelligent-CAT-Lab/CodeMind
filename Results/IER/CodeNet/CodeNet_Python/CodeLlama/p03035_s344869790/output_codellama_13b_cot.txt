<<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the math module, which provides mathematical functions.
The code then reads two integers A and B from the input, separated by a space.
The code then checks if A is less than or equal to 5, and if it is, it prints 0.
If A is greater than 5 and less than or equal to 12, the code calculates the floor of B divided by 2 and prints the result.
If A is greater than 12, the code simply prints B.

In this case, the input is 30 and 100, so the code will print 100.
<<<Output>>>
100
