<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input from the user and stores it in a variable called code.
The code then replaces all commas and periods in the input with empty strings.
The code then splits the input into a list of words.
The code then initializes an empty list called list.
The code then iterates over the list of words and checks if each word is at least 3 characters long and at most 6 characters long. If it is, it appends the word to the list.
The code then iterates over the list of words and prints each word followed by a space.
<<<Output>>>
Rain rain go to Spain
