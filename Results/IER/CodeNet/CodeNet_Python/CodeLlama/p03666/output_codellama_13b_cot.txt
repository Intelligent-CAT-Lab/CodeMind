  <<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function inpl() that takes no arguments and returns a list of integers obtained by splitting the input on whitespace.
The function is then called to assign the values of N, A, B, C, and D to the variables with the same names.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to N+1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 6.
For each number k in this range, it calculates the value of j as N-1-k.
The code checks if the expression D*k - C*j is greater than or equal to B-A, and if C*k - D*j is greater than or equal to B-A. If both conditions are met, it prints 'YES' and breaks out of the loop.
If the loop completes without printing 'YES', it prints 'NO'.
<<<Output>>>
YES
