<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes the input as a string, splits it into a list of integers using the split() method, maps each element of the list to an integer using the map() method, and then sorts the list in reverse order using the reversed() method.
The code then iterates over the sorted list and prints each element followed by a comma.
The output of the code will be the sorted list of integers in reverse order, separated by commas.
<<<Output>>>
9, 7, 6, 5, 3
