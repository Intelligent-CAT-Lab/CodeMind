  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the math module and defines the variables g, ESP, and V.
The function calc calculates the velocity of an object at a given time t.
The function cmp compares two numbers and returns -1 if the first number is less than the second, 1 if the first number is greater than the second, and 0 if the two numbers are equal.
The function check checks if a given point (qx, qy) is within the range of a given rectangle (L, B, R, T).
The main function first takes in the input N, V, X, and Y.
It then takes in N sets of input for the rectangles (L, B, R, T).
It then calls the check function for each rectangle to check if the point (X, Y) is within the rectangle.
If any of the check functions return True, the main function prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
