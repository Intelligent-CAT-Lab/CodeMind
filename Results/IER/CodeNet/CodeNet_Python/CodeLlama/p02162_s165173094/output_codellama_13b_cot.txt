  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes in four integers as input, and then defines three functions: A_win, B_win, and Draw.
The code then checks if either c or d is equal to -1, and if so, it checks if a is less than b, greater than b, or equal to b. If a is less than b, it prints "Alice", if a is greater than b, it prints "Bob", and if a is equal to b, it prints "Draw".
If neither c nor d is equal to -1, the code checks if c is greater than d, and if so, it prints "Alice", if c is less than d, it prints "Bob", and if c is equal to d, it prints "Draw".

<<<Output>>>
Bob
