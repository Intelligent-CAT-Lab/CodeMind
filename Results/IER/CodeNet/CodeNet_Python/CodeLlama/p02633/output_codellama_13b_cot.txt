<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input x from the user.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 100,000 (inclusive).
For each number i in this range, it checks if 360 * i is divisible by x.
If it is, the code prints the result of dividing 360 * i by x and breaks out of the loop.
The code will only print the result if it finds a number that satisfies the condition.
<<<Output>>>
360
