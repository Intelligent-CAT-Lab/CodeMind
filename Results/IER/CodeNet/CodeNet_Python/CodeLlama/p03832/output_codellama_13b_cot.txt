  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first initializes the variables N, A, B, C, D, MOD, fact, frev, dp, and Y.
N is set to 3, A is set to 1, B is set to 3, C is set to 1, D is set to 2, and MOD is set to 10^9 + 7.
The code then initializes the arrays fact, frev, and dp.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 3.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [1, 3] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 1,2 and 3.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 6.
<<<Output>>>
6
