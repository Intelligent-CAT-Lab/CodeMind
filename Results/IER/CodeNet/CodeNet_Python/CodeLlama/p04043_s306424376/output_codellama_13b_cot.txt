  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the itertools module, which provides various iterative tools.
The input is then split into a list of strings, which is stored in the variable a.
The code then uses the permutations function from the itertools module to generate all possible permutations of the string '575'.
The resulting permutations are stored in a list, which is then converted to a set to remove duplicates.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the elements of the set, and for each element, it calculates the sum of its digits and compares it to the input list a.
If the sum of the digits of an element is equal to the input list, the flag variable is set to 1.
Finally, the code prints 'YES' if the flag is 1, and 'NO' otherwise.
<<<Output>>>
YES
