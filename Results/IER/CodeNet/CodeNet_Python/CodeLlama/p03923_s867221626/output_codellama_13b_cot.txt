  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs, n and a, from the user.
The variable ans is initialized to 10^18, which is a large number.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 41 (inclusive).
For each iteration, the code calculates the value of k, which is the current iteration number.
The code then calculates the value of l and r, which are the left and right bounds of the current iteration.
The code then enters a while loop that iterates until l and r are equal.
The code calculates the value of m, which is the midpoint of l and r.
The code checks if m^k is greater than or equal to n. If it is, the code sets r to m. Otherwise, it sets l to m.
The code then enters another loop that iterates from k+2 to 41 (inclusive).
For each iteration, the code calculates the value of m, which is the current iteration number.
The code checks if (l^m)*(r^((k+1)-m)) is greater than or equal to n. If it is, the code updates the value of ans to be the minimum of the current value of ans and the current value of k*a+l*m+r*((k+1)-m).
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans.
