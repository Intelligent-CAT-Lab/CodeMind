The input string is "abca".
The code first initializes a HuffmanCoding object with the input string.
The HuffmanCoding object builds a Huffman tree using the input string.
The Huffman tree is a binary tree where each node represents a character in the input string.
The tree is built by creating a heap of nodes, where each node has a count of the number of times the character appears in the input string.
The tree is then built by repeatedly popping two nodes with the smallest counts from the heap and creating a new node with the sum of the counts of the two nodes.
The new node is then added to the heap.
The process is repeated until there is only one node left in the heap, which is the root node of the Huffman tree.
The Huffman tree is then traversed to generate an encoding table, where each character in the input string is mapped to a binary string.
The encoding table is generated by recursively traversing the Huffman tree, where each node is assigned a binary string based on the path from the root node to the node.
The binary string is generated by concatenating the binary strings of the left and right child nodes, if they exist.
The encoding table is then used to generate the encoded binary string for the input string.
The encoded binary string is generated by looking up the binary string for each character in the input string in the encoding table.
The encoded binary string is then printed.
