  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the math module, which is used to perform mathematical operations.
The code then defines a Vector class, which represents a vector in a two-dimensional space. The class has several methods, including __init__, which initializes the vector with the given coordinates, and print, which prints the vector. The class also defines several operators, including __add__, which adds two vectors, and __sub__, which subtracts two vectors.
The code then defines a koch function, which takes three arguments: d, a, and b. The function is recursive, and it uses the Koch curve algorithm to generate a fractal curve. The function first checks if the depth d is zero, and if it is, it returns. Otherwise, it calculates the midpoint s of the segment [a, b], and it calculates the midpoint u of the segment [s, b]. The function then recursively calls itself with the arguments d-1, a, s, and u, and it prints the resulting vectors.
The code then takes an integer input N from the user, and it initializes two vectors, a and b, with the coordinates (0, 0) and (100, 0), respectively. The code then calls the koch function with the arguments N, a, and b, and it prints the resulting vectors.
