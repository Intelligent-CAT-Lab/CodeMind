  <<<Analysis>>>
The variable p is initialized to 5700, which is the input given.
The code then checks if p is greater than or equal to 10000, which it is.
It then calculates the sum of the first 10000 and stores it in sum.
The code then subtracts the first 10000 from p, which leaves p as 700.
The code then checks if p is greater than or equal to 5000, which it is.
It then calculates the sum of the first 5000 and stores it in sum.
The code then subtracts the first 5000 from p, which leaves p as 200.
The code then checks if p is greater than or equal to 1000, which it is.
It then calculates the sum of the first 1000 and stores it in sum.
The code then subtracts the first 1000 from p, which leaves p as 0.
The code then checks if p is greater than or equal to 500, which it is not.
The code then prints the final value of sum, which is 15000.
<<<Output>>>
15000
