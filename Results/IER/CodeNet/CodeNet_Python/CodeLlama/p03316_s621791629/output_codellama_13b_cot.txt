<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user and stores it in the variable n.
The variable s is initialized to 0, which will be used to store the sum of the digits of n.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the length of n (which is 2 in this case).
For each iteration, it takes the ith digit of n and converts it to an integer.
It then adds this integer to the variable s.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if the integer representation of n is divisible by s.
If it is, the code prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
