<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, separated by a space.
The variables a and b are initialized to the values of the input.
The code then checks if a is less than b.
If it is, the code prints the difference between b and a.
If it is not, the code prints the difference between a and b.
In this case, a is 20 and b is 30, so the code prints 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
