  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first defines a class COMB_MOD with a constructor that initializes the following attributes:
* fac: an array of size max_n (default 510000) to store the factorials of the numbers from 0 to max_n-1.
* finv: an array of size max_n to store the inverse of the factorials of the numbers from 0 to max_n-1.
* inv: an array of size max_n to store the inverse of the numbers from 1 to max_n-1.
* max: the maximum value of n that can be handled by the class.
* mod: the modulo value used for the calculations.

The constructor also initializes the values of the arrays and sets the modulo value to 10^9 + 7.

The class also defines a method _maesyori that calculates the factorials and inverses of the numbers from 0 to max_n-1 and stores them in the arrays.

The class also defines a method comb that calculates the binomial coefficient of two numbers n and k.

The code then takes input from the user in the form of four integers h, w, a, and b.

The code then creates an instance of the COMB_MOD class with the default values of max_n and mod.

The code then calculates the value of ans by iterating from 0 to h-a and calculating the binomial coefficient of b-1+i and h-1-i+w-1-b and adding it to ans.

The code then prints the value of ans.

<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will depend on the input given by the user.
