<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user and stores it in the variable word.
The variable cflg is initialized to True, which will be used to indicate whether the input meets the conditions.
The code then checks if the first letter of the input is 'A'. If it is not, cflg is set to False.
If the first letter is 'A', the code checks if the number of 'C's in the input is exactly 1. If it is not, cflg is set to False.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the remaining letters of the input. For each letter l, it checks if l is uppercase. If it is, it increments a counter variable cnt.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if cnt is equal to 1. If it is not, cflg is set to False.
Finally, the code prints 'AC' if cflg is True, and 'WA' otherwise.
<<<Output>>>
AC
