  <<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function solve(k) that takes an integer k as input.
The function uses a deque data structure to store the current state of the problem.
The deque is initialized with the starting state (1, 1), which represents the current number and the number of steps taken to reach it.
The function then enters a loop that iterates until the deque is empty.
For each iteration, the function pops the last element from the deque and extracts the current number x and the number of steps taken to reach it, c.
The function then calculates the next number y by taking the modulo of x+1 with k.
If y is not in the dp dictionary or if the number of steps taken to reach y is greater than c+1, the function updates the dp dictionary with the new value and appends the new state to the front of the deque.
The function then calculates the next number z by taking the modulo of 10*x with k.
If z is not in the dp dictionary or if the number of steps taken to reach z is greater than c, the function updates the dp dictionary with the new value and appends the new state to the end of the deque.
The function then returns the value of dp[0], which represents the minimum number of steps required to reach 0 from the starting state.

The code then takes the input k from the user and calls the solve(k) function with the input k.
The function returns the minimum number of steps required to reach 0 from the starting state, which is printed to the console.

<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will depend on the input k.
If k is 6, the output will be 3, since the minimum number of steps required to reach 0 from the starting state is 3.
