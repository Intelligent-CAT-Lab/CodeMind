<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, separated by a space.
The variables a and b are initialized to the values of the input.
The code checks if the maximum of a and b is greater than 9.
If it is, the code prints -1.
If it is not, the code prints the product of a and b.

In this case, the input is 2 and 5, so the maximum is 5, which is less than 9.
The code prints the product of 2 and 5, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
