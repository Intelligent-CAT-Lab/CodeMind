<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in three integers as input, a, t, and r, and stores them in a list.
The code then calculates the value of ans as r * t / a.
The code then formats the value of ans to 6 decimal places using the format function and prints it.
<<<Output>>>
0.000000
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

Note: The output is 0.000000 because the value of ans is 0.000000.
