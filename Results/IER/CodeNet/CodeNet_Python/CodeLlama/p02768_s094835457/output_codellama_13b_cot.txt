  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes in three inputs: n, a, and b.
The variable n is initialized to 4, a is initialized to 1, and b is initialized to 3.
The code then defines a function called power_func, which takes in three inputs: a, n, and p.
The function calculates the value of a^n mod p using the binary representation of n.
The code then defines a function called cmb, which takes in three inputs: n, r, and p.
The function calculates the value of n choose r mod p using the formula (n! / (r! (n-r)!)) mod p.
The code then initializes the variable N to n, which is 4 in this case.
The code then defines a function called pow, which takes in two inputs: x and n.
The function calculates the value of x^n using the formula x^n = x^(n/2) * x^(n/2) if n is even, and x^n = x * x^(n-1) if n is odd.
The code then initializes the variable p to 10^9 + 7.
The code then defines a list called fact, which stores the values of n! mod p for n from 1 to N.
The code then defines a list called factinv, which stores the values of (n!)^-1 mod p for n from 1 to N.
The code then defines a list called inv, which stores the values of (p/n)^-1 mod p for n from 1 to N.
The code then calculates the value of (2^n - 1) mod p and stores it in ans.
The code then calculates the value of (n choose a) mod p and (n choose b) mod p and stores them in cmb(n, a, p) and cmb(n, b, p), respectively.
The code then subtracts the sum of cmb(n, a, p) and cmb(n, b, p) from ans and stores the result in ans.
The code then prints the value of ans mod p.
