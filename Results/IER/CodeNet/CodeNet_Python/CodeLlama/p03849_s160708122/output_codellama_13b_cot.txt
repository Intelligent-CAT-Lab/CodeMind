  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first defines a constant mod equal to 10^9+7, which is used to perform modular arithmetic.
The variable n is initialized to the input value, which is 3 in this case.
The function nth_bit takes an integer d as input and returns the value of the dth bit of n.
The function dp is defined as a list of lists, where each sublist has three elements.
The first element of each sublist is initialized to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 59 to 0 (inclusive), meaning it will consider values of d from 59 to 0.
For each value of d, the code enters a nested loop that iterates over the values of s from 0 to 2 (inclusive) and k from 0 to 2 (inclusive).
The variable s2 is set to the minimum of 2 and 2s+nth_bit(d)-k.
If s2 is greater than or equal to 0, the code adds the value of dp[d+1][s] to dp[d][s2].
The code then calculates the sum of the elements in the first sublist of dp and stores it in ans.
The code prints the value of ans modulo mod.
