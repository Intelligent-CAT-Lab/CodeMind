  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module and sets the recursion limit to 5010.
The solve function is defined, which takes a string s as input.
The function first checks if the length of s is 3, and if it is, it checks if the first three characters of s are 'A', 'B', and 'C', respectively. If they are, it returns True.
If the length of s is not 3, the function enters a while loop that iterates over the characters of s.
For each character, it checks if it is 'A', 'B', or 'C', and if it is, it increments the corresponding variable (a, b, or c).
It also appends the character to a list called lis.
If the character is not 'A', 'B', or 'C', it appends the character to lis without incrementing any of the variables.
After the while loop finishes, the function checks if a+b+c is equal to 2. If it is not, it returns False.
If a, b, or c is 0, the function loops over the characters in lis and replaces any 'X' characters with 'A', 'B', or 'C', respectively.
Finally, the function checks if the length of s is equal to the length of lis. If it is, it returns False.
If all of these conditions are met, the function returns the result of calling the solve function recursively with lis as the input.
The main function takes the input from the user and passes it to the solve function. If the solve function returns True, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".
