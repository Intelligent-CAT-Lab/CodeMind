<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes the input string s and splits it into two substrings: s[1:] and s[:-1].
The first substring is the substring starting from the second character and ending at the last character.
The second substring is the substring starting from the first character and ending at the second-to-last character.
The code then compares each character in the two substrings and checks if they are equal.
If they are not equal, the code adds 1 to the sum.
The code then prints the final sum.
