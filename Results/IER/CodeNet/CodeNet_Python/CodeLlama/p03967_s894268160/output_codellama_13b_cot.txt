<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user and stores it in the variable s.
The length of the string is calculated and stored in the variable l.
The code then initializes a variable point to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the string in pairs, using the zip function.
For each pair of characters, the code checks if the first character is 'p' and if so, decrements the point variable by 1.
The code then checks if the second character is 'g' and if so, increments the point variable by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of point.
<<<Output>>>
