<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input H and A from the user.
The variable H is initialized to 10 and variable A is initialized to 4.
The code then checks if A is equal to 0. If it is, it prints 0 and exits.
The code then calculates b = H/A//1, which is 2.5.
The code then checks if H/A is greater than b. It is not, so it prints 2.
<<<Output>>>
