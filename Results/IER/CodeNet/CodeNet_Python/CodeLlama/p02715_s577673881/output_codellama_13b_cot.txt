  <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N and variable K are initialized to 3 and 2, respectively.
The variable MOD is initialized to 10^9 + 7.
The variable just is initialized to an array of 0s with length K + 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from K to 0, meaning it will consider numbers from 2 to 3.
For each number X in this range, it calculates the power of K // X to the Nth power modulo MOD and stores it in just[X].
The code then enters another loop that iterates from X + X to K, meaning it will consider numbers from 2X to K.
For each number mul in this range, it subtracts just[mul] from just[X] and stores the result in just[X].
The code then enters a third loop that iterates from 1 to K + 1, meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 3.
For each number X in this range, it calculates the product of X and just[X] modulo MOD and stores the result in ans.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 2.
