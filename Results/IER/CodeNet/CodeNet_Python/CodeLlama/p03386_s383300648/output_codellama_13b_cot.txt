<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three inputs A, B, and K.
The first if statement checks if A+K-1 is greater than or equal to B-K+1.
In this case, A+K-1 is 3+2-1=4, and B-K+1 is 8-2+1=7.
Since 4 is greater than 7, the code enters the first if statement and prints the numbers from A to B.
The output will be 3,4,5,6,7,8.
