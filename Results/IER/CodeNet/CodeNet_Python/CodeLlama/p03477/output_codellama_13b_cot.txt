<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in four integers as input, which are stored in variables A, B, C, and D.
The code then checks if the sum of A and B is less than the sum of C and D. If it is, the code prints "Right".
If the sum of A and B is equal to the sum of C and D, the code prints "Balanced".
If the sum of A and B is greater than the sum of C and D, the code prints "Left".

In this case, the sum of A and B is 11 (3+8), and the sum of C and D is 15 (7+8). Since 11 is less than 15, the code prints "Right".
<<<Output>>>
Right
