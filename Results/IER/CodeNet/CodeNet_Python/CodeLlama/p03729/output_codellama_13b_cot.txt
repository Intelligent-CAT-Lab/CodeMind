<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in a string input from the user, splits it into three parts using the split() method, and assigns each part to a, b, and c, respectively.
The code then checks if the last character of a is equal to the first character of b, and if the last character of b is equal to the first character of c. If both conditions are met, the code prints 'YES', otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

In this case, the input is 'rng gorilla apple', which means a = 'rng', b = 'gorilla', and c = 'apple'. The last character of a is 'g', which is not equal to the first character of b, which is 'g'. Therefore, the code prints 'NO'.
<<<Output>>>
NO
