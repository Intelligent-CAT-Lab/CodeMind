  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in three integers a, b, and x as input.
The variable d is initialized to a - b, which is 3 - 1 = 2.
The variable n is initialized to the maximum of 0 and (x - b), which is 5 - 1 = 4.
The variable ans is initialized to x + n * b, which is 5 + 4 * 1 = 9.
The code then prints the remainder of ans divided by 1000000007, which is 9 % 1000000007 = 9.
<<<Output>>>
9
