  <<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function f(a,b,c) that returns True if a*b is less than 100*c, and False otherwise.
The code then maps the input string to integers using the map() function, and assigns the values to variables m, rd, rr, cd, and cr.
The code calculates the values of ex and ey using the formulae cd*100//rd and cr*100//rr, respectively.
The code checks if the values of ex and ey meet the condition of f(ex,rd,cd) and f(ey,rr,cr), respectively. If they do, the code increments them by 1.
The code then calculates the difference between m and ex+ey, and prints the result.
