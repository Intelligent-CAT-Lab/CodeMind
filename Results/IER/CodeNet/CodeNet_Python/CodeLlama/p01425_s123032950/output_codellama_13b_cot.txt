  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first reads the input from the user and stores it in the variables N, V, X, and Y.
The code then initializes the variable g to 9.8 and eps to 1e-10.
The code then enters a loop that iterates N times, meaning it will consider N obstacles.
For each obstacle, the code reads the input and stores it in the variables L, B, R, and T.
The code then checks if the obstacle is within the range of the pig's jump, which is from 0 to X.
If the obstacle is within the range, the code adds it to the list of obstacles.
The code then checks if the pig can hit the obstacle directly, which is possible if the pig's initial velocity is greater than the velocity required to reach the obstacle.
If the pig can hit the obstacle directly, the code prints "Yes" and exits.
The code then enters another loop that iterates over the obstacles and checks if the pig can hit the obstacle by jumping to the left or right of the obstacle.
If the pig can hit the obstacle by jumping to the left or right, the code prints "Yes" and exits.
If the pig cannot hit the obstacle by jumping to the left or right, the code prints "No" and exits.
<<<Output>>>
No
