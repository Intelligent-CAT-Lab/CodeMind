<<<Analysis>>>
The code imports the sys module and sets the recursion limit to 10^7. It also defines two constants, f_inf, which is set to infinity, and mod, which is set to 10^9 + 7.
The code then defines a function called resolve, which takes no arguments.
The function first takes input from the user and stores it in a variable called s.
The function then prints the first 8 characters of s, which is "CODEFESTI".
The function then returns None.
The code then checks if the module name is "__main__", which is the name of the module that is currently being executed. If it is, it calls the resolve function.
<<<Output>>>
CODEFESTI
