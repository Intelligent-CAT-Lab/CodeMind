<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in three integers a, b, and k as input.
The first line of the code checks if a is less than or equal to k. If it is, it subtracts a from k and sets a to 0. If not, it prints the difference between a and k, and then exits the program.
The second line of the code prints 0 and the maximum of b minus k and 0.

Based on the input of 2, 3, and 3, the first line of the code will not be executed because 2 is not less than or equal to 3. The second line of the code will be executed, and the output will be 1, 0.
