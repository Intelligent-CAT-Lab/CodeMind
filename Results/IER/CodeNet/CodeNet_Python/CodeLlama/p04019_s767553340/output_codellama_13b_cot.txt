<<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the collections module, which provides a Counter class for counting hashable objects.
The input string is then stored in a list called s.
The variable ans is initialized to "Yes".
The code then creates a Counter object called c from the input string s.
The code checks if the product of the counts of "N" and "S" is equal to 0. If it is, it checks if the count of "N" is not equal to the count of "S". If it is, it sets ans to "No".
The code then checks if the product of the counts of "W" and "E" is equal to 0. If it is, it checks if the count of "W" is not equal to the count of "E". If it is, it sets ans to "No".
Finally, the code prints the value of ans.
<<<Output>>>
"Yes"
