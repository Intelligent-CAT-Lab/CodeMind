  <<<Analysis>>>
The code imports the itertools module and defines two variables n and k.
The code then defines a list l with the values 0 to n-1 and an empty list p.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over all possible combinations of k elements from the list l.
For each combination, the code calculates the number of elements in the combination and stores it in num.
The code then appends a tuple containing num and the combination to the list p.
The code then sorts the list p based on the first element of each tuple.
The code then enters another loop that iterates over the sorted list p.
For each tuple in the list, the code prints the first element of the tuple followed by a colon and then the elements of the combination.
