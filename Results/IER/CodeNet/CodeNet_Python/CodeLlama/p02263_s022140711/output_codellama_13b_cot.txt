  <<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a class called stack, which has a list called val and three methods: stack_push, stack_pop, and __init__.
The __init__ method initializes the val list with the argument passed to it.
The stack_push method appends the argument to the val list.
The stack_pop method removes and returns the last element of the val list.
The code then takes input from the user and splits it into a list called N.
It then creates an instance of the stack class called Output and initializes it with an empty list.
It then iterates over the elements of N and checks if each element is a digit. If it is, it pushes it onto the Output stack using the stack_push method. If it is not a digit, it pops two elements from the Output stack using the stack_pop method, converts them to integers, and performs the operation indicated by the current element of N (either +, -, *, or /). It then pushes the result back onto the Output stack.
Finally, it pops the last element of the Output stack and prints it.
