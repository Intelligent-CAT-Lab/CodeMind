  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the numpy library and defines two variables n and M.
The code then takes input from the user and assigns it to n and M respectively.
The code then defines a variable l as n*3+1.
The code then defines a variable d as a 2D array of size (l,n*5) with data type int64.
The code then initializes the first element of the array d to 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to l (inclusive).
For each iteration, the code calculates the value of d[i] using the formula ((d[i-3]*k+roll(d[k],-1))*j+roll(d[j],1))%M.
The code then prints the sum of the last row of the array d modulo M.
<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will be 1000000007.
