  <<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a list a with 100 zeros.
The code then takes input from the user and stores it in a list b.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 12.
For each iteration, the code increments the value of a[b[i]-1] by 1.
The code then enters another loop that iterates from 1 to 100.
For each iteration, the code checks if a[i] is non-zero and if a[i] is divisible by 4. If both conditions are met, the code increments c by a[i]//4.
The code then prints 'yes' if c is equal to 3, and 'no' otherwise.
<<<Output>>>
yes
