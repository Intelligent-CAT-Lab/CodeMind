  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in four integers a, b, c, and d as input.
The variable mod is initialized to 998244353.
The variable dp is initialized to a list of lists, where each sublist has d+2 elements, all initialized to 0.
The code sets dp[a][b] to 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from a to c (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from a to c.
For each number i in this range, it iterates from b to d (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from b to d.
For each pair of numbers (i, j), the code calculates the value of dp[i][j] and stores it in dp[i][j].
The code then updates the values of dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j+1], and dp[i+1][j+1] based on the values of dp[i][j].
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of dp[c][d], which is the value of dp[2][2].
