<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes the input string "xabxa" and initializes variables i and j to 0 and len(s)-1, respectively.
The code then enters a while loop that iterates until i>=j.
The loop first checks if the characters at indices i and j are both "x". If they are, it increments i and j and continues the loop.
If i>=j, the loop breaks.
The code then enters another while loop that checks if the character at index i is "x". If it is, it increments i and ans by 1, and breaks if i>=j.
The code then enters another while loop that checks if the character at index j is "x". If it is, it decrements j and ans by 1, and breaks if i>=j.
If the characters at indices i and j are not equal, the code sets ans to -1 and breaks the loop.
The code then increments i and j and breaks the loop if i>=j.
The code finally prints the value of ans, which is 2.
