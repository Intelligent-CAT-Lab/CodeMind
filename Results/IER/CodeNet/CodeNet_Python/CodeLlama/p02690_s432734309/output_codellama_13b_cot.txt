  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input x from the user.
It then checks if x is a perfect square by checking if int(x**0.2)==int(x)**0.2.
If x is a perfect square, the code prints the square root of x and 0, and exits.
If x is not a perfect square, the code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 10000.
For each iteration, the code calculates the sum of x and the fifth power of two integers b and c, and checks if the result is a perfect square.
If the result is a perfect square, the code prints the square root of the result and the value of b or c, and exits.
If the result is not a perfect square, the code checks if the result is less than 0.
If the result is less than 0, the code enters a nested loop that iterates from 1 to 1000.
For each iteration, the code calculates the sum of x and the fifth power of the negative integer v, and checks if the result is equal to the result of the previous iteration.
If the result is equal to the previous iteration, the code prints v and c, and exits.
If the result is not equal to the previous iteration, the code continues the outer loop.
If the result is greater than or equal to 0, the code continues the outer loop.
The code continues the outer loop until it finds a perfect square or until it reaches the end of the loop.
