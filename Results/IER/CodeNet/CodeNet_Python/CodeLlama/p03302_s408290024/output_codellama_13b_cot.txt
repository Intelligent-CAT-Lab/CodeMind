<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user and splits it into two numbers using the space character as a delimiter.
The first number is stored in variable a and the second number is stored in variable b.
The code then checks if the sum of a and b is equal to 15, and if so, prints a plus sign.
If the product of a and b is equal to 15, the code prints an asterisk.
If neither of these conditions are met, the code prints an x.

In this case, the input is "4 11", so a = 4 and b = 11.
The sum of a and b is 15, so the code prints a plus sign.
