<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a list dp with 1001 elements, all set to 0.
The code then reads two integers n and m from the input.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive).
For each iteration, the code sets j to 1 and enters a while loop that iterates as long as i+j is less than or equal to n and j is less than or equal to m.
Inside the while loop, the code updates the value of dp[i+j] by adding dp[i] divided by (n-i) to it.
After the while loop finishes, the code prints the value of dp[n] rounded to 10 decimal places.
