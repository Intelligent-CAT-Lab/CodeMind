  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string as input and then processes it using the groupby function from the itertools module.
The groupby function groups consecutive identical elements in the input string together.
The code then iterates over the groups and calculates the length of each group.
The code also keeps track of the number of consecutive greater than and less than signs in the input string.
The code then calculates the output based on the number of consecutive greater than and less than signs and the length of each group.
The final output is printed.
