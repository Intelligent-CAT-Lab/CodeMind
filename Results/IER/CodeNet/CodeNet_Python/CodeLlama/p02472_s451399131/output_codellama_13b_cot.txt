The code imports the sys module, which provides access to the standard input and output streams.
The code then reads a line from the standard input using the readline() method of the sys.stdin object.
The readline() method returns a string containing the line read from the input stream.
The code then splits the string into two integers using the split() method of the string object.
The split() method returns a list of strings, where each string is a substring of the original string.
The code then assigns the first element of the list to the variable a and the second element to the variable b.
The code then prints the sum of a and b using the print() function.
