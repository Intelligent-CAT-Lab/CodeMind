  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input n from the user.
The code then checks if n is equal to 1, and if it is, it prints 1 and exits.
If n is not equal to 1, the code initializes two lists res_v and res_v_cumsum with n+1 elements, all set to 0.
The code then sets res_v[0] and res_v[1] to 0 and 1, respectively.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 3 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 3 to n.
For each number k in this range, the code calculates the value of res_v[k] and stores it in res_v_cumsum[k].
The code then calculates the final output by multiplying res_v_cumsum[n-2] by (((n-1) * (n-1)) % M) and adding it to res_v_cumsum[n-1] multiplied by (n-1) and n, and then adding n and (n-1)*(n-1)%M.
The code then prints the final output and exits.
