The code first imports the numpy library as np.
The input is then taken as a string and split into a list of integers using the split() method.
The list is then sorted using the sorted() method and converted to a numpy array using the np.array() method.
The code then calculates the difference between each consecutive element in the array and sums them up using the sum() method.
The final output is printed.
