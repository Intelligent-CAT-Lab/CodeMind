  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes the input string s and initializes two variables, g_num and p_num, to 1. It also initializes two variables, win and lose, to 0.
The code then checks if the first character of the input string is 'p', and if it is, it increments the lose variable by 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the remaining characters of the input string, starting from the second character.
For each character, the code checks if it is 'p' or 'g'. If it is 'p', the code increments the p_num variable by 1. If it is 'g', the code increments the g_num variable by 1.
If the p_num variable is less than the g_num variable, the code increments the p_num variable by 1. If the p_num variable is greater than or equal to the g_num variable, the code increments the g_num variable by 1 and increments the lose variable by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the difference between the win and lose variables.
