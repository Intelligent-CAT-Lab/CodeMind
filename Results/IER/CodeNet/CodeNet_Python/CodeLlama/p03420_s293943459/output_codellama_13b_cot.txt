  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module and defines two functions: input, which reads a line from standard input and removes the trailing newline character, and write, which writes a line to standard output.
The code then sets the recursion limit to 1000 or 10^9, whichever is larger.
The code then reads two integers, n and k, from standard input using the input function.
The code then initializes a variable ans to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from k+1 to n+1, meaning it will consider numbers from k+1 to n.
For each number b in this range, the code calculates a value val using the formula (b-k) * (n//b) + max(0, (n%b)-k+1).
If k is 0, the code subtracts 1 from val.
The code then adds val to ans.
The code then prints the final value of ans.
