The code takes two inputs a and b from the user.
The variable x is initialized to a list of 10 zeros.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 9.
For each iteration, the code calculates the value of x[i] as b*10 + i.
The code then checks if a is equal to x[i]*0.08.
If the condition is met, the code prints x[i] and breaks out of the loop.
If the condition is not met, the code prints -1.

In this case, the input is 2 and 2.
The code calculates x[i] as follows:
x[0] = 2*10 + 0 = 20
x[1] = 2*10 + 1 = 21
x[2] = 2*10 + 2 = 22
x[3] = 2*10 + 3 = 23
x[4] = 2*10 + 4 = 24
x[5] = 2*10 + 5 = 25
x[6] = 2*10 + 6 = 26
x[7] = 2*10 + 7 = 27
x[8] = 2*10 + 8 = 28
x[9] = 2*10 + 9 = 29

The code checks if a is equal to x[i]*0.08.
a = 2, x[i]*0.08 = 20*0.08 = 1.6
a = 21, x[i]*0.08 = 21*0.08 = 1.72
a = 22, x[i]*0.08 = 22*0.08 = 1.84
a = 23, x[i]*0.08 = 23*0.08 = 1.96
a = 24, x[i]*0.08 = 24*0.08 = 2.08
a = 25, x[i]*0.08 = 25*0.08 = 2.2
a = 26, x[i]*0.08 = 26*0.08 = 2.32
a = 27, x[i]*0.08 = 27*0.08 = 2.44
a = 28, x[i]*0.08 = 28*0.08 = 2.56
a = 29, x[i]*0.08 = 29*0.08 = 2.68

Since a is not equal to any of the values of x[i]*0.08, the code prints -1.
