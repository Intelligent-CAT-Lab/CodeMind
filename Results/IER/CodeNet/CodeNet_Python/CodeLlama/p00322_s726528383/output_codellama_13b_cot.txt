  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the itertools module, which provides a function for generating permutations of a given iterable.
The input is split into a list of strings, and each string is converted to an integer.
The code then creates a set of strings representing the numbers from 1 to 9, and initializes an empty list n and an integer variable c to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 8, meaning it will consider the first 9 elements of the input list.
For each element i in this range, the code checks if it is in the set b. If it is, it removes it from the set. If it is not, it appends the index of the element to the list n.
After the loop finishes, the code uses the itertools.permutations function to generate all possible permutations of the remaining elements in the set b.
For each permutation i, the code iterates over the elements in the list n and assigns the corresponding element in the permutation to the corresponding index in the list a.
The code then checks if the sum of the first three elements in the list a is equal to the sum of the last three elements. If it is, it increments the variable c by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of c, which is the number of permutations that satisfy the condition.
