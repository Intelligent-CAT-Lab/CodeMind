  <<<Analysis>>>
The code defines two functions: fib and solve.
The fib function takes an integer n as input and returns the nth Fibonacci number.
The solve function takes no input and prints the nth Fibonacci number, where n is the input given by the user.
The code first defines a list memo with n elements, and initializes the first two elements to 2 and 1, respectively.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 2 to n.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of the previous two elements in the memo list and stores it in the current element.
The code returns the final element of the memo list, which is the nth Fibonacci number.
<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will be the nth Fibonacci number, where n is the input given by the user.
