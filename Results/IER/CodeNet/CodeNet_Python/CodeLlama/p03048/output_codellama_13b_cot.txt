<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in four integers R, G, B, and n as input.
The variable cnt is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of valid combinations.
The code then enters a nested loop that iterates over all possible values of r, g, and b.
For each combination of r, g, and b, the code checks if the equation r * R + g * G + b * B is equal to n.
If it is, the code increments cnt by 1.
The loop finishes when all possible combinations have been considered.
The code then prints the final value of cnt, which is the number of valid combinations.
<<<Output>>>
