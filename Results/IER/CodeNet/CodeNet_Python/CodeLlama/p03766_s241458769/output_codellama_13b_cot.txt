<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input n from the user and initializes variables a, b, c, and p to 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates n-1 times.
For each iteration, the code calculates the value of p as p+=(a-1) and updates the values of a, b, and c as follows:
a, b, c = b, c, ((n-1)**2+p+c)%(10**9+7)
The loop finishes when i=n-1.
The code then prints the final value of c, which is the output of the code.
