<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input n from the user.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 9.
For each number i in this range, it checks if n is divisible by i and if n/i is less than 10.
If both conditions are met, the code prints "Yes" and exits the loop using the exit() function.
If the loop completes without finding a divisor, the code prints "No".

In this case, the input is 10, which is divisible by 1 and 10/1 is less than 10.
The code will print "Yes" and exit the loop.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
