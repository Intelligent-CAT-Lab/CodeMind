  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the necessary libraries, including sys, numpy, and numba.
It then defines a function called main, which takes two integer arguments N and K.
The function first initializes an array called power with size N + 10, and sets the first element to 1.
It then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N + 10, and for each iteration, it calculates the power of K + 1 and stores it in the corresponding element of the power array.
The function then calculates the value of ret, which is the sum of the first N elements of the power array, multiplied by K * (K + 1) // 2.
It then initializes an array called dp with size 1, and sets the first element to 1.
It then enters a loop that iterates from N to 0, and for each iteration, it calculates the new value of dp, which is the sum of the previous value of dp and the product of the current value of dp and the power of K + 1.
The function then returns the value of ret, which is the final answer.
<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will be 12, which is the result of the calculation in the main function.
