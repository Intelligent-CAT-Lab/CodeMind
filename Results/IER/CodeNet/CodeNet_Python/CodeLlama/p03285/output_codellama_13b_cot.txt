<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input N from the user.
The code then enters a nested loop that iterates from 0 to 24 (inclusive) for the outer loop and from 0 to 19 (inclusive) for the inner loop.
For each pair of values (i, j) in this range, the code calculates the expression 4*i + 7*j and checks if it is equal to N.
If the condition is met, the code prints "Yes" and exits the program.
If the loop finishes without finding a match, the code prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
