<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input H and W as integers from the user.
The code then checks if H or W is equal to 1. If either of them is equal to 1, the code prints 1 and exits.
If both H and W are greater than 1, the code calculates the answer as follows:
The code calculates the product of H and (W//2), which is the number of rectangles in the first half of the grid.
The code then calculates the number of rectangles in the second half of the grid, which is (H+1)//2 times (W%2).
The code then adds the number of rectangles in the first half and the second half to get the total number of rectangles.
The code finally prints the total number of rectangles.
<<<Output>>>
