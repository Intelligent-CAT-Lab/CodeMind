  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs, K and N, from the user.
K is an integer, and N is also an integer.
The code checks if K is even or odd.
If K is even, the code prints K//2 (integer division) followed by K*(N-1) (K repeated N-1 times).
If K is odd, the code initializes X to [(K+1)//2] * N (integer division).
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to N//2 (inclusive).
For each iteration, the code checks if X[-1] is equal to 1.
If it is, the code pops the last element of X.
If it is not, the code subtracts 1 from the last element of X and extends X with K*(N-len(X)) (K repeated N-len(X) times).
After the loop finishes, the code prints the elements of X.
