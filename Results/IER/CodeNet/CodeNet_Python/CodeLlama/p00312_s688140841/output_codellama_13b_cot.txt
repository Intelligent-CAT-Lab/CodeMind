<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, D and L, and stores them in variables D and L, respectively.
The code then calculates the result of D // L, which is the integer division of D by L.
The code then calculates the result of D % L, which is the remainder of D divided by L.
The code then adds the result of D // L and D % L and stores it in variable ans.
The code then prints the value of ans.
