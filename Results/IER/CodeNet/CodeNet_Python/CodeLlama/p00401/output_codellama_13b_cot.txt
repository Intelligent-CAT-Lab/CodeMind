<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized to 54, which is the input given to the code.
The variable count is initialized to 1.
The code enters a loop that iterates while count is less than or equal to N.
In each iteration, count is multiplied by 2.
The loop continues until count is greater than N, which happens when count is 112.
The code then prints the value of count divided by 2, which is 56.
<<<Output>>>
56
