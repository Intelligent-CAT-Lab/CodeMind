  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first defines a dictionary called dic, which contains key-value pairs. The keys are integers, and the values are also integers.
The code then prompts the user to input an integer value, which is stored in the variable n.
The code then checks if the value of n is a key in the dictionary dic. If it is, the code prints the corresponding value from the dictionary. If it is not, the code prints -1.
