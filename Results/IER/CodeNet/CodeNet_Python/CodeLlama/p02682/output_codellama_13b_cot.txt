  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in four integers as input, a, b, c, and k.
The code then initializes a variable ans to 0.
The code then performs the following operations:
1. It calculates the minimum of a and k and multiplies it by 1.
2. It subtracts the minimum of a and k from k.
3. It calculates the minimum of b and k and multiplies it by 0.
4. It subtracts the minimum of b and k from k.
5. It calculates the minimum of c and k and multiplies it by -1.
6. It subtracts the minimum of c and k from k.
7. It prints the final value of ans.

The output of the code will depend on the values of a, b, c, and k.

<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will be 0.
