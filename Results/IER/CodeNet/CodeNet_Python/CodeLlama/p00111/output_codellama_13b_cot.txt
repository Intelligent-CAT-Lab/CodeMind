  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first defines two functions: main() and make_table().
The main() function calls the make_table() function to create two tables: tableA and tableB.
The make_table() function creates two dictionaries: tableA and tableB.
The tableA dictionary maps each letter of the alphabet to a binary string of length 5.
The tableB dictionary maps each binary string of length 5 to a letter of the alphabet.
The main() function then enters an infinite loop that reads input from the user and processes it.
For each input character, it looks up the corresponding binary string in tableA and appends it to a temporary string.
If the temporary string is a key in tableB, it prints the corresponding letter and clears the temporary string.
The loop continues until the user enters a blank line or an invalid input.
<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will be:
```
D-C'KOPUA
