The output of the code will depend on the values of N, M, and K.
For example, if N = 2, M = 2, and K = 2, the output will be 1.
If N = 2, M = 2, and K = 3, the output will be 0.
If N = 2, M = 3, and K = 2, the output will be 1.
If N = 2, M = 3, and K = 3, the output will be 0.
If N = 3, M = 2, and K = 2, the output will be 1.
If N = 3, M = 2, and K = 3, the output will be 0.
If N = 3, M = 3, and K = 2, the output will be 1.
If N = 3, M = 3, and K = 3, the output will be 0.
