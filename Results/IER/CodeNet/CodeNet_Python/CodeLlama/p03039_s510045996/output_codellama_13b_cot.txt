  <<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called e_cell_distance that takes in four arguments: N, M, K, and MOD.
The function first defines a class called Combination, which is used to calculate the binomial coefficient.
The class has three attributes: mod, factorial, and inverse.
The function then defines two variables, t1 and t2, which are calculated using the formulae given in the code.
The function then calculates the value of comb using the Combination class and the formulae given in the code.
The function then calculates the value of t using the formulae given in the code.
The function then returns the value of comb multiplied by t, modulo MOD.

The code then takes in three inputs from the user: N, M, and K.
The function e_cell_distance is then called with these inputs, and the output is printed.

<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will depend on the values of N, M, and K.
For example, if N = 2, M = 2, and K = 2, the output will be 1.
If N = 2, M = 2, and K = 3, the output will be 0.
If N = 2, M = 3, and K = 2, the output will be 1.
If N = 2, M = 3, and K = 3, the output will be 0.
If N = 3, M = 2, and K = 2, the output will be 1.
If N = 3, M = 2, and K = 3, the output will be 0.
If N = 3, M = 3, and K = 2, the output will be 1.
If N = 3, M = 3, and K = 3, the output will be 0.
