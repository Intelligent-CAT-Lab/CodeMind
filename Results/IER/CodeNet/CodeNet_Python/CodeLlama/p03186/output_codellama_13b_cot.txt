<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in three integers as input, a, b, and c.
The code checks if c is less than or equal to a + b + 1.
If the condition is met, the code prints b + c.
If the condition is not met, the code prints a + 2b + 1.

In this case, the input is 3, 1, and 4.
The condition is not met, so the code prints a + 2b + 1, which is 3 + 2(1) + 1 = 6.
<<<Output>>>
6
