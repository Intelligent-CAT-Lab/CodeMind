  <<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function CheckDisit that takes a string as input and returns an integer. The function calculates the sum of the digits of the string, multiplies each digit by a weight based on its position, and then calculates the remainder of the sum divided by 11. If the remainder is less than or equal to 1, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it returns 11 minus the remainder.
The code then defines a list m and assigns it the value of the input string. If the 12th character of the input string is a question mark, the code calls the CheckDisit function with the input string as an argument and prints the result.
If the 12th character of the input string is not a question mark, the code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 9. For each iteration, the code replaces the question mark in the input string with the current iteration number, and then calls the CheckDisit function with the modified input string as an argument. If the result of the CheckDisit function is 0, the code appends the current iteration number to a list called ans.
After the loop finishes, the code checks the length of the ans list. If it is 1, the code prints the only element in the list. If it is greater than 1, the code prints "MULTIPLE".
