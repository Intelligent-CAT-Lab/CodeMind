<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs from the user, a and b, and stores them in variables a and b, respectively.
The code then checks if b is equal to 100, and if it is, it adds 1 to b.
The code then prints the result of multiplying b by 100 to the power of a.

In this case, the input is 0 and 5, so the code will print 500.
<<<Output>>>
500
