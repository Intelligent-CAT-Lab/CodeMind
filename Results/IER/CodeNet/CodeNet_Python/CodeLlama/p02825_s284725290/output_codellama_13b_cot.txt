  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first sets the recursion limit to 10^6.
It then reads the input from the user and stores it in the variable n.
The code then checks if n is equal to 2, if it is, it prints -1 and exits.
If n is not equal to 2, the code checks if n is even, if it is, it initializes a 2D list ans with n rows and n columns, and sets each element to ".".
It then iterates over the rows and columns of ans and sets the elements to the corresponding elements of a21 or a22 based on the row and column indices.
If n is not even, the code checks if n is 3, if it is, it initializes a 2D list ans with 3 rows and 3 columns, and sets each element to ".".
It then iterates over the rows and columns of ans and sets the elements to the corresponding elements of a3 based on the row and column indices.
If n is not 3, the code checks if n is 5, if it is, it initializes a 2D list ans with 5 rows and 5 columns, and sets each element to ".".
It then iterates over the rows and columns of ans and sets the elements to the corresponding elements of a5 based on the row and column indices.
If n is not 5, the code checks if n is 7, if it is, it initializes a 2D list ans with 7 rows and 7 columns, and sets each element to ".".
It then iterates over the rows and columns of ans and sets the elements to the corresponding elements of a7 based on the row and column indices.
Finally, the code iterates over the rows of ans and prints each row with a space separating each element.
