<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function main() that takes two integers N and M as input.
The function calculates the value of t as 1900*M + 100*(N-M) and p as 2**M.
The function then prints the value of t*p.
The code then checks if the module name is "__main__" and if it is, it calls the main() function.
The input is given as "1 1".
