<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input N from the user.
The variable ans is initialized to 0.
The code then enters a while loop that continues to run as long as N is not equal to 0.
In each iteration, the code divides N by 2 and assigns the result back to N.
The code also increments the variable ans by 1 in each iteration.
The loop will terminate when N becomes 0, which is when the input is 0.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is the number of times the loop ran.
<<<Output>>>
0
