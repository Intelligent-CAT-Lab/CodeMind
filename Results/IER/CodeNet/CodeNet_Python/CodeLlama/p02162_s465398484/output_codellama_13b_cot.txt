  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first maps the input to variables T1, T2, R1, and R2.
The code then checks if -1 is in the list [R1, R2].
If it is, the code checks if T1 is less than T2, and if so, it prints "Alice".
If T1 is greater than T2, it prints "Bob".
If T1 is equal to T2, it prints "Draw".
If -1 is not in the list [R1, R2], the code checks if R1 is greater than R2.
If it is, it prints "Alice".
If R1 is less than R2, it prints "Bob".
If R1 is equal to R2, it prints "Draw".
<<<Output>>>
Alice
