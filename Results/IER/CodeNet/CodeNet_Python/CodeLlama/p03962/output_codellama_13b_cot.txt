<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes input from the user, which is a string of numbers separated by spaces.
The input is then converted to a list of integers using the map() function.
The list is then converted to a set using the set() function, which removes duplicates.
The length of the set is then printed using the len() function.

In this case, the input is "3 1 4", which is converted to a list of integers [3, 1, 4].
The set of this list is {1, 3, 4}, which has a length of 3.
The code will print the length of the set, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>
3
