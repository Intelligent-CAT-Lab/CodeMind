<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers N and M as input, separated by a space.
The code then checks if the maximum value of N and M is 1. If it is, the code prints 1.
If the minimum value of N and M is 1, the code prints N*M - 2.
Otherwise, the code prints (N-2)*(M-2).

In this case, the input is 2 2, so N = 2 and M = 2.
The maximum value of N and M is 2, so the code prints 1.
<<<Output>>>
1
