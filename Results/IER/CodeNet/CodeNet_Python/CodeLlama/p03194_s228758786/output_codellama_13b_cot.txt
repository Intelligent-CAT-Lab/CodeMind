  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the math module, which provides mathematical functions.
The code then reads two integers, n and p, from the input using the map function.
The code then checks if n is equal to 1, and if it is, it prints p and exits.
If n is not equal to 1, the code initializes a variable ans to 1 and a variable limit to the smallest integer greater than or equal to p^(1/n).
The code then enters a loop that iterates while limit is greater than 1.
For each iteration, the code calculates the number of times that limit divides p, and stores the result in a variable cnt.
If cnt is greater than or equal to n, the code sets ans to limit and breaks out of the loop.
The code then prints the final value of ans.
