<<<Analysis>>>
The code first initializes six variables A, B, C, D, E, and F to the values 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15, respectively.
The code then reads two integers N and M from the input and stores them in variables N and M, respectively.
The code then checks if N is greater than M, and if so, it prints the character ">".
If N is equal to M, it prints the character "=".
If N is less than M, it prints the character "<".
