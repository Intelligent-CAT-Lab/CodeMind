The code first imports the sys module and the decimal module.
The input function is defined as a lambda function that reads a line from the standard input and removes the trailing newline character.
The code then reads an integer L from the input and stores it in the variable L.
The code then converts L to a Decimal object and stores it in the variable d.
The code then prints the result of raising d to the power of 3 and dividing it by 3.
