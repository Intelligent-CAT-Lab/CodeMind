<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input from the user and splits it into two integers A and B.
The code then checks the value of A and performs the corresponding action based on the condition.
If A is greater than or equal to 13, the code prints the value of B.
If A is greater than or equal to 6 but less than 13, the code prints the value of B divided by 2.
If A is less than 6, the code prints 0.
<<<Output>>>
100
