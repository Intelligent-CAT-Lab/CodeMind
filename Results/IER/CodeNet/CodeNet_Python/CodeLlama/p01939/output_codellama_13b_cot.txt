  <<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function sum(a,d,n) that calculates the sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence with first term a and common difference d.
The function returns the sum modulo MOD, which is 10**9+7.
The code also defines a function main() that takes two integers n and m as input.
The function calculates the sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence with first term m+1 and common difference -n+1.
The function then multiplies the result by 2 and subtracts (m+1) from it.
The function finally prints the result modulo MOD.

The code then checks if the input n is equal to 1. If it is, the function returns m+1. Otherwise, it calculates the sum of the first n terms of the sequence and returns the result.

The code then calls the main() function with the input n and m.

<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will be the sum of the first n terms of the sequence modulo MOD, where n is the first input and m is the second input.

If n is equal to 1, the output will be m+1.

If n is greater than 1, the output will be the sum of the first n terms of the sequence, which is calculated using the sum() function. The result is then multiplied by 2 and subtracted by (m+1). The final result is then modulo MOD.

The output will be an integer between 0 and MOD-1.
