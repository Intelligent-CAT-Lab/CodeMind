The output of the code will be the sum of the first n terms of the sequence modulo MOD, where n is the first input and m is the second input.

If n is equal to 1, the output will be m+1.

If n is greater than 1, the output will be the sum of the first n terms of the sequence, which is calculated using the sum() function. The result is then multiplied by 2 and subtracted by (m+1). The final result is then modulo MOD.

The output will be an integer between 0 and MOD-1.
