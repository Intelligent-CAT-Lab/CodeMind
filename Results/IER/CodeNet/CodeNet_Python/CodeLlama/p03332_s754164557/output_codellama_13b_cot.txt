  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in four inputs: n, a, b, and k.
n is the number of elements in the array, a is the lower bound of the range, b is the upper bound of the range, and k is the target value.
The code initializes m to n // 2 + 1, which is 3 in this case.
The code then initializes an array called comb with m elements, each initialized to 1.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to m (inclusive).
For each iteration, the code calculates the value of comb[i] using the formula:
comb[i] = comb[i - 1] * (n + 1 - i) * pow(i, mod - 2, mod)
The code then updates the value of ans using the formula:
ans += comb[i] * comb[j]
The code then checks if a * i > k, and if so, it breaks out of the loop.
The code then checks if j % b == 0, and if so, it updates the value of j to j // b.
The code then checks if 0 <= j <= n, and if so, it updates the value of i and j to the minimum of i and n - i, and the minimum of j and n - j.
The code then updates the value of ans using the formula:
ans += comb[i] * comb[j]
The code then prints the final value of ans.
