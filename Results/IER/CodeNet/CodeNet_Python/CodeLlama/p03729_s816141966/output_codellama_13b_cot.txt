<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in a string input from the user, splits it into three parts using the split() method, and then maps each part to a string using the map() method.
The code then checks if the last character of the first string (a) is equal to the first character of the second string (b), and if the last character of the second string (b) is equal to the first character of the third string (c).
If both conditions are met, the code prints "YES", otherwise it prints "NO".
<<<Output>>>
YES
