<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input from the user, which is a string of space-separated integers. It then converts the string to a list of integers using the map() function.
The code then assigns the first element of the list to variable a, the second element to variable b, and the third element to variable x.
The code then calculates the result using the formula:
result = b // x - (a - 1)// x
This formula calculates the number of times x goes into b, minus the number of times x goes into a-1.
The code then prints the result.
