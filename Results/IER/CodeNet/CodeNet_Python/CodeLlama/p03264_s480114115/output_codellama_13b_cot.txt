<<<Analysis>>>
The variable k is initialized to the integer value of the input, which is 3 in this case.
The variable k1 is initialized to the integer division of k by 2, which is 1.
The variable k2 is initialized to the difference between k and k1, which is 2.
The code then prints the product of k1 and k2, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
