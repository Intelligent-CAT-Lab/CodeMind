  <<<Analysis>>>
The input is a string of characters representing a logical expression. The code uses a dictionary tr to map each character to a corresponding integer value. The integer values are used to represent the logical operators and parentheses.
The code then splits the input string into a list of integers using the split() method.
The list of integers is then passed to the function evalor, which evaluates the logical expression.
The function evalor takes a list of integers as input and returns a tuple of two integers representing the minimum and maximum values of the expression.
The function push is used to push the values onto a stack.
The function andeval is used to evaluate the logical AND operator.
The function evalor is called recursively to evaluate the logical expression.
The final result is printed.
