<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function isPrime(n) that checks if a number n is prime. It does this by iterating through all the divisors of n, starting from 2, and checking if n is divisible by any of them. If it is, it returns False. If it reaches the end of the loop without finding any divisors, it returns True.
The code then takes an input X from the user and assigns it to the variable X.
The code then enters a loop that continues to increment X by 1 until it finds a prime number. It does this by calling the isPrime(X) function and checking if it returns True. If it does, it breaks out of the loop and prints the value of X.
