<<<Analysis>>>
The code first maps the input string "2 3 1 2" to four variables w, h, x, and y, respectively.
The variables w, h, x, and y are initialized to 2.0, 3.0, 1.0, and 2.0, respectively.
The code then calculates the midpoint of the rectangle, which is (w/2, h/2) = (1.0, 1.5).
The code then initializes an empty list res and appends the area of the rectangle to it.
The area of the rectangle is w*h/2 = 3.0.
The code then checks if the point (x, y) is at the midpoint of the rectangle.
Since x=1.0 and y=2.0, the condition is not met, and the code appends 0 to res.
Finally, the code prints the first and second elements of res, which are 3.0 and 0, respectively.
<<<Output>>>
3.0 0
