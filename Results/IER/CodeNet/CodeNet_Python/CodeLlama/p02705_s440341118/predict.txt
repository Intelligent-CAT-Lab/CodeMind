  The output of the code is:

C) Hello, Alice!
   Hello, Bob!

The code defines a function called greet that takes a string as an argument and prints a greeting message. The function is then called twice with different arguments, once with "Alice" and once with "Bob". Therefore, the output of the code is two greeting messages, one for each argument passed to the function.
