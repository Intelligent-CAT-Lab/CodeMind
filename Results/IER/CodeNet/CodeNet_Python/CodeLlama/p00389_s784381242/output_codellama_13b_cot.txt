<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs N and K from the user.
The variable ans is initialized to 1, which will be used to store the final answer.
The variable s is initialized to 1, which will be used to store the sum of the numbers considered so far.
The variable N is decremented by 1, which means that the code will consider numbers from 1 to N (inclusive).
The code enters a while loop that iterates until N is less than the maximum number of numbers that can be considered given the current value of s and K.
For each iteration, the code calculates the maximum number of numbers that can be considered given the current value of s and K, which is (s+K-1) // K.
If N is less than this maximum number, the code breaks out of the loop.
If N is greater than or equal to the maximum number, the code adds the maximum number to s and subtracts it from N.
The code then increments ans by 1.
The code repeats this process until N is less than the maximum number.
The final value of ans is the number of iterations that the code performed.
