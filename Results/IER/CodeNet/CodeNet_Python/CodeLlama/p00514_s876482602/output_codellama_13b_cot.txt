  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three inputs n, m, and r.
The variable n is initialized to 2, variable m is initialized to 0, and variable r is initialized to 3.
The code then calculates a and b as follows:
a = n + r - n*m - 1 = 2 + 3 - 2*0 - 1 = 3
b = r - n*m = 3 - 2*0 = 3
The code then calculates s as follows:
s = 1
If a < b or a < 0 or b < 0, s is set to 0.
If b > a - b, b is set to a - b.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to b (exclusive) and calculates s as follows:
s = s * (a - i) // (i + 1)
The loop finishes and the code prints the final value of s, which is 1.
