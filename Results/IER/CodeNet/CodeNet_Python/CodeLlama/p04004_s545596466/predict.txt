The output of the code will depend on the input given. In this case, the input is 1 1 1, which means that N=1, M=1, and K=1.
The code will then perform the calculations using the arrays defined above, and print the output.

Since the code is using modular arithmetic, the output will be a number between 0 and MOD-1, inclusive.

It's difficult to predict the exact output without knowing the values of the arrays and the calculations performed by the code.

However, based on the code, it's likely that the output will be a number that is a function of N, M, and K, and the values of the arrays defined in the code.

It's also possible that the output will be a number that is a function of the input given to the code, and the values of the arrays defined in the code.

In any case, the output will be a number between 0 and MOD-1, inclusive.
