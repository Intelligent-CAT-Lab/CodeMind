  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user in the form of two integers x and y, separated by a space.
The variables x and y are then initialized to the values of the input.
The code then initializes a variable result to 0.
The code then checks the value of x and y and adds the corresponding values to the result variable.
If x is 1, the code adds 300000 to the result.
If x is 2, the code adds 200000 to the result.
If x is 3, the code adds 100000 to the result.
If y is 1, the code adds 300000 to the result.
If y is 2, the code adds 200000 to the result.
If y is 3, the code adds 100000 to the result.
If x and y are both 1, the code adds 400000 to the result.
Finally, the code prints the value of the result variable.
<<<Output>>>
400000
