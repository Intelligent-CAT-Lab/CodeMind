<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input n from the user.
The variable c is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of the values of the loop.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (exclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 2.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the value of the expression (n - 1) // i and adds it to c.
The expression (n - 1) // i is equivalent to the integer division of (n - 1) by i.
The loop finishes when i reaches n, and the code prints the final value of c, which is 1.
