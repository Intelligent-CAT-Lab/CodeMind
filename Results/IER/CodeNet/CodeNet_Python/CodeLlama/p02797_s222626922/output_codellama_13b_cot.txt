<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in three inputs: n, k, and s.
n is set to 4, k is set to 2, and s is set to 3.
The variable num is set to 998245637.
The variable arr is set to [s] * k, which is [3] * 2 = [3, 3].
The variable arr2 is set to [num] * (n-k), which is [998245637] * (4-2) = [998245637, 998245637].
The code then prints the concatenation of arr and arr2, which is [3, 3, 998245637, 998245637].
<<<Output>>>
3 3 998245637 998245637
