  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first converts the input string to a numpy array of integers, where each integer represents the ASCII code of the corresponding character.
The code then calls the function "suffix_array" with the input array and an upper bound of 25.
The function "suffix_array" performs a suffix array construction algorithm on the input array, which is a linear time algorithm that constructs an array of suffixes of the input string in lexicographic order.
The function "induce" is then called with the input array, the suffix array, and some additional parameters.
The function "induce" performs a linear time algorithm that computes the longest common prefix (LCP) array of the suffixes in the suffix array.
The LCP array is then used to compute the answer to the problem.

<<<Output>>>
The output of the code is the number of distinct substrings in the input string.
In this case, the input string is "abcbcba", and the output is 6.
