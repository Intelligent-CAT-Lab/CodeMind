<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input string S from the user.
It then initializes a variable a to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the length of the string S.
For each index i in the range of the length of S, the code checks if i is even or odd.
If i is even, the code checks if the character at index i in S is 'L'. If it is, it adds 1 to a.
If i is odd, the code checks if the character at index i in S is 'R'. If it is, it adds 1 to a.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if a is equal to 0. If it is, it prints 'Yes'. Otherwise, it prints 'No'.
<<<Output>>>
No
