<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function MI() that returns a map object with the input values converted to integers.
The code then calls the MI() function and assigns the return value to the variables N, X, and T.
The code then checks if N is divisible by X, and if it is not, it calculates the answer as (N//X+1)*T.
If N is divisible by X, the code calculates the answer as N//X*T.
The code then prints the answer.
