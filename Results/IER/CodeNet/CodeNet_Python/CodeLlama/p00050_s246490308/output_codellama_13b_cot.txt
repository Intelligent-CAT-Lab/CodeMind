<<<Analysis>>>
The code first replaces all occurrences of "apple" with "???".
Then it replaces all occurrences of "peach" with "apple".
Finally, it replaces all occurrences of "???" with "peach".
The output of the code is the input string with all occurrences of "apple" and "peach" replaced as described above.
