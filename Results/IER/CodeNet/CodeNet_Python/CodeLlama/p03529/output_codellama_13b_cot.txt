  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs N and K from the user.
It then initializes a list lis with 3300 elements, all set to 0.
The list lis[0] is set to 1.

The code then enters a loop that iterates from N to 0, decrementing i by 1 each time.
For each iteration, the code initializes a new list nlis with 3300 elements, all set to 0.

The code then enters a nested loop that iterates from K+1 to 0, decrementing j by 1 each time.
For each iteration, the code enters a nested loop that iterates from 3300 to 0, decrementing last by 1 each time.

The code checks if i is less than j, and if so, it adds lis[last] to nlis[last] and takes the modulo of 10^9+7.
The code also checks if (last+j)//i + last is less than 3300, and if so, it adds lis[last] to nlis[last+(last+j)//i] and takes the modulo of 10^9+7.

After the nested loops finish, the code sets lis to nlis.

The code then calculates ans as K * (K+1) // 2 * pow(K+1,N-1,mod) * N.
It then subtracts lis[i] * i from ans for each i in the range 3300.
Finally, the code prints ans.

<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will depend on the input given by the user.
If the input is 2 2, the output will be 10.
