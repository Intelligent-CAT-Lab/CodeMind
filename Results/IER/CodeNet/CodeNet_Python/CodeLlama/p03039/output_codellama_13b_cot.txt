  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes in three inputs n, m, and k.
The variable n is initialized to 2, m is initialized to 2, and k is initialized to 2.
The variable ans is initialized to 0.
The variable INF is initialized to 10^9+7.
The code then checks if n is less than or equal to m.
If n is less than or equal to m, the code calculates the value of M and Ms.
M is calculated as -(m-1)*m*(2*m-1)//3+m*m*(m-1)
Ms is calculated as m*m*(m-1)//2-(m-1)*m*(2*m-1)//6
M and Ms are both modulo INF.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n+1.
For each value of i in this range, the code enters another loop that iterates from i to n+1.
For each value of j in this range, the code calculates the value of d as j-i.
If i is equal to j, the code adds Ms to ans.
If i is not equal to j, the code adds d*m^2+M to ans.
The code then takes the modulo of INF of ans.
If n is greater than m, the code swaps the values of n and m and repeats the same process.
The code then calculates the value of ans using the formula (n*m-2)!/(n*m-k)!*(k-2)!*ans.
The code then takes the modulo of INF of ans.
The code finally prints the value of ans.
