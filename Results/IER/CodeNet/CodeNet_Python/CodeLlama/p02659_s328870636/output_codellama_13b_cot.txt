The code first imports the Decimal class from the decimal module.
The input is then split into two variables, a and b, using the split() method.
The variable a is converted to an integer using the int() method.
The variable b is converted to a Decimal object using the Decimal() constructor.
The product of a and b is calculated using the multiplication operator and converted to an integer using the int() method.
The final result is then printed using the print() function.
