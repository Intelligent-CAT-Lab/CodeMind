  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input string as a parameter and assigns it to the variable s.
The length of the string is then calculated and assigned to the variable n.
The variables rc, lc, and p are initialized to 0.
The variable state is initialized to 1, which indicates that the current state is "R".
The variable ans is initialized to a list of n zeros.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the characters of the input string.
For each character, the code checks the current state and updates the variables rc, lc, and p accordingly.
If the current state is "R", the code checks if the current character is "R". If it is, it increments rc by 1. If the next character is "L", it updates the values of ans[i] and ans[i+1] based on the values of rc and p.
If the current state is "L", the code checks if the current character is "L". If it is, it increments lc by 1. If the current character is the last character of the input string or the next character is "R", it updates the values of ans[p+1] and ans[p] based on the values of lc and p.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final values of ans.
<<<Output>>>
[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
