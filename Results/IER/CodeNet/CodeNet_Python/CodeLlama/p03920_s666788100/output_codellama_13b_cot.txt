<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input n from the user.
The variable m is initialized to 0, which will be used to keep track of the sum of the numbers from 1 to n.
The variable tmp is initialized to 0, which will be used to keep track of the current number being added to m.
The code enters a while loop that iterates as long as m is less than n.
For each iteration, the code adds 1 to tmp and adds tmp to m.
The loop stops when m is greater than or equal to n.
The code then enters a for loop that iterates from 1 to tmp+1.
For each iteration, the code checks if m-n is equal to the current iteration number i.
If it is not, the code prints the current iteration number i.
The loop stops when i reaches tmp+1.
