<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input n from the user.
The code then checks if n is odd or even using the modulo operator (%).
If n is odd, the code calculates the sum of the first half of the numbers from 1 to n (including n) and stores it in s.
If n is even, the code calculates the sum of the first half of the numbers from 1 to n (excluding n) and stores it in s.
The code then prints the value of s.
