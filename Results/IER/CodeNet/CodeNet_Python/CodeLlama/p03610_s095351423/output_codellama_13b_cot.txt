 
The output of the code is:

Hello, Alice!

Explanation:

The code defines a function called `greet` that takes a single argument `name`. The function returns a string that says "Hello, " followed by the value of the `name` argument, and then a exclamation mark.

The code then calls the `greet` function with the argument "Alice", which is passed to the `name` parameter of the function. The function returns the string "Hello, Alice!", which is then printed to the console using the `print` function.

Therefore, the output of the code is the string "Hello, Alice!".
