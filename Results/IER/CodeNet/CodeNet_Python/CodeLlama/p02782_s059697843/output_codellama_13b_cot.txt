  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes in four integers as input, r1, c1, r2, and c2, and stores them in variables with the same names.
The code then defines two functions: get_euclidian and get_combi.
get_euclidian is a recursive function that calculates the greatest common divisor of two integers using the Euclidean algorithm.
get_combi is a function that calculates the number of combinations of n items taken r at a time.
The code then initializes an array F with the values of the factorials of the integers from 1 to r2 + c2 + 2.
The code then calculates the number of combinations of r2 + c2 + 2 items taken r2 + 1 at a time, and stores the result in combi1.
The code then calculates the number of combinations of r2 + c2 + 1 items taken c1 at a time, and stores the result in combi2.
The code then calculates the number of combinations of r1 + c2 + 1 items taken r1 at a time, and stores the result in combi3.
The code then calculates the number of combinations of r1 + c1 items taken r1 at a time, and stores the result in combi4.
The code then prints the difference between combi1, combi2, combi3, and combi4, and adds the result to L (which is 10^9 + 7) and takes the modulo of the result with L.
