  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes two inputs a and b from the user.
The code then initializes a variable cnt to 0.
The code then checks if a is greater than 1 and if so, it calculates the number of combinations of 2 elements from a using the cmb function.
The code then checks if b is greater than 1 and if so, it calculates the number of combinations of 2 elements from b using the cmb function.
The code then prints the value of cnt.
<<<Output>>>
