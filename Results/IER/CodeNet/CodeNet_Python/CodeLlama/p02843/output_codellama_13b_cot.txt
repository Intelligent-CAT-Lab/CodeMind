<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input N as an integer.
It then calculates the quotient and remainder of N divided by 100 using the divmod function.
The quotient is stored in q and the remainder is stored in mod.
The code then prints 1 if the remainder is less than or equal to the product of the quotient and 5, and 0 otherwise.
