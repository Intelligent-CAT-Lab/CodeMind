  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module, which is used to exit the program if the input is invalid.
The code then maps the input to variables W, a, and b, which are the weight of the package, the weight of the first box, and the weight of the second box, respectively.
The code then checks if the input is valid by checking if W, a, and b are within the range [0, 100000]. If any of them are not, the code exits.
The code then initializes a variable move to 0.
The code then checks if the weight of the package plus the weight of the first box is less than the weight of the second box. If it is, the code sets move to the difference between the weight of the second box and the weight of the package plus the weight of the first box.
The code then checks if the weight of the package plus the weight of the first box is greater than the weight of the second box and less than the weight of the package plus the weight of the second box. If it is, the code sets move to 0.
The code then checks if the weight of the first box is greater than the weight of the second box and less than the weight of the package plus the weight of the second box. If it is, the code sets move to 0.
The code then checks if the weight of the first box is greater than the weight of the package plus the weight of the second box. If it is, the code sets move to the difference between the weight of the first box and the weight of the package plus the weight of the second box.
The code then prints the value of move.
