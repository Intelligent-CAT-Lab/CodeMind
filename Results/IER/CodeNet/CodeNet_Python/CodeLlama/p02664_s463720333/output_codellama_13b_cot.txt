  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module and sets the recursion limit to 10^7. It then defines two constants, f_inf, which is set to infinity, and mod, which is set to 10^9 + 7.
The code then defines a function called resolve, which takes no arguments.
The function first takes input from the user and stores it in a variable called t.
The function then replaces all occurrences of "?" in t with "D" and stores the result in a variable called res.
Finally, the function prints the value of res.

The code then checks if the module name is "__main__" and if it is, it calls the resolve function.
