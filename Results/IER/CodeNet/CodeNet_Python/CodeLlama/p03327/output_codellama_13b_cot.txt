The code first checks if the variable __name__ is equal to "__main__", which is the name of the module when it is run as a script. If it is, it means that the code is being run directly and not imported as a module.
The code then reads an integer input from the user and stores it in the variable n.
The code then checks if the value of n is less than 1000. If it is, it prints "ABC". If it is not, it prints "ABD".
<<<Output>>>
ABC
