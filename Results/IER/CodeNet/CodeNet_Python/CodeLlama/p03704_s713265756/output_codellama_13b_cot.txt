  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module and defines the input function as sys.stdin.readline.
The code then reads an integer D from the input and initializes two lists, memo_F and memo_T, to store the number of ways to express D as a sum of two positive integers with no leading zeros and with leading zeros, respectively.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 10, meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 10.
For each number x in this range, the code enters another loop that iterates from 1 to 10, meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 10.
For each number y in this range, the code calculates the number of ways to express y-x as a sum of two positive integers with no leading zeros and with leading zeros, respectively, and stores the results in memo_T and memo_F, respectively.
The code then defines a recursive function F that takes three arguments: K, D, and allow_leading_zero.
If K is 0, the function returns 1 if D is 0, and 0 otherwise.
If K is 1, the function returns 0 if D is not 0, and 10 if allow_leading_zero is True, and 9 otherwise.
If K is greater than 1, the function calculates the number of ways to express D as a sum of two positive integers with no leading zeros and with leading zeros, respectively, and returns the sum of these values.
The code then defines a list comprehension that iterates from 1 to 20 and applies the F function to each value of K, with D set to 63 and allow_leading_zero set to False.
The code then prints the sum of the values returned by the F function.
