  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input from the user and stores it in the variable x.
The variable A is then initialized to the list of words in the input string, which is obtained by splitting the input string at spaces.
The code then initializes two empty lists, S and L, to store the counts and lengths of the words in A, respectively.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the words in A. For each word i, it calculates the count of i in A and appends it to S. It also calculates the length of i and appends it to L.
The code then finds the maximum count and length in S and L, respectively, and stores them in M and m, respectively.
The code then finds the index of the maximum count in S and the index of the maximum length in L, and stores them in Y and y, respectively.
Finally, the code prints the word at index Y in A and the word at index y in A.
