  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the numpy library and defines two variables A and B as integers.
The code then defines a variable M as 10^9+7 and a variable U as 2001.
The code then initializes a matrix C of size UxU with all elements set to 0.
The code then sets the element C[0,0] to 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to U (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 2001.
For each number n in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
