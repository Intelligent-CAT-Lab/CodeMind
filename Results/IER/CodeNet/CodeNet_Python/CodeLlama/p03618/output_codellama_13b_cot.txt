  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports several modules from the Python standard library, including sys, fractions, itertools, and collections.
It then sets the recursion limit to 10^5 using sys.setrecursionlimit().
The code then takes input from the user and stores it in a variable called s.
The code then sorts the input string using sorted() and stores the result in a variable called s.
The code then uses groupby() from the itertools module to group the sorted string into substrings of consecutive identical characters.
The code then uses len() to get the length of the sorted string and stores it in a variable called l.
The code then calculates the number of possible pairs of characters in the string using the formula (l * (l - 1)) // 2 + 1.
The code then iterates over the groups of consecutive identical characters using a for loop and calculates the number of pairs of characters in each group using the formula p * (p - 1) // 2.
The code then subtracts the number of pairs of characters in each group from the total number of possible pairs of characters in the string.
The code then prints the final result, which is the number of pairs of characters that are not consecutive in the input string.
<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will depend on the input string.
If the input string is "aatt", the output will be 3, since there are 3 pairs of characters that are not consecutive in the string: "aa", "tt", and "a".
