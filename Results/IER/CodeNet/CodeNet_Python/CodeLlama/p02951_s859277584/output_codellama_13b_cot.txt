<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in three integers as input, a, b, and c, and stores them in variables a, b, and c, respectively.
The code then calculates d = c - (a - b) and stores it in variable d.
The condition d < 0 is checked, and if it is true, the code prints 0. Otherwise, it prints d.
<<<Output>>>
