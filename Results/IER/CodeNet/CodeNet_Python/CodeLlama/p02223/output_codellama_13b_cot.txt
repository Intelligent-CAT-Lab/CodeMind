The code first takes input from the user and stores it in the variable n.
The code then checks the value of n and performs different actions based on the value of n.
If n is equal to 1, the code prints "1\n0" (without quotes).
If n is equal to 2, the code prints "2\n0\n11" (without quotes).
If n is greater than 2, the code prints n-1 (without quotes) and then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n-2.
For each iteration, the code prints "1" followed by "0" repeated n-2 times and then "1".
The loop finishes and the code prints a newline character.
