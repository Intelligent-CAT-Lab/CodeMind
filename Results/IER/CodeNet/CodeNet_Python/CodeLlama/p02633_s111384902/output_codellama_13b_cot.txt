<<<Analysis>>>
The variable x is initialized to 90, which is the input given to the code.
The variable n is initialized to 1, which will be used to count the number of times the loop iterates.
The code enters a loop that iterates while 360 * n % x is not equal to 0.
The condition is met when n is 3, which is the number of times the loop iterates.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of n * 360 // x, which is 360.
<<<Output>>>
360
