<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes input in the form of two integers X and Y separated by a space.
The code then calculates the absolute difference between X and Y, which is 1 in this case.
The code then checks if the absolute difference is less than 2, which is true in this case.
If the condition is met, the code prints "Brown". Otherwise, it prints "Alice".
<<<Output>>>
Brown
