  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports several libraries, including sys, itertools, and heapq. It then sets the recursion limit to 10^7 and defines some constants, including INF and MOD.
The code then reads in two integers, N and X, from standard input using the map function.
The code then defines two lists, l and p, which are initialized to 0. The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 50, and for each iteration, it calculates the value of l[i] and p[i] using the formulae l[i] = l[i - 1] * 2 + 3 and p[i] = p[i - 1] * 2 + 1.
The code then initializes a variable ans to 0 and enters a loop that iterates from N to 0, inclusive. For each iteration, the code checks if i is equal to 0 and X is greater than or equal to 1. If this is the case, the code increments ans by 1 and breaks out of the loop.
The code then checks if X is less than or equal to 1. If this is the case, the code breaks out of the loop.
The code then checks if X is less than or equal to l[i - 1] + 1. If this is the case, the code subtracts 1 from X and continues to the next iteration.
The code then checks if X is equal to l[i - 1] + 2. If this is the case, the code increments ans by 1 and subtracts 2 from X.
The code then checks if X is greater than l[i - 1] + 2. If this is the case, the code increments ans by p[i - 1] + 1 and subtracts l[i - 1] + 2 from X.
The code then prints the value of ans.
