  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first defines two functions: prime_factorize and solve.
prime_factorize takes an integer n as input and returns a list of its prime factors.
solve takes two integers A and B as input and calculates the number of distinct prime factors of their greatest common divisor (gcd).
The code then calls the solve function with the input 12 and 18.
The gcd of 12 and 18 is 6, and its prime factors are 2 and 3.
The code then calculates the number of distinct prime factors of 6, which is 2.
The code then prints the result, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>
