<<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the deque data structure from the collections module.
It then takes the input string "01B0" and converts it to a list of characters.
The code then initializes an empty deque called ans.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the list of characters in the input string.
For each character i in the input string, the code checks if i is equal to "B".
If i is equal to "B", the code checks if ans is empty. If it is, the code continues to the next iteration of the loop.
If ans is not empty, the code pops the last element from ans.
If i is not equal to "B", the code appends i to the end of ans.
After the loop finishes, the code joins the elements of ans into a string and prints it.
<<<Output>>>
"01"
