  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module and the gcd function from the fractions module.
The code then defines a main function that takes two integers as input, n and k, and splits them into a list of integers.
The code then initializes a variable ans to 0.
The code then checks if k is odd or even and performs the appropriate calculation.
If k is odd, the code calculates (n // k)**3, which is the same as n**3 // k**3.
If k is even, the code calculates (n // k)**3 + ((n + k // 2) // k)**3, which is the same as n**3 // k**3 + (n + k // 2)**3 // k**3.
The code then prints the final value of ans.
