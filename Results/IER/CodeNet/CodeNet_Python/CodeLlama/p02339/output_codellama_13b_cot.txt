  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports several modules, including bisect, collections, copy, heapq, itertools, math, string, and sys.
It then defines several functions, including I, F, SS, LI, LI_, LF, LSS, and resolve.
The resolve function is called, which takes two inputs, n and k, and calculates the number of ways to arrange n objects in k bins.
The code uses a dynamic programming approach to solve the problem.
It defines a 2D array dp, where dp[i][j] represents the number of ways to arrange the first i objects in j bins.
The code initializes dp[0][0] to 1, since there is only one way to arrange 0 objects in 0 bins.
It then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n-1, and for each iteration, it updates the values in dp[i+1][j+1] based on the values in dp[i][j].
The update rule is dp[i+1][j+1] = dp[i][j] + (j + 1) * dp[i][j+1].
The code then prints the final value of dp[-1][-1], which is the number of ways to arrange n objects in k bins.
