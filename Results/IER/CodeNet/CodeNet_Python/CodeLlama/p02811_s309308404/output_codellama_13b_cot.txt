<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, separated by a space.
The first integer is assigned to variable a, and the second integer is assigned to variable b.
The code then checks if 500 times a is greater than or equal to b.
Since 500 times 2 is 1000, and 1000 is greater than 900, the condition is met.
The code then prints 'Yes'.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
