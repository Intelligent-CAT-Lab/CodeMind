  <<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function gcd(a,b) that returns the greatest common divisor of a and b.
The function main() takes four integers as input and assigns them to variables a,b,c,d.
The code calculates the absolute difference between b and d, and the absolute difference between c and a, and assigns them to variables h and w, respectively.
The code checks if either h or w is equal to 0, and if so, returns 0.
If neither h nor w is equal to 0, the code calculates the greatest common divisor of the maximum and minimum of h and w, and assigns it to variable m.
The code returns h+w-m.
