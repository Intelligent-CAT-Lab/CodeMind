  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module and sets the recursion limit to 10000.
It then defines a function called main() which takes no arguments.
The main() function first takes input from the user and splits it into two variables a and b.
The function then defines another function called judge() which takes no arguments.
The judge() function iterates from 1 to 10000 and checks if the square of each number is equal to the sum of a and b.
If the condition is met, the function returns True, otherwise it returns False.
The main() function then calls the judge() function and checks if it returns True.
If it does, the function prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
