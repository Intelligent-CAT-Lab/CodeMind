<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function gcd(a, b) that returns the greatest common divisor of a and b. It uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the gcd.
The code then takes input from the user in the form of two numbers separated by a space. It stores the input in a list called num.
The code then calculates the product of the two numbers and divides it by their gcd.
The gcd is calculated using the gcd function defined earlier.
The code then prints the result.
