<<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module and the stdin object from it.
The code then reads a line from stdin and splits it into two integers using the split() method.
The first integer is stored in the variable n and the second integer is stored in the variable m.
The code then checks if the average of n and 1 is greater than or equal to m.
If it is, the code prints 'YES' to the console. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
<<<Output>>>
YES
