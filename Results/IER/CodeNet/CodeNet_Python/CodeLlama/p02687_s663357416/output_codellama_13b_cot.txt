<<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the math module, which is not used in the code.
The code then defines four functions: readInt, readInts, readChar, and readChars. These functions are used to read input from the user.
The code then reads a single character from the user using the readChar function and stores it in the variable s.
The code then checks if the value of s is equal to "ABC". If it is, the code prints "ARC". Otherwise, it prints "ABC".
<<<Output>>>
ABC
