<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, separated by a space.
The first integer is assigned to the variable ab, and the second integer is assigned to the variable bc.
The code then calculates the fare by adding the sum of ab and bc divided by 2.
The fare is then printed.

In this case, the input is 81 and 58, so the fare would be 81 + 58/2 = 141.
<<<Output>>>
141
