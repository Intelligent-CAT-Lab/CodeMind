  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the gcd function from the fractions module.
The code then maps the input string to three variables H, W, and T.
The code then calculates the greatest common divisor of H and T, and the greatest common divisor of W and T.
The code then calculates the values of h and w by dividing H and W by their respective greatest common divisors.
The code then calculates the value of the modulo 1000000007.
The code then prints the result of the pow function.
