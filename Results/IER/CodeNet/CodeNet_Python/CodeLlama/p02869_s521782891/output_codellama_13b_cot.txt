The code takes two inputs, n and k, from the user.
n is assigned the value 1, and k is assigned the value 1.
The code then calculates the values of s1, s2, s3, s4, s5, and s6 using the formulae:
s1 = k
s2 = k + n - 1 = 1 + 1 - 1 = 1
s3 = k + n = 1 + 1 = 2
s4 = k + 2*n - 1 = 1 + 2*1 - 1 = 1
s5 = k + 2*n = 1 + 2*1 = 3
s6 = k + 3*n - 1 = 1 + 3*1 - 1 = 2
The code then checks if the sum of s1 and s4 is less than or equal to the average of s5 and s6.
The sum of s1 and s4 is 2, and the average of s5 and s6 is (3+2)/2 = 2.5.
Since 2 is less than 2.5, the code enters the first if block.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n//2+n%2, which is 0 to 1.
For each iteration, the code calculates the values of a, b, and c using the formulae:
a = s1 + i*2 = 1 + 0*2 = 1
b = s4 - i = 1 - 0 = 1
c = s5 + n//2 + i = 3 + 0 + 0 = 3
The code then prints these values.
The loop iterates once, and the code prints (1, 1, 3).
The code then enters another loop that iterates from 0 to n//2, which is 0 to 0.
The loop does not iterate, and the code does not print anything.
The code then exits the if block and enters the else block.
The code prints -1.
