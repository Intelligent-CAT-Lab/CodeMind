The output of the code will depend on the input given by the user.
If the input is 2, the code will print -1 and exit.
If the input is 3, the code will print the first domino in the list of dominoes and exit.
If the input is greater than 3, the code will print a pattern of dots and dominoes, with the first domino in the list of dominoes at the top left corner of the pattern.
The pattern will have a total of n dots and dominoes, with each domino being 4 dots wide and 4 dots tall.
The pattern will be symmetric around the center of the pattern, with the first domino in the list of dominoes at the center of the pattern.
The pattern will be printed to the standard output.
