  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module, which is used to write to the standard output.
The code then defines a list of dominoes, which are represented as strings with newlines.
The code then replaces all spaces and newlines in the dominoes with empty strings, and splits each domino into a list of strings.
The code then defines a variable n, which is set to the input given by the user.
If the input is 2, the code prints -1 and exits.
If the input is 3, the code prints the first domino in the list of dominoes and exits.
The code then defines a variable col, which is set to 0.
The code then defines a function called write, which takes two arguments: ix and col.
The function writes the domino at index ix in the list of dominoes, starting from column col.
The function first writes n - col - (ix + 4) dots to the left of the domino, then the domino, and then n - col - (ix + 4) dots to the right of the domino.
The function then increments col by 4 + n % 4.
The code then calls the write function with arguments 0 and col.
The code then sets rem to n - col.
The code then enters a loop that continues until rem is 0.
In each iteration of the loop, the code calls the write function with arguments 0 and col.
The code then increments col by 4.
The code then decrements rem by 4.
The code then exits the loop.
The code then prints the final value of col.
<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will depend on the input given by the user.
If the input is 2, the code will print -1 and exit.
If the input is 3, the code will print the first domino in the list of dominoes and exit.
If the input is greater than 3, the code will print a pattern of dots and dominoes, with the first domino in the list of dominoes at the top left corner of the pattern.
The pattern will have a total of n dots and dominoes, with each domino being 4 dots wide and 4 dots tall.
The pattern will be symmetric around the center of the pattern, with the first domino in the list of dominoes at the center of the pattern.
The pattern will be printed to the standard output.
