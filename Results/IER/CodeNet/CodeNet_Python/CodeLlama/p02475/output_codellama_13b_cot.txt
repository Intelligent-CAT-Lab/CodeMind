<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes two integers as input using the map() function.
The first integer is stored in variable a and the second integer is stored in variable b.
The code then defines a function called round() that takes two integers as input.
The function checks if the product of the two integers is negative.
If it is, the function returns the negative of the integer division of the first integer by the second integer.
If the product is not negative, the function returns the integer division of the first integer by the second integer.
The code then calls the round() function with the two input integers and prints the result.
