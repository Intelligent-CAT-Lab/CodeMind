  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input N from the user.
The code then initializes a variable w to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 100,000.
For each iteration, the code calculates the sum of the first n natural numbers using the formula n(n+1)/2.
The code checks if the sum is less than N. If it is, the code updates the value of w to the current value of i + 1.
The code then breaks out of the loop.
The code then enters another loop that iterates from w to 0, decrementing by 1 each time.
For each iteration, the code checks if N is greater than or equal to the current value of i. If it is, the code prints the current value of i and updates N by subtracting i from it.
The code then breaks out of the loop.
The code then prints the final value of N.
