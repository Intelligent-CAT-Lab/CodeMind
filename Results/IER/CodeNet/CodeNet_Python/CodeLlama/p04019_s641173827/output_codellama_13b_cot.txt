<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input string SENW and converts it into a list of characters using the list() function.
It then converts the list of characters into a set of unique characters using the set() function.
The code then initializes four variables n, w, s, and e to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the length of the list of unique characters.
For each character in the list, it checks if the character is equal to 'N', 'W', 'S', or 'E'.
If the character is equal to 'N', the variable n is set to 1.
If the character is equal to 'W', the variable w is set to 1.
If the character is equal to 'S', the variable s is set to 1.
If the character is equal to 'E', the variable e is set to 1.
The code then creates a list called judge that contains the values of n, w, s, and e.
The code then checks if the list judge is equal to [1,0,1,0], [0,1,0,1], or [1,1,1,1].
If the list is equal to any of these values, the code prints 'Yes'.
If the list is not equal to any of these values, the code prints 'No'.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
