<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in four integers as input, which are assigned to variables a, b, c, and d.
The code then calculates the absolute difference between a and c, and between a and b.
The code checks if either of these differences is less than or equal to d.
If either of these conditions is true, the code prints "Y", otherwise it prints "Neos".
The code uses the ternary operator to perform this check and print the appropriate output.
<<<Output>>>
Y
