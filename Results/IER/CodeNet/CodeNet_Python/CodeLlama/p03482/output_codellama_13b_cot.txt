  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module and sets the recursion limit to 10^8. It then defines a few constants: mod, which is set to 10^9+7, and INF, which is set to 10^18.
The code then reads a line from standard input using the readline function and stores it in the variable S. It then calculates the length of S and stores it in the variable N.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the characters in S. For each character, it checks if it is equal to "1". If it is, it calculates the minimum of the current value of ans and the maximum of N-i-1 and i. If it is not equal to "1", it calculates the minimum of the current value of ans2 and the maximum of N-i-1 and i.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the maximum of ans and ans2.
