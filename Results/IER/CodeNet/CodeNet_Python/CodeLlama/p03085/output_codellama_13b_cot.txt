<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user and stores it in the variable b.
The code then checks if the value of b is equal to 'A', if it is, it prints 'T'.
If the value of b is not equal to 'A', the code checks if the value of b is equal to 'C', if it is, it prints 'G'.
If the value of b is not equal to 'C', the code checks if the value of b is equal to 'G', if it is, it prints 'C'.
If the value of b is not equal to 'G', the code prints 'A'.

Since the input is 'A', the code will print 'T'.
<<<Output>>>
T
