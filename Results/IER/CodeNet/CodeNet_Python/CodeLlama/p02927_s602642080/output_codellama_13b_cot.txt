The function solve() takes two arguments M and D.
The function first maps the input to integers M and D.
The function then initializes a variable ans to 0.
The function then enters a loop that iterates from 12 to D (inclusive).
For each number i in this range, it calculates the first and second digits of i and stores them in variables a and b, respectively.
The function then checks if a and b are both greater than 1.
If they are, the function checks if the product of a and b is less than or equal to M.
If both conditions are met, the function adds 1 to ans.
The function then returns the final value of ans.

The input given is 15 and 40.
The function will iterate from 12 to 40 (inclusive).
For each number i in this range, the function will calculate the first and second digits of i.
For example, for i=12, a=1 and b=2.
For i=13, a=1 and b=3.
For i=14, a=1 and b=4.
For i=15, a=1 and b=5.
For i=16, a=2 and b=6.
For i=17, a=2 and b=7.
For i=18, a=2 and b=8.
For i=19, a=2 and b=9.
For i=20, a=2 and b=0.
For i=21, a=3 and b=1.
For i=22, a=3 and b=2.
For i=23, a=3 and b=3.
For i=24, a=3 and b=4.
For i=25, a=3 and b=5.
For i=26, a=4 and b=6.
For i=27, a=4 and b=7.
For i=28, a=4 and b=8.
For i=29, a=4 and b=9.
For i=30, a=4 and b=0.
For i=31, a=5 and b=1.
For i=32, a=5 and b=2.
For i=33, a=5 and b=3.
For i=34, a=5 and b=4.
For i=35, a=5 and b=5.
For i=36, a=6 and b=6.
For i=37, a=6 and b=7.
For i=38, a=6 and b=8.
For i=39, a=6 and b=9.
For i=40, a=6 and b=0.

The function will add 1 to ans for the following numbers: 12, 13, 14, 15, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45.
The function will return the final value of ans, which is 16.
