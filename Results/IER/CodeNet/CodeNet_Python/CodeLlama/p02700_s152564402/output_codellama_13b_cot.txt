  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes in four integers A, B, C, and D as input.
The code then enters an infinite loop.
In each iteration, the code subtracts B from C and checks if C is less than or equal to 0. If it is, the code prints "Yes" and breaks out of the loop.
The code then subtracts D from A and checks if A is less than or equal to 0. If it is, the code prints "No" and breaks out of the loop.
The code continues to iterate until one of the conditions is met.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
