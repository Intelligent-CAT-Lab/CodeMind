<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes the variables r, D, and x to 2, 10, and 20, respectively.
The code then enters a loop that iterates 10 times.
For each iteration, the code calculates x = r * x - D, where r is the current value of r, x is the current value of x, and D is the current value of D.
The code then prints the value of x.
The loop will terminate when the value of x becomes 0.
