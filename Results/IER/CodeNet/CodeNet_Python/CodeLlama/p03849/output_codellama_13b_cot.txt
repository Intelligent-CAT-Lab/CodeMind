  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first initializes the variable MOD to 10^9 + 7, which is a large prime number used for modular arithmetic.
The variable n is initialized to the input value, which is 3 in this case.
The variable dp is a 2D array of size 61x3, which is initialized to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 59 to 0 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 59 to 0.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if the current number i is odd or even. If it is odd, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 3,1,5,7,9,13,15,17,19,25,27,29,31,35,37,39,43,45,47,49,53,55,57,59.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
