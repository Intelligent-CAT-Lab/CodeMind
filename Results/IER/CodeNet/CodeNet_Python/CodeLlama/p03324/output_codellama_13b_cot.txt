<<<Analysis>>>
The code first maps the input to two variables D and N, where D is an integer and N is also an integer.
The code then calculates the result of the expression 100 ** D * N, which is the same as 100 ** D * (N + 1) if N is equal to 100.
The code then prints the result of the expression.
<<<Output>>>
500
