  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first defines two functions, i1 and i2, which return the integer value of the input and the list of integers, respectively.
The code then defines a variable mod, which is equal to 10^9+7.
The code then defines a function bp, which takes two arguments, a and n, and returns the value of a^n modulo mod.
The code then takes two inputs, n and k, using the i2 function.
If n is less than or equal to k, the code calculates the value of x and y using the following formulae:
x = (2n-1-i) * x * (i+1) mod mod
y = (n-1-i) * (n-i) * y mod mod
The code then calculates the value of x * bp(y, 10^9+5) modulo mod and prints the result.
If n is greater than k, the code calculates the value of x and y using the following formulae:
x = x + y * c * c mod mod
y = (n-1-i) * (n-i) * y mod mod
The code then calculates the value of bp(t, 10^9+5) and multiplies it by c^2, where c is the value of bp(t, 10^9+5).
The code then prints the result of x.
<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will depend on the input values of n and k.
If n is less than or equal to k, the output will be a single integer value.
If n is greater than k, the output will be a list of integers.
