  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module and reads the input from stdin.
The variable N is initialized to 2, which is the input given.
The code then initializes four lists: dp1, Dp1, dp2, and Dp2.
The lists are initialized with 0s and have a length of N+3.
The code then sets the values of dp1[0], Dp1[0], dp2[0], and Dp2[0] to 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 3 to N+1.
For each iteration, the code calculates the values of dp1[i], dp2[i], Dp1[i], and Dp2[i].
The code then updates the values of dp1[i], dp2[i], Dp1[i], and Dp2[i] using the previous values.
The code then prints the value of (Dp1[N-1] + Dp2[N-1]) % MOD.
