<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, x and t, and stores them in variables x and t, respectively.
The code then calculates the difference between x and t, which is x-t.
The code then checks if the difference is less than 0, and if it is, it prints 0. Otherwise, it prints the difference.
In this case, x is 100 and t is 17, so the difference is 83.
<<<Output>>>
83
