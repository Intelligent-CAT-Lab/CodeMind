  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first sets the recursion limit to 1000000 and imports the necessary libraries.
It then defines a function called func, which takes three arguments: S, index, and cnt.
The function first checks if the index is equal to 20, and if so, it calculates the answer based on the current state of the string S.
If the current state of S is not valid (i.e., the sum of the digits is greater than N), it returns 0.
Otherwise, it calculates the answer by iterating over all possible values for the remaining digits in S and adding them to the current answer.
The function then returns the final answer.

The code then sets the input N to the user input and initializes an empty string S with 20 '?' characters.
It then calls the func function with the initial state of S and prints the final answer.

<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will depend on the input given to the program.
If the input is 5124, the output will be 0, since the sum of the digits in the input is greater than N.
