  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first maps the input to variables W, H, w, h, x, and y.
The code then checks if the center of the rectangle with width w and height h is within the bounds of the rectangle with width W and height H.
If it is, the code prints the ratio of y to x and quits.
If it is not, the code adjusts the position of the rectangle to be within the bounds of the larger rectangle.
The code then prints the ratio of y to x and quits.
