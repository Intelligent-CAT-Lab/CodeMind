  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in 7 integers as input and assigns them to variables i, o, t, j, l, s, and z.
The code then initializes a variable ans to the value of o.
The code then adds the value of i to ans, but only if i is even.
The code then adds the value of l to ans, but only if l is even.
The code then adds the value of j to ans, but only if j is even.
The code then checks if the sum of the remainders of i, j, and l when divided by 2 is equal to 3. If it is, the code adds 3 to ans.
The code then checks if the sum of the remainders of i, j, and l when divided by 2 is equal to 2. If it is, the code checks if the product of i, j, and l is positive. If it is, the code adds 1 to ans.
The code then prints the value of ans.
