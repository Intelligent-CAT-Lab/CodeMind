<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in four integers A, B, C, and D as input.
The while loop iterates as long as A and C are both positive.
In each iteration, the code subtracts B from C and checks if C is now non-positive. If it is, the code prints "Yes" and breaks out of the loop.
The code then subtracts D from A and checks if A is now non-positive. If it is, the code prints "No" and breaks out of the loop.
The loop will continue until one of the conditions is met, at which point the code will print "Yes" or "No" and break out of the loop.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
