  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input N from the user.
The function make_divisors(n) is defined, which takes an integer n as input and returns a list of its divisors.
The function make_divisors(N-1) is called and stored in the variable Nod.
The function make_divisors(N) is called and stored in the variable divs.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the elements of the list divs.
For each element d in divs, the code checks if d is a divisor of N.
If d is a divisor of N, the code appends d to the list Nod and breaks out of the loop.
The code then prints the length of the list Nod minus 1.
