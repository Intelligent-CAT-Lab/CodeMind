  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string input S and calculates the number of ways to arrange the balls in the boxes.
The code uses dynamic programming to solve the problem.
The code first initializes the list lis to [0] * (2*N+1) and sets lis[0] to 1.
The code then iterates over the string S and calculates the number of red and blue balls.
The code then updates the list lis using the recurrence relation.
The code then prints the sum of the elements in the list lis modulo 998244353.
