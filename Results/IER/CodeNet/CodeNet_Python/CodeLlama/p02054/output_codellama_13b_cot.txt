  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the necessary modules and sets the recursion limit to 200000.
It then defines a function main() that takes no arguments.
The function first reads in three integers A, B, and C from standard input using the function mi().
The function then checks if the product of A and B is even and if the product of B and C is even and if the product of C and A is even.
If all three conditions are true, the function prints "Tem" to standard output. Otherwise, it prints "Hom".
The function then calls the main() function.
<<<Output>>>
Hom
