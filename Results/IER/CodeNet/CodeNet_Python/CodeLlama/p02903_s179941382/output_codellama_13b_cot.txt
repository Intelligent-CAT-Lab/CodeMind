  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module and defines a function called input that reads a line from the standard input and removes the trailing newline character.
The code then defines a function called main that takes no arguments.
The main function first maps the input to four variables h, w, a, and b using the map function.
The code then initializes an empty list called S.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to b-1 (inclusive).
For each iteration, the code appends a string of a ones followed by a string of w-a zeros to the list S.
The code then enters another loop that iterates from 0 to h-b-1 (inclusive).
For each iteration, the code appends a string of a zeros followed by a string of w-a ones to the list S.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to h-1 (inclusive).
For each iteration, the code prints the string at index i of the list S.
The code then checks if the name of the main function is equal to '__main__'.
If it is, the code calls the main function.
