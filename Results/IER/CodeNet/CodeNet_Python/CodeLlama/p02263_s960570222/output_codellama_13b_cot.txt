  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first initializes an empty list called stack.
It then enters a loop that iterates over the input string, which is "1 2 +".
For each token in the input string, it checks if the token is an operator (+, -, *).
If it is, it pops the top two elements from the stack, which are 1 and 2 in this case.
It then calculates the result of the operation using eval() and appends the result to the stack.
The loop continues until the input string is exhausted.
Finally, the code joins the elements of the stack into a string and prints it.
