  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input string and converts it into a list using the list() function.
The list is then converted into a set using the set() function, which removes any duplicates.
The length of the set is then checked using the len() function.
If the length is 4, the code prints "Yes".
If the length is 3, the code prints "No".
If the length is 2, the code checks if the set contains either "N" and "S" or "E" and "W". If it does, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
If the length is any other value, the code prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
