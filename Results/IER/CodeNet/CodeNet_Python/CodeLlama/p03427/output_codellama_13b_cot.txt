<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user and stores it in the variable n.
The code then calculates the maximum of two expressions:
1. int(n[0])-1+9*(len(n)-1)
2. sum([int(i) for i in n])

The first expression calculates the maximum value that can be obtained by subtracting 1 from the first digit of the input number and multiplying the result by 9, and then adding the length of the input number minus 1.
The second expression calculates the sum of the digits of the input number.
The code then prints the maximum of these two expressions.

<<<Output>>>
100
