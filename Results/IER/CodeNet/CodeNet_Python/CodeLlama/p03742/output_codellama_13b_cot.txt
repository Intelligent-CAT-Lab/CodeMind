<<<Analysis>>>
The code first maps the input to two variables a and b using the map() function.
The input is split into two parts using the split() function.
The first part is converted to an integer using the int() function and stored in variable a.
The second part is also converted to an integer using the int() function and stored in variable b.
The code then calculates the absolute difference between a and b using the abs() function.
The code then checks if the absolute difference is greater than 1. If it is, it prints 'Alice'. Otherwise, it prints 'Brown'.
<<<Output>>>
Brown
