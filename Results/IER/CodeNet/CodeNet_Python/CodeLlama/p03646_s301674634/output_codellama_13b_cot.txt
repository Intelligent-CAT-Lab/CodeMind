  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module and defines a function main().
The function main() takes no arguments and reads a line of input from stdin using the readline() method of the sys.stdin object.
The input is then converted to an integer using the int() function and stored in the variable K.
The variable N is then set to the maximum of 2 and the minimum of 50 and K.
The variable ans is then initialized to a list of N elements, where each element is the sum of the corresponding element in the range(N) and K//N.
The variable m is then set to K%N.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to m-1.
For each iteration, the code enters another loop that iterates from 0 to N-1.
For each iteration of the inner loop, the code checks if i==j. If it is, the element at index j in the ans list is incremented by N. Otherwise, the element at index j is decremented by 1.
Finally, the code prints the value of N and the elements of the ans list.
