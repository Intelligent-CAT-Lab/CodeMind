  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first defines a lambda function ceil that takes two arguments a and b and returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to a/b.
The code then reads in three integers K, A, and B from the input and stores them in variables with the same names.
The code checks if A is greater than or equal to K, and if so, it prints 1 and exits.
The code then checks if A is less than or equal to B, and if so, it prints -1 and exits.
The code then calculates the difference between A and B, which is stored in the variable p.
The code then calculates the value of the expression ceil(K - A, A - B) and multiplies it by 2.
The code then prints the final value of ans.
