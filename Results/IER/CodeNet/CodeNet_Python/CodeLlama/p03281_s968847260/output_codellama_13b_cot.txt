  <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized to 105.
The function divisor(n) is defined, which takes an integer n as input and returns the number of divisors of n.
The function works by iterating from 1 to âˆšn (inclusive), and checking if each number i is a divisor of n. If it is, it appends i and n/i to a list called table. The function then returns the length of the list table.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), and for each number i, it checks if the number of divisors of i is equal to 8. If it is, it increments the variable answer by 1.
The loop finishes and the code prints the final value of answer, which is 1.
