<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input n and k from the user.
It then checks if k is greater than n. If it is, it prints 0 and quits.
If k is not greater than n, it initializes ans to 1.
It then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to k-1.
For each iteration, it multiplies ans by (n-i) and divides it by i.
It then takes the modulo of 1000000007 of the result.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans.
