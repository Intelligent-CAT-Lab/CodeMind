  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the deque data structure from the collections module.
The variable K is initialized to the input value 15.
The code then initializes a deque object called que with the values 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.
The code then enters a loop that iterates K times.
For each iteration, the code pops the first element from the deque and stores it in a.
The code then checks if the last digit of a is not equal to 0. If it is not, it appends the value of a multiplied by 10 plus the last digit of a minus 1 to the deque.
The code then appends the value of a multiplied by 10 plus the last digit of a to the deque.
The code then checks if the last digit of a is not equal to 9. If it is not, it appends the value of a multiplied by 10 plus the last digit of a plus 1 to the deque.
The code then prints the value of a.

The output of the code will be the value of a after the last iteration of the loop.
