<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, n and m, and stores them in variables n and m, respectively.
The code then checks if n and m are equal to 1, and if so, prints 1.
If n and m are not equal to 1, the code checks if the smaller of n and m is equal to 1. If it is, the code prints the larger of n and m minus 2.
If neither of the above conditions are met, the code prints the product of n minus 2 and m minus 2.

In this case, the input is 2 2, so n is 2 and m is 2. The code does not meet the first condition, so it checks the second condition. The smaller of n and m is 2, so the code prints the larger of n and m minus 2, which is 2-2=0.
