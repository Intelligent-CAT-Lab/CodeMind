The code first takes an integer input N from the user.
The variable hon is initialized to the last digit of N, which is 6 in this case.
The code then checks if hon is in the list [2, 4, 5, 7, 9], which it is not.
The code then checks if hon is in the list [0, 1, 6, 8], which it is.
The code then prints the string "pon".
<<<Output>>>
