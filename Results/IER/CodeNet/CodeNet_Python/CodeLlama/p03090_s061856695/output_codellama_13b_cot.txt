  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input from the user and stores it in the variable num.
The variable check_list is initialized to a list of 0s with length num*num.
The function make_bridge is defined, which takes two integers island1 and island2 as input and updates the check_list accordingly.
The code then checks if num is even or odd and stores the result in the variable sum_pair.
The code then enters a nested loop that iterates over the range [0, num-1] and [0, i-1] for each value of i.
If the sum of the two indices is not equal to sum_pair, the corresponding element in the check_list is set to 1.
The code then initializes a variable bridge_num to 0 and enters another loop that iterates over the range [0, num*num-1].
If the corresponding element in the check_list is 1, the variable bridge_num is incremented.
The code then prints the value of bridge_num.
The code then enters another loop that iterates over the range [0, num*num-1] and prints the indices of the elements in the check_list that are 1.
<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will depend on the input given to the code.
If the input is 3, the output will be 3.
The code will print the indices of the elements in the check_list that are 1, which are (1,1), (1,2), and (2,1).
