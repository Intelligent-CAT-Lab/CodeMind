  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in five variables A, B, C, X, and Y, which are integers.
The code then calculates three different values:
1. v1 = A * X + B * Y, which is the cost of buying A and B individually.
2. v2 = C * 2 * Y + (X - Y) * A, which is the cost of buying C and X - Y of A.
3. v3 = C * 2 * max([X, Y]) + (Y - X) * B, which is the cost of buying C and X - Y of B.
The code then prints the minimum of these three values.

The input given is 1500, 2000, 1600, 3, and 2.

<<<Output>>>
The output of the code is 1500.

The minimum of v1, v2, and v3 is v1, which is calculated as A * X + B * Y = 1500.

The code prints the minimum value, which is 1500.
