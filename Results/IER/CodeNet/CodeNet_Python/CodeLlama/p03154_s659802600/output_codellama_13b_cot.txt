  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first maps the input to three variables H, W, and K.
The code then calculates the value of x using the formula:
x = K*(K+3)//2 + (K**3-K)//3*H*W*pow(N*N-N,P-2,P)
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to K-1.
For each iteration, the code multiplies x by (N-i) and takes the remainder of the result modulo P.
The loop finishes and the code prints the final value of x.
