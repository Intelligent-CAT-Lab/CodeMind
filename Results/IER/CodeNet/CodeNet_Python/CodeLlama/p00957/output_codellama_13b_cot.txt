  <<<Analysis>>>
The variable l and variable k are initialized to 5 and 3, respectively.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to l (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 5.
For each number i in this range, it calls the function rec with the arguments i and True.
The function rec is a decorated function that uses the lru_cache decorator.
The function rec checks if i is less than 0, if it is, it returns 0.
If i is equal to 0, it returns 1 if isBlack is False and 0 if isBlack is True.
If isBlack is True, it returns the sum of rec(i-1, False) and rec(i-k, False).
If isBlack is False, it returns the sum of rec(i-1, True) and rec(i-k, True).
The function rec uses the lru_cache decorator to cache the results of previous calls.
The code then calculates the sum of the results of the function rec for each value of i.
The final result is printed.
