  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input, a, b, and c, and initializes d to 0.
The code then enters a while loop that checks if a, b, and c are all even.
If they are, the code increments d by 1 and then divides a, b, and c by 2.
The code then reassigns a, b, and c to the sum of the new values.
The loop continues until a, b, and c are no longer all even.
If a, b, and c are equal at any point during the loop, the code prints -1 and breaks out of the loop.
Otherwise, the code prints the final value of d.
<<<Output>>>
