<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input N from the user.
The variable answer is initialized to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from the square root of N to 0, inclusive.
For each number i in this range, it checks if N is divisible by i. If it is, it calculates the sum of the two factors (i-1) and (N//i-1) and stores it in answer.
The loop breaks when the condition is met, and the code prints the final value of answer.
