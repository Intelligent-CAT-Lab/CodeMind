  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in three inputs: N, K, and A.
N is the number of dice, K is the number of remaining points, and A is the number of points scored by the coin.
The code initializes a list dp with K+1 elements, where each element is set to 0.
The code then sets the first element of dp to 1 and the last N elements to 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to K+1.
For each iteration, the code calculates the probability of winning with i points remaining using the formula:
dp[i] = c * p_coin % mod
where c is the current value of dp[i-N] and p_coin is the probability of scoring A points with the coin.
The code then updates the value of c using the formula:
c += (dp[i] - dp[i-N]) * p_dice % mod
where p_dice is the probability of scoring any number of points with the dice.
The code then prints the final value of dp[K] multiplied by the probability of scoring A points with the coin.
<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will depend on the values of N, K, and A.
For the input 1 1 50, the output will be 1, since the probability of winning with 1 point remaining is 1.
