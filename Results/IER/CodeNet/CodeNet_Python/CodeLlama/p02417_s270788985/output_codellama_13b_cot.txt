  <<<Analysis>>>
The code imports the sys module and uses the stdin function to read input from the user.
The code then creates an empty dictionary called cnt.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each line of input.
For each line, the code enters another loop that iterates over each character in the line.
For each character, the code converts it to lowercase using the ord() and chr() functions.
The code then checks if the character is between 'a' and 'z' (inclusive).
If it is, the code increments the value of the corresponding key in the cnt dictionary by 1.
The code then enters another loop that iterates over the range of characters between 'a' and 'z' (inclusive).
For each character, the code prints the character and the corresponding value in the cnt dictionary.
