The code takes in three integers X, Y, and Z as input.
The variable answer is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the number of times the loop runs.
The variable width is initialized to Y + 2Z, which is 3 + 2(1) = 5.
The loop runs while width is less than or equal to X, which is 13.
The loop body increments answer by 1 and adds Y + Z to width, which is 3 + 1 = 4.
The loop runs again, incrementing answer by 1 and adding Y + Z to width, which is 3 + 1 = 4.
The loop runs again, incrementing answer by 1 and adding Y + Z to width, which is 3 + 1 = 4.
