  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input N from the user.
The function function(a,b) returns the maximum of the length of the strings representing a and b.
The variable mini is initialized to the length of the string representing N.
The variable lim is initialized to the length of the string representing the square root of N.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to the square root of N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 2 to 100.
For each number i in this range, it checks if N is divisible by i. If it is, it calculates the length of the string representing the quotient of N and i using the function function(i,N//i). If this length is greater than mini, it updates mini to this length. The condition is met when i is 2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20,22,24,26,28,30,32,34,36,38,40,42,44,46,48,50,52,54,56,58,60,62,64,66,68,70,72,74,76,78,80,82,84,86,88,90,92,94,96,98.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of mini, which is 2.
