<<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys and math modules.
The code then enters a loop that reads lines from the standard input using the sys.stdin iterator.
For each line, it splits the line into two numbers using the split() method.
The code then calculates the sum of the two numbers and stores it in the variable temp.
The code then checks if the square root of temp is an integer using the math.sqrt() function.
If it is, the code prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".
The code then breaks out of the loop if the line is empty or contains only a newline character.
<<<Output>>>
No
