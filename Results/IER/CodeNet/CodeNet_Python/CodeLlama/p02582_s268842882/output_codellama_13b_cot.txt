  <<<Analysis>>>
The variable S is initialized to the input string "RRS".
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each character in the string S.
For each character s in S, the code checks if s is equal to 'R'. If it is, it increments the variable cur_l by 1. If it is not, it sets cur_l to 0.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if cur_l is greater than max_l. If it is, it sets max_l to cur_l.
Finally, the code prints the value of max_l.
