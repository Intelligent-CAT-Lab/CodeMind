  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module and defines the readline and write functions from the sys module.
The code then defines a function called solve, which takes no arguments.
The solve function first maps the input string to integers using the map function.
The code then initializes an array S with the maximum value of 2*(X+Y+Z+1) and 2*N+2.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to N-1, where N is the number of elements in the input array.
For each iteration, the code calculates the sum of the first k elements in the array and stores it in S[k].
The code then enters another loop that iterates from N to X+Y+Z+1-1, where X, Y, and Z are the first three elements of the input array.
For each iteration, the code calculates the sum of the first k elements in the array and stores it in S[k].
The code then defines a function called calc, which takes four arguments: k, x, y, and z.
The calc function calculates the sum of the first k elements in the array and subtracts the sum of the first x elements, the sum of the first y elements, the sum of the first z elements, the sum of the first x+y elements, the sum of the first y+z elements, the sum of the first z+x elements, and the sum of the first x+y+z elements.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to N-1, where N is the number of elements in the input array.
For each iteration, the code calculates the sum of the first k elements in the array and stores it in ans[b].
The code then prints the ans array.
