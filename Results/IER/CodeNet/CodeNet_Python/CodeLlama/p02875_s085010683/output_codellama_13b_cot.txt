  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input n and initializes a list l with two elements, 0 and 1.
It then initializes three variables a, b, and c to 0, 1, and 1, respectively.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to n (inclusive).
For each iteration, it calculates the next element of the list l using the formula l[p%i]*(p-int(p/i))%p, where p is a large prime number.
The code then enters another loop that iterates from n to n//2 (inclusive) in reverse order.
For each iteration, it calculates the value of a, b, and c using the formula a+=b*c%p;b=2*b%p;c=c*i*l[n+1-i]%p.
Finally, the code prints the output using the formula (pow(3,n,p)-2*a+p)%p.
