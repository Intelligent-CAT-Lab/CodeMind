  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the necessary libraries, including sys, math, collections, bisect, and itertools.
It then sets the recursion limit to 10^7 and defines a few functions for input and output.
The main function is defined, which is the entry point of the program.
The main function first calls the make_prime_nums function with an argument of 2000.
The make_prime_nums function returns a list of prime numbers up to 2000.
The main function then defines a variable ans and initializes it to an empty list.
It then iterates over the list of prime numbers and appends each prime number to the ans list if it ends in 1.
It also breaks out of the loop if the length of the ans list is equal to the input n.
Finally, the main function prints the contents of the ans list separated by spaces.
<<<Output>>>
[2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19]
