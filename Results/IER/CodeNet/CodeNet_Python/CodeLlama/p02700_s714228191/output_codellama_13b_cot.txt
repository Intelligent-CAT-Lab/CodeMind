  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes in four integers A, B, C, and D as input.
It then calculates the number of attacks that Aoki can make by dividing A by D and rounding up if A is not divisible by D.
Similarly, it calculates the number of attacks that Takahashi can make by dividing C by B and rounding up if C is not divisible by B.
Finally, the code checks if Takahashi's number of attacks is less than or equal to Aoki's number of attacks, and prints "Yes" if it is, and "No" otherwise.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
