  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the math module and defines a modulus value of 10^9+7.
The code then takes input from the user in the form of two space-separated integers, n and k.
The code initializes an array cnt of size k+1 with all elements set to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to k+1.
For each i, the code calculates the value of pow(math.floor(k/i), n, mod) and stores it in cnt[i].
The code then enters another loop that iterates from k+1 to 0 in decreasing order.
For each i, the code calculates the value of cnt[i*j] for j=2,3,... until i*j>k.
The code then updates cnt[i] by subtracting cnt[i*j] and taking the modulus of the result.
The code then updates ans by adding cnt[i]*i and taking the modulus of the result.
The code finally prints the value of ans.

<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will depend on the input given.
For the input 3 2, the output will be 1.
