The code imports the decimal module from the decimal library.
The code then takes two inputs from the user, A and B, and splits them into two variables.
The variable A is converted to an integer using the int() function.
The variable B is converted to a Decimal object using the Decimal() function.
The code then multiplies A and B and converts the result to an integer using the int() function.
The code then prints the result.
