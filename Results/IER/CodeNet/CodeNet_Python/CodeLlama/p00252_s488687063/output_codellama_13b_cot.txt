  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in three integers as input, which are stored in variables b1, b2, and b3, respectively.
The code then checks the values of b1, b2, and b3 to determine the output.
If b1 is 1, the code checks if b2 is also 1. If it is, the output is "Open". If b2 is not 1, the output is "Close".
If b1 is not 1, the code checks if b2 is 1. If it is, the output is "Close". If b2 is not 1, the code checks if b3 is 1. If it is, the output is "Open". If b3 is not 1, the output is "Close".
In this case, the input is 0 0 1, so the output is "Open".
