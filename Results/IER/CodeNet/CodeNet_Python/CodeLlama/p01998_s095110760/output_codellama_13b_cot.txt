  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the math module and defines a variable N as an integer.
The code then initializes a list P with N+3 elements, all set to True.
The code sets the first two elements of P to False.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to the square root of N+3 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 2 to 10.
For each number i in this range, the code checks if P[i] is True. If it is, the code enters another loop that iterates from i*2 to N+3 (inclusive) and sets P[j] to False for each j in this range.
The code then exits the loop and enters another loop that iterates from 3 to N+1 (inclusive).
For each number q in this range, the code checks if P[q] and P[2+q] are both True. If they are, the code increments a variable count by 2.
The code then prints the final value of count.
