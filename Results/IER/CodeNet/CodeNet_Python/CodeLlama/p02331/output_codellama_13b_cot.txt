The code first imports the necessary modules: sys, math, itertools, and collections.
It then sets the recursion limit to 10000000.
The code then reads the input from the user, which is a single line containing two integers n and k, separated by a space.
The code then calculates k^n mod MOD, where MOD is a large prime number.
The code then prints the result.
