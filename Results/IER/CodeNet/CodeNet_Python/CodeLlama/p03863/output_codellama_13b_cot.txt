<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string input s from the user.
The code checks if the first and last characters of s are the same (s[0]==s[-1]) and if the length of s is even (len(s)%2==0). If both conditions are true, the code prints "First".
If the first and last characters of s are not the same, the code checks if the length of s is odd (len(s)%2==1). If this condition is true, the code prints "First".
If none of the above conditions are true, the code prints "Second".
<<<Output>>>
First
