  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module and the collections and bisect modules.
The input is read from stdin and stored in the variable A.
The variable K is initialized to a list of 0s with the same length as A.
The variable s is initialized to an empty set.
The variable cnt is initialized to 1.

The code then enters a loop that iterates from len(A)-1 to 0 (inclusive).
For each index i, the code calculates the length of the suffix of A starting from i+1 and stores it in K[i].
The code also adds the character at index i to the set s and increments cnt if the set s contains 26 distinct characters.

The code then initializes a defaultdict d with a list of indices for each character in the alphabet.

The code then enters another loop that iterates from 0 to cnt-1 (inclusive).
For each iteration, the code iterates over the alphabet and finds the first character that has an index greater than or equal to the current index in the corresponding list in d.
If the character is not found, the code appends the character to the answer and breaks out of the loop.
If the character is found, the code checks if the length of the suffix of A starting from the index of the character is equal to cnt-i-1. If it is, the code sets the current index to the index of the character and appends the character to the answer.

The code then joins the answer list into a string and prints it.

<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will depend on the input string.
If the input string is "atcoderregularcontest", the output will be "atcoderregularcontest".
