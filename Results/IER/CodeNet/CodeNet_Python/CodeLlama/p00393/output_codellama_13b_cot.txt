  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first initializes the variables MOD, N, and M to 1000000007, 4, and 3, respectively.
The code then initializes two lists, pow and dp, with 0s.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 4.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the power of 2 and stores it in pow[i].
The code then enters another loop that iterates from 1 to M (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 3.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the value of dp[i] and stores it in dp[i].
The code then subtracts 1 from dp[M] and enters another loop that iterates from M + 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 4 to 4.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the value of dp[i] and stores it in dp[i].
The code then prints the value of (pow[N] - dp[N] + MOD) % MOD.
