  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string input s and then iterates through it using a for loop.
The loop checks if the current character is equal to the next character using the == operator.
If the condition is met, the loop prints the indices of the two characters and exits.
If the condition is not met, the loop continues to the next iteration.
The code then enters a second loop that checks if the current character is equal to the next two characters.
If the condition is met, the loop prints the indices of the current character and the next two characters and exits.
If the condition is not met, the loop continues to the next iteration.
If both loops fail to find a match, the code prints -1,-1.
