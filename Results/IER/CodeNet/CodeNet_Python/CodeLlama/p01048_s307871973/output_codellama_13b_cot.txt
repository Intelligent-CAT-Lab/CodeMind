<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input from the user and uses it as an index to access the corresponding element in the list [0,1,2,4,6,16,12,64,24,36,48,1024,60].
The list is a list of powers of 2, and the index is used to access the corresponding power of 2.
For example, if the input is 1, the code will print 2, which is the second element in the list.
If the input is 2, the code will print 4, which is the fourth element in the list.
If the input is 3, the code will print 8, which is the eighth element in the list.
If the input is 4, the code will print 16, which is the sixteenth element in the list.
If the input is 5, the code will print 32, which is the thirty-second element in the list.
If the input is 6, the code will print 64, which is the sixty-fourth element in the list.
If the input is 7, the code will print 128, which is the one-hundred-twenty-eighth element in the list.
If the input is 8, the code will print 256, which is the two-hundred-fifty-sixth element in the list.
If the input is 9, the code will print 512, which is the five-hundred-twelfth element in the list.
If the input is 10, the code will print 1024, which is the one-thousand-twenty-fourth element in the list.
If the input is 11, the code will print 2048, which is the two-thousand-forty-eighth element in the list.
If the input is 12, the code will print 4096, which is the four-thousand-ninety-sixth element in the list.
If the input is 13, the code will print 8192, which is the eight-thousand-ninety-sixth element in the list.
If the input is 14, the code will print 16384, which is the sixteen-thousand-three-hundred-eighty-sixth element in the list.
If the input is 15, the code will print 32768, which is the thirty-two-thousand-seven-hundred-sixty-eighth element in the list.
If the input is 16, the code will print 65536, which is the sixty-five-thousand-five-hundred-thirty-sixth element in the list.
If the input is 17, the code will print 131072, which is the one-hundred-thirty-one-thousand-twenty-seventh element in the list.
If the input is 18, the code will print 262144, which is the two-hundred-sixty-two-thousand-one-hundred-forty-fourth element in the list.
If the input is 19, the code will print 524288, which is the five-hundred-twenty-four-thousand-two-hundred-eighty-fourth element in the list.
If the input is 20, the code will print 1048576, which is the one-million-four-hundred-eighty-five-thousand-seventy-sixth element in the list.
