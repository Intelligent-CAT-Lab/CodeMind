<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input string and converts it into a list of characters using the list() function.
The code then initializes two variables, a and b, to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the length of the list.
For each character in the list, the code checks if it is equal to 'C'. If it is, it sets variable a to 1.
If the character is equal to 'F' and variable a is equal to 1, it sets variable b to 1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the value of variable b.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
