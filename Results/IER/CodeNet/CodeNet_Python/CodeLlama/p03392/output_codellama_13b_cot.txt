  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes in a string input from the user and stores it in the variable a.
The length of the string is calculated and stored in the variable l.
If the length of the string is less than 6, the code enters a loop that iterates over the string and checks if the characters are in alphabetical order.
If the characters are in alphabetical order, the code adds the string to a set and adds it to a queue.
The code then iterates over the queue and checks if the characters in each string are in alphabetical order.
If the characters are not in alphabetical order, the code adds the string to the set and adds it to the queue.
The code then prints the length of the set.
If the length of the string is greater than or equal to 6, the code calculates the product of the first character of the string with the length of the string and stores it in the variable t.
If t is equal to the string, the code prints 1 and returns.
The code then calculates the number of characters 'b' and 'c' in the string and stores it in the variable x.
The code then calculates the number of permutations of the string and stores it in the variable ans.
The code then calculates the number of permutations of the string with the characters in alphabetical order and stores it in the variable dp.
The code then prints the sum of ans and dp modulo 998244353.
