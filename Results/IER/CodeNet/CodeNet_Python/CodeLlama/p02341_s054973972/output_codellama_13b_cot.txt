  The output of the code is:

A) Hello, Alice!
Hello, Bob!

Explanation:
The code defines a function called `greet` that takes a string as an argument and prints a greeting message. The function is then called twice with different arguments, resulting in two separate greeting messages being printed. The order of the greetings is not specified in the code, so the output can be either "Hello, Alice!" followed by "Hello, Bob!" or "Hello, Bob!" followed by "Hello, Alice!". Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
