<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 8, which is the input given to the code.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to store the final answer.
The variable tmp is initialized to 1, which will be used to store the current power of 3.
The code enters a loop that iterates while n is greater than tmp.
In each iteration, tmp is multiplied by 3, and ans is incremented by 1.
The loop stops when tmp is greater than or equal to n.
The final value of ans is 3, which is the number of times 3 needs to be multiplied by itself to reach 8.
<<<Output>>>
3
