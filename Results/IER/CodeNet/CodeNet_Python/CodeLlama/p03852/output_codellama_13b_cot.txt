<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user and stores it in the variable x.
The code then checks if x is equal to any of the following strings: "a", "i", "u", "e", or "o".
If x is equal to any of these strings, the code prints "vowel".
If x is not equal to any of these strings, the code prints "consonant".
<<<Output>>>
