  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes in the input and splits it into a list of integers.
The variables a, b, c, d, e, and f are assigned the values of the list.
The variables A and B are assigned the values of a and b multiplied by 100, respectively.
The default values of x and y are set to the minimum of a and b multiplied by 100 and 0, respectively.
The variable dens is set to y divided by x.
The code then enters an exhaustive search loop that iterates from 0 to f divided by A plus 1.
For each iteration, the code enters another loop that iterates from 0 to (f minus A multiplied by the current iteration) divided by B plus 1.
If the current iteration is 0 and the current loop is 0, the code skips the current iteration.
The code calculates the water and sugar values for the current iteration and loop.
The code then calculates the total value of water and sugar.
The code checks if the sugar value divided by the total value is greater than the maximum density e divided by (e plus 100).
If it is, the code breaks out of the loop.
If it is not, the code checks if the sugar value divided by the total value is greater than the current density.
If it is, the code updates the density and x and y to the current values.
The code then prints the final values of x and y.
