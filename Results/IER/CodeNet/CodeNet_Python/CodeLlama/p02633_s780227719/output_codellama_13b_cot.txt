<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input X from the user.
The variable ans is initialized to 360, which is the greatest common divisor of 360 and X.
The code then divides 360 by the greatest common divisor of 360 and X, which is the same as dividing 360 by X.
The result of this division is stored in ans.
The code then prints the value of ans.
<<<Output>>>
360
