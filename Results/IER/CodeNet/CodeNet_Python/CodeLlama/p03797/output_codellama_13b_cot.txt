<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, s and c, and splits them into two variables using the map function.
The code then checks if s * 2 is less than or equal to c. If it is, it calculates the sum of s and the result of (c-s*2)//4 and prints it.
If s * 2 is greater than c, it calculates the result of c//2 and prints it.
