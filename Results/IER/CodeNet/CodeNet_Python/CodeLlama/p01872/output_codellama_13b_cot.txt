  <<<Analysis>>>
The input is a string of 12 digits, with a question mark in the middle.
The code defines two functions: is_collect and check.
is_collect takes a string of 12 digits as input and returns True if the number is a collect number, and False otherwise.
check takes a string of 12 digits as input and returns the digit that makes the number a collect number, or None if there is no such digit.
The code then calls check with the input string, and prints the result.

<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will be "MULTIPLE" because there are multiple digits that can be inserted into the input string to make it a collect number.
