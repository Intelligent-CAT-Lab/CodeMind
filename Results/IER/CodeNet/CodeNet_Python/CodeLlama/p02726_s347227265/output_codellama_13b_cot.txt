  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in three inputs: n, x, and y.
n is the number of points in the grid, x and y are the coordinates of the point to be found.
The code then initializes a list D with n+1 elements, each initialized to 0.
The code then enters a nested loop that iterates over all pairs of points in the grid.
For each pair of points, it calculates the distance between them and stores it in dist.
The code then checks if dist is less than or equal to the minimum distance between the current point and the point to be found.
If it is, it increments the value of D at the index corresponding to dist.
The code then enters another loop that iterates over all values of dist from 1 to n.
For each value of dist, it prints the value of D at that index.
