  <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 105.
The function cnt_divisor is defined, which takes an integer n as input and returns the number of divisors of n.
The function cnt_divisor iterates from 1 to n+1 and checks if n is divisible by i. If it is, it increments the variable cnt by 1.
The function cnt_divisor returns the value of cnt.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n+1. For each integer j in this range, it checks if j is even. If it is, it skips to the next iteration.
If j is odd, it calls the function cnt_divisor with j as input. If the number of divisors of j is equal to 8, it increments the variable cnt by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of cnt.
