  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes in two inputs, K and N, and then calculates the value of k for each iteration of the loop.

The loop iterates from 2 to 2K+1, and for each value of k, the code calculates the value of ans.

The value of ans is calculated using the following formula:

ans = modnCr(t,u,mod,fac,inv) * pow(2,t-u,mod) * modnHr(N,x+t-u,mod,fac,inv)

where t, u, and x are calculated based on the value of k.

The formula is then repeated for each value of u from 0 to end, where end is calculated based on the value of k.

Finally, the value of ans is printed.

<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will depend on the input values of K and N.

For the input ```3 3```, the output will be:

1
