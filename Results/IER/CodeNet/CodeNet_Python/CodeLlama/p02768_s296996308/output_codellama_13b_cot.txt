  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first defines a function mod_cmb(n, k, p) that calculates the binomial coefficient of n and k modulo p.
The function first checks if the input is valid, and if not, it returns 0.
If the input is valid, it calculates the binomial coefficient using the formula (n! / (k! \* (n-k)!)) modulo p.
The function then defines a function main() that takes input from the user and calculates the answer.
The function first calculates the number of ways to choose a subset of size a or b from a set of size n, using the mod_cmb() function.
It then calculates the number of ways to choose a subset of size a or b from a set of size n-1, using the mod_cmb() function.
Finally, it prints the difference between the two values, modulo p.

The code then calls the main() function.

<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will be the number of ways to choose a subset of size a or b from a set of size n, modulo p.
In this case, the output will be 10, since there are 10 ways to choose a subset of size 1 or 3 from a set of size 4.
