  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, a and b, and uses the map function to convert them into binary strings.
The MASK variable is initialized to 2^32 - 1, which is a 32-bit mask.
The code then uses the format function to print the binary representation of a & b, a | b, and a ^ b.
The & operator performs a bitwise AND operation on the two binary strings, which results in a binary string that has a 1 in each position where the corresponding bits of both strings are 1.
The | operator performs a bitwise OR operation on the two binary strings, which results in a binary string that has a 1 in each position where the corresponding bits of either string are 1.
The ^ operator performs a bitwise XOR operation on the two binary strings, which results in a binary string that has a 1 in each position where the corresponding bits of the two strings are different.
