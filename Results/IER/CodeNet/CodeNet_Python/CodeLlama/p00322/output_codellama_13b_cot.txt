  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first defines a function called make_list that takes an integer X as input. If X is not equal to -1, the function returns a list containing only X. Otherwise, it returns a list of integers from 1 to 9.
The code then uses the map function to convert the input string into a list of integers.
The code then defines 9 variables (a_list, b_list, ..., i_list) and assigns them the corresponding lists generated by the make_list function.
The code then enters a nested loop that iterates over the elements of each list. For each element in a_list, it checks if it is not in b_list, and if it is not, it checks if it is not in c_list, and so on. If all the conditions are met, it increments a counter variable cnt.
The code then prints the value of cnt.
