  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input N from the user.
The code then initializes two empty lists A and B.
The code checks if N is even or odd using the modulo operator.
If N is even, the code enters the first if block.
In this block, the code iterates over the range of numbers from 1 to N-1 and appends the pairs (i,j) to list A, where i and j are the numbers in the range.
The code then iterates over the range of numbers from 0 to N//2-1 and appends the pairs (i+1,N-i) to list B.
The code then calculates the set difference between A and B and stores it in a variable D.
The code prints the length of D and then iterates over the elements of D and prints each element.
If N is odd, the code enters the else block.
In this block, the code iterates over the range of numbers from 1 to N and appends the pairs (i,j) to list A, where i and j are the numbers in the range.
The code then iterates over the range of numbers from 0 to N//2-1 and appends the pairs (i+1,N-i-1) to list B.
The code then calculates the set difference between A and B and stores it in a variable D.
The code prints the length of D and then iterates over the elements of D and prints each element.
