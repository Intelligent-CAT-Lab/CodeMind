<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input from the user and stores it in a variable s.
The code then converts the input string to a list of characters using the list() function.
The code then checks if the third and fourth characters of the string are the same, and if the fifth and sixth characters are the same.
If both conditions are true, the code prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
