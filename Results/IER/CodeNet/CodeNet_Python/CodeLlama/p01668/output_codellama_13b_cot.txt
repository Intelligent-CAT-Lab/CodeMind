The code first imports the sys module and defines the readline and write functions from the sys module.
The code then defines a class called RollingHash with three parameters: s, base, and mod.
The class has two methods: __init__ and get.
The __init__ method initializes the class variables pw and h.
The get method returns the hash value of the substring of s from l to r.
The code then defines a function called solve.
The solve function first defines the MOD variable as 10^9 + 7.
It then reads the input from the standard input and splits it into three variables A, B, and C.
The function then defines a function called calc.
The calc function first defines the N and M variables as the lengths of the input strings B and C.
It then defines the hx and hy variables as RollingHash objects with the input strings B and C, respectively.
It then defines the hY variable as a list of hash values of the substring of Y from 0 to i.
It then defines the res variable as 0.
It then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to N.
Inside the loop, it defines the v variable as the integer value of the ith character of X.
It then updates the res variable by adding the product of v, the current value of cur, and the power of 10 of N - (i+1) modulo MOD.
It then enters a nested loop that iterates from i-M+1 to i+1.
Inside the nested loop, it defines the l variable as the length of the substring of X from j to j+M.
It then checks if the hash values of the substring of X from j to j+l and the substring of Y from 0 to l are equal.
If they are not equal, it continues to the next iteration of the nested loop.
If l is greater than 0 and the hash values are not equal, it continues to the next iteration of the outer loop.
If M + (i+1) is less than or equal to N, it updates the res variable by adding the product of v, the power of 10 of N - (M + i+1), and the number of possible values of the substring of X from M + (i+1) to N modulo MOD.
If i-M+1 is greater than or equal to 0 and the hash values are equal, it updates the cur variable by adding 1.
It then enters a loop that iterates from N-M+1 to N.
Inside the loop, it checks if the hash values of the substring of X from j to j+M and the substring of Y from 0 to M are equal.
If they are equal, it updates the res variable by adding 1.
It then updates the res variable by subtracting the product of 9, the power of 10 of N - i - 1, and i modulo MOD.
It then updates the res variable by subtracting N - 1.
It then returns the res variable modulo MOD.
The solve function then defines the ans variable as the result of calling the calc function with the input strings B and C.
It then defines the a variable as the integer value of the input string A.
If a is greater than 0, it updates the A variable by subtracting 1.
It then updates the ans variable by subtracting the result of calling the calc function with the updated A and C variables.
It then writes the ans variable to the standard output.
