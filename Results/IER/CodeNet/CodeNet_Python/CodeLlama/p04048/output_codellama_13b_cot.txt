  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the necessary modules and defines some functions for input and output.
It then reads two integers N and X from the input and stores them in variables N and X, respectively.
The code then calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of N and X using the gcd function from the math module.
It then calculates the result of (N-gcd(N, X))*3 and prints it to the output.
