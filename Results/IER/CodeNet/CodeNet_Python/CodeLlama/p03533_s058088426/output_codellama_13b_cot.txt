<<<Analysis>>>
The code imports the re module, which provides regular expression matching functions.
The code then defines a function that takes a single argument, input().
The function uses the re.match() function to check if the input string matches the regular expression 'A?KIHA?BA?RA?$'.
The regular expression matches strings that start with 'A' or 'K', followed by 'IH', followed by 'A' or 'B', followed by 'RA', and ends with '$'.
The function returns 'YES' if the input string matches the regular expression, and 'NO' otherwise.
The code then prints the output of the function, which is either 'YES' or 'NO'.
<<<Output>>>
YES
