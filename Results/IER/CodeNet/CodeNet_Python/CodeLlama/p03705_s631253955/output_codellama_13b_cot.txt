  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first maps the input to variables n, a, and b.
The code then checks if the difference between b and a is less than 0 or if n is equal to 1 and the difference between b and a is greater than 0. If either of these conditions is true, the code prints 0.
If n is equal to 1, the code prints 1.
If none of the above conditions are true, the code prints the result of the expression (n-2)*(b-a)+1.
