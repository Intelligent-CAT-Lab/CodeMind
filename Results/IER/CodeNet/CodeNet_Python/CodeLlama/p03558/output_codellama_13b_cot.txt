  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the deque data structure from the collections module.
It then initializes an empty deque object q and a dictionary m.
The variable K is initialized to the input value, which is 6 in this case.
The code then appends the tuple (1, 1) to the end of the deque q.
The loop starts by popping the first element from the deque q and assigning it to the variables n and s.
The code checks if n is already in the dictionary m, and if it is, it continues to the next iteration.
If n is not in m, the code adds it to m with the value s.
The code then appends the tuple (n * 10 % K, s) to the beginning of the deque q.
The code then appends the tuple ((n + 1) % K, s + 1) to the end of the deque q.
The loop continues until the deque q is empty.
The code then prints the value of m[0], which is 1.
