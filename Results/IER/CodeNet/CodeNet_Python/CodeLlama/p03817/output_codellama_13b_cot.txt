<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input x from the user.
The variable ans is initialized to 0.
The code then calculates the quotient and remainder of x divided by 11 using the divmod function.
The quotient is stored in q and the remainder is stored in r.
The code then calculates the sum of 2 times the quotient and the quotient of the remainder divided by 6.
The result is stored in ans.
The code then checks if the remainder is greater than 0. If it is, it adds 1 to ans.
Finally, the code prints the value of ans.
