<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in three inputs: n, a, and b.
n is set to 8, a is set to 3, and b is set to 4.
The code calculates k as n divided by a plus b, which is 8//(3+4) = 8//7 = 1.
The code calculates p as n modulo a plus b, which is 8%(3+4) = 8%7 = 1.
The code prints k times a plus the minimum of p and a, which is 1*3 + min(1,3) = 3 + 1 = 4.
