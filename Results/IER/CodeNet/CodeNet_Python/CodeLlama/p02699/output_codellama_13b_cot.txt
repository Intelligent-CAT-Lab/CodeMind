<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, separated by a space. The first integer is stored in variable s, and the second integer is stored in variable w.
The code then checks if w is greater than or equal to s. If it is, the code prints "unsafe". Otherwise, it prints "safe".
<<<Output>>>
unsafe
