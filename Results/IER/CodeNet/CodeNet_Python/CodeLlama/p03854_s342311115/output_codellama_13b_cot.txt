  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input string s from the user.
It then initializes an empty string r.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from the length of s-1 to 0 (inclusive).
For each character i in this range, it appends the character to the front of r.
The code then checks if r is equal to 'dream', 'dreamer', 'erase', or 'eraser'.
If it is, it sets r to an empty string.
The code then checks if r is still an empty string.
If it is, it prints 'YES'.
If it is not, it prints 'NO'.
<<<Output>>>
YES
