<<<Analysis>>>
The code first reads a line of input from the user using the raw_input() function.
The input line is then split into a list of strings using the split() method.
The code then converts the first, second, and third elements of the list to integers using the int() function.
The code then checks if the first element is less than the second element, and the second element is less than the third element.
If this condition is met, the code prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
