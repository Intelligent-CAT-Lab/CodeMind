  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input N from the user.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 2000 to 1 (inclusive).
For each number i in this range, it calculates the value of i(i-1)/2 and checks if it is equal to the input N.
If it is, the code sets a flag c to 1 and initializes a list X with i empty lists.
The code then enters another loop that iterates from 0 to i-1 (inclusive).
For each number j in this range, it enters another loop that iterates from j+1 to i-1 (inclusive).
For each number k in this range, it appends the value of c to the jth and kth lists in X.
The code then increments c by 1.
After the inner loop finishes, the code prints "Yes" and the length of X.
It then prints the length of each list in X and the elements of each list.
The code then breaks out of the outer loop.
If the loop finishes without breaking, the code prints "No".
