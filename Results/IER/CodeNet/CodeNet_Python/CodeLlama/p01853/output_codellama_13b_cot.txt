<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes two inputs from the user, n and m, and splits them into two variables.
The variable n is assigned the value 3, and the variable m is assigned the value 100.
The code then initializes a list called points with n elements, each initialized to the string "0".
The code then enters a loop that iterates from n//2 + 1 to n (inclusive), which is 2 to 3 (inclusive) in this case.
For each iteration, the code assigns the string representation of m to the corresponding element in the points list.
The code then joins the elements of the points list into a single string using the " " separator and prints it.
<<<Output>>>
0 0 100
