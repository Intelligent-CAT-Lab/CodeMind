  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first maps the input to integers and stores them in the variables m[0], m[1], and m[2].
The code then checks if the numbers are in ascending order or if they are equal.
If the numbers are in ascending order, the code prints them in the order they were entered.
If the numbers are not in ascending order, the code checks if they are in descending order and prints them in the order they were entered.
If the numbers are not in ascending or descending order, the code checks if they are equal and prints them in the order they were entered.
The code then prints the output.
