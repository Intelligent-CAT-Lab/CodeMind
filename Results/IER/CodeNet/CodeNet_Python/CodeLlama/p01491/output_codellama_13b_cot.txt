  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module and defines the readline and write functions from it.
The solve function is defined, which takes no arguments.
The function first maps the input to the variables M, N, m0, md, n0, and nd.
The S and T lists are initialized to 0 and M+1, respectively.
The S list is then populated with the values of mi, which is initially set to m0, and then updated using the formula (mi * 58 + md) % (N + 1) for each iteration.
The S list is then sorted.
The T list is populated in a similar manner, and then sorted.
The gen function is defined, which generates the minimum value of the function calc(a, b) for each value of a and b.
The write function is called with the minimum value of the gen function as an argument.
