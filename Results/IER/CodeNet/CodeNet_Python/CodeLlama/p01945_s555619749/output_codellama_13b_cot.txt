  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input string and stores it in a list called S.
The length of the list is stored in S_l.
The code then initializes two empty lists called l and r.
The code then initializes two variables called f_l and f_r to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to the index of the first '*' in the input string.
For each iteration, the code checks if the current character is '(' or ')'.
If it is '(', f_l is incremented.
If it is ')', f_l is decremented.
The code then enters another loop that iterates from the length of the input string to the index of the first '*' in the input string.
For each iteration, the code checks if the current character is ')' or '('.
If it is ')', f_r is incremented.
If it is '(', f_r is decremented.
The code then prints the minimum value of f_r and f_l.
