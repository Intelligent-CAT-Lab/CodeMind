<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines three sets: a, b, and c.
The variable x and y are initialized to 1 and 3, respectively, based on the input.
The code checks if x and y are in any of the sets.
The first condition is met when x and y are both in set a.
The second condition is met when x and y are both in set b.
The third condition is met when x and y are both in set c.
Since none of these conditions are met, the code prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
