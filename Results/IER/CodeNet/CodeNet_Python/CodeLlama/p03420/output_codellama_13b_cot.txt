  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys and random modules.
The function rd() reads a line from the standard input and removes the trailing newline character.
The function rdi() reads a line from the standard input, splits it into a list of integers, and returns the list.
The code then assigns the first two elements of the list returned by rdi() to the variables N and K.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from K+1 to N+1, meaning it will consider numbers from 3 to 5 in this case.
For each number b in this range, the code calculates the number of integers between b and N that are divisible by b.
It then adds this number to the variable s.
The code then prints the final value of s, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
