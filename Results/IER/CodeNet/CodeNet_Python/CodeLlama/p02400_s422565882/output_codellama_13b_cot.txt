The code first imports the math module, which provides mathematical functions.
The variable r is initialized to the value of the input, which is 2 in this case.
The code then calculates the area of a circle with radius r (menseki) and the circumference of the circle (shuu) using the formulae for these quantities.
The code then formats the output using the format() method, which is used to convert the values to strings with a specified number of decimal places.
The output is then printed to the console.
