  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first defines a function named main() which takes no arguments.
The function first defines a variable named rr which is an empty list.
The function then defines a function named f() which takes an integer argument n.
The function f() first defines a variable named a which is a list of strings of length n.
The function f() then defines a variable named b which is an empty list.
The function f() then defines a variable named ii which is a list of integers of length n.
The function f() then defines a variable named q which is a dictionary with keys of tuples of integers and values of integers.
The function f() then defines a variable named nq which is a dictionary with keys of tuples of integers and values of integers.
The function f() then defines a variable named key which is a tuple of integers.
The function f() then defines a variable named nv which is an integer.
The function f() then defines a variable named fr which is an integer.
The function f() then returns the sum of the lengths of the strings in the list a minus the value of fr.
The function main() then calls the function f() with the argument n.
The function main() then appends the return value of f() to the list rr.
The function main() then prints the list rr.
The function main() then returns the list rr.
