  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the necessary libraries, including numpy and sys.
It then reads the input from stdin and maps it to the variables N, M, L, and R.
The code then initializes the variables X, MOD, and fact, which are used for calculating the binomial coefficients.
The code then calculates the binomial coefficients using the formula (n choose k) = n! / (k! (n-k)!) and stores them in the fact array.
The code then calculates the inverse of the binomial coefficients using the formula (n choose k)^-1 = (n-k+1 choose k)^-1 and stores them in the fact_inv array.
The code then calculates the combination of N and M using the formula (N choose M) = (N! / (M! (N-M)!)) and stores it in the comb array.
The code then calculates the probability of the event using the formula (1-x)^(N+1) and stores it in the P array.
The code then calculates the answer using the formula (f(R) - f(L-1)) and prints it.

The code uses the following formula to calculate the probability of the event:
f(R) = (1-x)^(N+1) / (1-x)^(N+1-R)

The code uses the following formula to calculate the answer:
answer = (f(R) - f(L-1)) % MOD

<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will depend on the input given.
For the input 4 2 3 7, the output will be 1.
