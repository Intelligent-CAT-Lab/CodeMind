<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input N from the user.
The code then prints the value of N multiplied by the result of the expression (N % 2 + 1).
The expression (N % 2 + 1) is equivalent to (N modulo 2) + 1.
For example, if N is 3, then (N % 2 + 1) is 2 + 1 = 3.
So, the output of the code will be N * (N % 2 + 1) = 3 * 3 = 9.
<<<Output>>>
9
