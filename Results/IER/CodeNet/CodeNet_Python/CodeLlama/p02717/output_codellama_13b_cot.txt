  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes input from the user in the form of three space-separated integers.
The input is then stored in the variables X, Y, and Z.
The code then performs the following operations:

1. It assigns the value of X to A, Y to B, and Z to C.
2. It assigns the value of X to B, Y to C, and Z to A.
3. It prints the values of A, B, and C.

The output of the code will be the values of A, B, and C after the second assignment.
