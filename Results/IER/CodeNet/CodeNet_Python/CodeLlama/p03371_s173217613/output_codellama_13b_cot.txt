  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in five variables A, B, C, X, and Y, which are all integers.
The code then initializes a variable ans to 10^9 + 7, which is a large prime number.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 10^5 + 1, which is a large number.
For each iteration, the code calculates the value of 2*C*i + max(0,Y-i)*B + max(0,X-i)*A, where i is the current iteration number.
The code then checks if the current value is less than the previous value of ans. If it is, the code updates ans to the current value.
The code repeats this process for all iterations until the loop finishes.
The code then prints the final value of ans.
<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will depend on the input values. However, based on the analysis, the output will be a large integer that is the maximum value of the expression 2*C*i + max(0,Y-i)*B + max(0,X-i)*A for all values of i from 1 to 10^5 + 1.
