  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first reads an integer T from standard input using the read_int() function.
The function then calls the solve() function with the value of T as an argument.
The solve() function first checks if T is less than or equal to 3, and if so, it returns T.
If T is greater than 3, the function sets sec to 1 and T to T-1.
It then sets f to 3 and enters a loop that iterates while T is greater than or equal to 2*f.
For each iteration of the loop, T is decremented by 2*f, f is multiplied by 3, and sec is incremented by 2.
The loop exits when T is less than 2*f.
If T is greater than or equal to f, T is decremented by f and sec is incremented by 1.
Otherwise, f is divided by 3 and the loop continues.
The function then enters another loop that iterates while T is greater than 0.
For each iteration of the loop, T is divided by f, the result is stored in t, and T is decremented by t*f.
Sec is incremented by t, and f is divided by 3.
The loop exits when T is 0.
The function returns the value of sec.
