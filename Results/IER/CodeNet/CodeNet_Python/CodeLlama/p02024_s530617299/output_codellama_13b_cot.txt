<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in four integers as input, h, w, x, and y.
The code then calculates the product of h and w, and checks if the result is odd.
If the result is odd, the code calculates the sum of x and y, and checks if the result is odd.
If both conditions are met, the code prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".

In this case, the input is 4 5 2 3, which means h=4, w=5, x=2, and y=3.
The product of h and w is 20, which is even.
The sum of x and y is 5, which is odd.
Therefore, the output of the code is "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
