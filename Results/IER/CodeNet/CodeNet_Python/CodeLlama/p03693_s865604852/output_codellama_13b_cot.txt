<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in a list of three numbers as input, separated by spaces.
The list is converted to a list of strings using list comprehension.
The code then joins the strings in the list to form a single string.
The code then checks if the resulting string is divisible by 4.
If it is, the code prints "YES", otherwise it prints "NO".
<<<Output>>>
YES
