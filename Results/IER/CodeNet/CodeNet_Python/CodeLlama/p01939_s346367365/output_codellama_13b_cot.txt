  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user in the form of a string.
The string is then split into two parts using the split() method, which returns a list of two strings.
The first string is converted to an integer using the int() method, and the second string is also converted to an integer.
The code then checks if the first integer is equal to 1. If it is, the code prints the second integer plus 1 modulo 1000000007.
If the first integer is not equal to 1, the code calculates the value of d using the formula m // (n - 1).
The code then calculates the values of A and B using the formulae A = m - d * (n-1) + 1 and B = m - (n-1) + 1.
The code then calculates the value of ans using the formula (A+B)*d + (m+1).
The code then prints the value of ans modulo 1000000007.
