  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first defines three functions: gcd, lcm, and factorization.
The gcd function calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers.
The lcm function calculates the least common multiple of two numbers.
The factorization function takes a number n as input and returns a list of its prime factors and their exponents.
The code then takes two numbers n and m as input and calculates their gcd using the gcd function.
If the gcd is 1, the code prints 1. Otherwise, it calculates the lcm of n and m using the lcm function and prints the length of the factorization of the lcm plus 1.
