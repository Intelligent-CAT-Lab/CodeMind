<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes in a string input s.
The variable cnt is initialized to a list of 26 zeros.
The code then iterates through each character x in s and updates the corresponding index in cnt.
The index is calculated by subtracting the ASCII value of 'a' from the ASCII value of x.
The code then prints the sum of the elements in cnt that are odd, divided by 2.
