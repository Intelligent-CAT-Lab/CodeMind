  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first defines a dictionary L, which maps each uppercase letter to a binary string of length 6.
The code then defines a string T, which contains all uppercase letters.
The code then defines two dictionaries de and de2, which map each letter to its binary representation and vice versa, respectively.
The code then enters an infinite loop, where it repeatedly prompts the user for input and processes the input.
For each character in the input, the code looks up its binary representation in the dictionary de and appends it to a string called codebit.
The code then enters another loop, where it repeatedly checks if the length of codebit is less than 6 and if the first 5 bits of codebit are 0. If so, it breaks out of the loop.
If not, the code checks if the first 3 to 8 bits of codebit are a valid binary representation of a letter. If so, it appends the corresponding letter to a string called s and removes the corresponding bits from codebit.
The code then prints the final value of s.
<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will be "D-C'KOPUA".
