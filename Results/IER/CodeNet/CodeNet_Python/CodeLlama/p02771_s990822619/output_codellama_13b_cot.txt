The code takes input from the user in the form of three space-separated integers.
The variables A, B, and C are initialized to the first, second, and third integers, respectively.
The code checks if A, B, and C are equal to each other. If they are, it prints "No".
If they are not, it checks if any two of them are equal. If they are, it prints "No".
If none of the above conditions are met, it prints "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
