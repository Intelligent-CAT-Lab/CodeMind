<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers A and B as input, separated by a space.
The variables A and B are initialized to 6 and 3, respectively.
The code then checks if the sum of A and B is less than 10.
Since 6 + 3 = 9, which is less than 10, the code enters the if block and prints the sum of A and B, which is 9.
<<<Output>>>
9
