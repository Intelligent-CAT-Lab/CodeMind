<<<Analysis>>>
The code imports the math module, which provides mathematical functions.
The code then reads three integers from the input, n, x, and t, using the map function to convert the input to integers.
The code then calculates the ceiling of n/x and multiplies it by t.
The ceiling function rounds up to the nearest integer.
The output of the code is the result of this calculation.
