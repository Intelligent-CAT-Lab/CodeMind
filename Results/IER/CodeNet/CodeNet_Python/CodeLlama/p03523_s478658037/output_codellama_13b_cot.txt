  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input string and stores it in a list called S.
The length of the list is stored in the variable N.
The code then initializes a list called akiba with the letters K, I, H, B, and R.
The code then initializes two flags: flagA and flag.
The code enters a while loop that iterates through the list S.
The loop checks if the current index i is greater than 9. If it is, it sets flag to False and breaks out of the loop.
The loop then checks if the current character at index i is 'A'. If it is, it sets flagA to False and increments i.
If the current character is not 'A', the code sets flagA to True and checks if the current index ia is greater than 4. If it is, it sets flag to False and breaks out of the loop.
If the current character is not 'A' and ia is less than 5, the code checks if the current character at index i is equal to the character at index ia in the list akiba. If it is, it increments both i and ia. If it is not, it sets flag to False and breaks out of the loop.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if ia is less than 5. If it is, it sets flag to False.
Finally, the code prints 'YES' if flag is True and 'NO' otherwise.
