  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input from the user and assigns it to the variables n and x.
The code then checks if x is equal to 1 or 2n-1, and if so, it prints "No" and exits the program.
If n is equal to 2, the code prints "Yes" and then prints the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4.
If x is equal to 2, the code sets y to be the list [3, 2, 1, 4], and if x is any other number, it sets y to be the list [x-1, x, x+1, x-2].
The code then initializes a list called ANS and sets i to 1.
The code then enters a while loop that iterates until i is greater than or equal to 2n.
The code checks if the length of ANS is equal to 2n-1, and if so, it breaks out of the loop.
If i is in y, the code adds 4 to i and continues to the next iteration of the loop.
If the length of ANS is equal to n-3, the code appends y to ANS and checks if the length of ANS is now equal to 2n-1. If so, the code breaks out of the loop.
The code then appends i to ANS and increments i by 1.
The code then prints "Yes" and then prints each element of ANS on a new line.
