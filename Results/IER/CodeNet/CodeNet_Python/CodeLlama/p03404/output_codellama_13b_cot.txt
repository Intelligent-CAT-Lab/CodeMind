  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user in the form of two integers separated by a space.
The first integer is stored in variable a and the second integer is stored in variable b.
The code then initializes an empty list ar and appends 50 lists of 100 characters each to it.
The first 50 lists are filled with "#" and the next 50 lists are filled with ".".
The code then iterates through the lists in ar and replaces every other character with ".".
The code then iterates through the lists in ar and replaces every other character with "#".
The code then prints the final value of ar.
