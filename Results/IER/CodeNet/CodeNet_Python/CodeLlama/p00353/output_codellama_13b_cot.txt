<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in three integers m, f, and b as input.
The first if statement checks if the sum of m and f is less than b. If it is, the code prints "NA".
The second if statement checks if m is greater than or equal to b. If it is, the code prints "0".
If none of the above conditions are met, the code prints b-m.

In this case, the input is 1000, 3000, and 3000.
The sum of 1000 and 3000 is 4000, which is greater than 3000.
Therefore, the code prints "NA".
<<<Output>>>
NA
