<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, separated by a space.
The first integer is assigned to variable a, and the second integer is assigned to variable b.
The code then calculates the sum of a and b and stores it in variable buf.
The code checks if buf is even, and if it is, it prints the result of dividing buf by 2.
If buf is odd, the code prints the string "IMPOSSIBLE".
