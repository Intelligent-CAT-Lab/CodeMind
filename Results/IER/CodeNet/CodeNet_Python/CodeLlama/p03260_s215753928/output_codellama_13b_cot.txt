<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers A and B as input, separated by a space.
The code checks if A and B are both odd numbers by checking if their remainders when divided by 2 are not equal to 0.
If both conditions are met, the code prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".

In this case, the input is 3 and 1, which are both odd numbers.
The code will therefore print "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
