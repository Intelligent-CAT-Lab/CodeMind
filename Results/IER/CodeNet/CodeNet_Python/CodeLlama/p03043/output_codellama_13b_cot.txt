  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the math and fractions modules.
It then maps the input to two variables N and K, which are 3 and 10, respectively.
The code then initializes a variable s to 0.
The code then checks if N is greater than or equal to K. If it is, it calculates the sum of the fractions and stores it in s.
The code then initializes a variable d to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to K-1.
For each iteration, the code calculates the logarithm of K/(i+1) to the base 2 and rounds it up to the nearest integer.
The code then calculates the fraction 1/2^ceil(log2(K/(i+1))) and multiplies it by 1/N.
The code then adds the result to d.
The code then prints the sum of s and d.
