  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs, n and k, from the user.
The variable mod is initialized to 1000000007, which is a prime number.
The variable ans is initialized to 1.
The code enters a loop that iterates while n is greater than 0.
For each iteration, the code checks if n is odd. If it is, it multiplies ans by k and takes the result modulo mod.
The code then multiplies k by k and takes the result modulo mod.
Finally, the code divides n by 2.
The loop continues until n is 0.
The code then prints the final value of ans.
