  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first reads in three integers m, n, and k from standard input using the function LI().
The function LI() returns a list of integers, so the values of m, n, and k are stored in a list.
The code then checks if n < k or m < k. If either of these conditions is true, the code prints 0 and returns.
If both conditions are false, the code calculates the value of ans = pow(m,n,mod) using the pow() function.
The pow() function calculates the value of m^n modulo mod, where mod is a large prime number.
The code then initializes a list p of length k+1, where p[i] = pow(i,n,mod) for i in range(k+1).
The code then initializes a variable c to m and a list comb of lists of length k+1, where comb[i][j] = 0 for i in range(k+1) and j in range(i+1).
The code then sets comb[0][0] to 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to k.
For each iteration i, the code sets k to 0 and enters a loop that iterates from 1 to i in reverse order.
For each j in this loop, the code checks if (i+j)&1 is true or false.
If it is true, the code sets k -= comb[i][j]*p[j].
If it is false, the code sets k += comb[i][j]*p[j].
The code then sets k *= c and c *= (m-i) and c *= pow(i+1,mod-2,mod).
The code then sets ans -= k and ans %= mod.
The code then prints ans and returns.
<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will depend on the input given.
If the input is 2 10 1, the output will be 1.
