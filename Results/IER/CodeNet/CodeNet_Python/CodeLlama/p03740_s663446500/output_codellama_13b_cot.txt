<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers X and Y as input, separated by a space.
The code then calculates the absolute difference between X and Y, which is abs(X - Y).
The code checks if the absolute difference is less than or equal to 1, which is the case when X and Y are 2 and 1, respectively.
If the condition is met, the code prints 'Brown', otherwise it prints 'Alice'.
<<<Output>>>
Brown
