<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user in the form of two numbers separated by a space.
The first number is stored in the variable h and the second number is stored in the variable a.
The code then converts the strings to integers using the int() function.
The code then checks if the first number is divisible by the second number.
If it is, the code calculates the integer division of the first number by the second number and stores the result in the variable ans.
If it is not, the code calculates the integer division of the first number by the second number and adds 1 to the result and stores the result in the variable ans.
The code then prints the value of the variable ans.
