<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in four integers as input, which are stored in variables a, b, c, and d.
The code then checks if the sum of a and b is greater than the sum of c and d.
If it is, the code prints 'Left'.
If it is not, the code checks if the sum of a and b is less than the sum of c and d.
If it is, the code prints 'Right'.
If neither of these conditions are met, the code prints 'Balanced'.

In this case, the sum of a and b is 11, and the sum of c and d is 8.
Since 11 is greater than 8, the code prints 'Left'.
<<<Output>>>
Left
