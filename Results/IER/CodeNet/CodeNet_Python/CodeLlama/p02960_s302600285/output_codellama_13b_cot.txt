  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module and defines a function main().
The function main() reads a line of input from the standard input stream using the readline() method of the sys.stdin object.
The input is a string of length 5, consisting of the characters '?', '2', '?', '?', and '5'.
The function main() then defines a variable mod equal to 10^9 + 7, which is a large prime number used for modular arithmetic.
The function main() then defines a variable s equal to the input string, a variable n equal to the length of the input string, and a variable dp equal to a 2D list of 13 rows and 13 columns.
The function main() then checks if the last character of the input string is '?', and if so, it sets the value of the first row of the dp list to 1.
If the last character of the input string is not '?', the function main() sets the value of the first row of the dp list to the integer value of the last character of the input string.
The function main() then defines a variable a equal to 1, and enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n-1.
In each iteration of the loop, the function main() calculates the value of a as 10 times the previous value of a modulo 13.
The function main() then checks if the character at position i+1 of the input string is '?', and if so, it sets the value of the ith row of the dp list to the sum of the values of the previous row of the dp list modulo mod.
If the character at position i+1 of the input string is not '?', the function main() sets the value of the ith row of the dp list to the sum of the values of the previous row of the dp list modulo mod, where the value of the previous row is multiplied by the integer value of the character at position i+1 of the input string.
The function main() then prints the value of the last row of the dp list modulo mod.
<<<Output>>>
The output of the code is 1, which is the value of the last row of the dp list modulo mod.
