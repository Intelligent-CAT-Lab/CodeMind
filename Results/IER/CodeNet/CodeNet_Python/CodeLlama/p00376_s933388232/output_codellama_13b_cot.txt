<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user in the form of two integers separated by a space.
The input is then split into two variables x1 and x2 using the split() method.
The variables x1 and x2 are then converted to integers using the int() method.
The code then checks if x2 is greater than x1.
If it is, the code prints the difference between x2 and x1.
If not, the code prints the difference between x1 and x2.
