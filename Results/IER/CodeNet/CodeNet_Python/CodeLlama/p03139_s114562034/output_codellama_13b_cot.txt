<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user in the form of three integers, n, a, and b.
The variables n, a, and b are then assigned the values of the input.
The code then calculates the minimum of a and b and assigns it to the variable ma.
The code then calculates the difference between a and b and assigns it to the variable mi.
The code then checks if mi is less than 0 and if it is, it sets mi to 0.
Finally, the code prints the values of ma and mi.
