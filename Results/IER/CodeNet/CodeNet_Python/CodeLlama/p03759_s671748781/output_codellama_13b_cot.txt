<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in three integers as input, separated by spaces.
The variables a, b, and c are initialized to the values of the input.
The code then checks if the difference between b and a is equal to the difference between c and b.
If this condition is met, the code prints "YES", otherwise it prints "NO".

In this case, the input is 2 4 6, so a = 2, b = 4, and c = 6.
The difference between b and a is 2, and the difference between c and b is also 2.
Therefore, the condition is met, and the code prints "YES".
<<<Output>>>
YES
