<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user in the form of two integers A and B, separated by a space.
The code then checks if any of the following conditions are met:

* A is divisible by 3
* B is divisible by 3
* A + B is divisible by 3

If any of these conditions are met, the code prints "Possible". Otherwise, it prints "Impossible".

In this case, the input is 4 and 5, which means A = 4 and B = 5.

The code checks if any of the following conditions are met:

* 4 is divisible by 3 (it is not)
* 5 is divisible by 3 (it is not)
* 4 + 5 is divisible by 3 (it is not)

Since none of the conditions are met, the code prints "Impossible".
<<<Output>>>
Impossible
