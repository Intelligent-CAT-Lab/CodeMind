  The output of the code is:

A) Hello, Alice!
Hello, Bob!

Explanation:
The code defines a function called `greet` that takes a single argument `name` and prints a greeting message using the `print` function. The function is then called twice with different arguments, first with "Alice" and then with "Bob". The output of the code is the concatenation of the two greeting messages, which are "Hello, Alice!" and "Hello, Bob!". Therefore, the output of the code is option A) Hello, Alice!
Hello, Bob!
