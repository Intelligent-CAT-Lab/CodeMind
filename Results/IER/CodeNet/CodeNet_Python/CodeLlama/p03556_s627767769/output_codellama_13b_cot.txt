<<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the math module, which provides mathematical functions such as square root.
The variable N is initialized to the input value, which is 10 in this case.
The code then calculates the square root of N using the math.sqrt() function and casts the result to an integer.
The code then multiplies the result by itself to get the square of the square root.
The code finally prints the result.
<<<Output>>>
10
