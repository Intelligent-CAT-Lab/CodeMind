  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module and defines a class called DSumOfDivisors. The class has a solve method that takes an integer argument tc. The method first defines a function called divCount that takes an integer argument n and returns the number of divisors of n. The function uses the sieve method to calculate the prime factors of n and then calculates the number of divisors of n using the formula (p1+1) * (p2+1) *.....* (pn+1) where n = (a1^p1)*(a2^p2).... *(an^pn) ai being prime divisor for n and pi being their respective power in factorization.
The method then defines a variable so_far and initializes it to 0. It then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 10 and calculates the sum of the divisors of each number i using the divCount function. The sum is then multiplied by i and added to so_far. The loop then prints so_far with a comma at the end.
The method then defines a variable n and initializes it to the input from the user. It then calculates the sum of the divisors of n using the formula (p1+1) * (p2+1) *.....* (pn+1) where n = (a1^p1)*(a2^p2).... *(an^pn) ai being prime divisor for n and pi being their respective power in factorization. The method then prints the sum of the divisors of n.
