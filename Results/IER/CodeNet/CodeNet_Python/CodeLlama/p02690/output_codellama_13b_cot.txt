  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input x from the user.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from -1000 to 1000 (inclusive) for both i and j.
For each combination of i and j, the code calculates i**5-j**5 and checks if it is equal to x.
If it is, the code prints the values of i and j and breaks out of the loop.
If the loop completes without finding a match, the code continues to the next iteration of the outer loop.
The code will continue to iterate over all possible combinations of i and j until it finds a match or reaches the end of the range.
