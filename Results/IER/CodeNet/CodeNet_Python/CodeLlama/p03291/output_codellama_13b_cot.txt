  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input string s and calculates its length n.
It then initializes a 2D array dp with dimensions (n+1)x4, where each element is initialized to 0.
The code then sets dp[0][0] to 1 and defines a list of strings string = ["A","B","C"] and an integer num = 10**9+7.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the characters of the input string s.
For each character i in the input string, the code iterates over the possible values of j in the range [0,3], where j represents the number of consecutive characters in the input string that are equal to the corresponding element in the string list string.
The code then calculates the value of m, which is 1 if the current character is equal to the corresponding element in the string list string, and 0 otherwise.
The code then calculates the value of b, which is 3 if the current character is a question mark, and 1 otherwise.
The code then updates the value of dp[i+1][j] using the following formula:
dp[i+1][j] = (m*dp[i][j-1] + b*dp[i][j])%num
The code then continues to the next iteration of the loop.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of dp[-1][3], which is the number of ways to arrange the input string s such that no two consecutive characters are equal.
