  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user in the form of a string.
The input string is then split into three parts using the space character as the delimiter.
The first part is assigned to the variable w, the second part is assigned to the variable h, and the third part is assigned to the variable c.
The variables w, h, and c are then converted to integers using the int() function.
The code then prints a line of characters using the print() function.
The line consists of a plus sign followed by a string of hyphens of length w-2, followed by another plus sign.
The code then enters a loop that iterates h-2 times.
For each iteration, the code checks if the current iteration is equal to (h-3)/2.
If it is, the code prints a line of characters using the print() function.
The line consists of a vertical bar followed by a string of dots of length (w-3)/2, followed by the character c, followed by another string of dots of length (w-3)/2, followed by a vertical bar.
If the current iteration is not equal to (h-3)/2, the code prints a line of characters using the print() function.
The line consists of a vertical bar followed by a string of dots of length w-2, followed by a vertical bar.
After the loop finishes, the code prints another line of characters using the print() function.
The line consists of a plus sign followed by a string of hyphens of length w-2, followed by another plus sign.
