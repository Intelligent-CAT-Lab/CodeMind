<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes the input string s from the user and initializes an empty list a.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the characters of the input string s.
For each character i in the input string, the code checks if it is already present in the list a.
If it is not, the code appends it to the list a.
If it is already present, the code sets the output string ans to "no" and breaks out of the loop.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is "yes" if the input string contains no repeated characters, and "no" otherwise.
<<<Output>>>
yes
