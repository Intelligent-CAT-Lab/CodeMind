  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the necessary libraries, including sys, numpy, and numba.
It then defines a function called fact_table, which takes two arguments: N and MOD.
The function calculates the factorial of N and its inverse, and also calculates the inverse of each number modulo MOD.
It then defines a function called main, which takes three arguments: N, M, and MOD.
The function calculates the number of ways to choose M elements from a set of N elements, and returns the result modulo MOD.
The code then checks if the program is running on an online judge, and if it is, it compiles the code using numba.
It then imports the compiled code and runs it with the input 2 and 2.
