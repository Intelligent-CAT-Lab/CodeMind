  <<<Analysis>>>
The input is a string of numbers separated by spaces. The code uses the map() function to convert the input string into a list of integers. The list is then unpacked into four variables: h1, m1, h2, and m2. The fifth variable, k, is not used in the code.

The code then calculates the total time in minutes for each time (h1, m1) and (h2, m2) using the formula 60*h + m.

Finally, the code prints the difference between the two total times, minus k.
