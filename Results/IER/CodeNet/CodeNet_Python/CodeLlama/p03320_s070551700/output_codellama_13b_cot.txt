  <<<Analysis>>>
The code defines two functions: Ask and Check.
Ask takes an integer x as input and returns the sum of its digits.
Check takes two integers x and y as input and returns whether x * Ask(y) > y * Ask(x).
The code then prompts the user to input an integer k and initializes variables no and st to 1.
It then enters a loop that iterates k times.
For each iteration, it prints the current value of no and increments it by st.
If Check(no + st, no + st * 10) is true, it multiplies st by 10.
The loop continues until k iterations have been completed.
