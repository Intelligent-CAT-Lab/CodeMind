<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in four integers as input, separated by spaces.
The variables a, b, c, and d are initialized to the values of the input.
The variable ans is initialized to a very large negative number.
The code then calculates the maximum of the four possible products of the input numbers, and stores the result in ans.
The products are calculated as follows:
* a * c
* a * d
* b * c
* b * d
The code then prints the value of ans.
