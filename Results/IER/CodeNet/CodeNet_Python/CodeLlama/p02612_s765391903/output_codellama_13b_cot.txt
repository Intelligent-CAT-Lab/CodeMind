<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input from the user and stores it in the variable n.
The code then checks if n is divisible by 1000. If it is, the code sets the variable ans to 0. Otherwise, it sets ans to 1000 minus the remainder of n divided by 1000.
The code then prints the value of ans.
<<<Output>>>
100
