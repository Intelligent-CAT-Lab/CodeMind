  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes in a string input s from the user.
It then calculates the length of the string n.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n-1.
For each index i in this range, it checks if the character at index i is different from the character at index i+1.
If this condition is met, it calculates the minimum of the distance between the current index i and the end of the string n-i-1, and the distance between the current index i and the beginning of the string i+1.
This minimum value is then stored in a variable res.
The loop continues until the end of the string is reached.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if res is equal to infinity.
If it is, it prints the length of the string n.
Otherwise, it prints the value of res.
