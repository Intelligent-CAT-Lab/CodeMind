<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user in the form of two numbers, n and r.
The variable n is initialized to the first number, and the variable r is initialized to the second number.
The code then checks if n is less than 10. If it is, it calculates the value of z as r plus 100 times the difference between 10 and n.
If n is greater than or equal to 10, the value of z is simply r.
The code then prints the value of z.
