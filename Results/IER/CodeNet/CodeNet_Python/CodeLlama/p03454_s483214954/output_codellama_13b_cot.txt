  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the necessary libraries, including sys, numpy, and fractions.
It then defines a function called type_1, which takes an integer S as input.
The function calculates the number of integers between 1 and S that have a digit sum of 1, 2, 3, ..., 9.
It does this by first calculating the maximum and minimum values of k and n such that kn < S < (k+1)n.
It then calculates the number of integers between 1 and M that have a digit sum of k, and adds this to the total count.
It repeats this process for k = 9, 10, ..., M, and returns the final count.

The code then defines a function called type_2, which takes an integer S as input.
The function calculates the number of integers between 1 and S that have a digit sum of 10, 11, 12, ..., 99.
It does this by first calculating the number of integers between 1 and M that have a digit sum of 10, 11, 12, ..., 99.
It then calculates the number of integers between 1 and M that have a digit sum of 100, 101, 102, ..., 999.
It repeats this process for n = 100, 101, ..., 999, and returns the final count.

The code then defines a function called type_3, which takes an integer S as input.
The function calculates the number of integers between 1 and S that have a digit sum of 100, 101, 102, ..., 999.
It does this by first calculating the number of integers between 1 and 9 that have a digit sum of 100, 101, 102, ..., 999.
It then calculates the number of integers between 1 and 99 that have a digit sum of 100, 101, 102, ..., 999.
It repeats this process for n = 100, 101, ..., 999, and returns the final count.

The code then defines a variable called answer, which is the sum of the counts returned by the type_1, type_2, and type_3 functions.
It then prints the value of answer.

The code then reads a single integer from standard input and assigns it to the variable S.
It then calls the type_1, type_2, and type_3 functions with S as input, and assigns the sum of their returns to the variable answer.
It then prints the value of answer.

<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will depend on the input given to the code.
If the input is a single integer S, the code will print the sum of the counts returned by the type_1, type_2, and type_3 functions with S as input.
