<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs, n and k, from the user.
The variable i is initialized to 0.
The code enters a while loop that checks if n is divisible by k to the power of i.
The loop continues until n is not divisible by k to the power of i.
The loop exits when i is equal to 3.
The code then prints the value of i, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>
3
