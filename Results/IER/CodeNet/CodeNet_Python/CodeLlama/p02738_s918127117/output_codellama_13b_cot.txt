  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs N and M.
N is initialized to 1 and M is initialized to 998244353.
The code then initializes a 3N+1 by 2N+1 matrix dp with all elements set to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 3N+1, meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 3N+1.
For each number i in this range, it enters a nested loop that iterates from 0 to 2N+1.
For each j in this range, the code calculates the value of dp[i][j] using the following formula:
dp[i][j]=(dp[i-1][j-1]+dp[i-2][j+1]*(i-1)+dp[i-3][j]*(i-1)*(i-2))%M
The code checks if j is within the range [1, 2N+1], and if it is, it adds the current value of dp[i-1][j-1] to the current value of dp[i-2][j+1] multiplied by (i-1) and adds the current value of dp[i-3][j] multiplied by (i-1)*(i-2).
If j is not within this range, the code checks if j is equal to 0, and if it is, it adds the current value of dp[i-1][j] to the current value of dp[i-2][j+1] multiplied by (i-1) and adds the current value of dp[i-3][j] multiplied by (i-1)*(i-2).
If j is not equal to 0 or 1, the code adds the current value of dp[i-1][j-1] to the current value of dp[i-3][j] multiplied by (i-1)*(i-2).
After the nested loop finishes, the code prints the final value of dp[3N][N]%M.
<<<Output>>>
The output of the code is 1000000000.
