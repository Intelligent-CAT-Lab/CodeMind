The variable n is initialized to 575.
The function dfs takes a string s as input and returns an integer.
The function first checks if the integer representation of s is greater than n. If it is, it returns 0.
The function then checks if all the characters in '753' are present in s. If they are, it returns 1. Otherwise, it returns 0.
The function then iterates over the characters in '753' and recursively calls itself with the input s + c, where c is the current character.
The function returns the sum of the return values of all these recursive calls.
The function is called with the input '0'.
