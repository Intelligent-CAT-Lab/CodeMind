<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in three inputs: n, a, and b.
n is initialized to 4, a is initialized to 2, and b is initialized to 9.
The code then calculates the product of n and a, which is 8.
The code then checks if the product is greater than b, which is 9.
Since 8 is less than 9, the code sets ans to b, which is 9.
The code then prints the value of ans, which is 9.
<<<Output>>>
9
