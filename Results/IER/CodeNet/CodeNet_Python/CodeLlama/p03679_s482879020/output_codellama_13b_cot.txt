<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user in the form of three integers X, A, and B, separated by a space.
The variable X is assigned the value 4, A is assigned the value 3, and B is assigned the value 6.
The code then calculates the difference between B and A, which is 6-3=3.
The code then checks if the difference is less than or equal to 0, which is not the case.
The code then checks if the difference is less than or equal to X, which is 3.
The code then prints "safe" as the output.
<<<Output>>>
