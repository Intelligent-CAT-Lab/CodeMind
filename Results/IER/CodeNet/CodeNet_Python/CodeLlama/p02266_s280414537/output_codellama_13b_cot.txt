  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input from the user and stores it in the variable data.
The length of the input is stored in the variable xmax.
The input is then converted into a list and reversed.
The code then defines a function called partialSqu that takes in two arguments, h and sig.
The function calculates the value of squ based on the value of h and sig.
The code then initializes a dictionary called x_squ_dict and sets the value of cnt to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the input data.
For each iteration, the code checks if the current character is a backslash or a forward slash.
If it is, the code increments the value of sw and sets the value of x to the current index.
If sw is 1, the code calculates the value of squ and h using the partialSqu function.
The code then adds the value of squ to the totalSqu variable.
If h is 0, the code adds the value of totalSqu to the dictionary x_squ_dict with the key being the value of x.
The code then resets the value of totalSqu to 0 and sets the value of sw to 0.
The code then reverses the input data and enters another loop that iterates over the reversed data.
For each iteration, the code checks if the current character is a backslash or a forward slash.
If it is, the code increments the value of sw and sets the value of x to the current index.
If sw is 1, the code calculates the value of squ and h using the partialSqu function.
The code then adds the value of squ to the totalSqu variable.
If h is 0, the code adds the value of totalSqu to the dictionary x_squ_dict with the key being the value of x.
The code then resets the value of totalSqu to 0 and sets the value of sw to 0.
The code then calculates the sum of the values in the dictionary x_squ_dict and stores it in the variable a.
The code then converts the values in the dictionary x_squ_dict into a list and sorts the list.
The code then prints the sum of the values in the dictionary x_squ_dict and the sorted list.
