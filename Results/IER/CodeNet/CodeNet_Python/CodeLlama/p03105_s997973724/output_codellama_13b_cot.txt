<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in three integers A, B, and C as input.
The code then checks if B is divisible by A, and if the result is greater than or equal to C.
If the condition is met, the code prints C. Otherwise, it prints the result of B // A.

In this case, B is 11 and A is 2. B is not divisible by A, so the condition is not met. The code prints the result of B // A, which is 5.
<<<Output>>>
5
