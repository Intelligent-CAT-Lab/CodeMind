  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the necessary modules, including sys, math, heapq, and sets the recursion limit to 10^7.
It then defines a few functions, including POW, INV, DIV, LI, LF, LS, II, and FLIST.
The function LI() takes a list of integers as input and returns a list of integers.
The function LF() takes a list of floats as input and returns a list of floats.
The function LS() takes a list of strings as input and returns a list of strings.
The function II() takes a single integer as input and returns an integer.
The function FLIST() takes a single integer as input and returns a list of integers.
The function gcd() takes two integers as input and returns the greatest common divisor of the two integers.

The code then takes two integers K and X as input using the LI() function.
It then enters a loop that iterates from the maximum of X-K+1 and -1000000 to the minimum of X+K and 1000000.
For each integer i in this range, the code prints i followed by a space using the print() function.
The loop ends when the maximum value of i is reached.

<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will be a list of integers between -1000000 and 1000000, inclusive, separated by spaces.
The list will contain all integers between X-K+1 and X+K, inclusive, as well as any integers between -1000000 and -1 that are within the range of X-K+1 and X+K.
The list will not contain any integers greater than 1000000.
