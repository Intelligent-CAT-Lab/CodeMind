<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input from the user, which is a string of the form "N D". It then splits the string into two parts using the space character as a delimiter. The first part is converted to an integer and stored in the variable N, while the second part is converted to an integer and stored in the variable D.
The code then checks if N is divisible by 2D + 1. If it is, it prints the result of the division of N by (2D + 1). If it is not, it prints the result of the division of N by (2D + 1) + 1.
