<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in three integers as input, separated by spaces.
The variables a, b, and c are initialized to the first, second, and third integers, respectively.
The code then checks if a, b, and c are all equal to each other.
Since a, b, and c are all equal to 2 in this case, the condition is met, and the code prints "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
