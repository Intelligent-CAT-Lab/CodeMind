  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in four integers as input, r, g, b, and n.
The code then initializes an empty dictionary called mem to store the results of the recursive function dfs.
The dfs function takes in three arguments: i, ais, and tot.
The function first checks if tot is less than 0, if it is, it returns 0.
If i is equal to the length of ais, the function returns 1 if tot is equal to 0, and 0 otherwise.
If i is equal to the length of ais minus 1, the function returns 1 if tot is greater than or equal to 0 and tot is divisible by ais[i], and 0 otherwise.
If none of the above conditions are met, the function calculates the key for the current state of the function using i and tot.
If the key is already in mem, the function returns the value stored in mem.
Otherwise, the function calculates the value of cumul by calling itself recursively with i+1, ais, and tot.
The function then updates the value of mem[key] with cumul.
Finally, the function returns cumul.

The code then calls the dfs function with the arguments 0, [r, g, b], and n.
The output of the code is the value returned by the dfs function.

<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will depend on the input given.
If the input is 1 2 3 4, the output will be 1.
