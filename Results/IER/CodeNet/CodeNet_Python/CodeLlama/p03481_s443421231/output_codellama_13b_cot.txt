<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers X and Y as input, where X is 3 and Y is 20.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 10^18 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 100,000,000,000,000,000.
For each number i in this range, the code checks if X multiplied by 2^i is greater than Y.
The condition is met when i is 10, which means that X multiplied by 2^10 is greater than Y.
The code then prints the value of i, which is 10, and breaks out of the loop.
<<<Output>>>
10
