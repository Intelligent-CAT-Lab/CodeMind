  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input n from the user.
It then creates a list of numbers from 1 to n using the range function.
The code then initializes a variable ans to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates through the list of numbers.
For each number num in the list, the code calculates the number of multiples of num that are less than or equal to n using the integer division operator.
The code then calculates the sum of these multiples using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.
The code then adds the current sum to the variable ans.
The code repeats this process for each number in the list until the loop finishes.
The code then prints the final value of ans.
