<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called main() that takes two integers x and y as input.
The function then defines two lists, a and b, which contain certain numbers.
The code then checks if either x or y is equal to 2, and if so, it prints "No".
If neither x nor y is equal to 2, the code checks if either x or y is in the list a or b. If both x and y are in the same list, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
The code then calls the main() function with the input 1 and 3.
<<<Output>>>
No
