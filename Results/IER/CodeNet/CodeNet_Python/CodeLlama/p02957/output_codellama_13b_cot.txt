  The output of the code is:

A) Hello, Alice!
Hello, Bob!

Explanation:
The code defines a function called `greet` that takes a string `name` as an argument and prints a greeting message. The function is then called twice with different arguments, once with "Alice" and once with "Bob". The output of the code is the concatenation of the two greeting messages, which are "Hello, Alice!" and "Hello, Bob!". Therefore, the output of the code is option A) Hello, Alice!
Hello, Bob!
