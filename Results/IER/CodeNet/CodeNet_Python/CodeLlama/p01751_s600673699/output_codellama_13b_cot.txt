  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module, which is used to exit the program.
The variables A, B, and C are initialized to 10, 10, and 5, respectively.
The variable time is initialized to 0, which will be used to keep track of the time.
The variable ss is initialized to an empty set, which will be used to keep track of the times when the condition is met.
The code then enters an infinite loop.
In each iteration of the loop, the code first checks if the current time is a multiple of C (5). If it is, it prints the current time and exits the program using sys.exit().
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to A (10) and increments the time by 1 in each iteration.
If the current time is a multiple of C (5) after the inner loop, the code prints the current time and exits the program using sys.exit().
The code then increments the time by B (10) and checks if the current time is a multiple of C (5). If it is, the code breaks out of the loop.
If the current time is not a multiple of C (5), the code adds the current time to the set ss.
After the loop finishes, the code prints -1.
