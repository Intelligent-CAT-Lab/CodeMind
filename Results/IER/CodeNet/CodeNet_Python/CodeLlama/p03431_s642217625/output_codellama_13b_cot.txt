  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first defines two functions: combs_mod and solve.
The combs_mod function calculates the binomial coefficient of n choose k modulo mod.
The solve function takes two integers N and K as input, and calculates the number of ways to choose K elements from a set of N elements, modulo mod.
The code then calls the solve function with the input N and K, and prints the result.
