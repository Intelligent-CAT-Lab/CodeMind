<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string input s from the user.
The code then checks if the third and fourth characters of the string are the same, and if the fifth and sixth characters are the same.
If both conditions are true, the code sets the variable ans to 'Yes', otherwise it sets it to 'No'.
The code then prints the value of ans.

<<<Output>>>
No
