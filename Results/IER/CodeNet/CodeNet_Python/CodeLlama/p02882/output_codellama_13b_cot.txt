  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in three inputs a, b, and x.
The code then imports the math module and defines two variables h and V.
The code then checks if h is greater than or equal to b/2.
If it is, the code calculates V as 2*((a**2)*b - x)/a**3 and calculates the angle using the atan function.
If h is less than b/2, the code calculates V as a*(b**2)/(2*x) and calculates the angle using the atan function.
The code then prints the angle.
