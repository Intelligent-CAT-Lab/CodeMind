<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input string S from the user.
It then initializes two variables, A and c, to False and 0, respectively.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each character in S.
For each character s in S, it checks if s is equal to "A". If it is, it sets A to True.
If s is equal to "Z" and A is True, it increments c by 1 and sets A to False.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if c is greater than 0. If it is, it prints "AZ" repeated c times. If it is not, it prints -1.
<<<Output>>>
AZ
