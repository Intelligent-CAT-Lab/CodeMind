The code first takes the input from the user and stores it in the variable S.
The variable year is initialized to the first four characters of S, which is 2019.
The variable month is initialized to the next two characters of S, which is 04.
The code then checks if year is less than 2019, which is not the case.
The code then checks if month is less than 5, which is true.
The code then prints 'Heisei', which is the output.
