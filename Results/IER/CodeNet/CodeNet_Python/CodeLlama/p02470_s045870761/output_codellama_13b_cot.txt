  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the math module, which is not used in the code.
The function prime_factorize is defined, which takes an integer N as input and returns a list of lists, where each sublist contains a prime factor and its exponent.
The function first checks if N is even and if so, it increments the exponent until N is odd.
If N is odd, the function checks if it is a prime number and if so, it adds it to the factorization list.
If N is not a prime number, the function checks if it is a power of 2 and if so, it adds it to the factorization list.
If N is not a power of 2, the function checks if it is a power of any other prime number and if so, it adds it to the factorization list.
The function then returns the factorization list.
The code then takes an integer N as input and calculates its prime factorization using the prime_factorize function.
It then calculates the number of divisors of N using the formula (p-1)/p, where p is a prime factor of N.
It then prints the number of divisors of N.
