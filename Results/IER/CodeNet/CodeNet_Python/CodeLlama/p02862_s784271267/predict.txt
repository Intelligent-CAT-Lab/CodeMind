The code first takes input from the user in the form of two integers X and Y.
It then checks if X is greater than Y, and if so, it swaps the values of X and Y.
The code then calculates the sum of X and Y and checks if it is divisible by 3.
If it is not, the code sets the output to 0 and prints it.
If it is, the code calculates the number of ways to choose X objects from a set of N objects, where N is the sum of X and Y, and the number of ways to choose Y objects from the same set, using the combination formula.
