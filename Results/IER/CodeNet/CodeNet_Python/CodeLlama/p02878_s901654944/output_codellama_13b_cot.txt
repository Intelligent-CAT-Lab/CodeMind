  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first initializes the variables N, A, and B to 5, 1, and 3, respectively.
The code then checks if B is equal to 0, and if so, it prints 1 and exits.
The code then initializes the variable MOD to 998244353.
The code then initializes the variable f to 1 and the variable F to a list of length N + 1, where each element is set to f.
The code then initializes the variable fi to pow(f, MOD - 2, MOD) and the variable FI to a list of length N + 1, where each element is set to fi.
The code then initializes the variable z to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from min(A + 1, N - B) to A + 1, where min(A + 1, N - B) is 2.
The code calculates the value of x and y using the formulae provided in the code.
The code then updates the value of z using the formula z = (z + x * y) % MOD.
The code then prints the final value of z, which is 1.
