<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input string s from the user.
It then finds the first occurrence of the letter 'A' in the string using the find() method and stores the index of the letter in a variable.
It then finds the last occurrence of the letter 'Z' in the string using the rfind() method and stores the index of the letter in a variable.
The code then prints the length of the substring of the input string that starts at the index of the first occurrence of 'A' and ends at the index of the last occurrence of 'Z'.
