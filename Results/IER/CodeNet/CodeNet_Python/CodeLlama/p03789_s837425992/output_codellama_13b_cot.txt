  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module and uses it to read input from stdin.
It then defines three functions: read, readline, and readlines, which are used to read input from stdin.
The code then defines a variable N, which is initialized to the list of digits in the input number, in reverse order.
The code then multiplies each digit in N by 9 and adds 1 to the last digit.
The code then calculates the sum of the first 10 digits in N and stores it in a variable called low.
The code then calculates the sum of the remaining digits in N and stores it in a variable called high1.
The code then calculates the sum of the first 10 digits in N and stores it in a variable called high2.
The code then defines a function called test, which takes a single argument x.
The function calculates the sum of the digits in low + x and compares it to x.
If the sum of the digits is greater than or equal to x, the function returns True.
Otherwise, the function returns False.
The code then defines a variable called left, which is initialized to 0.
The code then defines a variable called right, which is initialized to 10^10.
The code then enters a while loop that continues until left + 1 is greater than right.
Inside the loop, the code calls the test function with an argument of (left + right) // 2.
If the test function returns True, the code sets right to (left + right) // 2.
Otherwise, the code sets left to (left + right) // 2.
After the loop finishes, the code calculates the answer by dividing (right + 8) by 9 and rounding down.
The code then prints the answer.
