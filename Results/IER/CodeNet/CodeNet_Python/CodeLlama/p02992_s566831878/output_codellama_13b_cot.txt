  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input N and K from the user.
It then initializes the variable LARGE to 10^9 + 7, which is a large prime number used for modular arithmetic.
The code then calculates the square root of N, which is 1 in this case, and stores it in the variable R.
It then initializes the variable square to False, as N is not a perfect square.
The code then initializes the variable DP_S to a list of 1s of length R, which will be used to store the number of ways to express N as a sum of squares of positive integers.
The code then initializes the variable DP_L to a list of 1s of length R, which will be used to store the number of ways to express N as a sum of squares of positive integers that are less than or equal to N.
The code then initializes the variable N_L to a list of 1s of length R, which will be used to store the number of ways to express N as a sum of squares of positive integers that are less than or equal to N.
The code then initializes the variable DP_M to 0, which will be used to store the number of ways to express N as a sum of squares of positive integers that are less than or equal to N.
The code then initializes the variable L to R, which will be used to store the number of ways to express N as a sum of squares of positive integers that are less than or equal to N.
The code then enters a loop that iterates K - 1 times.
In each iteration, the code calculates the number of ways to express N as a sum of squares of positive integers that are less than or equal to N, and stores it in the variable S.
The code then calculates the number of ways to express N as a sum of squares of positive integers that are less than or equal to N, and stores it in the variable L.
The code then calculates the number of ways to express N as a sum of squares of positive integers that are less than or equal to N, and stores it in the variable SS.
The code then enters a loop that iterates R times.
In each iteration, the code calculates the number of ways to express N as a sum of squares of positive integers that are less than or equal to N, and stores it in the variable S.
The code then updates the value of DP_S[i] to (L + SS) % LARGE.
The code then updates the value of DP_L[i] to (S * N_L[i]) % LARGE.
The code then updates the value of L to (L - DP_L[i]) % LARGE.
The code then updates the value of N_L[i] to (S * N_L[i]) % LARGE.
The code then updates the value of DP_M to (DP_M + SS) % LARGE.
The code then prints the final value of DP_L, DP_S, and DP_M, which is 1, 1, and 0, respectively.
