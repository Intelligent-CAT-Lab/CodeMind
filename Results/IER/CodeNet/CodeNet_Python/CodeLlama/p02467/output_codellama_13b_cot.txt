  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module and the math module.
The code then defines a function called solve, which takes no arguments.
The function first prompts the user to input a number and stores it in a variable called n.
The function then prints the number and a colon, followed by a space.
The function then calls another function called prime_factorization, which takes the number n as an argument.
The prime_factorization function first checks if the number is less than 2 and returns the number if it is.
The function then initializes a variable called res to an empty list.
The function then calculates the square root of the number and stores it in a variable called lim.
The function then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to lim (inclusive).
For each number p in this range, the function checks if the number n is divisible by p.
If it is, the function appends p to the res list and divides n by p.
The function then checks if n is greater than 1 and appends n to the res list if it is.
The function then returns the res list.
The solve function then prints the elements of the list returned by the prime_factorization function, separated by spaces.
