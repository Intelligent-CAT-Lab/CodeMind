<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes input as a string, splits it into a list of integers using the map() function, and then filters the list to only include odd numbers using a list comprehension.
The length of the resulting list is then checked to see if it is greater than or equal to 2.
If it is, the code prints "Hom", otherwise it prints "Tem".

In this case, the input is "1 1 10", which is split into a list of integers [1, 1, 10].
The list comprehension filters this list to only include the odd numbers, which are 1 and 10.
The length of this list is 2, which is greater than or equal to 2, so the code prints "Hom".
<<<Output>>>
Hom
