The variable k is initialized to 103.
The variable now is initialized to 100.
The variable cnt is initialized to 0.
The code enters a loop that iterates while now is less than k.
In each iteration, the value of now is multiplied by 1.01, rounded to the nearest integer, and stored in now.
The variable cnt is incremented by 1.
The loop continues until now is greater than or equal to k.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of cnt, which is 9.
<<<Output>>>
9
