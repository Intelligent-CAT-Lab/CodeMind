<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input n from the user and stores it in the variable n.
The code then calculates the value of n(n-1)//2 and prints it.
The value of n(n-1)//2 is equal to n times (n-1) divided by 2.
In this case, the input is 2, so the value of n(n-1)//2 is 2 times (2-1) divided by 2, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
