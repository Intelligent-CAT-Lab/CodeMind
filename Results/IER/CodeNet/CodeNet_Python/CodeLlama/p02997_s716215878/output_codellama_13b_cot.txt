  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the itertools module, which provides various functions for iterating over sequences.
The code then reads in two integers N and K from the input, and calculates the number of edges in a complete graph with N vertices, which is (N-1)*(N-2)//2.
The code then checks if this number is less than K, and if so, prints -1 and exits.
If the number of edges is not less than K, the code creates a list of edges using the itertools.combinations function, which generates all possible combinations of two elements from a given iterable.
The code then slices the list of edges to include only the first x-K elements, where x is the number of edges in the complete graph.
The code then prints the length of the list of edges, which is the number of edges in the subgraph, and then prints each edge in the subgraph.
<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will depend on the values of N and K.
If N is less than or equal to 2, the code will print -1 and exit.
If N is greater than 2 and K is less than or equal to (N-1)*(N-2)//2, the code will print the number of edges in the subgraph, which is x-K.
If N is greater than 2 and K is greater than (N-1)*(N-2)//2, the code will print -1 and exit.
