The output of the code will depend on the values of N and K.
If N is less than or equal to 2, the code will print -1 and exit.
If N is greater than 2 and K is less than or equal to (N-1)*(N-2)//2, the code will print the number of edges in the subgraph, which is x-K.
If N is greater than 2 and K is greater than (N-1)*(N-2)//2, the code will print -1 and exit.
