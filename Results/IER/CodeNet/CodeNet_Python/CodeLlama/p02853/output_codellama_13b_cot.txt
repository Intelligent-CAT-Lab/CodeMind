<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user in the form of two integers x and y.
The code then initializes two variables X and Y to 0.
The code then checks the value of x and y and assigns a value to X and Y based on the following conditions:
* If x is 3, X is assigned 100000.
* If x is 2, X is assigned 200000.
* If x is 1, X is assigned 300000.
* If x is any other value, X is assigned 0.
* If y is 3, Y is assigned 100000.
* If y is 2, Y is assigned 200000.
* If y is 1, Y is assigned 300000.
* If y is any other value, Y is assigned 0.
The code then checks if x and y are both equal to 1. If they are, it prints the sum of X, Y, and 400000. Otherwise, it prints the sum of X and Y.
<<<Output>>>
400000
