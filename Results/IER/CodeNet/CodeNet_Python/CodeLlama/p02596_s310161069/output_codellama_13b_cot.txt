The variable K is initialized to 101, which is the input given.
The variable A is initialized to 7%K, which is 7%101, which is 7.
The variable Flag is initialized to False.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to K (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 101.
For each number T in this range, it checks if A is equal to 0. If it is, it sets the variable Flag to True and breaks out of the loop.
If A is not equal to 0, it calculates the next value of A using the formula (10*A+7)%K.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of T, which is 101.
<<<Output>>>
101
