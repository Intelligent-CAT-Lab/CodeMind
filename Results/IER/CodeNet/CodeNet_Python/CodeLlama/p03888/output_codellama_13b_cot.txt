  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the math and sys modules.
The getinputdata() function is defined, which takes no arguments and returns an array of strings.
The function first initializes an empty array called array_result.
It then takes input from the user and splits the input into an array using the split() method.
The function then sets a flag variable called flg to 1.
It then enters a while loop that continues until flg is 0.
Inside the loop, it takes input from the user and splits the input into an array called array_temp.
If the input is not empty, it appends array_temp to array_result and sets flg to 1.
If the input is empty, it sets flg to 0.
The function then returns array_result.
The code then calls the getinputdata() function and stores the result in a variable called arr_data.
It then takes the first element of arr_data and converts it to an integer using the int() function.
It then takes the second element of arr_data and converts it to an integer using the int() function.
It then prints the result of the calculation 1/((r2+r1) /(r1*r2)) using the print() function.
