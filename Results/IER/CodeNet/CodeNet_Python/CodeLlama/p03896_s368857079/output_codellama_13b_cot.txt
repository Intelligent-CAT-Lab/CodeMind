  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user and stores it in the variable n.
The code then checks if the input is equal to 2 and if it is, it prints -1 and exits the program.
The code then initializes a range object r with the value of n-1 and a list s with the values of r and n-1.
The code then initializes a 2D list A with the values of 1+(i+j+1)%n for each i in s and j in r.
The code then enters a nested loop that iterates over each element of A and checks if A[A[j][i]-1][i] is equal to j+1. If it is, the code swaps the values of A[j][i] and A[j][i-n].
The code then prints the values of A separated by spaces and newlines.
