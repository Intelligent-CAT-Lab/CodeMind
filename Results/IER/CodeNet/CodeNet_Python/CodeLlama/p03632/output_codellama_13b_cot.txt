<<<Analysis>>>
The variables A, B, C, and D are initialized to 0, 75, 25, and 100, respectively.
The code calculates the difference between the minimum of B and D (75) and the maximum of A and C (25), which is 50.
The code then checks if the difference is greater than 0. Since 50 is greater than 0, the code prints 50.
<<<Output>>>
50
