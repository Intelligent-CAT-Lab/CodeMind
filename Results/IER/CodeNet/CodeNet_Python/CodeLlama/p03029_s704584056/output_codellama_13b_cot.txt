The code takes two integers as input, separated by a space.
The first integer is assigned to variable a, and the second integer is assigned to variable b.
The code then calculates the product of a and 3, and stores the result in variable c.
The code then calculates the sum of c and b, and stores the result in variable d.
The code then divides d by 2 and stores the result in variable e.
The code finally prints the value of e.
