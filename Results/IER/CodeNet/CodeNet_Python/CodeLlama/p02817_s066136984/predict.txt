  The output of the code is:

C) Hello, Alice!

Explanation:
The function greet() takes a string as an argument and returns a string with the format "Hello, " followed by the name passed as an argument and an exclamation mark.
In the code, the function greet() is called with the argument "Alice", and the returned string is printed using the print() function.
Therefore, the output of the code is "Hello, Alice!".

Option A is incorrect because it does not include the exclamation mark at the end of the string.
Option B is incorrect because it does not include the comma after "Hello, ".
Option D is incorrect because it does not include the exclamation mark at the end of the string.
