<<<Analysis>>>
The code imports the math module and uses the floor function from it.
The variables A, B, and N are initialized to 5, 7, and 4, respectively.
The code calculates the expression floor(A*min(B-1, N)/B) and prints the result.
The expression can be broken down as follows:
* A*min(B-1, N) = 5*min(6, 4) = 5*4 = 20
* floor(20/B) = floor(20/7) = 2

Therefore, the output of the code is 2.
