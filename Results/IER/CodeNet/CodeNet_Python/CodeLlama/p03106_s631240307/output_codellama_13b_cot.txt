  <<<Analysis>>>
The function gcd(x,y) calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers x and y.
The function takes two inputs a and b, and calculates the greatest common divisor of a and b.
The function then calculates the greatest common divisor of b and a%b.
The function repeats this process until the value of y is 0.
The function then returns the value of x.
The function gcd is then called with the inputs a and b.
The variable k is initialized to 2.
The variable ans is initialized to the value of gcd(a,b).
The variable cnt is initialized to 1.
The while loop runs until cnt is less than k.
The variable ans is decremented by 1.
The condition a%ans == 0 and b%ans == 0 is checked.
If the condition is met, the variable cnt is incremented by 1.
The while loop repeats until the condition is not met.
The final value of ans is printed.
