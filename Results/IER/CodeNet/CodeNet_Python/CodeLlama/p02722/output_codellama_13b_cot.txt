  <<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function check(i) that takes an integer i as input.
The function calculates the totient function of i, which is the number of positive integers less than or equal to i that are relatively prime to i.
The function then checks if tot is divisible by i, and if it is, it divides tot by i.
The function then checks if tot is divisible by i again, and if it is, it adds i to a set called setl.
The function then returns the value of tot.
The code then defines a variable k and initializes it to the input value.
The code then initializes a set called setl with the values k and k-1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to the square root of k, and for each value x in this range, it calls the check function with x as input.
The code then calls the check function with k//x as input.
The code then checks if setl contains the value 1, and if it does, it removes it from setl.
The code then prints the length of setl.
