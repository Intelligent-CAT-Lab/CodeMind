  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first initializes a list l with the values ['R', 'Y', 'G', 'B'].
The code then reads in three integers h, w, and d from the input using the map function.
The code then initializes a 2D list res with 1000 rows and 1000 columns, with each element initialized to None.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the rows of res.
For each row i, the code checks if i is divisible by d and if the result is even.
If it is, the code enters a nested loop that iterates over the columns of res.
For each column j, the code calculates the value of res[i][j] using the formula (j // d + 2) % 4.
If i is not divisible by d or if the result is odd, the code calculates the value of res[i][j] using the formula j // d % 4.
The code then initializes a 2D list ans with h rows and w columns, with each element initialized to None.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the rows of ans.
For each row i, the code enters a nested loop that iterates over the columns of ans.
For each column j, the code calculates the value of ans[i][j] using the formula res[i + j][h - i - 1 + j].
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the rows of ans and prints each row as a string.
