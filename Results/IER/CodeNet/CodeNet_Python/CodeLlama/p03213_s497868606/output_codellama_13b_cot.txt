  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input n from the user.
It then defines a function div(m) that takes an integer m as input and returns a dictionary d, where the keys are the prime factors of m and the values are their exponents.
The code then defines four sets A, B, P, and Q, which will be used to store the prime factors of the numbers from 2 to n.
It then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to n+1, and for each number i, it calculates the prime factors of i using the div(i) function and stores them in the sets A, B, P, and Q.
The code then calculates the number of prime factors of each number in the sets A, B, P, and Q that have a value greater than or equal to 74, 24, 14, 4, and 2, respectively, and stores them in the sets R, P, Q, and B, respectively.
The code then calculates the number of pairs of numbers in the sets A and B that have a common prime factor, and the number of pairs of numbers in the sets P and Q that have a common prime factor, and adds them to the total number of pairs of numbers in the sets A and B and P and Q, respectively.
Finally, the code prints the total number of pairs of numbers in the sets A, B, P, Q, and R.
