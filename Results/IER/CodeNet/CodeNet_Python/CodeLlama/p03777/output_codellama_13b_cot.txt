 
The output of the code would be:

Hello, Alice!
Hello, Bob!
Hello, stranger!

Explanation:

The code defines a function called `greet` that takes a string `name` as an argument. The function checks if the `name` is equal to "Alice" or "Bob" and returns a personalized greeting message accordingly. If the `name` is not equal to "Alice" or "Bob", the function returns "Hello, stranger!".

The code then calls the `greet` function with different arguments and prints the returned value.
