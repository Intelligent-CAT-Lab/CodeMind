  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first defines a list called prime, which contains the number 2.
It then defines a function called check, which takes an integer x as input and checks if it is prime.
The function checks if x is divisible by any of the numbers in the list prime. If it is, it returns False. If it is not divisible by any of the numbers in the list prime and is less than the square of the largest number in the list prime, it returns True.
The code then defines a function called set, which iterates from 3 to 10000 in steps of 2 and checks if each number is prime using the check function. If it is prime, it adds the number to the list prime.
The code then calls the set function.
The code then takes two integers p and q as input, separated by a space.
It then checks if q is divisible by p. If it is, it sets q to q // p and p to 1.
It then iterates through the list prime and divides p and q by each prime number in the list.
It then calculates the product of all prime numbers that divide both p and q and prints the result.
