The code first takes input from the user and splits it into a list of strings using the split() method.
The list is then converted into a list of integers using the int() method.
The code then calculates the quotient of the two integers and stores it in the variable kimawasi.
The code then checks if the remainder of the division is greater than 0, and if it is, it adds 1 to kimawasi.
Finally, the code prints the value of kimawasi.
