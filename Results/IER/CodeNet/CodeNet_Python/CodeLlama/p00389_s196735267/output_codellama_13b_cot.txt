  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs, n and k, from the user.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the number of integers between 1 and n that are divisible by k.
The variables d and s are initialized to 1 and 0, respectively.
The code enters an infinite loop.
The inner loop checks if d*k is less than s. If it is, it increments d by 1.
The outer loop checks if s+d is greater than n. If it is, it breaks out of the loop.
If the condition is met, the code increments s by d and adds 1 to ans.
The code prints the final value of ans.
