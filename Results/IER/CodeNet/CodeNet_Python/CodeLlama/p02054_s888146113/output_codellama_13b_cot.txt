  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input, a, b, and c, and stores them in variables a, b, and c, respectively.
The code then initializes a variable cnt to 0.
The code then checks if a is even and if it is, it increments cnt by 1.
The code then checks if b is even and if it is, it increments cnt by 1.
The code then checks if c is even and if it is, it increments cnt by 1.
The code then checks if cnt is greater than or equal to 2 and if it is, it prints 'Tem' to the console. Otherwise, it prints 'Hom' to the console.

<<<Output>>>
Hom
