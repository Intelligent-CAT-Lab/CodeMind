<<<Analysis>>>
The variable K is initialized to 2, which is the input given.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to K (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 2.
For each number a in this range, it enters another loop that iterates from 1 to K (inclusive).
For each number b in this range, it enters another loop that iterates from 1 to K (inclusive).
For each number c in this range, it calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of a, b, and c using the gcd function from the math module.
The code then adds the result of this calculation to the variable ans.
The code repeats this process for all possible combinations of a, b, and c, which is 2 x 2 x 2 = 8 combinations.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 12.
<<<Output>>>
12
