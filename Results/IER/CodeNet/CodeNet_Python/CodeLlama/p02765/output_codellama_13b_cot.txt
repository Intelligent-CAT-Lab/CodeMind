<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user in the form of two numbers, n and r.
The variable n is initialized to 2, and the variable r is initialized to 2919.
The code then checks if n is less than 10.
If it is, the code prints the value of r plus 100 times the difference between 10 and n.
If n is greater than or equal to 10, the code simply prints the value of r.
<<<Output>>>
2919
