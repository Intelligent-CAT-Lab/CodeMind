  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the collections module and defines a function readInts() that takes input from the user and returns a list of integers.
The code then defines a function main() that takes two integers as input and performs the following operations:
1. It initializes a variable wa to 0.
2. It enters a nested loop that iterates over two variables i and j, both ranging from 0 to n (inclusive).
3. The loop checks if i + j > n, and if so, it breaks out of the inner loop.
4. The loop calculates y1000 = (y - 10000 * i - 5000 * j)//1000.
5. The loop checks if i + j + y1000 == n, and if so, it prints the values of i, j, and y1000 and exits the program.
6. If the loop completes without finding a solution, it prints -1, -1, -1 and exits the program.

The code then calls the main() function with the input values 9 and 45000.

The output of the code will be:
