  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input n from the user.
The variable mask is initialized to 2^32-1, which is a 32-bit mask.
The code then prints the binary representation of n using the format method.
The code then prints the binary representation of the bitwise NOT of n using the format method.
The code then prints the binary representation of n shifted left by 1 bit using the format method.
The code then prints the binary representation of n shifted right by 1 bit using the format method.
