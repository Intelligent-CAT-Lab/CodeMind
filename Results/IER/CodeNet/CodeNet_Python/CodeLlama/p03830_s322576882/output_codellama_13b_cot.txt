  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module and sets the recursion limit to 10^7.
It then reads the input from stdin and converts it to an integer.
The code then initializes a list called factorial with 0s and sets the first element to 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 3.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the factorial of i and stores it in the factorial list.
The code then sets n to the factorial of n.
The code then initializes a list called prime_factors with empty lists.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to the square root of n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 2 to 1.6.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is a factor of n. If it is, it calculates the exponent of i in n and stores it in ext.
If ext is not 0, the code appends (i, ext) to prime_factors.
The code then sets i to i+1.
The code then checks if n is not equal to 1. If it is, the code appends (n, 1) to prime_factors.
The code then initializes a variable called ans to 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over prime_factors.
For each (p, num) in prime_factors, the code calculates ans = (ans * (num + 1)) % MOD.
The code then prints ans.
