<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user and splits it into a list of integers using the split() method.
The list is then sorted using the sort() method.
The code then checks if the first three elements of the sorted list are equal to 5, 5, and 7, respectively.
If the condition is met, the code prints "YES", otherwise it prints "NO".
<<<Output>>>
YES
