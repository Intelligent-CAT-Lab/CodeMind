  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes the input S as a string and initializes a variable Sum to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 2^(length of S - 1), which is 2^2 - 1 = 3 in this case.
For each iteration, the code initializes a temporary list temp_list and a temporary string temp_s to the value of S.
The code then enters another loop that iterates from 0 to length of S - 1.
For each iteration, the code checks if the bit at position jj in the binary representation of ii is 1 or 0.
If the bit is 1, the code appends the first itr digits of temp_s to temp_list and updates temp_s to the remaining digits.
If the bit is 0, the code increments the variable itr by 1.
After the inner loop finishes, the code calculates the sum of the elements in temp_list and adds it to Sum.
The code also adds the last digit of temp_s to Sum.
After the outer loop finishes, the code adds the value of S to Sum and prints the final value of Sum.
