The code first imports several modules, including math, string, itertools, fractions, heapq, collections, re, array, bisect, sys, random, time, copy, and functools.

The code then sets the recursion limit to 10^7 and defines several variables, including inf, eps, mod, dd, ddn, and a function named LI, LI_, LF, LS, I, F, S, pf, and main.

The main function first initializes an empty list named rr.

The main function then defines a function named f, which takes a string named s as input.

The f function first initializes a list named ca, which contains the characters '0', '1', '+', '-', '*', and '('.

The f function then initializes a list named sa, which contains the characters in the input string s.

The f function then initializes two variables, r and sl, which are used to store the result of the function and the length of the input string, respectively.

The f function then defines a dictionary named fm, which is used to store the results of previous function calls.

The f function then defines a function named _f, which takes a string named s as input.

The _f function first checks if the input string s is already in the dictionary fm. If it is, it returns the corresponding value.

The _f function then checks if the input string s contains a closing parenthesis. If it does, it checks if the character before the closing parenthesis is either '0' or '1'. If it is, it returns -1.

The _f function then checks if the input string s contains an opening parenthesis. If it does, it sets the variable li to the index of the opening parenthesis and the variable ri to the index of the closing parenthesis.

The _f function then checks if the character before the opening parenthesis is either '0' or '1'. If it is, it sets the variable li to -1.

The _f function then checks if the character after the closing parenthesis is either '0' or '1'. If it is, it sets the variable ri to -1.

The _f function then checks if the character before the opening parenthesis is either '0' or '1' and the character after the closing parenthesis is either '0' or '1'. If it is, it returns -1.

The _f function then checks if the input string s contains a '*' character. If it does, it sets the variable oi to the index of the '*' character.

The _f function then checks if the input string s contains a '+' or '-' character. If it does, it sets the variable oi to the index of the '+' or '-' character.

The _f function then checks if the variable oi is equal to the index of the opening parenthesis. If it is, it returns -1.

The _f function then sets the variable li to the index of the opening parenthesis and the variable ri to the index of the closing parenthesis.

The _f function then checks if the character before the opening parenthesis is either '0' or '1' and the character after the closing parenthesis is either '0' or '1'. If it is, it returns -1.

The _f function then sets the variable t to the integer value of the substring of s from the index of the opening parenthesis to the index of the '*' character.

The _f function then sets the variable u to the integer value of the substring of s from the index of the '*' character to the index of the closing parenthesis.

The _f function then sets the variable tu to the product of t and u.

The _f function then checks if t, u, or tu is less than 0 or greater than or equal to 1024. If it is, it returns -1.

The _f function then sets the variable ts to the binary representation of tu.

The _f function then returns the result of calling itself with the input string s[:li] + ts + s[ri+1:].

The f function then initializes a list named ca, which contains the characters '0', '1', '+', '-', '*', and '('.

The f function then initializes a list named sa, which contains the characters in the input string s.

The f function then initializes two variables, r and sl, which are used to store the result of the function and the length of the input string, respectively.

The f function then checks if the character after the closing parenthesis is either '0' or '1'. If it is, it sets the variable ri to -1.

The f function then checks if the character before the opening parenthesis is either '0' or '1' and the character after the closing parenthesis is either '0' or '1'. If it is, it returns -1.

The f function then checks if the input string s contains a '*' character. If it does, it sets the variable oi to the index of the '*' character.

The f function then checks if the input string s contains a '+' or '-' character. If it does, it sets the variable oi to the index of the '+' or '-' character.

The f function then checks if the variable oi is equal to the index of the opening parenthesis. If it is, it returns -1.

The f function then checks if the character before the opening parenthesis is either '0' or '1' and the character after the closing parenthesis is either '0' or '1'. If it is, it returns -1.

The f function then sets the variable t to the integer value of the substring of s from the index of the opening parenthesis to the index of the '*' character.

The f function then sets the variable u to the integer value of the substring of s from the index of the '*' character to the index of the closing parenthesis.

The f function then sets the variable tu to the product of t and u.

The f function then checks if t, u, or tu is less than 0 or greater than or equal to 1024. If it is, it returns -1.
