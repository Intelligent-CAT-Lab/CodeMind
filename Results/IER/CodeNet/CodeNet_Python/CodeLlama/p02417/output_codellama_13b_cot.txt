  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first initializes an empty list A and enters an infinite loop.
The loop continues until an EOFError is raised, which occurs when the user presses Ctrl+D (Unix) or Ctrl+Z (Windows) to indicate the end of input.
The code then initializes an empty dictionary D and enters another loop that iterates over the elements of A.
For each element s in A, the code checks if s is already a key in D. If it is, the code increments the corresponding value in D. If it is not, the code adds s as a key in D with a value of 1.
The code then initializes a list Str that contains the lowercase letters of the alphabet.
The code then enters another loop that iterates over the elements of Str.
For each element s in Str, the code prints s followed by a colon and a space.
If s is a key in D, the code prints the corresponding value in D. If it is not, the code prints 0.
The code then prints a newline character.
