The code takes input from the user and stores it in the variable b.
The code then checks the value of b using if-elif-else statements.
If b is equal to 'A', the code prints 'T'.
If b is equal to 'T', the code prints 'A'.
If b is equal to 'G', the code prints 'C'.
If none of the above conditions are met, the code prints 'G'.
<<<Output>>>
T
