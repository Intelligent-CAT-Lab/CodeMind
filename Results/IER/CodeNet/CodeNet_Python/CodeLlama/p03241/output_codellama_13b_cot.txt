  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first defines a function called make_divisors that takes an integer n as input and returns a list of its divisors.
The function first initializes an empty list called divisors.
It then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to the square root of n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 3.
For each number i in this range, it checks if n is divisible by i. If it is, it appends i to the divisors list.
If i is not equal to n/i, it also appends n/i to the divisors list.
The function then returns the sorted list of divisors.

The code then defines a function called main that takes two integers N and M as input and prints the maximum common divisor of M and N.
The function first calculates the ratio M/N and stores it in a variable called MN.
It then calls the make_divisors function with M as input and stores the resulting list of divisors in a variable called divisor.
The function then enters a loop that iterates over the elements of the divisor list.
For each element d in the list, it checks if d is less than or equal to MN and greater than the current maximum common divisor (initialized to 0).
If these conditions are met, it updates the maximum common divisor to d.
The function then prints the final value of the maximum common divisor.

The code then checks if the module name is main, and if it is, it calls the main function with the input 3 and 14.
