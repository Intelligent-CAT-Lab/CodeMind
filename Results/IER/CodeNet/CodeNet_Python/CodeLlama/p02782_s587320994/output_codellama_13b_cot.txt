  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes in four integers as input, r1, c1, r2, and c2, and splits them into a list of integers using the split() method.
The code then defines a function called cmb() that takes in three arguments: n, r, and mod. The function calculates the binomial coefficient of n choose r, modulo mod.
The code then initializes a few variables, including mod, fact, factinv, and inv.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to N + 1, where N is the maximum of r1, c1, r2, and c2.
For each iteration, the code calculates the binomial coefficient of n choose r, modulo mod, and appends the result to the fact, factinv, and inv lists.
The code then calculates the value of a, b, c, and d using the cmb() function.
The code then calculates the final answer, ans, and prints it.
