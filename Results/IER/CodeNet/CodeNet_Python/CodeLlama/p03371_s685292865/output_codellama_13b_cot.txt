  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in five inputs: a, b, c, x, and y.
The variable l is initialized as an empty list.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 10^7 (inclusive).
For each iteration, the code calculates the value of s as follows:
s = c*i*2 + a*max(0, x-i) + b*max(0, y-i)
The code then appends the value of s to the list l.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the minimum value in the list l.

<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will be the minimum value in the list l.
Since the list l is empty, the output will be 0.
