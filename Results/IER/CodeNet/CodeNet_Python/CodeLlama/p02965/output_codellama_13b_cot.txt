The code first imports the necessary libraries, including os, sys, numpy, and math.
It then defines a function called main(), which is the entry point of the program.
The main() function first sets the recursion limit to 2147483647, which is the maximum value that can be stored in a 32-bit integer.
It then defines two constants, INF and IINF, which are used in the code.
The code then reads the input from stdin, which is the standard input stream.
The input is a pair of integers, N and M, separated by a space.
The code then defines two functions, get_factorials() and mod_invs(), which are used to calculate the factorials and modular inverses of numbers.
The code then defines a function called ncr(), which is used to calculate the number of combinations of a set of items.
The code then defines two variables, oc1 and oc2, which are used to store the number of combinations of a set of items with a specific number of odd numbers.
