  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input string S and converts it into a list of integers using the ord() function.
It then calls the suffix_array() function with the list of integers as an argument.
The suffix_array() function calls the sa_is() function with the list of integers and the upper bound of the alphabet (in this case, 255) as arguments.
The sa_is() function performs a series of steps to calculate the suffix array of the input string.
It first calculates the longest common prefix (LCP) array of the input string using the lcp_array() function.
It then calculates the z-algorithm of the input string using the z_algorithm() function.
It then uses the LCP array and the z-algorithm to calculate the suffix array of the input string.
Finally, it returns the suffix array.
The code then calculates the length of the input string and the sum of all the substrings of the input string.
It then subtracts the length of each substring from the sum of all the substrings to get the number of distinct substrings.
It then prints the number of distinct substrings.
