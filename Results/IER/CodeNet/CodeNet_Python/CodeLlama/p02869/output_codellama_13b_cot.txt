  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the math module.
The code then takes input from the user in the form of two integers, N and K.
The code then checks if the condition (2*N)*(K+ K+2*N-1) > N*(K+2*N + K+3*N-1) is true. If it is, the code prints -1 and exits.
The code then initializes a list called flag with N elements, all set to 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from math.floor(N/2) to N-1.
For each iteration, the code calculates three variables a, b, and c using the formulae given in the code.
The code then prints the values of a, b, and c.
The code then enters another loop that iterates from 0 to math.floor(N/2)-1.
For each iteration, the code calculates three variables a, b, and c using the formulae given in the code.
The code then prints the values of a, b, and c.
