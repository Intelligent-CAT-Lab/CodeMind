<<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the math module, which provides mathematical functions such as square root.
The code then defines a lambda function that takes a single argument x and returns its float value.
The code then uses the map function to apply the lambda function to each element of the input string, which is split into four elements using the split function.
The code then calculates the square root of the sum of the squares of the differences between the x and y coordinates of the two points.
The code then formats the output using the format function, which takes a format string and a value, and returns a string with the value formatted according to the format string.
The code then prints the output.
