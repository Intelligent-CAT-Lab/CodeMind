  <<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called search that takes two arguments x and y.
The function initializes four variables x_min, y_min, x_max, and y_max to 0.
It also initializes three variables f, f1, and f2 to 0, 1, and 0, respectively.
The function then enters an infinite loop that iterates until the condition x_min <= x and x <= x_max and y_min <= y and y <= y_max is met.
If this condition is met, the function returns the value of p%3 + 1.
The loop updates the values of x_min, y_min, x_max, and y_max based on the values of p, f1, and f2.
It also updates the values of f, f1, and f2.
The function then increments p by 1.
The code then calls the function search with the input x and y, which are both 0.
The function will iterate until the condition is met, and the output will be returned.
