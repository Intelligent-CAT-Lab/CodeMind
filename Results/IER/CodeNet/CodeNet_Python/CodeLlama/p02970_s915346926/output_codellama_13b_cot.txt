<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs, n and d, from the user.
n is assigned the value 6 and d is assigned the value 2.
The code then checks if n is divisible by 2d+1.
Since 6 is not divisible by 2*2+1=5, the code enters the else block and sets ans to n//(2*d+1) +1.
The value of ans is 6//(2*2+1) +1 = 3.
The code then prints the value of ans, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>
3
