  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes in a string input s and calculates its length N.
The code then initializes two variables A and B to -1.
The code then enters two loops. The first loop iterates from 0 to N-1 and checks if the ith and (i+1)th characters of the string are the same. If they are, the code updates A and B to the indices of the characters.
The second loop does the same thing but checks if the ith and (i+2)th characters of the string are the same.
After both loops finish, the code prints the values of A and B.

<<<Output>>>
-1 -1
