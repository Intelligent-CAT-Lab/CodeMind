<<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module and defines the input function as sys.stdin.readline.
The code then reads the input from the user, which is a string of two numbers separated by a space.
The code then splits the input string into two numbers using the split() method and maps them to integers using the map() function.
The code then checks if either of the numbers is equal to 1, and if so, it prints 1 and exits the program.
If neither of the numbers is equal to 1, the code calculates the sum of the two numbers and divides it by 2, and then prints the result.
