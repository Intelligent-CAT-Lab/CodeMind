  <<<Analysis>>>
The variable X is initialized to the input value 1.
The variable Day is initialized to a list of strings representing the days of the week.
The variable a is initialized to the remainder of X divided by 7.
The code then checks the value of a and prints the corresponding day of the week.
If a is 2 or 3, the code prints the day 3 days after the current day.
If a is 4, 5, or 6, the code prints the day 4 days before the current day.
If a is 0 or 1, the code prints the day 3 days after the current day.
