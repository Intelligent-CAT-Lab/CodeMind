<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in three numbers as input, separated by spaces.
The numbers are stored in a list called a, t, and r.
The code then calculates the product of t and r, and divides it by a.
The result is then printed.

In this case, the input is 180, 120, and 90.
The product of 120 and 90 is 10800.
Dividing 10800 by 180 gives 62.5.

<<<Output>>>
62.5
