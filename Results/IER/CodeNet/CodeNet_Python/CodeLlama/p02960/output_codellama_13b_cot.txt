  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input string S as input.
It then calculates the length of the string l and initializes a 2D array dp with dimensions (l+1)x13.
The variable mod is initialized to 10^9+7, which is used for modular arithmetic.
The first row of dp is initialized with all zeros, except for the first element which is set to 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each character s in the input string S.
For each character s, the code iterates over each possible value of j in the range [0,12].
If the character s is a question mark (?), the code adds the contribution of all possible digits (0-9) to the current value of dp[i+1][j].
The contribution of each digit is calculated using the formula ((j*10)+k)%13, where k is the digit.
The code then updates the value of dp[i+1][j] using the modulo operator (%).
If the character s is not a question mark, the code adds the contribution of the digit represented by s to the current value of dp[i+1][j].
The contribution of the digit is calculated using the formula ((j*10)+int(s))%13.
The code then updates the value of dp[i+1][j] using the modulo operator (%).
After the loop finishes, the code prints the value of dp[l][5], which is the final answer.
