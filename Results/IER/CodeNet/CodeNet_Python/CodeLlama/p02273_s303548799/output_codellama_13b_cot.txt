  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input n from the user.
It then initializes two lists p1 and p2 with two elements each, with the first element of each list set to 0 and the second element of each list set to 0.
The code then calls the function f with the arguments n, p1, and p2.
The function f takes three arguments: n, p1, and p2.
It first checks if n is equal to 0, and if so, it returns without doing anything.
It then initializes three empty lists s, t, and u.
It then calculates the first element of s and t using the formula (2*p1[0] + p2[0])/3 and (p1[0] + 2*p2[0])/3, respectively.
It then calculates the first element of u using the formula ((t[0]-s[0])*math.cos(math.radians(60)) - (t[1]-s[1])*math.sin(math.radians(60)) + s[0]).
It then calculates the second element of u using the formula ((t[0]-s[0])*math.sin(math.radians(60)) + (t[1]-s[1])*math.cos(math.radians(60)) + s[1]).
It then calls the function f with the arguments n-1, p1, and s.
It then prints the first element of s and the second element of s.
It then calls the function f with the arguments n-1, s, and u.
It then prints the first element of u and the second element of u.
It then calls the function f with the arguments n-1, u, and t.
It then prints the first element of t and the second element of t.
It then calls the function f with the arguments n-1, t, and p2.
It then prints the first element of p2 and the second element of p2.
The code then prints the first element of p1 and the second element of p1.
It then calls the function f with the arguments n, p1, and p2.
The code then prints the first element of p2 and the second element of p2.
