  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module and sets the recursion limit to 10^6.
The code then takes in three inputs: n, a, and b.
The function pop_count is defined, which takes in an integer x and returns the number of set bits in x.
The code then checks if the number of set bits in a^b is even or odd. If it is even, it prints "NO", otherwise it prints "YES".
The function f is defined, which takes in three inputs: m, x, and y.
The function first checks if m is equal to 1, and if so, it checks if x is equal to 0. If so, it returns [0, 1], otherwise it returns [1, 0].
If m is not equal to 1, the function calculates the number of set bits in x and y, and then calculates the difference between them.
It then calculates s and t, which are the values of x and y with the set bits in the same position as x and y, respectively.
It then calculates u, which is the value of s with the set bits in the same position as y.
It then calls the function f recursively on the values of m-1, s, and u, and stores the result in left.
It then calls the function f recursively on the values of m-1, u, and t, and stores the result in right.
It then checks if the set bits in x and y are in the same position, and if so, it returns the values of left and right.
If the set bits in x and y are not in the same position, it calculates the values of x_bit and y_bit, which are the values of the set bits in x and y, respectively.
It then calculates the values of left and right, which are the values of x and y with the set bits in the same position as x and y, respectively.
It then returns the values of left and right.
The code then calls the function f with the values of n, a, and b, and prints the result.
