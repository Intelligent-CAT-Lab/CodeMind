  <<<Analysis>>>
The input string is "1101".
The function solve() is called with this string as an argument.
The function solve() first initializes the variables res, length, n, used, cnt_temp, st, switch_count, cnt_1_even, and cnt_1_odd to 0, 0, 4, [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, and 0, respectively.
The function then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider the characters of the input string.
For each character i in this range, the function checks if it is equal to "1". If it is, the function increments length by 1 and adds (length + 1) // 2 to res. The function also sets used[i] to 1.
The function then enters another loop that iterates from 0 to n-1 (inclusive). For each character i in this range, the function checks if used[i] is 0. If it is, the function increments cnt_temp by 1. If cnt_temp is odd, the function increments length by 1 and adds (length + 1) // 2 to res. The function also sets used[i] to 1.
The function then calculates the number of unused characters (cnt_unused) by subtracting the sum of used from n.
The function then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n-1 (inclusive). For each character i in this range, the function checks if used[i] is 0. If it is, the function increments switch_count by 1. The function also sets st to i + 1 and resets cnt_1_even and cnt_1_odd to 0.
For each character i in this range, the function checks if used[i] is 0. If it is, the function increments switch_count by 1. The function also sets st to i + 1 and resets cnt_1_even and cnt_1_odd to 0.
The function then calculates the number of switched characters (switched) by dividing switch_count by 2 and adding 1.
The function then calculates the number of non-switched characters (non_switched) by subtracting switched from cnt_unused.
The function then adds cnt_1_even * non_switched + cnt_1_odd * switched to res.
The function then returns res.
