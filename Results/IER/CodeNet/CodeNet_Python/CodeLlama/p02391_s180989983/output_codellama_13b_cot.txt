<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, separated by a space.
The variables a and b are initialized to the values of the two integers.
The code then checks if a is greater than b, and if so, prints "a > b".
If a is less than b, it prints "a < b".
If a is equal to b, it prints "a == b".
The code does not have any other branches, so it will only print one of the three messages.
<<<Output>>>
a < b
