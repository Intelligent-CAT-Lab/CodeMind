  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in three inputs: n, x, and y.
n is the number of elements in the list, x is the index of the element to be removed, and y is the index of the element to be inserted.
The code initializes a list called ans with n-1 elements, each initialized to 0.
The code then enters a nested loop that iterates over the range of indices from 0 to n-2.
For each iteration, the code calculates the difference between the current index and the index of the element to be removed (a), and the difference between the current index and the index of the element to be inserted (b).
The code then updates the value of the element at the minimum of a and b to the current value plus 1.
The code then prints the updated values of the list ans.
<<<Output>>>
[0, 1, 1, 1, 1]
