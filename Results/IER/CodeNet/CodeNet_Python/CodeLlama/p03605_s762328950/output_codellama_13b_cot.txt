<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input N from the user.
It then checks if the last digit of N is 9 using the modulo operator (%).
If the last digit is 9, the code prints "Yes".
If the last digit is not 9, the code checks if the first digit of N is 9 by dividing N by 10 and checking if the result is 9.
If the first digit is 9, the code prints "Yes".
If neither of the above conditions are met, the code prints "No".

In this case, the input is 29, so the last digit is 9, so the code prints "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
