  <<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function main() that takes an integer input N from the user.
The function then iterates from 1 to SIZE+1 (inclusive), which is 4501 in this case.
For each value of n in this range, the code checks if n(n+1) is less than 2N and 2N is less than or equal to (n+1)(n+2). If this condition is met, the code breaks out of the loop and sets n to n+1.
The code then calculates the difference between n(n+1)//2 and N, which is 1 in this case.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n+1 (inclusive), which is 2 in this case.
For each value of i in this range, the code checks if i is equal to the difference calculated earlier. If it is, the code skips to the next iteration.
Otherwise, the code prints the value of i.
The code then returns from the function.

The code then checks if the module name is "main" and if it is, it calls the main() function.
