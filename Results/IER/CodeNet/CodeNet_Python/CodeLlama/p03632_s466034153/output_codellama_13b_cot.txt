<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in four integers as input, A, B, C, and D.
The code then calculates the difference between the minimum of B and D and the maximum of A and C.
If this difference is greater than or equal to 0, the code prints the difference.
If the difference is less than 0, the code prints 0.

In this case, the input is 0, 75, 25, and 100.
The minimum of B and D is 25, and the maximum of A and C is 75.
The difference between 25 and 75 is 50, which is greater than 0.
The code prints 50.
<<<Output>>>
50
