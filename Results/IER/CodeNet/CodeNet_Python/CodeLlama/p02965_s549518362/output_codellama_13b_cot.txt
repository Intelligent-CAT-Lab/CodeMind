  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports several modules, including collections, heapq, sys, math, bisect, and random.
It then defines several functions, including LI, I, LS, S, IR, LIR, SR, and LSR. These functions are used to read input from the user and perform various operations.
The code then sets the recursion limit to 1000000.
The main part of the code begins with a series of if-else statements that check the value of n. If n is less than or equal to 1000000000, the code prints 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, n. Otherwise, it calculates the square root of n and stores it in b. If b^2 is equal to n, the code prints 0, 0, b, 0, 0, n//b and returns.
If b^2 is not equal to n, the code sets x to b and m to b*x-n. If m is less than 0, it increments b and x and sets m to b*x-n.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of n to 1. For each integer a in this range, it checks if n is divisible by a. If it is, the code prints 0, 0, x, n//a, a, b and returns.
If none of the above conditions are met, the code prints 0, 0, x, n//a, a, b, where a and b are the largest integers less than or equal to the square root of n and n//a, respectively.
