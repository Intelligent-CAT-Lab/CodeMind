  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the math module, which provides mathematical functions.
The variable N is initialized to the input value, which is 8 in this case.
The variable factors is initialized to an empty list, which will be used to store the factors of N.
The variable d is initialized to the square root of N, which is 2.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to d+1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 3.
For each number i in this range, it checks if N is divisible by i. If it is, it appends i and N//i (the integer division of N by i) to the factors list.
The code then enters another loop that iterates over the factors list. For each factor f, it checks if f is equal to 1. If it is, it skips the current iteration and moves on to the next one.
If f is not equal to 1, the code calculates the values of s and t using the formula s = N/f-1 and t = N%f-1.
If s is equal to t, the code adds f-1 to the variable ans.
After the loops finish, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 3.
