<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in three integers as input, separated by spaces.
The variables a, b, and c are initialized to the first, second, and third integers, respectively.
The code then checks if a is equal to b, and if so, prints c.
If b is equal to c, the code prints a.
If none of the above conditions are met, the code prints b.

In this case, a is equal to b, so the code prints c, which is 5.
<<<Output>>>
5
