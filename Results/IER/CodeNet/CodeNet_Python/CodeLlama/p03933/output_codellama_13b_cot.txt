  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module and the numpy module.
The code then defines a function called test that takes a single argument x.
The function first calculates the sine of each angle in the triangle using the numpy.arange function.
The function then calculates the cosine of the difference between each angle and the angle of the triangle using the numpy.arccos function.
The function then calculates the upper and lower bounds of the angles that satisfy the condition using the numpy.minimum and numpy.maximum functions.
The function then calculates the number of angles that satisfy the condition using the numpy.sum function.
The function then returns the number of angles that do not satisfy the condition.
The code then defines a variable called left and sets it to 0.
The code then defines a variable called right and sets it to 4.
The code then enters a loop that iterates 100 times.
The loop calculates the midpoint of the current interval using the left and right variables.
The loop then calls the test function with the midpoint as an argument.
If the test function returns True, the loop sets the left variable to the midpoint.
If the test function returns False, the loop sets the right variable to the midpoint.
The loop then repeats the process until the left and right variables are equal.
The code then prints the midpoint of the final interval.
