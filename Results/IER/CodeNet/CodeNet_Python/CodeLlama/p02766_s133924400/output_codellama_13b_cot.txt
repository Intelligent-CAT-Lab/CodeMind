<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs from the user, n and k, and stores them in variables n and k, respectively.
The code then initializes a variable res to 0.
The code enters a while loop that runs while n is greater than 0.
In each iteration of the loop, the code adds 1 to res and then divides n by k.
The loop continues until n becomes 0.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of res, which is 4.
<<<Output>>>
