<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in three integers N, A, and B as input.
The variable N is not used in the code, so it can be ignored.
The variables A and B are initialized to 5 and 4, respectively.
The code then calculates the difference between A and B, which is 1.
The code checks if the difference is divisible by 2, which it is not.
The code then prints the string "Alice".
<<<Output>>>
Alice
