  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module, which is used to exit the program.
The variable N is initialized to the input given by the user, which is 2 in this case.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 2N+1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 4.
For each number n in this range, it enters another loop that iterates from 1 to N+1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 3.
For each number w in this range, it calculates the value of h using the formula h = w*n*N // (4*w*n-(n+w)*N).
The code then checks if h is greater than 0 and if h*(4*w*n-(n+w)*N) - w*n*N is equal to 0. If both conditions are met, it prints h, n, and w and exits the program using sys.exit().
The code will only print the first set of values that meet these conditions, which are h=2, n=2, and w=1.
