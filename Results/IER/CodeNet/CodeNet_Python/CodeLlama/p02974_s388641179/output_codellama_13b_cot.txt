  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes in two inputs, N and K, and initializes a 3D array dp with dimensions (N+1) x (N+1) x (K+N*2+1).
The code then initializes the first element of dp to 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to N-1, meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to N-1.
For each number i in this range, it enters another loop that iterates from 0 to i, meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to i.
For each number j in this range, it enters another loop that iterates from 0 to K+1, meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to K+1.
The code calculates the value of dp[i+1][j][k+j*2] and dp[i+1][j+1][k+(j+1)*2] based on the values of dp[i][j][k], j*2, and (j+1)*2.
The code also calculates the value of dp[i+1][j][k+j*2] based on the values of dp[i][j][k], j*2, and j*j.
The code then prints the final value of dp[N][0][K].
