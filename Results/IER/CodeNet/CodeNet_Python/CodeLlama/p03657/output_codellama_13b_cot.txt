  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, a and b, and splits them into two variables.
The code then checks if a is divisible by 3, if b is divisible by 3, or if the sum of a and b is divisible by 3.
If any of these conditions is met, the code prints "Possible", otherwise it prints "Impossible".
<<<Output>>>
Possible
