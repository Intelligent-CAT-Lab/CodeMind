<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, separated by a space.
The first integer is assigned to variable a, and the second integer is assigned to variable b.
The code then multiplies a and b and prints the result.

In this case, the input is 20 and 2, so the output would be 40.
<<<Output>>>
40
