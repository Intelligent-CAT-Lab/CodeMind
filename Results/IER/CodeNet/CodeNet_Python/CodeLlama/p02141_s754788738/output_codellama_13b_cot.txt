  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes in the input as a string and splits it into a list of integers.
The list is then multiplied by 2 using the map function.
The resulting list is then assigned to the variables W, H, w, h, x, and y.
The code then calculates the coordinates of the rectangle's corners using the variables W, H, w, and h.
The code then calculates the midpoint of the rectangle using the variables x1, y1, x2, and y2.
The code then calculates the ratio of the midpoint's y-coordinate to its x-coordinate.
The code then prints the ratio to 10 decimal places.
<<<Output>>>
0.6
