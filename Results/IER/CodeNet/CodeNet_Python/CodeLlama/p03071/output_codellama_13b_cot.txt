<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers A and B as input, separated by a space.
The variable A is initialized to 5 and variable B is initialized to 3.
The code then creates a list with three elements: A+B, 2*A-1, and 2*B-1.
The list is [8, 9, 5].
The code then prints the maximum value in the list, which is 9.
<<<Output>>>
9
