The code first imports the sys module and defines the input function as sys.stdin.readline.
It then maps the input to the variables h, w, and k using the map function.
The code then defines a mod variable as 10^9+7.
The code then checks if w is equal to 1, and if it is, it prints 1 and returns.
The code then defines a fib variable as a list of the first 100 Fibonacci numbers.
The code then defines a dp variable as a 2D list of size h*w.
The code then sets the first two elements of the first row of dp to fib[w-2] and fib[w-3], respectively.
The code then enters a nested loop that iterates over the rows and columns of dp.
For each element in dp, the code calculates the value using the formula (dp[i-1][j]*fib[j-1]*fib[w-2-j])%mod.
The code then checks if j is greater than or equal to 1, and if it is, it adds the value of (dp[i-1][j-1]*fib[j-2]*fib[w-2-j])%mod to the current element.
The code then checks if j is less than or equal to w-2, and if it is, it adds the value of (dp[i-1][j+1]*fib[j-1]*fib[w-3-j])%mod to the current element.
The code then prints the value of dp[-1][k-1].
