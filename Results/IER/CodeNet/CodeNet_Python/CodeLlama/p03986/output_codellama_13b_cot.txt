The variable X is initialized to the input string "TSTTSS".
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the number of "T"s in the input string.
The variable memo is initialized to 0, which will be used to keep track of the number of "T"s encountered so far.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the characters in the input string X.
For each character i in the input string, it checks if i is equal to "T". If it is, it increments the value of memo by 1. If it is not, it decrements the value of memo by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of memo multiplied by 2, which is 4.
<<<Output>>>
4
