  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first reads the input from stdin and splits it into a list of integers using the split() method.
The list is then assigned to the variables A, B, C, X, and Y.
The code then checks if A + B is less than or equal to 2 * C. If this condition is met, it prints the result of A * X + B * Y.
If the condition is not met, the code enters a loop that iterates from 2 * 10^5 + 1 to 2 * 10^5 + 1.
For each value of Z, the code calculates the cost of producing Z units of the product using the formula (max(0, X - Z // 2)) * A + (max(0, Y - Z // 2)) * B + Z * C.
The code then updates the minimum cost to the minimum of the current cost and the previous minimum cost.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final minimum cost.
<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will depend on the input given.
If the input is 1500 2000 1600 3 2, the output will be 1600.
