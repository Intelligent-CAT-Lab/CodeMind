  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in four integers A, B, C, and K as input.
The code then initializes a variable sum to 0.
The code then checks if K is greater than or equal to A. If it is, it sets sum to A and subtracts A from K. If not, it sets sum to K and sets K to 0.
The code then checks if K is greater than or equal to B and greater than 0. If it is, it subtracts B from K. If not, it sets K to 0.
The code then checks if K is greater than or equal to C and greater than 0. If it is, it subtracts C from sum. If not, it subtracts K from sum.
The code then prints the final value of sum.
