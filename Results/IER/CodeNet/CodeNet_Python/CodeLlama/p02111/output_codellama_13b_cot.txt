  The output of the code is:

A) Hello, Alice!
Hello, Bob!

Explanation:
The code defines a function called `greet` that takes a single argument `name` and prints a greeting message using the `print` function. The function is then called twice with different arguments, first with "Alice" and then with "Bob". The output of the function is the greeting message, which is printed to the console. Therefore, the output of the code is "Hello, Alice!" followed by "Hello, Bob!". Option B is incorrect because the order of the greetings is reversed. Option C is incorrect because the function is called twice with the same argument, so the output will be the same. Option D is incorrect because the function is called twice with different arguments, so the output will be different.
