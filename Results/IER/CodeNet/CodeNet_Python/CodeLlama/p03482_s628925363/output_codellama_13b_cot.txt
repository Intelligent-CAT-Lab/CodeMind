The code first takes input from the user and stores it in a variable s.
The length of the string is calculated and stored in a variable n.
The variable ans is initialized to n, which will be used to store the final answer.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (exclusive).
For each index i in this range, the code checks if the character at index i is the same as the character at index i-1.
If they are the same, the code continues to the next iteration of the loop.
If they are not the same, the code calculates the minimum of the current value of ans and the maximum of i and n-i.
The minimum is taken to ensure that the answer is always non-negative.
The maximum is taken to ensure that the answer is always the smallest possible value.
The code then updates the value of ans with the new minimum value.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans.
