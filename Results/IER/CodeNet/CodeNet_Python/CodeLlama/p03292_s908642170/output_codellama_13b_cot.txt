<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user and splits it into a list of strings using the split() method.
The list is then converted to a list of integers using a list comprehension.
The list is then sorted using the sorted() method.
The code then prints the difference between the second and first elements of the list, and the third element minus the second element.

In this case, the input is "1 6 3", which is split into a list of strings ["1", "6", "3"].
The list comprehension converts it to a list of integers [1, 6, 3].
The sorted() method sorts the list, resulting in [1, 3, 6].
The code then prints (6-1) + (3-1), which is 5.

<<<Output>>>
5
