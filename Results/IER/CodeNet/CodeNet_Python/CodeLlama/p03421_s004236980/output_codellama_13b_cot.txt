  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes in three inputs N, A, and B.
The code then checks if N is greater than A*B or less than A+B-1. If this condition is met, the code prints -1 and exits.
The code then initializes a list P with B empty lists.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive). For each number i in this range, it appends i+1 to the list P[i//A].
The code then reverses the list P.
The code then enters another loop that iterates from 0 to B-1. For each number i in this range, it checks if the length of the list P[i] is 0. If it is, it appends the last element of the list P[-((N-i-1)//A+1)][-1] to P[i] and then deletes the last element of the list P[-((N-i-1)//A+1)][-1].
The code then enters a third loop that iterates from 0 to B-1. For each number i in this range, it enters a nested loop that iterates from 0 to the length of the list P[i]-1. For each number j in this range, it appends the element P[i][j] to the list Q.
The code then prints the list Q.
