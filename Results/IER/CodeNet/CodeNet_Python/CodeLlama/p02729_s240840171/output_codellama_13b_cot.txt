<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers N and M as input, separated by a space.
The variable count is initialized to 0.
The code checks if N is not equal to 0 and if it is, it calculates the sum of the first N natural numbers and stores it in count.
The code then checks if M is not equal to 0 and if it is, it calculates the sum of the first M natural numbers and stores it in count.
The code then prints the final value of count.
