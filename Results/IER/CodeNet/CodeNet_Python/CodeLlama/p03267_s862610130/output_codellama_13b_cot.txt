  <<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function solve(l) that takes an integer l as input.
The function first calculates the value of n, which is the smallest integer greater than or equal to the logarithm of l to the base 2.
The function then initializes an empty list E and enters a loop that iterates from n-1 to 0 (inclusive).
For each value of i in this range, the code calculates the value of x = 2**i.
If i is not equal to n-1, the code appends two tuples to E: (i, i+1, 0) and (i, i+1, x).
If l - x is greater than or equal to 2**(n-1), the code appends a tuple (i, n-1, l-x) to E.
The code then prints the values of n and the length of E.
Finally, the code iterates over the elements of E and prints each tuple.

The code then calls the function solve with the input l = 4.
