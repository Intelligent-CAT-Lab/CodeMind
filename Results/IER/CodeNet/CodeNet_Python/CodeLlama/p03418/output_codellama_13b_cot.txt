  <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N and variable K are initialized to 5 and 2, respectively.
The variable count is initialized to 0.
The code enters a loop that iterates from K + 1 to N + 1, which is from 3 to 6.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the number of multiples of i that are less than or equal to N + 1.
The formula for this is ((N + 1) // i) * (i - K) + max(0, (N + 1) % i - K).
The first term in the formula is the number of multiples of i that are less than or equal to N + 1, and the second term is the number of multiples of i that are greater than N + 1 but less than or equal to N + 1.
The code then adds the result of this formula to count.
The loop finishes and the code prints the final value of count, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
