  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first defines two functions: getprime and factorization.
getprime takes an integer n as input and returns a list of prime numbers less than or equal to n.
factorization takes an integer n as input and returns a dictionary of its prime factors and their exponents.
The code then defines two variables n and p, and assigns them the values 3 and 24, respectively.
The code then checks if p is equal to 1, and if so, prints 1 and exits.
If p is not equal to 1, the code calculates the factorization of p using the factorization function.
It then iterates over the keys of the factorization dictionary and calculates the product of the prime factors raised to the power of their exponents.
The code then prints the final product.
