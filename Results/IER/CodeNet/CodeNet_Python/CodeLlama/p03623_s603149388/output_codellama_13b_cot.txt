<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in three inputs: x, a, and b.
The variable x is initialized to 5, a is initialized to 2, and b is initialized to 7.
The code calculates the absolute difference between x and a, which is 3.
The code calculates the absolute difference between x and b, which is 2.
The code checks if the absolute difference between x and a is less than the absolute difference between x and b.
Since 3 is less than 2, the code prints "A".
<<<Output>>>
A
