  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input as a list of integers and assigns them to variables N, A, and B.
The code then calculates the number of groups that can be formed by dividing N by A+B.
The code then calculates the remainder when N is divided by A+B.
The code then checks if the remainder is greater than A. If it is, it prints the number of groups multiplied by A plus A. Otherwise, it prints the number of groups multiplied by A plus the remainder.
