  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first maps the input string to two integers H and W using the map() function.
The code then defines four functions: pat1, pat2, pat3, and pat4.
pat1 and pat2 are simple functions that return 0 if the input is divisible by 3, and the input otherwise.
pat3 and pat4 are more complex functions that calculate the minimum and maximum values of the area of the rectangle, respectively.
The code then calls these functions and stores the minimum value in the variable ans.
Finally, the code prints the value of ans.
