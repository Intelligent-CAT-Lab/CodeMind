<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, separated by a space.
The variables a and b are initialized to the values of the input.
The variable c is initialized to the average of a and b.
The variable d is initialized to the integer part of c.
The code checks if c-d is greater than 0. If it is, it prints d+1. Otherwise, it prints d.
