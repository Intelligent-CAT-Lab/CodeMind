<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, separated by a space.
The first integer is assigned to variable a, and the second integer is assigned to variable b.
The code then calculates the difference between a and 2 times b, and takes the maximum of 0 and this difference.
The maximum is taken because the code only wants to print a positive value.
The final value is then printed.
