<<<Analysis>>>
The code imports the sys module, which provides access to the standard input and output streams.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the lines of input from the standard input stream.
For each line, it splits the line into a list of words using the split() method, and then takes the first word and converts it to an integer using the int() method.
The code then prints the cube of the integer using the ** operator.
The loop will run until the standard input stream is exhausted, which will happen when the user presses the Enter key.
