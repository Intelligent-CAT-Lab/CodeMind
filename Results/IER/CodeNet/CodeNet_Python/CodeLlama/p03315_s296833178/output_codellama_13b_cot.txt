<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes the input string s from the user.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each character in the string s.
For each character i in the string, the code checks if it is equal to '+' or '-'.
If it is equal to '+', the code increments the variable ans by 1.
If it is equal to '-', the code decrements the variable ans by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans.
