  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in three integers a, b, and c as input.
The variables x, y, and z are initialized to the maximum, minimum, and sum of the three numbers, respectively.
The code checks if the difference between z and y is even or odd.
If it is even, the code prints x minus z plus the difference between z and y divided by 2.
If it is odd, the code prints x minus z plus 1 plus the difference between z and y plus 1 divided by 2.
