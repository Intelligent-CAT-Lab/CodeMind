  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the math module and defines a variable inf with the value of infinity.
The variable s is initialized to the input string "abaababaab".
The code then removes the last character of s, which is "b".
The code then checks if the length of s is odd, and if it is, it removes the last character again, which is "a".
The variable N is initialized to the length of s, which is 9.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to N-1 (inclusive).
For each iteration, the variable h is initialized to the integer value of the length of s divided by 2.
The code then checks if the substring of s starting from the first character and ending at the h-1th character is equal to the substring of s starting from the h+1th character and ending at the last character.
If this condition is met, the code prints the length of s and quits.
The code then removes the last two characters of s and repeats the process.
The code quits when the length of s is 0.
