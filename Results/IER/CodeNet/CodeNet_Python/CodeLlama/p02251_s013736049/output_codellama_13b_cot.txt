The variable n is initialized to 100, which is the input given to the code.
The variable coin is initialized to [25,10,5,1], which are the denominations of coins.
The variable sum_s is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the number of coins.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the elements of the list coin.
For each element i in coin, it calculates the number of coins that can be made using that denomination and stores it in sent.
The code then updates the value of n by subtracting the number of coins made using the current denomination from it.
The code then adds the number of coins made using the current denomination to sum_s.
The loop continues until all the elements of the list coin have been processed.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_s, which is 4.
<<<Output>>>
4
