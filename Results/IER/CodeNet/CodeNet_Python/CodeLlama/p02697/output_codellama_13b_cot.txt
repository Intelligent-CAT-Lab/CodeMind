  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes in two inputs N and M.
N is assigned the value 4, and M is assigned the value 1.
The code then initializes variables a, b, c, and d to 1, N//2, N//2+1, and N, respectively.
The code then checks if N is even or odd using the modulo operator.
If N is even, the code increments a by 1.
The code then enters a while loop that iterates M times.
For each iteration, the code prints the values of c and d, then increments c and decrements d.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the values of a and b.
<<<Output>>>

2 3
1 2
1 1
