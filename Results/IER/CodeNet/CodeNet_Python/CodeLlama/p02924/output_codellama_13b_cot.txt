<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input n from the user and then prints the value of the expression (n-1)*n//2.
The expression is evaluated as follows:

1. (n-1)*n is calculated, which is equal to n^2 - n.
2. The result is then divided by 2, which is n^2 - n//2.

Therefore, the output of the code is n^2 - n//2.
