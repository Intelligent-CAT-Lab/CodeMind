The output of the code will depend on the input given. If the input is `2 3 1 1`, the output will be `1`.

Here's how the code processes the input:

1. The code reads the input as a string of four integers separated by spaces.
2. It splits the string into a list of integers using the `split()` method.
3. It maps the list to the variables `h`, `w`, `a`, and `b`.
4. It defines the list `points` that contains all the points in a rectangle with height `h` and width `w`, with the top-left corner at (0, 0) and the bottom-right corner at (h-1, w-1).
5. It defines the lists `former` and `latter` that contain the binomial coefficients of the points in `points` with respect to the x-axis and y-axis, respectively.
6. It calculates the sum of the products of the elements in `former` and `latter`, and prints the result modulo 1000000007.

In this case, the output will be `1`, because the binomial coefficient of 2 and 1 is 1, and the binomial coefficient of 3 and 1 is also 1. Therefore, the sum of the products of the elements in `former` and `latter` is 1.
