  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes in three integers a, b, and c as input.
The code then checks if a is less than b. If it is, it checks if c is less than a. If it is, it prints c and b. If b is less than c, it prints a and c. Otherwise, it prints a and b.
If a is not less than b, it checks if c is less than b. If it is, it prints c and a. If a is less than c, it prints b and c. Otherwise, it prints b and a.
The output of the code depends on the values of a, b, and c.
