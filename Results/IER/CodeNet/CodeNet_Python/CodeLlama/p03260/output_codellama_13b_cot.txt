<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, separated by a space.
The first integer is assigned to variable a, and the second integer is assigned to variable b.
The code then checks if both a and b are odd numbers by using the modulo operator (%).
If both a and b are odd numbers, the code prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
