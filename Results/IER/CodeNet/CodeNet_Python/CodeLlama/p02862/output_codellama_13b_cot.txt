  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first defines two functions: xgcd and modinv.
xgcd is a function that calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.
modinv is a function that calculates the modular multiplicative inverse of a number modulo a prime number.
The code then defines a constant MOD equal to 10^9+7.
The code then reads two integers x and y from the input and stores them in variables x and y, respectively.
The code then checks if the sum of x and y is divisible by 3 and if 3x is less than or equal to the sum of x and y, and if 3y is less than or equal to the sum of x and y. If either of these conditions is not met, the code prints 0 and exits.
The code then calculates the value of n as the sum of x and y divided by 3.
The code then calculates the values of x, y, and n modulo MOD using the modinv function.
The code then calculates the value of c as the product of the modular multiplicative inverses of x and y modulo MOD, and the value of n modulo MOD.
The code then prints the value of c modulo MOD.
