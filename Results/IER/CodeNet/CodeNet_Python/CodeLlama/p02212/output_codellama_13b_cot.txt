The code first takes the input as a string, splits it into a list of integers using the split() method, and then maps each element to an integer using the map() method.
The resulting list is then sorted using the sorted() method.
The code then calculates the absolute difference between the sum of the first and third elements and the sum of the second and fourth elements.
The output is then printed.
