  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the numpy library as np.
The variable N is initialized to 15, which is the input given to the code.
The function Num_Each_Digit is defined, which takes two arguments: N and limit.
The function first checks if N is less than 10^limit, which is 10^10 in this case.
If N is less than 10^limit, the function enters a loop that iterates from 1 to limit+1.
For each iteration, the function calculates the remainder of N divided by 10^i, where i is the current iteration number.
If i is 1, the function appends the remainder to the ans array.
If i is greater than 1, the function appends the difference between the remainder and the remainder of N divided by 10^(i-1) to the ans array.
The function then returns the ans array.
The function Num_Each_Digit is then called with N and 10 as arguments.
The function returns the ans array, which is [1,5].
The code then checks if N is equal to 10^(len(digit)-1), which is 10^1 in this case.
If N is equal to 10^(len(digit)-1), the code prints 10.
If N is not equal to 10^(len(digit)-1), the code prints the sum of the elements in the digit array, which is 6.
