  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input n as an integer and calculates the value of m using the formula m = int(log(n, 3)) + 2.
The code then generates all possible combinations of -1, 0, and 1 using the itertools.product function, with each combination having m elements.
The code then checks if the sum of the product of each element in the combination with the corresponding power of 3 is equal to n.
If the condition is met, the code prints the combination in the format specified in the code.
The code then breaks out of the loop and exits.
