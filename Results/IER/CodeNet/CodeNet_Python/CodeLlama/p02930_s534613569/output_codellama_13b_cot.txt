  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input N from the user.
The variable n is initialized to 0, which will be used to keep track of the number of iterations in the while loop.
The while loop runs until 2**n is greater than or equal to N. This means that the loop will run for n = 0, 1, 2, and 3.
In each iteration of the loop, the variable P is set to 2**n, which is 1, 2, 4, and 8, respectively.
The variable graph is initialized to a 2D list of size P x P, where each element is set to 0.
The for loop iterates from 1 to n+1, which means it will run for i = 1, 2, 3, and 4.
For each iteration of the outer loop, the variable k is set to 2**i, which is 2, 4, 8, and 16, respectively.
The inner for loop iterates from 0 to P-1, which means it will run for p = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
If p%k is less than k//2, the offset variable is set to p//k*k + k//2, which is 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16, respectively.
The inner for loop iterates from 0 to k//2-1, which means it will run for q = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
The element at position (p, q+offset) in the graph is set to i.
The for loop iterates from N-1 to N-2, which means it will run for i = 2 and 3.
The inner for loop iterates from i+1 to N-1, which means it will run for j = 3 and 4.
The element at position (i, j) in the graph is printed.
