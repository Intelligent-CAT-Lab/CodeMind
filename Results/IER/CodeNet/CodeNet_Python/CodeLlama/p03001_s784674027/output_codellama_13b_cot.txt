<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in four inputs, a, b, x, and y, and maps them to floats using the map() function.
The code then calculates the ratio of a and b, and checks if it is equal to x. If it is, it sets h to 1. Otherwise, it sets h to 0.
The code then prints the product of a and b divided by 2, followed by a space and the value of h.
