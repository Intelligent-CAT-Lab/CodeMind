<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input: a, b, and c.
The variable t is initialized to 0, which will be used to keep track of the time.
The code enters a loop that iterates 61 times.
For each iteration, it checks if the current time t is within the range [t % 60, t % 60 + a], which is [0, 10] in this case. If it is, it prints the current time and breaks out of the loop.
If the loop completes without breaking, it prints -1.
The code then increments t by a + b, which is 20 in this case.
The loop repeats until it reaches the end.
