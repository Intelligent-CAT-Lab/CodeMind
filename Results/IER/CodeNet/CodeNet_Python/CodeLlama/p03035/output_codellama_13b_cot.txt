<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs A and B from the user, where A is an integer and B is an integer.
The code then checks if A is greater than or equal to 13, and if it is, it prints B.
If A is between 6 and 12 (inclusive), the code divides B by 2 and prints the result.
If A is less than 6, the code prints 0.
<<<Output>>>
