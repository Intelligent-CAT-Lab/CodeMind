<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes in a string input s.
It then calculates the number of occurrences of each letter in the string using the count() method.
The code then checks if the difference between the number of occurrences of each letter is less than or equal to 1.
If this condition is met, the code prints "YES", otherwise it prints "NO".

<<<Output>>>
YES
