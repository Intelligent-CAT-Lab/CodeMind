  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in six variables a, b, c, d, e, and f.
The variables a, b, and c are initialized to 1, 2, and 10, respectively.
The variables d and e are initialized to 20 and 15, respectively.
The variable f is initialized to 200.
The code then enters a nested loop that iterates over the range of values from 0 to 30 for i, j, and k.
For each iteration, the code calculates the amount of water and sugar produced by the combination of i, j, and k.
The code checks if the total amount of water and sugar produced exceeds the limit f. If it does, the code continues to the next iteration.
The code then checks if the amount of sugar produced exceeds the limit (a*i+b*j)*e. If it does, the code continues to the next iteration.
If both conditions are met, the code calculates the amount of sugar that can be produced by adding the minimum amount of water that will bring the total amount of sugar produced to the limit f.
The code then checks if the amount of sugar produced is greater than the current maximum amount of sugar produced. If it is, the code updates the maximum amount of sugar and water produced.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the maximum amount of sugar and water produced, as well as the maximum amount of sugar produced.
