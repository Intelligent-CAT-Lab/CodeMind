  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first splits the input string into two parts: s and K.
s is the binary string "0101", and K is the integer 1.
The code then checks if K is greater than the number of "1"s in s, which is 2.
If K is greater than the number of "1"s in s, the code sets K to 0 and prints 1.
The code then initializes an empty list a and sets cnt to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the characters in s.
For each character in s, the code checks if it is "0".
If it is "0", the code appends cnt to a and sets cnt to 0.
If it is not "0", the code increments cnt.
After the loop finishes, the code appends cnt to a.
The code then reverses a.
The code then initializes a 3D list dp with dimensions (n+1) x (K+1) x (K+1), where n is the length of s.
The code also initializes two 2D lists col and dia with dimensions (K+1) x (K+1).
The code sets dp[0][0][0] to 1 and col[0][0] and dia[0][0] to 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the characters in s.
For each character in s, the code checks if it is "0".
If it is "0", the code sets dp[i][j][k] to col[j][k] and col[j][k] to dp[i][j][k].
If it is not "0", the code sets dp[i][j][k] to dp[i][j][k] + col[j][k] and col[j][k] to dp[i][j][k].
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the characters in s.
For each character in s, the code checks if it is "0".
If it is "0", the code sets dp[i][j][k] to dp[i][j][k] + dia[j][k] and dia[j][k] to dp[i][j][k].
If it is not "0", the code sets dp[i][j][k] to dp[i][j][k] + dia[j][k] - dia[j-a[i-1]-1][k-a[i-1]-1] and dia[j][k] to dp[i][j][k].
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the characters in s.
For each character in s, the code checks if it is "0".
If it is "0", the code sets dp[i][j][k] to dp[i][j][k] + col[j][k] and col[j][k] to dp[i][j][k].
If it is not "0", the code sets dp[i][j][k] to dp[i][j][k] + col[j][k] - col[j][k-1] and col[j][k] to dp[i][j][k].
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the characters in s.
For each character in s, the code checks if it is "0".
If it is "0", the code sets dp[i][j][k] to dp[i][j][k] + dia[j][k] and dia[j][k] to dp[i][j][k].
If it is not "0", the code sets dp[i][j][k] to dp[i][j][k] + dia[j][k] - dia[j-a[i-1]-1][k-a[i-1]-1] and dia[j][k] to dp[i][j][k].
The code then sets ans to 0 and enters a loop that iterates over the characters in s.
For each character in s, the code checks if it is "0".
If it is "0", the code sets ans to ans + dp[n][j][0] and dp[n][j][0] to ans.
If it is not "0", the code sets ans to ans + dp[n][j][0] - dp[n][j][0] and dp[n][j][0] to ans.
The code then prints ans.
