  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module and the math module.
The code then defines a function called main.
The function takes two arguments, a and b, from the input.
The function then calculates the sum of a and b and stores it in a variable called n.
The function then calculates the square root of n and stores it in a variable called sqrtn.
The function then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to sqrtn + 1.
For each value of i in this range, the function checks if i multiplied by i is equal to n.
If this condition is met, the function prints 'Yes' and breaks out of the loop.
If the loop completes without finding a value of i that satisfies the condition, the function prints 'No'.
The code then calls the main function.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
