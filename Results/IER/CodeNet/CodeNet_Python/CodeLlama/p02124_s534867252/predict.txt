  The output of the code is:

A) Hello, Alice!
Hello, Bob!

Explanation:
The code defines a function called `greet` that takes a single argument `name` and prints a greeting message using the `print` function. The function is then called twice with different arguments, first with "Alice" and then with "Bob". The output of the function is the concatenation of the string "Hello, " and the value of the `name` argument, followed by a newline character. Therefore, the output of the code is:

Hello, Alice!
Hello, Bob!
