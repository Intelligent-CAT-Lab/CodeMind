  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in 6 integers as input, which are assigned to variables c1, c5, c10, c50, c100, and c500, respectively.
The code then calculates the sum of these variables and stores it in the variable sum.
The sum is calculated by multiplying each variable by its corresponding value and adding them up.
The code then checks if the sum is greater than or equal to 1000, and if it is, it prints 1, otherwise it prints 0.
