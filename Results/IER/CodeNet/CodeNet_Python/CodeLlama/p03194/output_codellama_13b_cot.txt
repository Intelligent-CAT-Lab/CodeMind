  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs, n and p, from the user.
n is assigned the value 3 and p is assigned the value 24.
The code then checks if n is equal to 1, if so, it prints p.
The code then checks if p is equal to 1, if so, it prints 1.
The code then checks if n is greater than or equal to 40, if so, it prints 1.
If none of the above conditions are met, the code enters a loop that iterates from 2 to n (inclusive).
For each iteration, the code calculates the value of count as count**n.
The code then checks if tmp is less than or equal to p, if so, it multiplies ans by count and divides p by tmp.
The code then increments count by 1 and calculates tmp as count**n.
The code repeats this process until tmp is greater than p.
The code then prints the final value of ans.
<<<Output>>>
