  <<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function SumOfDigits(n) that calculates the sum of the digits of a given integer n.
The function takes an integer n as input, and returns the sum of its digits.
The code then takes three inputs from the user: n, a, and b.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n+1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits using the SumOfDigits(i) function.
The code checks if the sum of digits is within the range [a, b], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
