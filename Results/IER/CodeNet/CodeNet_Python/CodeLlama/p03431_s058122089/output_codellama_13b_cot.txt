  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes in two inputs, n and k, and initializes p to 998244353.
It then initializes f to [1], which will be used to store the values of the function.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to k, and for each iteration, it calculates the next value of f using the formula f[i+1] = -~i*f[i]%p.
The code then prints the sum of the values of f[i]*f[k-1-i]^(-1)%p for i in range(n-1,k), where the power is calculated using the pow() function.
The code then takes the modulo of the sum with p.
<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will be 1000000007.
