<<<Analysis>>>
The code imports the math module, which provides a hypot function for calculating the length of a vector.
The code then maps the input string to four variables x1, y1, x2, and y2, which are floats.
The code calculates the length of the vector from (x1, y1) to (x2, y2) using the hypot function.
The output of the code is the length of the vector.
