<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input n from the user.
It then initializes an array a with the values from 0 to n+1.
The code then initializes two variables res and time to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n+1.
For each value of i in this range, it calculates the number of times i appears in the array a.
It then calculates the sum of the products of i and the number of times it appears in the array.
The code then adds this sum to the variable res.
The code then prints the final value of res.
