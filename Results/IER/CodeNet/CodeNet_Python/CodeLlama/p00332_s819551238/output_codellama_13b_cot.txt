  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input E and Y as integers.
The code then checks if E is equal to 0. If it is, it checks if Y is between 1868 and 1911. If it is, it prints 'M' followed by the value of Y minus 1867. If Y is between 1912 and 1925, it prints 'T' followed by the value of Y minus 1911. If Y is between 1926 and 1988, it prints 'S' followed by the value of Y minus 1925. If Y is greater than 1988, it prints 'H' followed by the value of Y minus 1988.
If E is not equal to 0, the code checks if E is equal to 1. If it is, it prints the value of Y plus 1867. If E is equal to 2, it prints the value of Y plus 1911. If E is equal to 3, it prints the value of Y plus 1925. If E is greater than 3, it prints the value of Y plus 1988.
