  <<<Analysis>>>
The variable K is initialized to 15.
The code then imports the sys module and the queue module.
The code creates a queue object and adds the numbers from 1 to 9 to the queue.
The code checks if K is less than or equal to 9. If it is, it prints K and exits the program.
The code then initializes a count variable to 0.
The code enters a while loop that continues until the queue is empty.
The code retrieves the first element from the queue and increments the count variable.
The code checks if the count variable is equal to K. If it is, it prints the current element and breaks out of the loop.
The code then checks if the current element is not divisible by 10. If it is not, it adds the current element multiplied by 10 plus the current element modulo 10 minus 1 to the queue.
The code then adds the current element multiplied by 10 plus the current element modulo 10 to the queue.
The code then checks if the current element is not divisible by 10. If it is not, it adds the current element multiplied by 10 plus the current element modulo 10 plus 1 to the queue.
The code repeats this process until the queue is empty.
<<<Output>>>
