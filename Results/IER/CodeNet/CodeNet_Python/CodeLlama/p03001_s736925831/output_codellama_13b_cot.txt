  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module and uses it to read input from stdin.
It then maps the input to variables w, h, x, and y using the map function.
The code then calculates the area of a rectangle with width w and height h and stores it in ans.
The code then checks if the point (x, y) is in the center of the rectangle.
If it is, it prints the area of the rectangle and 1.
If it is not, it prints the area of the rectangle and 0.
