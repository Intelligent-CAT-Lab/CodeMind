<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs from the user, N and k, and initializes ans to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to N-1.
For each iteration, the code calculates the value of ans as (ans * k + k - 1) // (k - 1).
The loop finishes and the code prints the final value of ans.
