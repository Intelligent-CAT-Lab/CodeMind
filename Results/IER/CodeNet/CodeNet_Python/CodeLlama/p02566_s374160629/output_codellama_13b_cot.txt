  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first reads the input from stdin and stores it in the variable S.
It then calculates the length of the input string and stores it in the variable N.
The code then calls the SuffixArray function with the input string S as an argument.
The SuffixArray function returns two values, P and LCP, which are stored in the variables SA and LCP, respectively.
The code then calculates the output by subtracting the sum of the LCP array from the product of N and (N+1) divided by 2.
Finally, the code prints the output.
