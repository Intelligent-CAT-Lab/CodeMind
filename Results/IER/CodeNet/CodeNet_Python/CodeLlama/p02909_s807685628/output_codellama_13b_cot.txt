The code takes input from the user and stores it in the variable S.
The code then checks if S is equal to 'Sunny', and if it is, it prints 'Cloudy'.
The code then checks if S is equal to 'Cloudy', and if it is, it prints 'Rainy'.
The code then checks if S is equal to anything else, and if it is, it prints 'Sunny'.
Since the input is 'Sunny', the first condition is met, and the code prints 'Cloudy'.
