  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first reads a line of input from the user and stores it in the variable s.
The code then splits the input into two parts using the slice operator. The first part is stored in the variable f, and the second part is stored in the variable l.
The code then checks if the input is in the format YYMM or MMYY.
If the input is in the format YYMM, the code prints "YYMM".
If the input is in the format MMYY, the code prints "MMYY".
If the input is in neither format, the code prints "NA".
<<<Output>>>
NA
