  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers A, B, and C as input and splits them into two lists, even and odd, based on whether they are even or odd.
The code then calculates the number of pairs of integers in the lists that are within 2 units of each other.
The code first checks if there are exactly two even numbers in the list. If so, it adds 1 to the count for each even number and adds the next even number to the list.
The code then checks if there are exactly two odd numbers in the list. If so, it adds 1 to the count for each odd number and adds the next odd number to the list.
The code then sorts the list of numbers and calculates the maximum value.
The code then iterates through the list of numbers and adds the difference between the maximum value and each number to the count.
The code then prints the final count.
