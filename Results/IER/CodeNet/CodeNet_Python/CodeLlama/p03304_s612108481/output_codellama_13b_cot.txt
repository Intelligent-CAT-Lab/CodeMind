  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports several modules from the Python standard library, including sys, re, collections, math, itertools, operator, copy, and string.
It then sets the recursion limit to 10^9 and defines some constants, including INF, MOD, and pi.
The code then reads in three integers n, m, and d from standard input using the MAP() function, which splits the input on whitespace and converts each element to an integer.
The code then checks if d is not equal to 0, and if so, it prints the expression 2*(n-d)*(m-1)/n^2.
If d is equal to 0, the code prints (m-1)/n.
