  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the numpy and numba libraries.
The function solve is defined with the @nb.njit decorator, which means it is a numba-compiled function.
The function takes a single argument s, which is an array of integers.
The function first initializes several variables, including n, size, MOD, dp_can, and dp_cnt.
The function then enters a loop that iterates from n - 1 to 0 (inclusive), meaning it will consider the numbers from 0 to n - 1.
For each number i in this range, the function checks if s[i] is equal to 0. If it is, the function enters a loop that iterates from 0 to size (inclusive), meaning it will consider the numbers from 0 to size.
For each number j in this range, the function calculates the cumulative sum of dp_cnt[i + 1, j] and stores it in dp_cnt[i, j].
If s[i] is not equal to 0, the function enters a loop that iterates from 0 to size (inclusive), meaning it will consider the numbers from 0 to size.
For each number k in this range, the function calculates the cumulative sum of dp_cnt[i + 1, :, k] and stores it in dp_cnt[i, :, k].
The function then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider the numbers from 1 to n.
For each number i in this range, the function enters a loop that iterates from 0 to size (inclusive), meaning it will consider the numbers from 0 to size.
For each number j in this range, the function enters a loop that iterates from 0 to size (inclusive), meaning it will consider the numbers from 0 to size.
If dp_can[i, j, k] is not equal to 0, the function sets dp_can[i + 1, j, k] to 1.
If j is greater than 0 and s[i] is equal to 1, the function sets dp_can[i + 1, j - 1, k + 1] to 1.
If k is greater than 0 and s[i] is equal to 0, the function sets dp_can[i + 1, j + 1, k - 1] to 1.
If i is less than n - 1, the function sets dp_can[i + 2, j + 1, k] to 1.
If s[i] is equal to 0 or s[i + 1] is equal to 0, the function sets dp_can[i + 2, j, k] to 1.
If s[i] is equal to 1 or s[i + 1] is equal to 1, the function sets dp_can[i + 2, j + 1, k + 1] to 1.
The function then sets dp_can[1:, 0, 0] to 0.
The function then enters a loop that iterates from n to 0 (inclusive), meaning it will consider the numbers from n to 0.
For each number i in this range, the function enters a loop that iterates from size + 1 to 0 (inclusive), meaning it will consider the numbers from size + 1 to 0.
For each number j in this range, the function enters a loop that iterates from size + 1 to 0 (inclusive), meaning it will consider the numbers from size + 1 to 0.
If dp_can[i, j, k] is not equal to 0, the function calculates the cumulative sum of dp_cnt[i, j, k] and stores it in ans.
The function then enters a loop that iterates from i - 1 to 0 (inclusive), meaning it will consider the numbers from i - 1 to 0.
For each number h in this range, the function sets dp_can[h, a, b] to 0, where a and b are calculated based on the values of s[h] and s[h + 1].
The function then returns the value of ans.
