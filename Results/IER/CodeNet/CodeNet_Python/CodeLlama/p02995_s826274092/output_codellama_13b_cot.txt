  <<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function gcd(x,y) that calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers x and y.
The function first finds the maximum and minimum of x and y, and then uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor.
The code then takes four integers A,B,C,D as input and calculates the greatest common divisor of C and D using the gcd function.
It then calculates the number of multiples of C and D that are less than or equal to A and B, respectively, and subtracts the number of multiples of CD from A and B.
The code then prints the difference between the two numbers.
