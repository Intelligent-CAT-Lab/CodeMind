  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports various modules and sets the value of mod to 924844033.
It then reads in two integers, n and k, from standard input using the LI() function.
The code then initializes a list of lists, dp, with two zeros for each index.
The code then initializes a list, fac, with the factorial of each integer from 1 to n.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to min(n, 2*k).
For each iteration, the code calculates the index of the current iteration, idx, and updates the value of last.
The code then enters a nested loop that iterates from idx to n in steps of 2*k.
For each iteration, the code calculates the value of ndp, which is a list of lists with two zeros for each index.
The code then updates the value of ndp using the values of dp and the current index, l.
The code then updates the value of dp to ndp.
The code then updates the value of idx to idx + 2*k.
The code then updates the value of last to idx.
The code then calculates the value of ans using the values of fac, dp, and n.
The code then prints the value of ans.
