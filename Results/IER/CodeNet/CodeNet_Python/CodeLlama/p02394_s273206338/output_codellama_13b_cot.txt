  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input as a string and splits it into a tuple of integers.
The variables W, H, x, y, and r are initialized to the values of the tuple.
The code then checks if the point (x,y) is within the circle with center (x,y) and radius r.
It does this by checking if the point is within the rectangle with corners (x-r, y-r), (x+r, y-r), (x+r, y+r), and (x-r, y+r).
If the point is within the rectangle, the code prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
