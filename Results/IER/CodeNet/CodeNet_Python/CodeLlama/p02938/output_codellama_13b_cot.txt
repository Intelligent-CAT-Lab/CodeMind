  <<<Analysis>>>
The code imports the functools module and defines a function solve with two arguments L and R. The function is decorated with the lru_cache decorator, which caches the results of previous function calls to improve performance.
The function first checks if L is greater than R, and if so, returns 0.
If L is equal to 1, the function returns (1 + solve(2, R)) % MOD.
Otherwise, the function returns the sum of the results of three recursive calls to solve, each with different arguments.
The code then maps the input to the function solve and prints the result.
