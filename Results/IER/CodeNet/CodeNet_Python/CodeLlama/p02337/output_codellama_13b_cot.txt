  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module and sets the recursion limit to 10^7.
It then defines a mod variable equal to 10^9 + 7, which is used for modular arithmetic.
The code then defines a star variable, which is a 2D list of size 1001x1001.
The code then defines a search function that takes two arguments, n and k.
The function checks if n is less than k, if so, it returns 0.
If n is greater than or equal to k, it checks if the value of star[n][k] is not None, if it is, it returns star[n][k] % mod.
If star[n][k] is None, it calculates the value of star[n][k] using the formula (search(n-1, k-1) + k * search(n-1, k)) % mod.
The function then returns the value of star[n][k].
The code then maps the input to variables n and k using the map function.
The code then defines a variable ans and initializes it to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to k+1.
For each iteration, the code calls the search function with arguments n and i, where i is the current iteration number.
The code then adds the result of the search function to ans and takes the modulus of ans with mod.
The code then prints the value of ans.

<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will be 10.
