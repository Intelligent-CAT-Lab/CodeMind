  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first calculates the value of M = 8^7 = 16777216.
It then initializes the variables m, f, g, and i to M*476+1, [j:=1], [k:=1]*M, and 1, respectively.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to M (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 16777216.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [1, 1] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 1.
