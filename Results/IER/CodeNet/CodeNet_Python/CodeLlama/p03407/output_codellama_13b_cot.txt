<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user in the form of three integers A, B, and C.
The code then checks if the sum of A and B is less than C.
If the condition is met, the code prints "No", otherwise, it prints "Yes".

In this case, the input is 50, 100, and 120, respectively.
The sum of 50 and 100 is 150, which is less than 120.
Therefore, the output of the code is "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
