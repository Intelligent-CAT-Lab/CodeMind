<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user and splits it into a list of integers using the map() function.
The list is stored in the variable sw.
The code then checks if the second element of the list (sw[1]) is greater than or equal to the first element of the list (sw[0]).
If it is, the code prints "unsafe".
If it is not, the code prints "safe".
<<<Output>>>
unsafe
