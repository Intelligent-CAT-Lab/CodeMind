  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the math module, which provides mathematical functions.
The code then reads two integers n and m from the input, separated by a space.
The code then defines a variable mod as 10^9 + 7, which is a large prime number used for modular arithmetic.
The code then checks if n and m are equal, and if they are, it calculates the result as 2 times the factorial of n times the factorial of m.
The code then prints the result modulo mod, which is the remainder of the result when divided by mod.
If n and m are not equal, the code checks if the absolute difference between n and m is 1, and if it is, it calculates the result as the factorial of n times the factorial of m.
The code then prints the result modulo mod.
If neither of the above conditions are met, the code prints 0.
