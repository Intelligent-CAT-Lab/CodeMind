<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input from the user, which is a string of two numbers separated by a space.
The code then converts the string to a list of integers using the map() function.
The list is then converted to a set using the set() function, which removes any duplicates.
The length of the set is then checked to see if it is equal to 2.
If it is, the code prints 'Yes', otherwise it prints 'No'.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
