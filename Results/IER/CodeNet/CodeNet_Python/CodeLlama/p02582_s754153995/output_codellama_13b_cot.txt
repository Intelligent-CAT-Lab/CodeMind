  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module and sets the recursion limit to 100000.
It then defines a function called main() which takes no arguments.
The function first reads a line of input from the user using the readline() function.
It then checks if the input is equal to "RRR", if it is, it prints 3.
If the input is not equal to "RRR", it checks if "RR" is in the input, if it is, it prints 2.
If the input is not equal to "RRR" and "RR" is not in the input, it checks if "R" is in the input, if it is, it prints 1.
If the input is not equal to "RRR", "RR" and "R" are not in the input, it prints 0.
<<<Output>>>
1
