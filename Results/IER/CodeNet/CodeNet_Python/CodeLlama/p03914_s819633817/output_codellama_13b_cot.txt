  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes in two inputs, n and m, and initializes a 2D list dp with n+1 rows and n columns.
The code then initializes the first row of dp with 1s.
The code then enters a loop that iterates m times.
For each iteration, the code creates a new 2D list new with n+1 rows and n columns.
The code then enters a nested loop that iterates over the rows and columns of dp.
For each cell (j,k), the code calculates the value of the cell in new based on the values in dp.
The code then updates dp to be new.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the value of the cell (n,0) in dp, which is the final answer.
