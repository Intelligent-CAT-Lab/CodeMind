  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input as a string and stores it in variable l.
It then splits the string into a list of words using the split() method.
The list is then joined back into a string using the join() method.
The resulting string is then split again using the split() method, this time on the space character.
The resulting list is then iterated over, and each word is checked to see if it has a length between 3 and 6 characters.
If a word meets this criteria, it is added to a list called L.
Finally, the list L is joined back into a string using the join() method, and the resulting string is printed.
