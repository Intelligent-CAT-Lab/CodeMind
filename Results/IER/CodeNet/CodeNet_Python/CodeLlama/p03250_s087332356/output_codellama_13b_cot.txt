The code first takes input from the user and stores it in a list called a.
The input is a string, so the code uses the strip() method to remove any leading or trailing whitespace.
The code then splits the string into a list of individual numbers using the split() method.
The resulting list is stored in b.
The code then converts each element of b to an integer using a list comprehension.
The code then sorts the list b using the sort() method.
The code then prints the product of the third, second, and first elements of b, which are 2, 5, and 1, respectively.
The output of the code is 125.
