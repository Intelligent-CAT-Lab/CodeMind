  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the necessary libraries and sets the recursion limit to 10^7.
It then defines the main function, which takes in three inputs: N, K, and S.
The function first maps the input to integers and stores them in variables N, K, and S.
The function then initializes a list A with N copies of S.
If S is equal to 10^9, the function iterates through the list A and sets each element to S-1.
Otherwise, it iterates through the list A and sets each element to 10^9.
The function then joins the elements of the list A into a string and prints it.
<<<Output>>>
[3, 3, 3, 3]
