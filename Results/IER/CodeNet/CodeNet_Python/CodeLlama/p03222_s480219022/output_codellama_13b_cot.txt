  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first reads the input from the user and stores it in the variables H, W, and K.
The code then initializes the variable P to 10^9 + 7, which is a large prime number used for modular arithmetic.
The code then initializes the variable M to W + 100, which is used to calculate the Fibonacci sequence.
The code then calculates the Fibonacci sequence using the formula (fib[i] + fib[i+1]) % P, where fib[i] is the ith Fibonacci number.
The code then defines a function solve(h, k) that calculates the number of ways to place h blocks of size k on a line of length W.
The function uses the Fibonacci sequence to calculate the number of ways to place the blocks.
The function also uses the modular arithmetic to ensure that the results are within the range of the prime number P.
The code then checks if W is equal to 1, and if it is, it prints 1 and exits the program.
The code then calls the function solve(H, K) to calculate the number of ways to place H blocks of size K on a line of length W.
The code then prints the result of the function solve(H, K) and exits the program.
