<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers x and y as input, separated by a space.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of times the loop runs.
The code enters a loop that runs while x is less than or equal to y.
For each iteration, the code multiplies x by 2 and increments ans by 1.
The loop stops when x is greater than y.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is the number of times the loop ran.
