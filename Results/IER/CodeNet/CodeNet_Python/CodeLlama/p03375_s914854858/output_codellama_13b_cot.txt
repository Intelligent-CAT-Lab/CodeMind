  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes two inputs N and M from the user.
The variable fact is initialized to an array of length N+1, where each element is initialized to 1.
The variable rfact is also initialized to an array of length N+1, where each element is initialized to 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N+1, meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to N+1.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the factorial of i and stores it in fact[i].
The code also calculates the reverse factorial of i and stores it in rfact[i].
The code then defines a memoization function f(N, K) that takes two inputs N and K.
If the inputs are already in the memoization table, the function returns the value from the table.
If K is 0, the function returns N == 0.
If K is 1 or N is K, the function returns 1.
Otherwise, the function calculates the value of f(N-1, K-1) and f(N-1, K) and adds them together.
The function then stores the result in the memoization table and returns it.
The code then defines a variable S as an array of length 1, where the first element is initialized to 1.
The code then defines a variable rev2 as the power of 2, M-2, modulo M.
The code then defines a variable base as the power of 2, N, modulo M.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to N+1, meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to N+1.
For each number K in this range, the code calculates the value of r as the product of fact[N], rfact[K], and rfact[N-K].
The code then calculates the value of b as the product of base and rev2.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to K, meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to K.
For each number L in this range, the code calculates the value of s as the sum of S[L] and (L+1)*S[L+1].
The code then calculates the value of v as the sum of s and b.
The code then calculates the value of T as an array of length K+2, where the first element is initialized to 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to K, meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to K.
For each number L in this range, the code calculates the value of s as the sum of S[L] and (L+1)*S[L+1].
The code then calculates the value of v as the sum of s and b.
The code then calculates the value of b as the product of base and rev2.
The code then calculates the value of r as the product of r, v, and b.
The code then calculates the value of ans as the sum of ans and r.
The code then calculates the value of base as the product of base and rev2.
The code then prints the value of ans.

<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will depend on the input values of N and M.
If N is 2 and M is 1000000007, the output will be 500000003.
