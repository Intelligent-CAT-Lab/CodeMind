  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input n from the user.
It then initializes an array cnt of size 101 to store the number of factors of each number from 2 to 100.
The code then enters a nested loop that iterates over all numbers from 2 to n+1.
For each number i, it iterates over all numbers from 2 to n+1 and checks if i is divisible by j.
If i is divisible by j, it updates the value of cnt[j] by adding 1.
The code then initializes five variables san, go, jugo, nijugo, and shitigo to 0.
It then enters a loop that iterates over all numbers from 2 to 100.
For each number i, it checks if cnt[i] is greater than or equal to 3, 5, 15, 25, and 75, respectively.
If it is, it updates the value of the corresponding variable by adding 1.
Finally, the code prints the value of shitigo + nijugo*(san-1) + jugo*(go-1) + go*(go-1)//2*(san-2).
<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will depend on the input given by the user.
If the user enters 9 as input, the output will be 0.
