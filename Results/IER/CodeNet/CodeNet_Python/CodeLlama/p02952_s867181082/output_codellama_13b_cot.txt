  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user and stores it in the variable i.
The variable n is then initialized to the integer value of i.
The length of i is calculated and stored in the variable len.
The code then checks the value of len and performs the corresponding action.
If len is 1, the code prints the value of n.
If len is 2, the code prints 9.
If len is 3, the code prints n - 90.
If len is 4, the code prints 909.
If len is 5, the code prints n - 90 - 9000.
If len is 6, the code prints 90909.
