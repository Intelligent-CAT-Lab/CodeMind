<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input n from the user.
The variable p is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of times the loop runs.
The variable t is initialized to True, which will be used to determine whether the loop should continue running.
The code enters a loop that runs while p is less than 26.
For each iteration of the loop, the variable r is calculated as n minus 7 times p.
The code checks if r is greater than or equal to 0 and if r is divisible by 4. If both conditions are met, the variable t is set to False and the string "Yes" is printed. The loop is then exited using the break statement.
If the loop completes without breaking, the variable t is still True, and the string "No" is printed.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
