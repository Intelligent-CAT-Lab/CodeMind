  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input string and removes any trailing whitespace using the rstrip() method.
The length of the string is then calculated using the len() function.
The code then initializes an empty string called r_s, which will be used to store the reversed version of the input string.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the characters of the input string in reverse order.
For each character, the code appends it to the end of the r_s string.
The code then checks if the original string and the reversed string are the same.
If they are not, the code prints "No" and exits.
If they are the same, the code prints "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
