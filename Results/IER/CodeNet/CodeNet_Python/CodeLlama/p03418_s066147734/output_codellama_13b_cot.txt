<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs N and K from the user.
The variable count is initialized to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from K+1 to N+1.
For each number b in this range, it calculates the number of integers between b and N that are divisible by b.
It does this by first calculating (b-K)*(N//b), which is the number of multiples of b between b and N.
It then adds max(0, (N%b) - K +1), which is the number of integers between b and N that are divisible by b but not by K.
The loop finishes and the code prints the final value of count.
<<<Output>>>
10
