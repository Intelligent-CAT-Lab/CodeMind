<<<Analysis>>>
The code first initializes a dictionary called dic with keys "A", "B", "C", "D", "E", and "F" and their corresponding values 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, respectively.
The code then takes input from the user in the form of two strings X and Y.
The code then iterates over the keys of the dictionary and checks if the current key is equal to X or Y. If it is, it assigns the corresponding value to the variable x or y, respectively.
The code then checks if x is greater than y, less than y, or equal to y. If it is, it prints the corresponding symbol (">", "<", or "=") to the console.
