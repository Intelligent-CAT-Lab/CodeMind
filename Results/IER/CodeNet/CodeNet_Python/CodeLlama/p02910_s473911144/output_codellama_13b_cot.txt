<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes the input string "RUDLUDR" and stores it in variable s.
The code then initializes a flag variable flag to True.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the characters in the string s.
For each character j in the string, the code checks if the index i (which is the position of the character in the string) is even or odd.
If i is even, the code checks if j is either "L", "U", or "D". If it is not, the flag variable is set to False.
If i is odd, the code checks if j is either "R", "U", or "D". If it is not, the flag variable is set to False.
After the loop finishes, the code checks the value of the flag variable. If it is True, the code prints "Yes". If it is False, the code prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
