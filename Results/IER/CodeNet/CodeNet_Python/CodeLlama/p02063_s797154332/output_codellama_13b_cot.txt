  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first reads two integers, a and b, from standard input.
It then checks if b is divisible by a or if a is equal to 2.
If either of these conditions is true, the code prints -1 and exits.
Otherwise, the code calculates the smallest integer x such that ax is greater than or equal to b.
It then calculates the product of a and x, which is c.
If x is less than or equal to c divided by b plus c modulo b, the code prints c.
Otherwise, the code prints -1.
<<<Output>>>
-1
