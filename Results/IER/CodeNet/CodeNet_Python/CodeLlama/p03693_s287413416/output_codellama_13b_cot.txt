<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in three integers as input, r, g, and b, and stores them in variables with the same name.
The code then calculates the sum of the three numbers and stores it in the variable answer.
The code checks if the value of answer is divisible by 4, and if it is, it prints "YES", otherwise it prints "NO".

In this case, the input is 4, 3, and 2, which gives answer = 4*100 + 3*10 + 2 = 432.
432 is divisible by 4, so the code prints "YES".
<<<Output>>>
YES
