<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in four integers as input, which are stored in the variables a, b, c, and k.
The code then calculates the value of ans based on the conditions given in the if-else block.
The first condition is that if k is less than or equal to a, then ans is set to k.
The second condition is that if k is less than or equal to a+b, then ans is set to a.
The third condition is that if k is greater than a+b, then ans is set to a minus the difference between k and a+b.

Based on the input given, the value of k is 3, which is less than a+b (2+1=3), so the third condition is met.
The value of ans is then set to a minus the difference between k and a+b, which is 2-3= -1.

Finally, the code prints the value of ans, which is -1.
<<<Output>>>
-1
