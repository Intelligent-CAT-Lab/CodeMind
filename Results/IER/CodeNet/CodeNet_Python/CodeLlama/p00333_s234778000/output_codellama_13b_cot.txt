<<<Analysis>>>
The code imports the math module, which provides mathematical functions.
The code then maps the input string to three integers, w, h, and c, using the map() function.
The code calculates the greatest common divisor of w and h using the math.gcd() function.
The code then calculates the final output by multiplying w, h, and c, and dividing the result by the square of the greatest common divisor.
