The code first takes input from the user in the form of two space-separated integers x and y.
It then initializes two variables N and K to the values of x and y, respectively.
The code then checks if K is equal to 1. If it is, it prints 0. Otherwise, it prints N-K.

In this case, the input is 3 2, so N is initialized to 3 and K is initialized to 2. The code then checks if K is equal to 1, which it is not. It then prints N-K, which is 3-2=1.
