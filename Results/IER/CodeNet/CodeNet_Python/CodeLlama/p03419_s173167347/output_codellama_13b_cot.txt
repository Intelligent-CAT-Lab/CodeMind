<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, n and m, and stores them in variables n and m, respectively.
The code then checks if n and m are both equal to 1. If they are, the code prints 1.
If n or m is equal to 1, but not both, the code prints the maximum of n and m minus 2.
If none of the above conditions are met, the code prints the product of n minus 2 and m minus 2.

In this case, the input is 2 2, so n is 2 and m is 2. The code does not meet any of the above conditions, so it prints the product of n minus 2 and m minus 2, which is 0.
<<<Output>>>
0
