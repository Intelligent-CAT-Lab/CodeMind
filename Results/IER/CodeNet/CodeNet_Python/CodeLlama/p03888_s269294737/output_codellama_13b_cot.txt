<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer as input, and stores it in variable N.
The code then checks if N is even by using the modulo operator (%).
If N is even, the code prints "Even".
If N is odd, the code prints "Odd".

In this case, the input is 10, so the output would be "Even".
<<<Output>>>
Even
