<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, N and M, and stores them in a list.
The code then initializes a variable count to 0.
The code checks if N is greater than or equal to M, and if it is, it adds M//2 to count.
If N is less than M, the code checks if N*2 is less than or equal to M. If it is, it adds N to count, subtracts N*2 from M, and adds M//4 to count.
The code then prints the final value of count.
