  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input as a list of 12 integers.
The list is then sorted in ascending order.
The code then checks if the first four elements of the list are equal to each other, and if the last four elements are also equal to each other.
If both conditions are met, the code prints 'yes', otherwise it prints 'no'.

<<<Output>>>
yes
