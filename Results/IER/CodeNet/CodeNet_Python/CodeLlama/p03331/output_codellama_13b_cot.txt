  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module and defines a function called input that reads a line from the standard input and strips the newline character.
The code then reads an integer N from the input and defines a function called sum_N that takes an integer N as input and returns the sum of its digits.
The code then defines a variable ans and initializes it to a large value.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (exclusive) and calls the sum_N function on each number i and N - i.
The code then updates the value of ans to be the minimum of the current value of ans and the sum of the two values returned by the sum_N function.
The code then prints the final value of ans.
