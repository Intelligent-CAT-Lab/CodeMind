<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs, N and K, from the user.
The variable N is assigned the value 2, and the variable K is assigned the value 2.
The code then calculates the value of K multiplied by (K-1) raised to the power of (N-1), which is 2*((2-1)**(2-1)).
The result of this calculation is 2*((1)**(1)), which is 2*1, which is 2.
The code then prints the result of this calculation, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
