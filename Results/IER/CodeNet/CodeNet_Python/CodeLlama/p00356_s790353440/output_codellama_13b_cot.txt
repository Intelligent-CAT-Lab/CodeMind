The code imports the math module, which provides a function for calculating the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two numbers.
The function intersection takes two integers x and y as input and returns their greatest common divisor.
The function first calculates the gcd of x and y using the math.gcd function.
If the gcd is 1, the function returns x + y.
If the gcd is greater than 1, the function recursively calls itself with the reduced arguments x//g and y//g, where g is the gcd.
The function then multiplies the result by g and subtracts (g-1) before returning it.
The code then calls the intersection function with the input arguments 4 and 4, which are passed as a list of integers to the map function to convert them to integers.
The map function returns an iterator that yields the result of the function call, which is then passed to the print function to print the output.
