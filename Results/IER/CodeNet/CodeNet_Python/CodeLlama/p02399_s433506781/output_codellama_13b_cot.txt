<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes input from the user in the form of two numbers separated by a space.
The first number is assigned to variable a and the second number is assigned to variable b.
The code then calculates the quotient and remainder of a divided by b using the divmod() function.
The quotient is stored in variable d and the remainder is stored in variable r.
The code then calculates the floating-point division of a by b and stores the result in variable f.
The code then prints the values of d, r, and f using the format() function.

<<<Output>>>
