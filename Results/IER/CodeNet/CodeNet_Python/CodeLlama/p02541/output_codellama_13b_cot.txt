  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module and the collections module.
The code then defines a function called inv_gcd that takes two integers a and b as input and returns a tuple containing the greatest common divisor of a and b and the inverse of a modulo b.
The code then defines a function called crt that takes two lists r and m as input and returns a tuple containing the remainder and the modulus of the Chinese Remainder Theorem.
The code then defines a function called make_divisors that takes an integer n as input and returns a list of all the divisors of n.
The code then defines a function called main that takes no input and prints the output of the code.
The code then checks if the name of the module is main and if it is, it calls the main function.

The main function first takes an integer n as input and then calls the make_divisors function to get a list of all the divisors of 2n.
The main function then initializes a variable ans to n-1 if n is odd and 2n-1 if n is even.
The main function then iterates over the list of divisors and for each divisor x, it calculates the value of y as 2n//x.
The main function then initializes two lists r and m with the values [0, y-1] and [x, y] respectively.
The main function then calls the crt function with the lists r and m as input and stores the result in the variables rem and mod.
The main function then checks if rem and mod are both equal to 0 and if they are, it continues to the next iteration.
The main function then calculates the value of x as (rem-r0)//g % u1 * im % u1.
The main function then updates the values of r0 and m0 using the values of x, g, and im.
The main function then checks if r0 is less than 0 and if it is, it adds m0 to r0.
The main function then updates the value of ans to the minimum of ans and rem.
The main function then prints the value of ans.
