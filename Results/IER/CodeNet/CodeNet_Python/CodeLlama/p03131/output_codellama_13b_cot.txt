  <<<Analysis>>>
The variable K, variable A and variable B are initialized to 4, 2 and 6, respectively.
The code then checks if the difference between B and A is less than or equal to 2. If it is, it prints K + 1, which is 5.
If the difference between B and A is greater than 2, the code enters a block of code that calculates the number of cookies that can be obtained by manipulating the first number and the remaining numbers.
The code calculates the number of exchanges required for the first number, which is A + 1.
The code calculates the number of exchanges required for the remaining numbers, which is K - first_num_exchanges.
The code calculates the gain per two manipulations, which is B - A.
The code calculates the number of cookies that can be obtained by manipulating the remaining numbers, which is rest_num_exchanges // 2 * gain_per_two_manipulation + B.
The code checks if the number of exchanges required for the remaining numbers is odd, and if it is, it adds 1 to the number of cookies.
The code prints the final value of num_cookies, which is 11.
<<<Output>>>
11
