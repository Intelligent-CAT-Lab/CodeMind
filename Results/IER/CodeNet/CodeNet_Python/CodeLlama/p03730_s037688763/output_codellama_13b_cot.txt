<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in three integers a, b, and c as input.
The code then checks if any of the numbers from 1 to b (inclusive) multiplied by a is equal to c.
The condition is met when a is 7, b is 5, and c is 1.
The code prints "YES" if the condition is met, and "NO" otherwise.
<<<Output>>>
YES
