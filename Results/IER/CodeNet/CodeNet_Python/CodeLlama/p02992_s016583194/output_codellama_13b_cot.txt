  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the numpy library and defines a modulus value of 10^9 + 7.
The code then takes in two inputs, N and K, and maps them to integers.
The code then calculates the square root of N and stores it in M.
The code then calculates the sum of the reciprocals of the numbers from 1 to M and stores it in T.
The code then creates an array A of length N, where each element is equal to 1 if the corresponding index is not in T, and 0 otherwise.
The code then initializes an array dp of length N, where each element is equal to the corresponding element of A.
The code then enters a loop that iterates K - 1 times.
For each iteration, the code multiplies dp by the cumulative sum of A in reverse order, modulo the modulus value, and stores the result in dp.
The code then prints the sum of the elements of dp, modulo the modulus value.
