  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first initializes the variables g, eps, N, V, X, and Y to 9.8, 1e-10, 0, 7, 3, and 1, respectively.
The code then enters a loop that iterates N times, meaning it will consider N obstacles.
For each obstacle, it calculates the left and right boundaries of the obstacle (L and R) and the top and bottom boundaries (B and T).
If the left boundary (L) is less than the initial position of the projectile (X), it adds the obstacle to the list of obstacles.
The code then checks if the projectile can pass through the obstacles by calling the check function.
The check function first checks if the projectile is within the boundaries of the obstacle.
If it is, it calculates the velocity of the projectile at the time of impact (vx and vy) and checks if the projectile can reach the target (Y) at that time.
If the projectile can reach the target, the function returns 1, indicating that the projectile can pass through the obstacles.
If the projectile cannot reach the target, the function returns 0, indicating that the projectile cannot pass through the obstacles.
If the projectile cannot pass through any obstacle, the code prints "No" and exits.
If the projectile can pass through at least one obstacle, the code prints "Yes" and exits.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
