<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user and stores it in the variable s.
The code then checks if the third and fourth characters of the string s are the same, and if the fifth and sixth characters are the same.
If both conditions are true, the code prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
