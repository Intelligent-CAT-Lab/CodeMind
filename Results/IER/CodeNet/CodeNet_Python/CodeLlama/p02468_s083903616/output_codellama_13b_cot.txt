  <<<Analysis>>>
The function rep_pow calculates the exponentiation of a number a to the power of k modulo p.
The function takes three arguments: a, k, and p.
The function first initializes the variable ans to 1.
The function then enters a loop that iterates while k is greater than 0.
In each iteration, the function checks if k is odd by checking if k & 1 is true.
If k is odd, the function multiplies ans by a modulo p and updates ans.
The function then updates a by multiplying it by itself modulo p.
The function then shifts k to the right by 1 bit.
The function repeats this process until k is 0.
The function then returns the final value of ans.

The main function takes two inputs m and n and calls the rep_pow function with the arguments m and n.
The function prints the output of rep_pow.

<<<Output>>>
The output of the code would be 8.

The function rep_pow calculates the exponentiation of 2 to the power of 3 modulo 1000000007.
The function first initializes ans to 1.
The function then enters the loop and calculates the following values of ans:

ans = 1 * 2 % 1000000007 = 2
ans = 2 * 2 % 1000000007 = 4
ans = 4 * 2 % 1000000007 = 8

The function then returns the final value of ans, which is 8.
The main function then prints the output of rep_pow, which is 8.
