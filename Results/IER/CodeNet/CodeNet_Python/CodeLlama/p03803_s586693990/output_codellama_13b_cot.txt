  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports several modules, including sys, math, collections, itertools, array, and inspect.
It then sets the recursion limit to 1000000 using sys.setrecursionlimit(1000000).

The code then defines a function called chkprint, which takes any number of arguments and prints them out along with their names.

The code then defines a function called to_bin, which takes an integer x as input and returns its binary representation as a string.

The code then defines a function called li_input, which takes no arguments and returns a list of integers obtained by splitting the input on whitespace.

The code then defines a function called gcd, which takes two integers n and m as input and returns their greatest common divisor.

The code then defines a function called gcd_list, which takes a list of integers L as input and returns their greatest common divisor.

The code then defines a function called lcm, which takes two integers n and m as input and returns their least common multiple.

The code then defines a function called lcm_list, which takes a list of integers L as input and returns their least common multiple.

The code then defines a function called wfs_d, which takes a list of integers D, an integer N, and an integer K as input and returns a list of integers representing the shortest distance from each node to the starting node.

The code then defines a function called dfs_d, which takes a list of integers v, pre, and dist as input and returns a list of integers representing the shortest distance from each node to the starting node.

The code then defines a function called sigma, which takes an integer N as input and returns the sum of the integers from 1 to N.

The code then defines a function called comb, which takes two integers n and r as input and returns the binomial coefficient of n and r.

The code then defines a function called bisearch, which takes a list of integers L and an integer target as input and returns True if the target is in the list and False otherwise.

The code then defines a function called main, which takes no arguments and performs the following steps:

1. It takes two integers A and B as input using li_input().
2. It sets A to 14 if A is equal to 1, and sets B to 14 if B is equal to 1.
3. It prints "Alice" if A is greater than B, "Bob" if A is less than B, and "Draw" if A is equal to B.

<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will depend on the input given to the program. If the input is "8 6", the output will be "Draw".
