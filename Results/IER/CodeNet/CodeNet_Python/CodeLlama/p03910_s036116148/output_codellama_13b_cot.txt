<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input n from the user.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers from 1 to n.
The variable lst is initialized to an empty list, which will be used to store the numbers from 1 to n.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to n.
For each number i in this range, it adds i to ans and appends i to lst.
The code checks if ans is greater than or equal to n. If it is, it breaks out of the loop.
After the loop finishes, the code calculates the difference between ans and n, which is num.
If num is not equal to 0, the code removes the last element of lst that is equal to num.
The code then prints the elements of lst, which are the numbers from 1 to n that meet the condition.
