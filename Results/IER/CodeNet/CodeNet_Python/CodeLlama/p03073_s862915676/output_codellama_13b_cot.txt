  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes the input as a string and stores it in variable S.
It then creates an empty list called slist and iterates through the characters of S, appending each character to slist.
The code then initializes a variable called ans to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to the length of slist-1.
For each iteration, the code checks if the current character is equal to the next character and if both characters are either '0' or '1'.
If both conditions are met, the code increments ans by 1 and changes the next character to the opposite of the current character.
If only the first condition is met, the code increments ans by 1 and changes the next character to the opposite of the current character.
If neither condition is met, the code does nothing.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans.
