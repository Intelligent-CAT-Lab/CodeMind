  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys and random modules.
The function rd() reads a line from the standard input and removes the trailing newline character.
The function rdi() reads a line from the standard input, splits it into a list of integers, and returns the list.
The code then reads two integers K and N from the standard input using the rdi() function.
The code then checks if K is equal to 1, and if it is, it prints a string of ones with length (N+1)/2.
The code then checks if K is even, and if it is, it prints K/2 followed by N-1 copies of K.
The code then initializes a list t with N copies of K/2+1.
The code then initializes a variable j to N-1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to N/2.
For each iteration, the code checks if t[j] is equal to 1. If it is, the code decrements j. If it is not, the code decrements t[j] and sets t[j+1] to K for each k from j+1 to N.
The code then prints the list t[:j+1] as a string of integers separated by spaces.
