  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the necessary libraries: sys, numpy, and math.
It then reads the input from stdin and splits it into four variables: N, X, Y, and Z.
The code then initializes the MOD variable to 10^9 + 7, which is used for modular arithmetic.
The code then defines a function called L, which returns the maximum of 10 and X + Y + Z.
The code then defines a function called bad, which returns a boolean array indicating whether the corresponding element in the array rng is equal to the sum of the powers of 2 corresponding to X, Y, and Z.
The code then defines a function called dp, which is a numpy array of size 1 << L + 1, initialized to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates N times.
For each iteration, the code updates the value of dp using the previous value of dp and the current value of bad.
The code then calculates the answer as the difference between 10^N and the sum of the elements in dp, modulo MOD.
The code then prints the answer.
<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will depend on the input given.
For the input 3 5 7 5, the output will be 10^3 - 10^2 - 10^1 - 10^0 = 729.
