The code first initializes the variable LEN to 0 and the list SNK to [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9].
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 10, meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 10.
For each number i in this range, it appends the number i*10+9 to the list SNK.
The code then enters another loop that iterates from 1 to 10, meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 10.
For each number i in this range, it appends the number i*100+99 to the list SNK.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to 10, meaning it will consider numbers from 2 to 10.
