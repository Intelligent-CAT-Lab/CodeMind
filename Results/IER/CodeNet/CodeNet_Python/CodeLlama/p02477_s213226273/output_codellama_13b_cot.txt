  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the necessary modules: sys, collections as cl, and bisect as bs.
It then sets the recursion limit to 100000 and defines a few functions:
* l(): takes input and returns a list of integers
* m(): takes input and returns a list of integers
* onem(): takes input and returns an integer
* s(): takes a list of integers and returns a list of lists, where each sublist contains two elements: the first element is the integer, and the second element is the number of times it appears in the input list
* jo(): takes a list of integers and returns a string with each integer separated by a space
* max2(): takes a list of lists and returns the maximum value in the second element of each sublist

The code then takes input from the user and assigns it to the variables n and m.
It then prints the product of n and m, which is 40.

<<<Output>>>
40
