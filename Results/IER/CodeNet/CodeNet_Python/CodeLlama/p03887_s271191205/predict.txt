The code first imports the necessary libraries, including numpy and sys.
It then sets the recursion limit to 10^7 and defines a function called cumprod, which is used to calculate the cumulative product of an array.
The code then defines three variables, N, A, and B, which are initialized to the values of the input.
The code then checks if B is odd, and if it is, it prints 0 and exits.
The code then defines two more variables, B2 and C, which are initialized to B//2 and C//3+1, respectively.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to C//3+1, and for each iteration, it calculates the number of ways to choose m non-negative integers that sum to C-3m.
The code then calculates the number of ways to choose n non-negative integers that sum to A-n, and the number of ways to choose a non-negative integer that sums to B2.
The code then calculates the number of ways to choose a non-negative integer that sums to C-3m-(A-n), and the number of ways to choose a non-negative integer that sums to B2+A+m.
