<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an input from the user, which is a string of digits.
The variable n is initialized to this input.
The variable sn is initialized to 0, which will be used to store the sum of the digits in the input.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the length of the input string (i.e., the number of digits in the input).
For each digit in the input, it adds the digit to the variable sn.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if the input number (i.e., the variable n) is divisible by the sum of its digits (i.e., the variable sn).
If it is, the code prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
