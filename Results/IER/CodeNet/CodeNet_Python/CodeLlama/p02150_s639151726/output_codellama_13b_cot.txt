  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three inputs: a, b, and x.
The variable MOD is initialized to 1000000007.
The code checks if x is less than a. If it is, it calculates the remainder of x divided by MOD and stores it in res.
If x is greater than or equal to a, it calculates the value of k by dividing (x-b) by (a-b) and rounding down.
It then calculates the value of res as (x + b*k) modulo MOD.
Finally, it prints the value of res.
