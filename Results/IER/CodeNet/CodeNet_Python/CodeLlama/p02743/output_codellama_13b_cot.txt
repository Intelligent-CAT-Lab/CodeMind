<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in three integers a, b, and c as input.
The code checks if c-a-b is less than 0, which is not the case in this input.
The code then checks if 4*a*b is less than (c-a-b)**2.
In this case, 4*a*b = 4*2*3 = 24, and (c-a-b)**2 = (9-2-3)**2 = 4**2 = 16.
Since 24 is greater than 16, the code prints 'No'.
<<<Output>>>
No
