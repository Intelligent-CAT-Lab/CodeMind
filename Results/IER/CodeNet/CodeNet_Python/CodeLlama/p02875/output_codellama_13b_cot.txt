  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input N and initializes two variables nn and P.
nn is initialized to N + 10, and P is initialized to 998244353.
The code then initializes two lists fa and fainv, which are used to store the values of the factorial and its inverse.
The code then enters two loops. The first loop iterates from 0 to nn and calculates the value of fa[i] = fa[i-1] * (i-1) % P.
The second loop iterates from nn to 0 and calculates the value of fainv[i] = fainv[i+1] * (i+1) % P.
The code then defines a function C that takes two integers a and b as input and returns the value of fa[a] * fainv[b] % P * fainv[a-b] % P if 0 <= b <= a, and 0 otherwise.
The code then calculates the value of ans = pow(3, N, P) and enters a loop that iterates from N//2 + 1 to N + 1.
In each iteration, the code calculates the value of ans = (ans - 2 * C(N, i) * pow(2, N - i, P)) % P.
Finally, the code prints the value of ans.
<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will depend on the input given. If the input is 2, the output will be 1024.
