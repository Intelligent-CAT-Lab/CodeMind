  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in three inputs: N, X, and M.
N is the number of iterations, X is the initial value, and M is the modulus.
The code initializes a list called List with the initial value X.
The code then enters a loop that iterates N-1 times.
For each iteration, the code calculates X^2 % M and appends the result to the List.
The code checks if the current value of X is already in the List. If it is, it breaks the loop and calculates the number of iterations it took to reach the duplicate value.
The code then calculates the sum of the first num elements in the List, where num is the number of iterations it took to reach the duplicate value.
The code then calculates the sum of the remaining elements in the List.
The code then prints the sum of all elements in the List.
