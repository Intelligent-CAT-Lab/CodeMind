  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input as two integers e and y.
The variable e is initialized to 0, which means that the code will consider the year y as a year in the Meiji era.
The code then checks if y is within the range [1868, 1911], which is the range of years in the Meiji era. If it is, it calculates the number of years since the start of the Meiji era and adds 1 to it. The result is stored in ans.
The code then checks if y is within the range [1912, 1925], which is the range of years in the Taisho era. If it is, it calculates the number of years since the start of the Taisho era and adds 1 to it. The result is stored in ans.
The code then checks if y is within the range [1926, 1988], which is the range of years in the Showa era. If it is, it calculates the number of years since the start of the Showa era and adds 1 to it. The result is stored in ans.
The code then checks if y is within the range [1989, 2015], which is the range of years in the Heisei era. If it is, it calculates the number of years since the start of the Heisei era and adds 1 to it. The result is stored in ans.
The code then prints the value of ans.
