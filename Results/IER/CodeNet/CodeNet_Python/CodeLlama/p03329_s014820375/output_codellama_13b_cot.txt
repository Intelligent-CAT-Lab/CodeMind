The variable n is initialized to 127.
The variable nl is initialized to [9, 81, 729, 6561, 59049] in reverse order.
The variable sl is initialized to [6, 36, 216, 1296, 7776, 46656] in reverse order.
The variable tl is initialized to an empty list.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 127.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of the number of 9s, 6s, and 1s in the number i.
The code then appends the sum to the list tl.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the minimum value of tl, which is 127.
<<<Output>>>
127
