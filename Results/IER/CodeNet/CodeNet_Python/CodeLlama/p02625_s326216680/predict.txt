The output of the code will depend on the input values of N and M. The code calculates the number of ways to choose N elements from the first set and M elements from the second set, such that no element is chosen from both sets. The output will be a single integer, which is the number of ways to choose the elements.

For example, if the input values are 2 and 2, the output will be 6, since there are 6 ways to choose 2 elements from the first set and 2 elements from the second set, such that no element is chosen from both sets:

{0, 1} {0, 2} {1, 2} {0, 3} {1, 3} {2, 3}
