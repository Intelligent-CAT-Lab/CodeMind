<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in a string input from the user, splits it into two parts using the space character as a delimiter, and stores the two parts in the variables a and b, respectively.
The code then checks if the two parts are equal or not. If they are not equal, the code sets the variable res to 'D', otherwise, it sets res to 'H'.
The code then prints the value of res.
<<<Output>>>
H
