  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first maps the input to variables H, W, h, and w.
The code then checks if H is divisible by h and W is divisible by w.
If both conditions are true, the code prints "No" and exits.
If either condition is false, the code prints "Yes".
The code then initializes a variable n to 1000.
If W is not divisible by w, the code initializes a variable m to -((w-1)*n + 1).
The code then creates a list row with the following elements:
* If i%w is equal to w-1, the element is m.
* Otherwise, the element is n.
The code then prints the elements of row, which is a list of 3 elements, each of which is either n or m.
If W is divisible by w, the code initializes a variable m to -((h-1)*n + 1).
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to H-1.
If i%h is equal to h-1, the code prints a list of W elements, each of which is m.
Otherwise, the code prints a list of W elements, each of which is n.
