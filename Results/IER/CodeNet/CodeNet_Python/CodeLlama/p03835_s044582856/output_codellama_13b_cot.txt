<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs, k and s, from the user.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the number of valid solutions.
The code then enters a nested loop that iterates over all possible values of x and y, where x and y are integers between 0 and k, inclusive.
For each pair of x and y, the code calculates the value of z as s - x - y.
If z is between 0 and k, inclusive, the code increments the variable ans by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is the number of valid solutions.
