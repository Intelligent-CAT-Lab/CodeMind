The output of the code will be a list of 3 numbers, each representing the product of the binomial coefficients (n-k+1) choose i and (k-1) choose (i-1) modulo MOD for the values of i from 1 to 3.
The first number in the list will be the product of (5-3+1) choose 1 and (3-1) choose 0, which is equal to 5 modulo 10^9 + 7.
The second number in the list will be the product of (5-3+1) choose 2 and (3-1) choose 1, which is equal to 10 modulo 10^9 + 7.
The third number in the list will be the product of (5-3+1) choose 3 and (3-1) choose 2, which is equal to 10 modulo 10^9 + 7.
Therefore, the output of the code will be:
5
10
10
