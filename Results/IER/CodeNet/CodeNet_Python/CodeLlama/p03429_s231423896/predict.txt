The code first maps the input to the variables N, M, A, and B.
The code then initializes a 2D list called ans with N rows and M columns, each initialized to a period (.).
The code then checks if M is odd and if A is greater than 0. If both conditions are true, it sets the last column of the last two rows to "^" and the last row of the last two columns to "v".
The code then checks if N is odd and if B is greater than 0. If both conditions are true, it sets the last two rows to "<" and the last two columns to ">".
The code then checks if A and B are both greater than 0. If both conditions are true, it sets the last two rows to "<" and the last two columns to ">".
The code then checks if A and B are both greater than 0. If both conditions are true, it sets the last two rows to "<" and the last two columns to ">".
The code then checks if A and B are both greater than 0. If both conditions are true, it sets the last two rows to "<" and the last two columns to ">".
