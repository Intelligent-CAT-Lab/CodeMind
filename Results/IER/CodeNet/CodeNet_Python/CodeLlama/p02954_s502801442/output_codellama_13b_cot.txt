  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input string and adds an 'O' to the end of it.
The length of the new string is stored in N.
An array n is created with length N-1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the characters of the string.
For each character, it checks if it is 'R' or 'L'.
If it is 'R', the code increments a counter and continues to the next character.
If it is 'L', the code decrements the counter and continues to the next character.
The code then appends the current value of the counter to an array t.
The code then calculates the length of t, which is always even.
The code then enters another loop that iterates over the even indices of t.
For each index, it checks if the corresponding value in t is even or odd.
If it is even, the code checks if the next value in t is even or odd.
If it is even, the code sets the current index in n to the average of the current and next values in t.
If it is odd, the code sets the current index in n to the average of the current and next values in t minus 1.
If it is odd, the code checks if the next value in t is even or odd.
If it is even, the code sets the current index in n to the average of the current and next values in t plus 1.
If it is odd, the code sets the current index in n to the average of the current and next values in t.
The code then prints the array n as a string with spaces between each element.
