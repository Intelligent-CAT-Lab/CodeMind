  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first initializes the variables n and m to 2 and 6, respectively.
The code then defines a function called comb_build, which builds the factorial and inverse factorial tables for the range [0, MAX] (where MAX is 2*10^5+1).
The code then defines a function called nCk, which calculates the binomial coefficient of n and k.
The code then defines a function called prime_factor, which calculates the prime factorization of a given number.
The code then calls the comb_build function with the argument MAX.
The code then initializes the variable ans to 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the values in the dictionary returned by the prime_factor function for the number m.
For each value in the dictionary, the code calculates the binomial coefficient of the value and the number of prime factors of m, and multiplies it by the current value of ans.
The code then prints the final value of ans modulo MOD (which is 10^9+7).
