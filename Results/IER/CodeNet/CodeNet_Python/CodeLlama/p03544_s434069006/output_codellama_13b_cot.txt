<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input n from the user.
If n is equal to 1, the code prints 1 and exits.
If n is greater than 1, the code initializes a list ans with the first two elements as 2 and 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n-2.
For each iteration, the code appends the sum of the last two elements of the list ans to the list ans.
The loop finishes when i is equal to n-1.
The code then prints the last element of the list ans, which is the final answer.
