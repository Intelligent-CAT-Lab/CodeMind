  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys and math modules.
The code then sets the recursion limit to 10000.
The code then defines a function called comb that takes two arguments x and y and returns the value of factorial(x)//factorial(x-y)//factorial(y).
The code then maps the input to variables w, h, ax, ay, bx, and by.
The code then calculates the minimum of the absolute difference between ax and bx and the width of the rectangle, which is 3.
The code then calculates the minimum of the absolute difference between ay and by and the height of the rectangle, which is 3.
The code then calculates the value of ans as 1.
If the width of the rectangle is even, the code multiplies ans by 2.
If the height of the rectangle is even, the code multiplies ans by 2.
The code then multiplies ans by the value of comb(dx+dy,dx) which is 12.
The code then prints the value of ans modulo 100000007, which is 12.
<<<Output>>>
12
