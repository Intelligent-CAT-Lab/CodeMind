  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the necessary libraries, including os, sys, numpy, and math.
It then checks if the environment variable "LOCAL" is set, and if so, it opens a file called "_in.txt" for reading.
It then sets the recursion limit to 2147483647, sets the value of INF to infinity, IINF to 10^18, and MOD to 10^9 + 7.
The code then reads the input from stdin, which is the input file, and splits it into three variables: H, W, and D.
It then creates two meshgrids, X and Y, with dimensions H and W, respectively.
It then calculates the values of X and Y using the formulae X = X + Y and X = X - Y.
It then flattens the arrays X and Y using the ravel() method.
It then initializes an array of strings called colors with length H * W.
It then checks if D is odd, and if so, it sets the values of colors to 'R' for the indices where X is odd and 'Y' for the indices where X is even.
If D is even, it sets the values of colors to 'R' for the indices where X is less than D and Y is less than D, 'Y' for the indices where X is less than D and Y is greater than or equal to D, 'G' for the indices where X is greater than or equal to D and Y is less than D, and 'B' for the indices where X is greater than or equal to D and Y is greater than or equal to D.
It then calculates the values of x and y using the formulae x = (X + Y) // 2 and y = (X - Y) // 2.
It then initializes an array of strings called ans with dimensions H and W.
It then sets the values of ans to colors using the formulae ans[x, y] = colors.
It then prints the values of ans using the join() method.
