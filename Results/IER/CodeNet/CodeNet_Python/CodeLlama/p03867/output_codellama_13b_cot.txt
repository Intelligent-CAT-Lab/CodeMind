  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input N and K from the user.
The variable MOD is initialized to 10^9 + 7, which is a large prime number used for modular arithmetic.
The variable i is initialized to 1, and the variable M is initialized to N.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 4.
For each number i in this range, it checks if N is divisible by i. If it is, it appends i to the list div.
If N is divisible by i, but not by i^2, it appends N//i to the list div.
The code then sorts the list div and stores it in the variable N1.
The code then initializes a list num with N1 elements, and sets the first element of num to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 4.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the value of num[i] using the formula pow(K, (div[i] + 1) // 2, MOD).
The code then enters a nested loop that iterates from 0 to i-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 3.
For each number j in this range, it checks if div[i] is divisible by div[j]. If it is, it updates the value of num[i] using the formula num[i] = num[i] - num[j] + MOD.
The code then checks if div[i] is even. If it is, it updates the value of ans using the formula ans += div[i] * num[i] // 2.
If div[i] is odd, it updates the value of ans using the formula ans += div[i] * num[i].
The code then prints the final value of ans.
