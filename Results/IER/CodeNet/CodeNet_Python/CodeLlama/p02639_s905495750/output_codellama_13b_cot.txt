<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input as a list of integers using the map() function.
The list is then iterated over using a for loop, and for each element in the list, the code checks if it is equal to 0.
If an element is equal to 0, the code prints the index of that element plus 1.
The code will print the index of the first element that is equal to 0, which is 0 in this case.
