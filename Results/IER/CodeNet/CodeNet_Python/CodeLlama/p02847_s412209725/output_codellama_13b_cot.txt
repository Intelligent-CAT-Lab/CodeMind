The code takes input from the user and stores it in a variable.
The variable is then used to find the index of the input in the list ['SUN','MON', 'TUE', 'WED', 'THU', 'FRI', 'SAT'].
The index of the input in the list is then subtracted from 7.
The output of the code is the result of this subtraction.
