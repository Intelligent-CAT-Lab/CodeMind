  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the necessary modules and sets the recursion limit to 10^6.
It then defines a few functions:
* input: reads a line from the input and removes the trailing newline character.
* LMIIS: reads a line from the input, splits it into a list of integers, and returns the list.
* II: reads a line from the input and converts it to an integer.
* MOD: defines the modulo value to be used in the code.

The main function is defined, which takes an optional argument given, which is a function that reads a line from the input. If given is not provided, it defaults to sys.stdin.readline.
The main function first reads two integers S and W from the input using the LMIIS function.
It then checks if S is less than or equal to W, and if so, prints "unsafe". Otherwise, it prints "safe".
