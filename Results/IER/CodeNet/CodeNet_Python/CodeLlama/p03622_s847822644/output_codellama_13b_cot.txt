  <<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes three lists f, g, and h with M elements, each initialized to 0.
The code then sets f[0], g[0], and h[1] to 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to M (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 2 to 1000001.
For each number i in this range, it calculates f[i], g[i], and h[i] using the following formulas:
f[i] = f[i-1] * i % m
g[i] = m - h[m%i] * (m//i) % m
h[i] = g[i-1] * h[i] % m
The code then sets A and B to the values input by the user, and checks if A < B. If it is, it swaps the values of A and B.
The code then sets b to 1 and ans to 0.
The code then enters another loop that iterates from 1 to B (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to B.
For each number j in this range, it calculates ans using the following formula:
ans += b * f[A+B-j] * g[B-j] * g[A] % m
b = b * 2 % m
The code then prints the final value of ans % m.
