<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input from the user and stores it in the variable n.
The code then calculates the remainder of n divided by 100 and stores it in n%100.
The code then calculates the quotient of n divided by 100 and stores it in n//100.
The code then calculates the expression n//100*5>=n%100 and stores the result in a boolean variable.
The code then prints the value of the boolean variable.

The output of the code will depend on the value of n.
If n is less than 5, the output will be 0.
If n is greater than or equal to 5 and less than 100, the output will be 1.
If n is greater than or equal to 100, the output will be 0.
