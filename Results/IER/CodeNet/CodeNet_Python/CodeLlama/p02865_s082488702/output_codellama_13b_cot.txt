<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input from the user and stores it in the variable n.
The code then checks if n is even by using the modulo operator (%). If n is even, the code prints n//2-1, which is the integer division of n by 2 minus 1. If n is odd, the code prints n//2, which is the integer division of n by 2.
The input given is 4, which is even. Therefore, the output of the code will be 4//2-1 = 1.
