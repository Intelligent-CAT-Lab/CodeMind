  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in 6 inputs: R, C, ay, ax, by, and bx.
The code then initializes a 2D array called dists with R rows and C columns, and initializes it to INF.
The code then initializes a 2D array called ptns with R rows and C columns, and initializes it to 0.
The code then initializes a queue called q and appends the tuple (0, ax, ay) to it.
The code then initializes two lists called dxs and dys, which are used to iterate over the neighbors of a given cell.
The code then sets ans_d to None.
The code then enters a while loop that iterates until the queue is empty.
The code pops the first element from the queue and assigns it to d, x, and y.
The code then checks if ans_d is not None and if d is greater than ans_d. If so, it breaks out of the loop.
The code then checks if (x, y) is equal to (bx, by). If so, it sets ans_d to d.
The code then checks if d is greater than dists[y][x]. If so, it continues to the next iteration.
The code then sets dists[y][x] to d.
The code then iterates over the neighbors of (x, y) using the dxs and dys lists. For each neighbor, it checks if it is within the bounds of the grid and if d+1 is less than or equal to dists[ny][nx]. If so, it appends the tuple (d+1, nx, ny) to the queue and sets dists[ny][nx] to d+1.
The code then iterates over the four corners of the grid and checks if they are within the bounds of the grid and if d+1 is less than or equal to dists[ny][nx]. If so, it appends the tuple (d+1, nx, ny) to the queue and sets dists[ny][nx] to d+1.
The code then prints ans_d and ptns[by][bx] modulo MOD.
