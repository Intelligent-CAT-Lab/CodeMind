<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers m and n as input, separated by a space.
The variable mod is initialized to 10^9+7, which is a large prime number used for modular arithmetic.
The code then calculates the value of m^n modulo mod, which is the remainder of m^n divided by mod.
The code then prints the result.
