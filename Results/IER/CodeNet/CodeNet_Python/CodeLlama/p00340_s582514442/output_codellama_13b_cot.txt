  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in four integers as input and stores them in variables e1, e2, e3, and e4.
The code then checks if any of the following conditions are met:

* e1 is equal to e2 and e3 is equal to e4
* e1 is equal to e3 and e2 is equal to e4
* e1 is equal to e4 and e2 is equal to e3
* e1, e2, e3, and e4 are all equal

If any of these conditions are met, the code prints "yes". Otherwise, it prints "no".

<<<Output>>>
yes
