<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user and splits it into a list of integers using the split() method.
The list is assigned to the variable l.
The code then checks if the first element of the list (l[0]) is less than or equal to the third element of the list (l[2]) and if the sum of the first and second elements of the list (l[0] + l[1]) is greater than or equal to the third element of the list (l[2]).
If both conditions are met, the code prints "YES", otherwise it prints "NO".
<<<Output>>>
YES
