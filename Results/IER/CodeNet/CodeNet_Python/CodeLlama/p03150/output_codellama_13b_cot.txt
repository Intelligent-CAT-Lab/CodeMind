  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input string S and stores it in a variable.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to the length of S (exclusive).
For each index i in this range, the code enters another loop that iterates from i to the length of S (inclusive).
For each index j in this range, the code checks if the substring of S starting from index i and ending at index j is equal to "keyence".
If it is, the code prints "YES" and exits the program.
The code then enters another loop that iterates from 0 to the length of S (exclusive).
For each index i in this range, the code checks if the substring of S starting from index i and ending at index i+8 is equal to "keyence".
If it is, the code prints "YES" and exits the program.
If none of the above conditions are met, the code prints "NO".
<<<Output>>>
YES
