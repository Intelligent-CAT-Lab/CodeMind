The code imports the sys module and uses the stdin object to read a line of input from the user.
The input is then stripped of any trailing whitespace using the rstrip() method.
The code then defines a dictionary called week with keys representing the days of the week and their corresponding values.
The code then uses the get() method to retrieve the value associated with the key 'SAT' in the dictionary.
The code then subtracts the value of the key 'SAT' from 7 and prints the result.
