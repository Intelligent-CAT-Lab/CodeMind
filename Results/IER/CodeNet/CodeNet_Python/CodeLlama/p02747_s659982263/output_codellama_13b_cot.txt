  <<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized to the input string "hihi".
The variable cnt is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of occurrences of the characters 'h' and 'i' in the string.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the characters in the string s.
For each character at position i, the code checks if i is even and if the character at that position is 'h'. If both conditions are met, it increments the variable cnt by 1.
The code then checks if i is odd and if the character at that position is 'i'. If both conditions are met, it increments the variable cnt by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if the length of the string s is even and if the variable cnt is equal to the length of the string. If both conditions are met, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
