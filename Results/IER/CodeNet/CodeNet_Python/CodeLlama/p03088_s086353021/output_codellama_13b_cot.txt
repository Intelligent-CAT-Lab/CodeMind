  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input N, which is 3 in this case.
It then initializes a list of dictionaries called memo, with N+1 elements.
The function ok takes a string of length 4 as input and returns True if the string does not contain the substring "AGC" and False otherwise.
The function dfs takes two inputs: the current position in the string (cur) and the last 3 characters of the string (last3).
If last3 is in memo[cur], the function returns the value stored in memo[cur][last3].
If cur is equal to N, the function returns 1.
Otherwise, the function iterates over the possible characters that can be added to the string (ACGT) and checks if the resulting string is valid using the ok function.
If it is, the function recursively calls dfs with the updated values of cur and last3.
The function then stores the result in memo[cur][last3] and returns it.
The code then calls dfs with the initial values of cur=0 and last3='TTT'.
