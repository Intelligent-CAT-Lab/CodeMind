  <<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a lambda function LI that takes no arguments and returns a list of integers.
The code then assigns the first two elements of the list returned by LI to variables a and b.
The code then defines a function main that takes no arguments and returns nothing.
The function main defines a lambda function f that takes one argument x and returns x * (x + 1) // 2.
The function main then calculates the value of ans by calling f with the argument b - a - 1 and subtracting a from the result.
The function main then prints the value of ans.
The code then checks if the name of the module is "__main__" and if it is, it calls the main function.

The input given is "8 13".
The code processes the input by calling the LI function and assigning the first two elements of the list returned to variables a and b.
The value of a is 8 and the value of b is 13.
The function main is then called and it calculates the value of ans by calling the f function with the argument b - a - 1, which is 13 - 8 - 1 = 4.
The value of ans is then subtracted by a, which is 8, and the result is 4 - 8 = -4.
The function main then prints the value of ans, which is -4.

<<<Output>>>
-4
