  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the math and sys modules.
The function rem checks if any of the three variables a, b, or c is odd. If it is, it returns False. Otherwise, it returns True.
The function isDouble checks if any of the three variables a, b, or c is not an integer. If it is, it returns False. Otherwise, it returns True.
The code then takes input from the user in the form of three integers separated by spaces.
The code then initializes the variables fa, fb, and fc to the values of a, b, and c, respectively.
The code then enters a while loop that iterates until the condition (cnt != 0 and fa == a and fb == b and fc == c) is met.
The loop first checks if the condition is met. If it is, it prints -1 and exits the program.
The loop then divides each of the variables a, b, and c by 2 and stores the results in tmp1, tmp2, and tmp3, respectively.
The loop then checks if the variables tmp1, tmp2, and tmp3 are integers using the isDouble function. If they are not, it breaks the loop.
The loop then increments the variable cnt by 1.
The loop then sets the variables a, b, and c to the values of tmp2 + tmp3, tmp1 + tmp3, and tmp1 + tmp2, respectively.
The loop then checks if the variables a, b, and c are even using the rem function. If they are not, it breaks the loop.
The loop then repeats until the condition is met.
The code then prints the value of cnt and exits the program.
<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will be 3.
