<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user and splits it into a list of strings using the split() method.
The list is stored in the variable a.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 4 (inclusive).
For each iteration, it checks if the current iteration number (i) is equal to the value of the corresponding element in the list a minus 1.
If the condition is met, the code continues to the next iteration without printing anything.
If the condition is not met, the code prints the current iteration number (i+1) followed by a newline character.
The loop finishes when i reaches 4.
