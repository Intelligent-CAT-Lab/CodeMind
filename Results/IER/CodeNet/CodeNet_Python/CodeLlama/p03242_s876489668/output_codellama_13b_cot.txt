  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user and stores it in a variable called S.
The code then creates a new string called new_S and initializes it to an empty string.
The code then iterates through each character in the string S and checks if it is equal to "9". If it is, it appends "1" to new_S. If it is not equal to "9", it checks if it is equal to "1". If it is, it appends "9" to new_S. If it is not equal to "1", it appends the character to new_S as is.
The code then prints the value of new_S.
