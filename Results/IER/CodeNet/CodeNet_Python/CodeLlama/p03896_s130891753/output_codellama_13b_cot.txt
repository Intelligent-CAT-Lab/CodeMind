  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input N from the user.
The code then checks if N is equal to 2 and if it is, it prints -1 and exits the program.
The code then initializes a 2D list ans with N rows and N-1 columns.
The code then enters a nested loop that iterates over each element of the 2D list ans.
The inner loop iterates over each element of the row and calculates the value of the element as (i+j+1)%N + 1.
The code then checks if N is even and if it is, it swaps the elements at index m and m-1 for each row in the 2D list ans.
The code then prints the 2D list ans.
