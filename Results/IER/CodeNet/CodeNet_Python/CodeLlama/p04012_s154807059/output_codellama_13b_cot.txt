  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the necessary modules: sys and collections.
It then defines a function called slove().
The function takes no arguments and reads a line of input from stdin using the readline() method of the sys.stdin object.
It then creates a Counter object called w from the list of characters in the input string using the collections.Counter() function.
The function then iterates over the items in w and checks if the value of each item is odd.
If any value is odd, the function prints "No" and exits.
If all values are even, the function prints "Yes".
The function is then called with the __main__ guard.
<<<Output>>>
No
