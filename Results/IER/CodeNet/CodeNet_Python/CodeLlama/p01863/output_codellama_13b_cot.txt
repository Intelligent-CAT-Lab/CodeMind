  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input string "NicoNicoNi" and stores it in the variable s.
It then calculates the length of the string and stores it in the variable length.
The code then initializes the variables BASE, MOD1, MOD2, acc1, acc2, hlst1, and hlst2.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to length // 3, which is 6 in this case.
For each iteration, the code calculates the hash values for the substrings of length 1, 2, and 3 using the calc_hash function.
The code then checks if the hash values are equal, and if they are, it prints the substring and breaks out of the loop.
If the loop completes without finding a match, the code prints "mitomerarenaiWA".
<<<Output>>>
Love Nico!
