  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first initializes the variable M to 10^9+7, which is a large prime number used for modular arithmetic.
The variable D is initialized to an empty list, which will be used to store the prime factors of N.
The variable i is initialized to 1, which will be used as a counter in the loop.
The variable r is initialized to 0, which will be used to store the final result.
The code then reads the input N and K from the user, and splits them into two variables.
The code then enters a loop that iterates as long as i*i is less than or equal to N.
Inside the loop, the code checks if N is divisible by i, and if it is, it appends i to the list D and also appends N/i to the list D if N/i is not already in the list.
The code then increments i by 1 and repeats the loop.
After the loop finishes, the code sorts the list D and initializes an empty list N.
The code then enters a nested loop that iterates over the elements of D.
Inside the loop, the code calculates the power of K to the -~D[i]/2 modulo M, and appends the result to the list N.
The code then enters another nested loop that iterates over the elements of D from 0 to i-1.
Inside the loop, the code checks if D[i] is divisible by D[j], and if it is, it subtracts N[j] from N[i] modulo M.
The code then increments r by the product of N[i], D[i], and 2^(M-2+D[i]%2) modulo M, and repeats the loop.
After the nested loops finish, the code prints the final value of r.
<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will depend on the input given.
For the input 4 2, the output will be 1.
