<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes the input string s and sorts it alphabetically.
The sorted string is then joined back into a single string using the join() method.
The code then checks if the sorted string is equal to "abc".
If it is, the code prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
