  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes two inputs a and b from the user.
The function gcd is defined, which takes two arguments a and b.
The function checks if b is greater than a, if it is, it swaps the values of a and b.
The function then enters a while loop that iterates until b is 0.
In each iteration, the function calculates the modulus of a and b and stores the result in mod.
The function then assigns the value of b to a and the value of mod to b.
The function repeats this process until b is 0.
The function returns the value of a, which is the greatest common divisor of a and b.
The code then prints the output of the function gcd(a,b).
