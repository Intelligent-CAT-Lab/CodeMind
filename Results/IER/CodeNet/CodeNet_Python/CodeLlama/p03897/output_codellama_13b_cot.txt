  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input n and initializes an empty list ans.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n-1 (exclusive).
For each iteration, the code checks if the current iteration number i is odd. If it is, it appends the tuple (i,0) to the list ans.
The code then enters another loop that iterates from 0 to n-1 (exclusive).
For each iteration, the code checks if the current iteration number i is divisible by 6 and if the remainder is 1. If it is, the code enters another loop that iterates from 2 to n (exclusive).
For each iteration, the code checks if the current iteration number j is even. If it is, the code appends the tuple (i,j) to the list ans.
The code then enters another loop that iterates from 0 to n (exclusive).
For each iteration, the code checks if the current iteration number j is odd. If it is, the code appends the tuple (n-1,j) to the list ans.
The code then prints the length of the list ans.
The code then prints the contents of the list ans.
