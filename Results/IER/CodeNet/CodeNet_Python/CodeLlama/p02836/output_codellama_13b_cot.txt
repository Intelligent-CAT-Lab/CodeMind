<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string input s from the user.
The variable n is initialized to the length of s minus 1, which is 9 in this case.
The variable ans is initialized to 0.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to the length of s divided by 2, which is 4 in this case.
For each iteration, the code checks if the character at index i is the same as the character at index n-i. If they are not the same, the code increments ans by 1.
The loop finishes and the code prints the final value of ans, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
