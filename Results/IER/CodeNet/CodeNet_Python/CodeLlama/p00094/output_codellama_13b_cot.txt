<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user in the form of two numbers separated by a space.
The numbers are then converted to integers using the int() function.
The code then checks if both numbers are less than or equal to 100.
If the condition is met, the code calculates the product of the two numbers and divides it by 3.305785.
The result is then rounded to 4 decimal places using the f-string format.
The code then prints the result.
