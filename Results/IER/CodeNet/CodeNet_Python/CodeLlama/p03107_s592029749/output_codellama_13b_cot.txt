  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module and reads the input from stdin.
The input is stored in the variable s.
The length of the input is stored in the variable n.
The code then enters a while loop that checks if the variable ok is equal to 0.
The variable ok is initialized to 0, so the loop will execute at least once.
The loop first initializes the variable i to 0.
The loop then enters a while loop that iterates from i to len(s) - 1.
The loop checks if the string formed by concatenating the characters at positions i and i+1 is equal to "01" or "10".
If the condition is met, the loop updates the variable s by removing the characters at positions i-j and i+2-j.
The variable ok is set to 0, indicating that the loop should continue.
The loop then increments the variable j by 1 and checks if i is greater than j + 1.
If it is, the loop updates the variable str to the string formed by concatenating the characters at positions i-j and i-j+1.
If i is not greater than j + 1, the loop breaks.
The loop then increments the variable i by 1.
The loop repeats until the variable i is equal to len(s) - 1.
The loop then prints the difference between the original length of the input and the current length of the input.
