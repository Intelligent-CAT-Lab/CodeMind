  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input string S as input.
It then initializes several variables, including max0, max1, amax0, amax1, mi0, mi1, h0, and h1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each character c in S.
If c is "1", the code increments h1 and checks if h1-mi1 is greater than max1. If it is, it updates max1 and amax1 accordingly.
If h1-mi1 is equal to max1, the code appends the current index i to amax1.
The code then decrements h0 and checks if h0 is less than mi0. If it is, it updates mi0.
If c is "0", the code decrements h1 and checks if h1 is less than mi1. If it is, it updates mi1.
The code then increments h0 and checks if h0-mi0 is greater than max0. If it is, it updates max0 and amax0 accordingly.
If h0-mi0 is equal to max0, the code appends the current index i to amax0.
The code then checks if max0 is less than max1. If it is, the code checks if the number of indices in amax1 is odd. If it is, the code prints max1. Otherwise, it prints max1+1.
If max0 is greater than max1, the code checks if the number of indices in amax0 is odd. If it is, the code prints max0. Otherwise, it prints max0+1.
If max0 is equal to max1, the code checks if the number of indices in amax1 is odd. If it is, the code prints max0. Otherwise, it prints max0+1.
