  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the re module, which is used for regular expression operations.
The input string S is read from the user and stored in the variable S.
The code then replaces all occurrences of 'x' with '*({0})' and '^' with '**' in the string S.
The code then uses the re.sub() function to replace all occurrences of '[+-]' followed by '*' with '\1' in the string S.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 2000 to -2001 in steps of -1.
For each value of i in this range, the code evaluates the expression S.format(i) and checks if it is equal to 0.
If it is, the code prints the string '(x{:+})'.format(-i) followed by a space.
If the loop completes without finding any values of i that satisfy the condition, the code prints a newline character.
<<<Output>>>
(x-2)(x+3)(x-1)
