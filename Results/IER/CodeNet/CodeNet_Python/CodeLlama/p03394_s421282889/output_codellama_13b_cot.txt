  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input n from the user.
If n is equal to 3, the code prints the tuple (22,3,5) and exits.
If n is equal to 4, the code prints the tuple (2,3,4,9) and exits.
If n is equal to 5, the code prints the tuple (2,3,4,6,9) and exits.
If n is not equal to any of the above values, the code calculates a and b as follows:
a=n//4
b=n%4
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to a-1, and for each iteration, it appends the tuple (6*i+2,6*i+3,6*i+4,6*i+6) to the list ans.
If a is even, the code checks the value of b and appends the appropriate elements to the list ans.
If a is odd, the code checks the value of b and removes the last element of the list ans and appends the appropriate elements to the list ans.
Finally, the code prints the list ans.
<<<Output>>>
(2, 3, 4, 6, 9)
