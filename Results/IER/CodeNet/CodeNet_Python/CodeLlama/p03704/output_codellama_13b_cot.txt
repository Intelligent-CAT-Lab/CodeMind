  <<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function f(d,x,y) that takes three arguments:
* d: an integer representing the current digit
* x: an integer representing the number of digits in the current number
* y: an integer representing the number of digits in the next number
The function first calculates the maximum value of the current number, which is 9^x.
It then checks if the current digit is 0, and if so, returns 1 if x is less than 1, otherwise it returns 0.
If the current digit is not 0, the function calculates the sum of the results of calling itself recursively for each possible value of the current digit, with the current digit multiplied by the maximum value of the current number.
The function then returns the sum of the results.
The code then takes the input D and prints the sum of the results of calling the function f(D,i,0) for each value of i from 1 to 20, multiplied by 10 minus the current digit modulo 2 times 9.
<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will depend on the input D.
If D is 63, the output will be 100.
