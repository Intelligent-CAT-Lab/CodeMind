  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user and stores it in the variable S.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the number of times the string "BC" appears in the input.
The variable a is initialized to 0, which will be used to keep track of the number of times the letter "A" appears before the string "BC".
The variable i is initialized to 0, which will be used as an index to iterate through the input string.
The code then enters a while loop that iterates through the input string character by character.
For each character, the code checks if it is equal to "A", if it is, it increments the variable a by 1 and increments the variable i by 1.
If the character is not equal to "A", the code checks if the substring starting from the current index and ending at the next index is equal to "BC", if it is, it increments the variable ans by the value of a and increments the variable i by 2.
If the substring is not equal to "BC", the code sets the variable a to 0 and increments the variable i by 1.
The loop continues until the end of the input string is reached.
The code then prints the final value of ans, which is the number of times the string "BC" appears in the input.
