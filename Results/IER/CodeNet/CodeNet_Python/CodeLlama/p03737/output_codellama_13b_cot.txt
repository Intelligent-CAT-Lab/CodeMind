<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a single line of input from the user, which is a string.
The input string is converted to uppercase using the upper() method.
The string is then split into three parts using the split() method, with each part separated by a space.
The first character of each part is extracted using the [0] indexing notation, and the three characters are concatenated using the + operator.
The resulting string is then printed.
