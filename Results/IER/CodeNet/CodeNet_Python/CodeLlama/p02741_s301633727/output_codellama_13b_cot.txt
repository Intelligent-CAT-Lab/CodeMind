<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a list called lis and initializes it with the following values:
[1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 5, 2, 2, 1, 5, 1, 2, 1, 14, 1, 5, 1, 5, 2, 2, 1, 15, 2, 2, 5, 4, 1, 4, 1, 51]
The code then prompts the user to enter a number and stores it in a variable called input.
The code then uses the input variable to index into the lis list and print the corresponding value.
