  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes the input as a string and reverses it using the slice notation [::-1].
It then converts the string to a list of integers using the map function.
The list is then extended with a zero at the end.
The code then initializes two variables, s and res, to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the list of integers, starting from the second-to-last element.
For each element, it calculates the sum of the current element and the previous element, and stores it in k.
The code then checks if k is less than 5 or if k is equal to 5 and the next element is less than 5.
If either of these conditions is true, it adds k to res and sets s to 0.
If neither of these conditions is true, it adds 10 - k to res and sets s to 1.
After the loop finishes, the code adds s to res and prints the final value of res.
<<<Output>>>
10
