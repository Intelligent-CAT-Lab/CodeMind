  The output of the code is:

A) Hello, Alice!
Hello, Bob!

Explanation:
The code defines a function called `greet` that takes a string `name` as an argument and returns a string "Hello, " concatenated with the `name` argument and an exclamation mark. The function is then called twice with different arguments, "Alice" and "Bob", and the returned strings are printed. Therefore, the output of the code is "Hello, Alice!" followed by "Hello, Bob!".

Therefore, the correct answer is option A.
