<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input n from the user and increments it by 1.
The code then enters a while loop that repeatedly divides n by 2 and increments the variable cnt by 1.
The loop stops when n becomes 1.
The code then prints the final value of cnt, which is the number of times the loop executed.
