  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input n from the user.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to int(pow(n,1/5))+100, which is 1 to 100 in this case.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the value of a and b.
a is set to i, and b is set to -1*(n-pow(a,5)).
The code then calculates the value of c as int(pow(abs(b),1/5)).
If b is negative, c is set to -c.
The code then checks if c*c*c*c*c==b, which is true when c is 1.
If this condition is met, the code prints the values of a and c and exits the loop.
The output of the code is therefore 1 1.

1 1
