  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first reads an integer from standard input and stores it in the variable n.
The code then initializes two variables, reserved and maxspeed, to 1.
The code then enters an infinite loop that continues until the condition reserved + maxspeed * 3 > n is met.
In each iteration of the loop, the code multiplies maxspeed by 3 and adds maxspeed * 2 to reserved.
The code then calculates the value of ans as the sum of 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + ... + 2, where the number of terms is equal to the value of n.
The code then subtracts 1 from n and sets i to 3.
The code then enters another loop that continues until i is greater than or equal to maxspeed.
In each iteration of the loop, the code adds 2 to ans, subtracts i * 2 from n, and multiplies i by 3.
The code then sets i to maxspeed and enters a third loop that continues until i is 0.
In each iteration of the loop, the code adds n // i to ans, subtracts n // i * i from n, and divides i by 3.
The code then prints the value of ans + 1 to standard output.
