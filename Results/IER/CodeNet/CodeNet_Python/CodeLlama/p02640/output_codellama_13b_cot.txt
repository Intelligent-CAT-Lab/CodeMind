<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs x and y from the user.
The variable count is initialized to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to x (inclusive).
For each value of a in this range, the code calculates the value of b as x - a.
The code then checks if the expression 2*a + 4*b is equal to y.
If it is, the code sets count to 1 and breaks out of the loop.
If the condition is not met, the code continues to the next iteration of the loop.
After the loop finishes, the code prints "Yes" if count is 1, and "No" otherwise.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
