<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input X and Y from the user.
X is initialized to 3 and Y is initialized to 8.
The code then checks if 2*X (6) is less than or equal to Y (8) and if Y (8) is less than or equal to 4*X (12).
The condition is met, so the code enters the if block.
The code then checks if Y (8) is divisible by 2. It is, so the code prints "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
