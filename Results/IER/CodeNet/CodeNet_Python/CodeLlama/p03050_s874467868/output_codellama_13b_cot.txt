  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the necessary libraries and sets the recursion limit to 10^7.
It then reads the input from the user, which is an integer N.
The code then initializes a variable i to 1 and an empty list divs.
It then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to the square root of N (inclusive).
For each integer i in this range, it checks if N is divisible by i. If it is, it appends the pair (i, N//i) to the list divs.
The code then initializes a variable ans to 0 and enters a loop that iterates over the elements of the list divs.
For each element p in this loop, it extracts the first element of the pair (i.e., the divisor) and the second element of the pair (i.e., the quotient) and assigns them to variables r and m, respectively.
The code then checks if m is equal to 0, and if so, it continues to the next iteration of the loop.
If m is not equal to 0, the code checks if N is divisible by m and if so, it adds m to the variable ans.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans.
