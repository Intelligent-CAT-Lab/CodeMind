<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input N from the user.
The variable N is then converted to a binary string using the bin() function.
The length of this binary string is calculated using the len() function.
The value of 1 is shifted left by the length of the binary string minus 3, which is equivalent to multiplying 1 by 2^len(bin(N))-3.
The result of this operation is then printed.

For example, if the input is 7, the binary string is 111, and the length is 3. Therefore, the output will be 1<<3-3 = 1<<2 = 4.
