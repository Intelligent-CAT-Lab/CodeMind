  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports several modules from the Python standard library, including collections, heapq, bisect, math, itertools, string, queue, copy, and time. It also imports numpy as np.
The code then sets the recursion limit to 10**8 and defines some constants, including INF, mod, and eps.
The code then defines a function called inp() that reads a line of input from stdin and converts it to an integer.
The code then defines a function called inpl() that reads a line of input from stdin, splits it into a list of integers, and returns the list.
The code then defines a function called inpl_str() that reads a line of input from stdin, splits it into a list of strings, and returns the list.
The code then defines a variable called n and assigns it the value of the integer returned by the inp() function.
The code then prints the value of 3*n*n to stdout.
