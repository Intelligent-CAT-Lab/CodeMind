  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in four integers a, b, c, and d as input.
The variable mod is initialized to 998244353, which is a large prime number.
The variable dp is initialized to a 2D array of size (c+1)x(d+1) with all elements initialized to 0.
The code sets dp[a][b] to 1, which means that the number of ways to reach the starting point (a,b) is 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from a+1 to c+1, meaning it will consider all possible values of i from 2 to c+1.
For each value of i, the code calculates the number of ways to reach the point (i,b) by multiplying the number of ways to reach the point (i-1,b) by b.
The code then calculates the number of ways to reach the point (i,b) by adding the number of ways to reach the point (i,b-1) by i and the number of ways to reach the point (i-1,b) by j.
The code then calculates the number of ways to reach the point (i,b) by subtracting the number of ways to reach the point (i-1,b-1) by (i-1)*(j-1).
The code then stores the result in dp[i][b] and takes the modulo of the result with mod.
The code then enters another loop that iterates from a to c+1, meaning it will consider all possible values of i from 1 to c+1.
For each value of i, the code calculates the number of ways to reach the point (i,d) by adding the number of ways to reach the point (i,d-1) by i and the number of ways to reach the point (i-1,d) by j.
The code then calculates the number of ways to reach the point (i,d) by subtracting the number of ways to reach the point (i-1,d-1) by (i-1)*(j-1).
The code then stores the result in dp[i][d] and takes the modulo of the result with mod.
The code then prints the value of dp[c][d], which is the number of ways to reach the final point (c,d).
