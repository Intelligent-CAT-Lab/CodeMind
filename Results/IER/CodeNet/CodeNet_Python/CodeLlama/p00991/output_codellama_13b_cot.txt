  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the factorial function from the math module.
It then defines a function called comb that takes two arguments x and y and returns the binomial coefficient of x and y.
The code then maps the input to variables w, h, ax, ay, bx, and by.
The code then calculates the minimum of the absolute difference between ax and bx and the width of the grid, which is w.
It then calculates the minimum of the absolute difference between ay and by and the height of the grid, which is h.
The code then calculates the answer by multiplying the number of ways to choose the horizontal and vertical directions by the binomial coefficient of the horizontal and vertical distances.
If the horizontal distance is equal to the width of the grid, the code multiplies the answer by 2.
If the vertical distance is equal to the height of the grid, the code multiplies the answer by 2.
The code then prints the final answer modulo 100000007.
