The output of the code will depend on the input values of B and W.

If B = 2 and W = 1, the output will be 1.

If B = 1 and W = 1, the output will be 0.

If B = 1 and W = 2, the output will be 1.

If B = 2 and W = 2, the output will be 0.

If B = 3 and W = 1, the output will be 1.

If B = 3 and W = 2, the output will be 0.

If B = 3 and W = 3, the output will be 1.

If B = 4 and W = 1, the output will be 1.

If B = 4 and W = 2, the output will be 0.

If B = 4 and W = 3, the output will be 1.

If B = 4 and W = 4, the output will be 0.

If B = 5 and W = 1, the output will be 1.

If B = 5 and W = 2, the output will be 0.

If B = 5 and W = 3, the output will be 1.

If B = 5 and W = 4, the output will be 0.

If B = 5 and W = 5, the output will be 1.
