  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first initializes several variables:

* U is set to 2*10^5, which is a large number used as an upper bound for the range of values that will be processed.
* MOD is set to 10^9+7, which is a large prime number used to ensure that the calculations do not overflow.
* fact, fact_inv, two, and two_inv are initialized to arrays of length U+1, which will be used to store the values of the factorials and their inverses.

The code then enters a loop that calculates the values of the factorials and their inverses using the following formulae:

* fact[i] = (fact[i-1]*i)%MOD
* two[i] = (two[i-1]*2)%MOD
* fact_inv[U] = pow(fact[U], MOD-2, MOD)
* two_inv[U] = pow(two[U], MOD-2, MOD)

The loop then enters another loop that calculates the values of the factorials and their inverses for the range of values from U to 0, inclusive.

The function comb is then defined, which calculates the value of the binomial coefficient (n choose k) using the following formula:

* z = fact[n]
* z *= fact_inv[k]
* z %= MOD
* z *= fact_inv[n-k]
* z %= MOD

The code then reads in two integers B and W from standard input, and initializes two variables p and q to 0.

The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to B+W+1, and for each value of i, it calculates the value of the binomial coefficient (i choose B) and (i choose W) using the comb function, and then calculates the value of the expression 1 - p + q, which is the final result.

The code then prints the value of the expression 1 - p + q, which is the final result.

<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will depend on the input values of B and W.

If B = 2 and W = 1, the output will be 1.

If B = 1 and W = 1, the output will be 0.

If B = 1 and W = 2, the output will be 1.

If B = 2 and W = 2, the output will be 0.

If B = 3 and W = 1, the output will be 1.

If B = 3 and W = 2, the output will be 0.

If B = 3 and W = 3, the output will be 1.

If B = 4 and W = 1, the output will be 1.

If B = 4 and W = 2, the output will be 0.

If B = 4 and W = 3, the output will be 1.

If B = 4 and W = 4, the output will be 0.

If B = 5 and W = 1, the output will be 1.

If B = 5 and W = 2, the output will be 0.

If B = 5 and W = 3, the output will be 1.

If B = 5 and W = 4, the output will be 0.

If B = 5 and W = 5, the output will be 1.
