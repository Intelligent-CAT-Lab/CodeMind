  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first reads an integer R from standard input using the readline() method of the sys module.
The code then checks if R is between 0 and 1200, inclusive, and prints "ABC" if it is.
If R is between 1200 and 2800, inclusive, the code prints "ARC".
Otherwise, the code prints "AGC".
<<<Output>>>
ABC
