  <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and variable x are initialized to 2 and 7, respectively.
The function f is defined with two parameters, N and X.
The function f checks if N is equal to 0, if it is, it returns 0 if X is less than or equal to 0, otherwise it returns 1.
If N is not equal to 0, the function checks if X is less than or equal to 4 times 2 raised to the power of N minus 2. If it is, it returns the value of f(N-1, X-1).
If X is equal to 4 times 2 raised to the power of N minus 1, it returns 2 raised to the power of N.
If X is less than or equal to 4 times 2 raised to the power of N minus 3, it returns 2 raised to the power of N plus the value of f(N-1, X - 4 times 2 raised to the power of N minus 1).
If none of the above conditions are met, it returns 2 raised to the power of N plus 1.
The function f is then called with the values of n and x as parameters.
