  <<<Analysis>>>
The function egcd takes two integers a and b as input and returns their greatest common divisor (gcd), the coefficients of the linear combination of a and b that produces the gcd, and the sign of the gcd.
The function first initializes the variables x, y, u, and v to 0, 1, 1, and 0, respectively.
The function then enters a loop that iterates while a is not equal to 0.
In each iteration, the function calculates the quotient and remainder of b divided by a, and updates the variables m, n, x, y, u, and v accordingly.
The function then updates the variables b, a, x, y, u, and v with the values of a and r, respectively, and repeats the loop.
The function exits the loop when a is equal to 0, and returns the value of b as the gcd.
The function then checks if the linear combination of a and b that produces the gcd is equal to the gcd, and if it is, it swaps the values of x and y.
The function then prints the values of x and y.
