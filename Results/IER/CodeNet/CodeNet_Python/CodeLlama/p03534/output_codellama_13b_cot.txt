<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user and stores it in the variable s.
The code then initializes a dictionary called dic with keys 'a', 'b', and 'c' and values 0, 0, and 0, respectively.
The code then iterates over the characters in the string s and increments the corresponding value in the dictionary by 1.
For example, if the input is "abac", the dictionary will be {'a': 2, 'b': 1, 'c': 1}.
The code then extracts the values from the dictionary and stores them in variables a, b, and c.
The code then calculates the maximum absolute difference between the values of a, b, and c and checks if it is less than or equal to 1.
If it is, the code prints "YES", otherwise it prints "NO".
<<<Output>>>
YES
