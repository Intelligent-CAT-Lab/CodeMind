  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes in two inputs N and K, and initializes the variable MOD to 10^9 + 7.
The code then calculates the factorial and inverse of K using the formulae for the factorial and inverse of a number modulo MOD.
The code then defines a function nCr(n, r) that calculates the combination of n choose r modulo MOD using the formulae for the combination of n choose r and the fermat's little theorem.
The code then calculates the answer to the problem using the formulae for the answer and the function nCr(n, r).
