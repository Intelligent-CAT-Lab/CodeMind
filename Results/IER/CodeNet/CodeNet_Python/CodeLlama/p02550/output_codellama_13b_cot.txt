  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in three inputs: n, x, and m.
n is the number of elements in the array, x is the initial value of the array, and m is the modulus.
The code initializes an empty array arr, a set s to store the values of arr, and variables h, r, and res to store the final result.
The code enters a loop that iterates n-1 times.
For each iteration, the code calculates the square of the last element of arr and takes the modulus with m.
If the result is not in s, the code adds the result to arr and s.
If the result is in s, the code sets h to the current iteration and r to the result.
The loop breaks when the result is in s.
The code calculates the sum of arr and stores it in res.
If h is not -1, the code calculates the sum of the elements of arr from the index of r to the end of the array and multiplies it by the number of times the result appears in the array.
The code then adds the result to res.
The code prints the final value of res.
