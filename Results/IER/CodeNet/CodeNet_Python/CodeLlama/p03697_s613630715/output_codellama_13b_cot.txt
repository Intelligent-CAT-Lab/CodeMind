The code takes two integers as input from the user, separated by a space.
The variables A and B are initialized to the values of the first and second integers, respectively.
The code then checks if the sum of A and B is greater than or equal to 10.
If the condition is met, the code prints "error".
If the condition is not met, the code prints the sum of A and B.
