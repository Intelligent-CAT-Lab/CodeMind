<<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the math module, which provides mathematical functions.
The variable N is initialized to the input value 10000.
The variable i is initialized to the square root of N, which is 100.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from i to 0 (inclusive).
For each value of i, the code checks if N is divisible by i. If it is, it prints the length of the string representation of N // i (the integer division result), which is 4 in this case.
The loop breaks when the condition is met, and the code exits.
<<<Output>>>
4
