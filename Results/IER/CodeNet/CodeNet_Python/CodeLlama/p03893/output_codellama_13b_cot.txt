<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes two lists g and h with 50 None values each.
The code then sets h[1] to 3 and g[1] to 6.
The input X is then taken as an integer.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to X+1.
For each iteration, the code calculates h[i] as g[i-1] + 1 and g[i] as 2*h[i].
The loop finishes when i reaches X+1.
The code then prints g[X].
