<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, separated by a space.
The first integer is assigned to variable a, and the second integer is assigned to variable b.
The code then prints the result of the expression (a // b) + (a % b).

The expression (a // b) calculates the integer division of a by b, which is 2 in this case.
The expression (a % b) calculates the remainder of a divided by b, which is 0 in this case.
Therefore, the final output of the code is 2 + 0 = 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
