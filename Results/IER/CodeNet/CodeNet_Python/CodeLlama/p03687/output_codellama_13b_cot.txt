  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the Counter class from the collections module.
It then takes the input string as a list of characters and creates a Counter object from it.
The Counter object is a dictionary that maps each unique character in the input string to its frequency.
The code then initializes an empty list o and enters a loop that iterates over the keys of the Counter object.
For each key, the code initializes two variables j and m to 0.
It then enters another loop that iterates over the characters in the input string.
If the current character is the same as the current key, the code sets j to 0.
Otherwise, it increments j and sets m to the maximum of m and j.
After the inner loop finishes, the code appends the value of m to the o list.
Finally, the code prints the minimum value in the o list.
