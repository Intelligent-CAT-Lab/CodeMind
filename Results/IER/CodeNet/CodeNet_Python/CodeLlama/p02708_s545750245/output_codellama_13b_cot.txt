<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs, n and k, from the user.
The variable tot is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from k to n+2, meaning it will consider numbers from 2 to 4.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in tot.
The condition is met when i is 2,3 and 4.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of tot, which is 15.
<<<Output>>>
15
