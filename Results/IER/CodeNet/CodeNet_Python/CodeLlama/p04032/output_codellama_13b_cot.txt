  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user and stores it in the variable S.
The code then checks the length of S and if it is 2, it checks if the first and second characters are the same. If they are, it prints 1 and 2 and exits. If they are not, it prints -1 and -1 and exits.
If the length of S is not 2, the code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to the length of S minus 3. For each iteration, it creates a list called s from the characters at position i to position i+2 in S. It then checks if the length of the set of characters in s is less than or equal to 2. If it is, it prints the position of the first character in s (i+1) and the position of the last character in s (i+3) and breaks out of the loop. If it is not, it continues to the next iteration.
If the loop completes without finding a list with a length of 2, it prints -1 and -1.
<<<Output>>>
-1 -1
