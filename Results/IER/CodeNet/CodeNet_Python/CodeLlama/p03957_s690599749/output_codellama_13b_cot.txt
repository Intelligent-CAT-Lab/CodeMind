<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user and stores it in a variable s.
The code then initializes a variable f to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the length of the string s.
For each character in the string, the code checks if the character is "C" and if f is 0. If both conditions are met, the code increments f by 1.
The code then checks if f is 1 and if the current character is "F". If both conditions are met, the code prints "Yes" and exits the loop.
If the loop completes without printing "Yes", the code prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
