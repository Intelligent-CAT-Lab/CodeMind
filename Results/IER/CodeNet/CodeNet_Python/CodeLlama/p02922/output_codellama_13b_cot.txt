<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs, a and b, from the user.
The variable total is initialized to 1, which will be used to keep track of the total number of terms in the sequence.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to store the final answer.
The code enters a while loop that iterates as long as total is less than b.
In each iteration, the code adds 1 to ans and adds a-1 to total.
The loop stops when total is greater than or equal to b.
The code then prints the final value of ans, which is the number of terms in the sequence.
