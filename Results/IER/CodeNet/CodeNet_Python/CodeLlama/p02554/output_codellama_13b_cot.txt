  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input n and initializes three variables ant, bnt, and cnt to 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates n times.
For each iteration, the code calculates the next value of ant, bnt, and cnt using the following formulas:
ant = (10 * ant) % 1000000007
bnt = (9 * bnt) % 1000000007
cnt = (8 * cnt) % 1000000007

After the loop finishes, the code calculates the final answer as:
ans = (ant - (bnt * 2 - cnt)) % 1000000007

If the answer is negative, the code adds 1000000007 to it to make it positive.
<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will be 1000000007.
