  The output of the code is:

C) Hello, Alice!
   Hello, Bob!

The code defines a function called `greet` that takes a single argument, `name`, and prints a greeting message using the `print` function. The function is then called twice, once with the argument "Alice" and once with the argument "Bob", resulting in two separate greeting messages being printed.

Therefore, option C is the correct answer.
