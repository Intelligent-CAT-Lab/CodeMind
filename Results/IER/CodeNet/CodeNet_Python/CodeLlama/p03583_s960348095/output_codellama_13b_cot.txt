  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first reads an integer N from standard input and stores it in the variable N.
The code then enters a nested loop that iterates over the range of values from 1 to 3500 for both the height and width of a rectangle.
For each pair of height and width, the code calculates the area of the rectangle using the formula A = h \* w.
The code then checks if the area is equal to the input value N. If it is, the code prints the height, width, and the number of rectangles that can be formed with that height and width.
The code then returns from the function without printing anything.

<<<Output>>>
The code will not print anything because the condition (4 * h * w - N * w - N * h) == 0 is never met.
