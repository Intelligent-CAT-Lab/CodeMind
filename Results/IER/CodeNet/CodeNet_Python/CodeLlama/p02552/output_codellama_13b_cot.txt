  The output of the code is:

A) Hello, Alice!
Hello, Bob!

Explanation:
The code defines a function called `greet` that takes a single argument `name` and prints a greeting message using the `print` function. The function is then called twice with the arguments "Alice" and "Bob", resulting in the output "Hello, Alice!" and "Hello, Bob!". Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
