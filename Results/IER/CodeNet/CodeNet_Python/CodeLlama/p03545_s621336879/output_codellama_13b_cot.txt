  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the product function from the itertools module.
The variable S is initialized to the input string "1222".
The code then enters a loop that iterates over all possible combinations of the strings "+", "-", and "".
For each combination, it creates a list of strings by zipping the input string S with the current combination.
The code then calculates the sum of the elements in the list using the eval function.
If the sum is equal to 7, the code prints the list of strings joined by the "+" symbol and the string "=7".
The code then breaks out of the loop.
<<<Output>>>
1222+1222+1222+1222=7
