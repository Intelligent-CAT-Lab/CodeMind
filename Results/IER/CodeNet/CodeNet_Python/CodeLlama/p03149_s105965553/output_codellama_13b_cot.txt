  <<<Analysis>>>
The code imports the sys module and defines a main function.
The main function reads a line of input from stdin using the readline method and splits it into a list of strings using the split method.
The list is then sorted using the sorted function.
The code then checks if the sorted list is equal to the list ['1', '4', '7', '9'], which is the case in this example.
If the condition is met, the code prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'.
<<<Output>>>
YES
