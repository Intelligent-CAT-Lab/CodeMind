<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input as a list of integers using the map() function.
The input is split into two numbers, 9 and 12, and the list is created as [9, 12].
The code then calculates the sum of these two numbers and takes the modulo of 24.
The modulo operation returns the remainder of the division of the first number by the second number.
In this case, the sum of 9 and 12 is 21, and the remainder of 21 divided by 24 is 3.
The code then prints the result, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>
3
