  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the factorial function from the math module.
It then defines a constant maxans equal to 100000007.
The code then defines a function named main, which is the entry point of the program.
The function takes no arguments and returns nothing.
The function first maps the input string to integers using the map function.
The input string is split into a list of integers using the split function.
The list is then unpacked into the variables r, c, ar, ac, br, and bc.
The code then calculates the distance between the two points using the min function.
The distance is calculated by taking the absolute value of the difference between the two points and then taking the minimum of that value and the difference between the maximum value and the minimum value.
The code then calculates the gain in each direction using the gainr and gainc variables.
The gain is calculated by taking the minimum of the distance and the maximum value minus the distance.
If the distance is equal to the maximum value, the gain is 2, otherwise it is 1.
The code then calculates the answer using the factorial function.
The answer is calculated by taking the factorial of the sum of the distances and dividing it by the factorial of each distance.
The code then prints the answer modulo maxans.
