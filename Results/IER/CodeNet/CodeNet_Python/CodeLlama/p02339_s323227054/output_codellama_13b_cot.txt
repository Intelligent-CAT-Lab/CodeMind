  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first sets the recursion limit to 10000000 and imports the necessary modules.
It then reads the input from the user, which is a pair of integers n and k.
The code then defines a few functions:
* comb(N, K): returns the binomial coefficient of N and K.
* pow(N): returns the power of N.
* inv(N): returns the inverse of N.

The code then calculates the answer by first calculating the power of k, then adding the binomial coefficients of k and i, and finally multiplying the result by the inverse of i.
The code then prints the final answer.

<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will be the value of the expression (k^k) + (k^(k-1)) + ... + (k^1) + (k^0), which is equal to 10.
