  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input N and x from the user.
The code then checks if x is equal to 1 or 2*N-1. If it is, the code prints 'Yes' and 1, and exits.
The code then checks if x is greater than N. If it is, it sets smaller to False and sets x to 2*N-x.
The code then creates a list called ans by concatenating two lists: the first list is the range of numbers from 2*N-1 to N+x-1 in reverse order, and the second list is the range of numbers from 1 to N+x.
If smaller is False, the code reverses the order of the elements in ans.
The code then prints 'Yes' and the elements of ans.
