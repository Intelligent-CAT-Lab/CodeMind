  <<<Analysis>>>
The variable S is initialized to "erasedream".
The variable a is initialized to a list of strings ["dream","dreamer","erase","eraser","dreamerase","dreameraser"].
The variable numlist is initialized to a list of zeros [0,0,0,0,0,0].
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the length of the list a.
For each iteration, it calculates the number of times the current string in a is present in S and stores it in the corresponding index of numlist.
The code then subtracts the number of times the string "dreamer" is present in S from the number of times the string "dream" is present in S.
The code then subtracts the number of times the string "eraser" is present in S from the number of times the string "erase" is present in S.
The code then subtracts the number of times the string "dreameraser" is present in S from the number of times the string "dreamerase" is present in S.
The code then adds the number of times the string "dreamerase" is present in S to the number of times the string "dream" is present in S.
The code then calculates the total number of characters in S and compares it to the sum of the products of the number of times each string in a is present in S and the corresponding weights.
If the total number of characters in S is equal to the sum of the products of the number of times each string in a is present in S and the corresponding weights, the code prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".
