  <<<Analysis>>>
The code defines two functions: coun and sigma.
The coun function takes two arguments, n and r, and returns the value of n*r+1+r-r**2.
The sigma function takes three arguments: func, frm, and too. It defines a variable result and initializes it to 0. It then enters a loop that iterates from frm to too+2, and for each iteration, it calculates the value of func(too,i) and adds it to result. Finally, it prints the value of result%mod.
The code then takes two inputs, n and k, and assigns them to variables n and k, respectively. It then assigns the value 10**9+7 to the variable mod.
Finally, the code calls the sigma function with the arguments coun, k, and n.
<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will depend on the values of n and k.
If n=3 and k=2, the output will be 10.
