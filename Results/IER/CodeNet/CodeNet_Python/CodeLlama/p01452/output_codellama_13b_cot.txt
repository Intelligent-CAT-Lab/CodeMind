  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports several modules, including math, string, itertools, fractions, heapq, collections, re, array, bisect, sys, random, time, copy, and functools.

The code then sets the recursion limit to 10^7 and defines several constants, including inf, eps, and mod.

The code defines two functions, LI(), LI_(), LF(), LS(), I(), F(), S(), pf(s), inv(x), comb_init(), comb(a, b), and main().

The code then defines a list called rr and calls the main() function.

The main() function first defines a function called f(n,m,k) that takes three arguments: n, m, and k.

The f(n,m,k) function first calls the comb_init() function, which initializes the cm list with values from 0 to 10^6.

The f(n,m,k) function then defines a variable called r and sets it to 0.

The f(n,m,k) function then enters a loop that iterates from k+1 to 0.

Inside the loop, the f(n,m,k) function calculates the value of mt, lk, and rk using the comb() function.

The f(n,m,k) function then updates the value of r using the formula r += mt * lk * rk % mod.

The f(n,m,k) function then returns the value of r.

The main() function then calls the f(n,m,k) function with the arguments n, m, and k, which are read from the input.

The main() function then appends the result of the f(n,m,k) function to the rr list.

The main() function then returns the rr list as a string.

<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will be a string containing the values of the rr list, separated by newlines.
