<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in a single line of input, which is a string of digits.
The code then splits the input into three variables a, b, and c, where a is the first digit, b is the second digit, and c is the third digit.
The code then checks if a is equal to c, and if it is, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
