  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes in two integers N and M as input.
The code then checks if N is greater than M and swaps their values if it is.
The code then initializes three lists: fact, powm, and pown.
The code then initializes a function pow that takes in two integers n and m and returns n^m mod mod.
The code then initializes a function C that takes in two integers n and r and returns the binomial coefficient C(n, r) mod mod.
The code then initializes a list inv_fact that stores the inverse of the factorial of each number from 0 to M.
The code then initializes a variable ans that will store the final answer.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to N+1.
For each iteration, the code calculates the value of ans using the formula:
ans += (-1)**i * C(N, i) * C(M, i) * fact[i] * powm[N - i] * pown[M - i]
The code then prints the final value of ans.
