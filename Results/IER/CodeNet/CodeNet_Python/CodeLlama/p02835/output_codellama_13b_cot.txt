<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in three integers separated by spaces as input.
The variables a, b, and c are initialized to the values of the input.
The code then calculates the sum of a, b, and c and checks if it is less than 22.
If the sum is less than 22, the code prints "win". Otherwise, it prints "bust".
<<<Output>>>
win
