  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input n from the user.
The function factorization is defined, which takes an integer n as input and returns an array of arrays, where each subarray contains two elements: the first element is a prime factor of n, and the second element is the power to which that prime factor is raised.
The function factorization first initializes an empty array arr.
It then iterates from 2 to the square root of n, and for each integer i in this range, it checks if n is divisible by i. If it is, it calculates the number of times i divides n, and appends the pair [i, cnt] to arr.
After the loop finishes, if n is not equal to 1, it appends [n, 1] to arr.
The function factorization then returns arr.
The code then checks if n is equal to 1, and if it is, it prints 0 and exits.
If n is not equal to 1, it calculates the value of ans by iterating over the array a, which is the array returned by the function factorization.
For each subarray i in a, it calculates the value of k, which is the second element of i.
It then calculates the value of ans by adding the value of the expression (-1+(1+8*k)**(0.5))/2 to ans.
Finally, the code prints the value of ans.
