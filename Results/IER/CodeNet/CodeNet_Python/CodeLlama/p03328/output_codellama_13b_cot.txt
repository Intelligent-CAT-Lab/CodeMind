The code takes two integers as input, a and b, and stores them in variables a and b, respectively.
The code calculates the distance between the two towers, tower_dis, as b - a.
The code calculates the height of the second tower, b_height, as tower_dis * (tower_dis + 1) // 2.
The code calculates the difference between the two heights, ans, as b_height - b.
The code prints the final value of ans.
