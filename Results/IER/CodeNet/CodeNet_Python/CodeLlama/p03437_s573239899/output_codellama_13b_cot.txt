<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user in the form of two integers x and y separated by a space.
The input is then split into a list of two strings using the split() method.
The list is then converted to a list of integers using list comprehension.
The code then checks if x is divisible by y.
If it is, the code prints -1.
If it is not, the code prints x.
