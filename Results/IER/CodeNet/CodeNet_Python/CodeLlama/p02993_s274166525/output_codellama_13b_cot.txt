<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user and stores it in the variable s.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to the length of the string s-1.
For each iteration, the code checks if the character at the current index i is equal to the character at the next index i+1.
If the condition is met, the code prints "Bad" and exits the loop.
If the loop completes without finding any matching characters, the code prints "Good".
<<<Output>>>
Bad
