The code first takes input from the user and stores it in a variable s.
The length of the string is calculated and stored in a variable n.
The code checks if the first and last characters of the string are the same. If they are, it increments the value of n by 1.
The code then prints "First" if the value of n is odd, and "Second" otherwise.
