<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input string "aabbaa" and stores it in the variable s.
It then initializes the variable t to an empty string, k to 0, and prev to an empty string.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the length of the input string (which is 6 in this case).
For each iteration, it appends the current character to the variable t, and checks if the previous character is not equal to t.
If it is not equal, it increments k by 1, sets prev to t, and sets t to an empty string.
The loop finishes when it reaches the end of the input string.
The code then prints the final value of k, which is 4.
<<<Output>>>
4
