  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes in two inputs, n and y, and initializes a flag to False.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n, meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to n.
For each number i in this range, it enters another loop that iterates from 0 to n-i, meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to n-i.
For each number j in this range, it calculates the result of y - 10000 * i - 5000 * j, and checks if the result is divisible by 1000.
If it is, it prints the values of i, j, and the result, and sets the flag to True.
If the flag is True, the code breaks out of the inner loop and the outer loop.
If the flag is still False after the loops finish, the code prints -1, -1, and -1.
