  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports several modules, including bisect, collections, copy, heapq, itertools, math, string, and sys.
It then defines several functions, including I, F, SS, LI, LI_, LF, LSS, combMod, and resolve.
The resolve function is called, which takes two inputs, n and k.
The code then checks if n is greater than or equal to k.
If it is, it calculates the answer using a formula involving the binomial coefficient and the power function.
If n is less than k, the answer is 0.
The code then prints the answer.
