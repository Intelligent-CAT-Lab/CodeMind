  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the necessary libraries, including numpy for numerical computations and sys for reading input from stdin.
The code then reads the input from stdin and splits it into two integers N and M.
The code then initializes two numpy arrays dp_T and dp_F, which will be used to store the number of ways to arrange the boxes in a row such that the first box is red and the last box is red, respectively.
The code then enters a loop that iterates M times.
For each iteration, the code updates the values of dp_T and dp_F using the following recurrence relation:
dp_T[i] = dp_T[i-1] + dp_F[i-1]
dp_F[i] = dp_F[i-1] + dp_T[i-1]
The code then takes the modulo of MOD (10^9 + 7) to ensure that the values of dp_T and dp_F are within the range of the modulo.
Finally, the code prints the sum of the values of dp_T, which is the number of ways to arrange the boxes in a row such that the first box is red and the last box is red.
<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will be the number of ways to arrange the boxes in a row such that the first box is red and the last box is red, which is 3.
