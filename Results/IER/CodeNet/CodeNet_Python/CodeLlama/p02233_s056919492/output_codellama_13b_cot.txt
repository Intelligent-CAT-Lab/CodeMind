  <<<Analysis>>>
The function fib takes two arguments, n and memo. The function returns the nth Fibonacci number.
The function first checks if n is 0 or 1, in which case the function returns 1.
If n is not 0 or 1, the function checks if n is already in the memo dictionary. If it is, the function returns the value stored in the memo dictionary.
If n is not in the memo dictionary, the function calculates the nth Fibonacci number by calling itself recursively with n-1 and n-2 as arguments.
The function then stores the calculated value in the memo dictionary and returns it.
The main function takes an integer input n and calls the fib function with n as an argument.
The function prints the returned value.
