<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers X and Y as input, separated by a space.
The code then calculates the absolute difference between X and Y, which is abs(X-Y).
The code checks if the absolute difference is greater than or equal to 2, which is the condition in the if statement.
If the condition is met, the code prints 'Alice', otherwise it prints 'Brown'.

In this case, the input is 2 and 1, which means X=2 and Y=1. The absolute difference between X and Y is 1, which is less than 2. Therefore, the code prints 'Brown'.
<<<Output>>>
Brown
