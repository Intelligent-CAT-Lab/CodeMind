  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input E and Y as integers.
The code then checks if E is equal to 0. If it is, it checks if Y is greater than 1912. If it is, it prints "M" followed by the value of Y minus 1867. If Y is greater than 1926, it prints "T" followed by the value of Y minus 1911. If Y is greater than 1989, it prints "S" followed by the value of Y minus 1925. Otherwise, it prints "H" followed by the value of Y minus 1988.
If E is not equal to 0, it checks if E is equal to 1. If it is, it prints the value of 1867 plus Y. If E is equal to 2, it prints the value of 1911 plus Y. If E is equal to 3, it prints the value of 1925 plus Y. Otherwise, it prints the value of 1988 plus Y.
