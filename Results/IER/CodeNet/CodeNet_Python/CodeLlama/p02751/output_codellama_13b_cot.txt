  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs, n and m, and initializes a 2D list ans with dimensions 2^n-1 x 2^m-1, where each element is initialized to "1".
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 10, meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 10.
For each number k in this range, the code enters a nested loop that iterates from 2^k to 2^n in steps of 2^k, and another nested loop that iterates from 2^k to 2^m in steps of 2^k.
For each pair of indices (i,j) in these loops, the code checks if the element at position (i,j) in the 2D list ans is "1". If it is, the code sets the element at position (i,j) to "0". Otherwise, it sets the element at position (i,j) to "1".
After the loops finish, the code prints the final value of the 2D list ans, which is a 2D list of dimensions 2^n-1 x 2^m-1, where each element is either "0" or "1".
