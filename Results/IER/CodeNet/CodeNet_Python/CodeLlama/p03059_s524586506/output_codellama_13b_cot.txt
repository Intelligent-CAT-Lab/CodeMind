<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in three integers A, B, and T as input.
The code then calculates the value of (T + 0.5) // A * B, where // is the integer division operator.
The result of this calculation is then cast to an integer and printed.

In this case, the input is 3, 5, and 7, respectively.
The calculation is (7 + 0.5) // 3 * 5, which is (7.5) // 3 * 5, which is 5.
The result of this calculation is 5, which is then cast to an integer and printed.

<<<Output>>>
5
