<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input K from the user.
The variable K is then converted to an integer using the int() function.
The code then prints the integer 50 to the console.
The variable a is initialized to the integer division of K by 50, and the variable b is initialized to the modulo of K by 50.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 50-b, and for each iteration, it appends the string representation of a+i to the list ans.
The code then enters another loop that iterates from 0 to b, and for each iteration, it appends the string representation of a+50-b+i+1 to the list ans.
Finally, the code joins the elements of the list ans using the " " separator and prints the resulting string to the console.
<<<Output>>>
50
