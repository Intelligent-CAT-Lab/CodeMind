  <<<Analysis>>>
The code defines two functions: gcd and lcm.
The gcd function uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of two numbers.
The lcm function uses the gcd function to find the least common multiple of two numbers.
The code then takes two numbers A and B as input and prints their least common multiple.
