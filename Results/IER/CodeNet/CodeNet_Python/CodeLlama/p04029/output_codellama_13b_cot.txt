<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input n from the user and stores it in the variable n.
The code then calculates the sum of the first n natural numbers using the formula (n + 1) * n / 2.
The formula is derived from the fact that the sum of the first n natural numbers is equal to the sum of the first n odd numbers, which is equal to (n + 1) * n / 2.
The code then prints the result of the calculation, which is the sum of the first n natural numbers.
