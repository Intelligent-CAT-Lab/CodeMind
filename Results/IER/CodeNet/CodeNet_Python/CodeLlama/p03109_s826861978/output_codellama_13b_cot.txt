<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input from the user and stores it in the variable s.
The code then extracts the year, month, and date from the input string using slicing.
The year is extracted from the first four characters of the input string, which is 2019.
The month is extracted from the fifth and sixth characters of the input string, which is 04.
The date is extracted from the seventh and eighth characters of the input string, which is 30.
The code then checks if the year is less than or equal to 2019. If it is, it checks if the month is less than or equal to 4. If it is, it prints "Heisei". If the month is greater than 4, it prints "TBD". If the year is greater than 2019, it prints "TBD".
<<<Output>>>
Heisei
