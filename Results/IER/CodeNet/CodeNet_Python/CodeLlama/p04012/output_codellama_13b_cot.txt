<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by defining a string Alfa containing all lowercase letters of the English alphabet.
The variable w is initialized to the input string "abaccaba".
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each letter in Alfa.
For each letter i in Alfa, it checks if the number of occurrences of i in w is odd.
If it is, the code prints "No" and exits the loop.
If the loop completes without printing "No", the code prints "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
No
