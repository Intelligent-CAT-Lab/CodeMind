<<<Analysis>>>
The code imports the itertools module and uses the permutations function to generate all possible permutations of a sequence of numbers from 1 to n (inclusive).
The variable n is initialized to the input value, which is 2 in this case.
The variable b is initialized to the permutations of the sequence from 1 to n+1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each element in b and prints it.
The loop prints each permutation as a space-separated string.
<<<Output>>>
1 2
2 1
