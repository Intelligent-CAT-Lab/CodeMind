<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input as a list of integers using the map function.
The list is then sorted using the sort function.
The code then checks if the sum of the first two elements of the sorted list is equal to the third element.
If the condition is met, the code prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
