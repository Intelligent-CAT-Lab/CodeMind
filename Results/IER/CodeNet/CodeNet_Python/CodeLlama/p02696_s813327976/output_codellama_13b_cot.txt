<<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the math module, which provides mathematical functions.
The code then maps the input to three variables a, b, and n, which are integers.
The code then checks if b is less than or equal to n+1. If it is, it sets x to b-1. Otherwise, it sets x to n.
The code then calculates g as the floor of a*x/b.
The code then prints g.
