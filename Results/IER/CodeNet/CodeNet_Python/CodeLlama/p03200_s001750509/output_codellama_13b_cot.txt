  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module and the collections module.
The code then defines a function called main.
The function takes no arguments and returns nothing.
The function first prompts the user to enter a string.
The function then splits the string into a list of characters.
The function then iterates over the list of characters and checks if each character is equal to the character "B".
If the character is equal to "B", the function increments a counter.
If the character is not equal to "B", the function adds the value of the counter to a total.
The function then prints the value of the total.
