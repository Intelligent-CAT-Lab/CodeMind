<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, separated by a space.
The variables a and b are initialized to the values of the first and second integers, respectively.
The code then checks if a is less than b, greater than b, or equal to b.
If a is less than b, the code prints 'a < b'.
If a is greater than b, the code prints 'a > b'.
If a is equal to b, the code prints 'a == b'.
The code then ends.
<<<Output>>>
a < b
