  The output of the code is:

A) Hello, Alice!

Explanation:
The code defines a function called `greet` that takes a single argument `name` and prints a greeting message using the `print` function. The function is then called with the argument `"Alice"`, which results in the output "Hello, Alice!". Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
