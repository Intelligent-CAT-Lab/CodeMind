  <<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes two variables o and f. o is set to 998244353, and f is set to [1].
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 2500100, which is a large number.
For each iteration, the code appends the product of the previous element in f and i (where i is the current iteration number) modulo o to f.
The code then defines a function c that takes two arguments, n and k, and returns the product of f[n] and f[n-k] raised to the power o-2 modulo o, multiplied by f[k] raised to the power o-2 modulo o.
The code then takes input from the user in the form of two integers n and m.
The code then calculates the value of a, which is the result of the function c called with arguments w and u, where w is 3*m and u is n-1.
The code then checks if u is greater than m, and if so, it enters a nested loop that iterates from m+1 to the minimum of w and n.
For each iteration, the code calculates the value of a, which is the result of the function c called with arguments n and i, where i is the current iteration number.
The code then subtracts the product of c(n,i) and c((w-i)/2+u,u) from a, where w-i+1 is odd.
Finally, the code prints the value of a modulo o.
<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will depend on the input given.
If the input is 2 2, the output will be 1.
