  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user and stores it in the variable N.
The code then checks if N is equal to 0, and if it is, it returns 0.
If N is not equal to 0, the code initializes a set l and a variable N.
The code then enters a while loop that iterates until N is equal to 0.
In each iteration, the code checks if N is greater than 0. If it is, it calls the plus function and stores the result in r.
The code then subtracts pow(2, r) from N and adds r to l.
If N is less than or equal to 0, the code calls the minus function and stores the result in r.
The code then adds pow(2, r) to N and adds r to l.
The code then sorts l and prints the result.
