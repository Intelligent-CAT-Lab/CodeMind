  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the necessary libraries, including sys, numpy, and math.
It then reads the input from stdin and splits it into three variables, N, M, and K.
The code then defines a few functions, including cumprod, make_fact, and make_power.
These functions are used to calculate the cumulative product of an array, the factorial of a number, and the power of a number.
The code then initializes some variables, including U, power2, power2_inv, power3, power3_inv, fact, and fact_inv.
These variables are used to calculate the final answer.
The code then calculates the final answer using the variables and functions defined earlier.
The output of the code is the final answer, which is a number.
