  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs, n and m, and initializes an array d with n+1 elements, all set to 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n-1, meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to n-1.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the value of d[i+1] using the following formula:
((m-i)*((m-n+i)*d[i]+i*d[i-1]*(m-i+1)))%(10**9+7)
The code then prints the final value of d[-1], which is the last element of the array.
