  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the collections module and sets the recursion limit to 10^6.
It then defines a function bruteforce that takes a string as input and returns the number of distinct substrings of length 2 or more.
The function uses a set to keep track of the substrings that have already been seen, and a recursive function to generate all substrings.
The function then returns the length of the set.
The code then defines a function main that takes a string as input and prints the result of the bruteforce function.
The code then calls the main function with the input string "abc".
