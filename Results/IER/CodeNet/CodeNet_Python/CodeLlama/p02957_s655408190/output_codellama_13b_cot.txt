<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers A and B as input, separated by a space.
The code then checks if the sum of A and B is even (i.e., if (A+B)%2==0).
If the sum is even, the code prints the average of A and B, rounded down to the nearest integer (i.e., int((A+B)/2)).
If the sum is odd, the code prints the string "IMPOSSIBLE".

In this case, the input is 2 and 16, which gives a sum of 18. Since 18 is even, the code prints 9, which is the average of 2 and 16 rounded down to the nearest integer.
<<<Output>>>
9
