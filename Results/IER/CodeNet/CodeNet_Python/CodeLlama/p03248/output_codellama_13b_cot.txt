  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the bisect module from the Python standard library.
The variable s is initialized to the input string "1111".
The code checks if the last character of s is "1" or the first character is "0". If either of these conditions is met, it prints -1 and exits.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to (len(s) - 1) // 2, which is 0 to 2 in this case.
For each iteration, the code checks if the characters at position i and len(s) - i - 2 are the same. If they are not, it prints -1 and exits.
The code then calculates the suffix of s with the last character removed and adds a "1" to the end. It then creates a list of indices where the character "1" appears in the suffix.
The code then enters another loop that iterates over the characters of s[:-1]. For each character, it uses the bisect module to find the index of the next "1" in the suffix list. It then prints the index of the current character plus 1 and the index of the next "1" plus 1.
