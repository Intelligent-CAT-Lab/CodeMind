  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the gcd function from the math module.
The function solve is defined, which takes two integers p and q as input and calculates their greatest common divisor using the gcd function.
The function then divides both p and q by their GCD to simplify the fraction.
The function then prints the simplified fraction in the form of p/q.
The code then defines a variable s and assigns it the input string.
The code then splits the input string into two parts using the dot character as the delimiter.
The first part is assigned to x and the second part is assigned to y.
The code then checks if the last character of y is a closing parenthesis.
If it is, the code calculates the value of a and b using the formulae given in the problem statement.
The code then calls the solve function with the values of a and b.
If the last character of y is not a closing parenthesis, the code calculates the value of p and q using the formulae given in the problem statement.
The code then calls the solve function with the values of p and q.
