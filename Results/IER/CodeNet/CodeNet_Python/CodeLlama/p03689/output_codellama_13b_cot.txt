  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes in the input as a list of integers using the map function.
The list is then unpacked into the variables H, W, h, and w.
The code then checks if H is divisible by h and W is divisible by w.
If both conditions are true, the code prints "No".
If W is not divisible by w, the code prints "Yes" and then enters a nested loop that prints a pattern of 100000 and -100000.
If H is not divisible by h, the code prints "Yes" and then enters a nested loop that prints a pattern of 100000 and -100000.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
100000 100000 100000
100000 -100000 -100000
100000 100000 100000
