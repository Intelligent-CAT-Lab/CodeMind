<<<Analysis>>>
The code first initializes two variables, ref and aizu, to the lists "AADINNUY" and "AIZUNYAN", respectively.
The code then reads a string from the user and stores it in the variable inp.
The code then checks the length of the input string, and if it is less than 8, it prints the input string.
If the length of the input string is greater than or equal to 8, the code enters a loop that iterates over the input string.
For each character in the input string, the code checks if the substring of length 8 starting at that character is equal to the reference string ref.
If it is, the code appends the string aizu to the output string ans.
If it is not, the code appends the current character to the output string ans.
The code then prints the output string ans.
