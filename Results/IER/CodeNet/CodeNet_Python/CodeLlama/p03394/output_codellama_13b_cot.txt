  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input N from the user.
It then initializes two lists P2 and P3 with 5000 and 2500 elements, respectively.
The code then sets a limit variable to 30000.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 4999, meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 4999.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
