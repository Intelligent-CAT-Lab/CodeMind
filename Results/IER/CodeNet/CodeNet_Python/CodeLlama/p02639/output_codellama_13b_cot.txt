<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input as a list of integers using the map() function.
The list is then iterated over using a for loop that iterates from 0 to 4 (inclusive).
For each iteration, the code checks if the current element is equal to 0.
If it is, the code prints the current index (i+1) and then breaks out of the loop.
Since the input list contains 5 elements, the loop will iterate 5 times.
The output of the code will be the index of the first element that is equal to 0, which is 1.
