<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input from the user and stores it in the variable D.
The code then checks if D is equal to 25, and if it is, it prints "Christmas".
If D is not equal to 25, the code checks if D is equal to 24, and if it is, it prints "Christmas Eve".
If D is not equal to 24, the code checks if D is equal to 23, and if it is, it prints "Christmas Eve Eve".
If D is not equal to 23, the code prints "Christmas Eve Eve Eve".
<<<Output>>>
Christmas
