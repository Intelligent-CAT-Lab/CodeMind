  <<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function cal(n) that returns the sum of the first n natural numbers.
The code then prompts the user to input a value x and initializes a list ans with the values 1 and cal(x).
The code then enters a loop that iterates until the condition ans[1]-ans[0]==1 is met.
In each iteration, the code calculates the sum of the first half of the numbers in ans and stores it in tmp.
The code checks if tmp is greater than, less than, or equal to x.
If tmp is greater than x, the code updates ans[1] to be the sum of the first half of the numbers in ans.
If tmp is less than x, the code updates ans[0] to be the sum of the first half of the numbers in ans.
If tmp is equal to x, the code prints the sum of the first half of the numbers in ans and breaks out of the loop.
If the difference between ans[1] and ans[0] is 1, the code prints the value of ans[1] and breaks out of the loop.
