  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input N from the user.
The code then checks if N is even or odd using the modulo operator.
If N is even, the code initializes an empty list called edge and enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive).
For each number s in this range, the code calculates the number ng = N - s + 1.
The code then enters another loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive).
For each number t in this range, the code checks if s >= t or t == ng. If either of these conditions is true, the code continues to the next iteration.
If both conditions are false, the code appends the tuple (s, t) to the edge list.
The code repeats this process for all values of s from 1 to N.
After the loops finish, the code prints the length of the edge list and then prints each tuple in the list.

If N is odd, the code follows a similar process, but the second loop starts at 1 instead of 2.

<<<Output>>>
The output of the code depends on the value of N.
If N is even, the output will be a list of tuples representing the edges of a complete graph with N vertices.
If N is odd, the output will be a list of tuples representing the edges of a complete graph with N vertices, but with one vertex removed.
