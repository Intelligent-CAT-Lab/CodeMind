<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user and stores it in a variable s.
The code then initializes two variables, cnt and l, to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the length of the string s.
For each character in the string, the code checks if it is equal to 'W'. If it is, it increments the value of cnt by the difference between the current index i and the previous index l. The code then updates the value of l to the current index i.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of cnt, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
