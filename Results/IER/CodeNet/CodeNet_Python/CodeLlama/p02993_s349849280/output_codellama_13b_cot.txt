  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string input s from the user.
It then iterates over the string s, checking if each character is equal to the next character.
If it finds two equal characters, it sets the variable is_good to False and breaks out of the loop.
Finally, it prints "Good" if is_good is True, and "Bad" otherwise.

<<<Output>>>
Bad
