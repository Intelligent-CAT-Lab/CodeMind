  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in three inputs: N, X, and M.
N is the length of the sequence A.
X is the starting index of the sequence A.
M is the modulus for the sequence A.

The code then initializes two arrays, nxt and dp, with dimensions H x M, where H is the number of bits in N.
nxt[i][r] represents the value of r mod M after 2 ** i squaring.
dp[i][r] represents the sum of the sequence of length 2 ** i starting from r.

The code then calculates the values of nxt and dp for each i and r.

The code then calculates the sum of the sequence of length N starting from X.
It does this by iterating over each bit in N and adding the corresponding value in dp to the sum.

The code then prints the final sum.

<<<Output>>>
The output of the code would be 1001.
