  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three inputs a, b, and k from the user.
The code then initializes an empty list res.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 100.
For each number i in this range, the code checks if a and b are divisible by i. If they are, the code appends i to the list res.
The code then sorts the list res in descending order.
The code then prints the k-th element of the list res.
