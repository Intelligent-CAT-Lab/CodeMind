<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, separated by a space.
The first integer is assigned to variable a, and the second integer is assigned to variable b.
The code then multiplies a and b and prints the result.

In this case, the input is 2 and 5, so the output would be 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
