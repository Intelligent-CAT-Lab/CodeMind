  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the NumPy library as np.
The function exp_np is defined, which takes three arguments: a, e, and m.
The function exp_np calculates the power of a modulo m using the binary exponentiation algorithm.
The function exp_np returns the result of the calculation.
The code then maps the input to the variables l, a, b, and m.
The variable first_d is initialized to the length of the string representation of a.
The variable tail is initialized to a + b * (l - 1).
The variable lo is initialized to -1.
The variable state is initialized to a 3x3 matrix with elements 0, a % m, and 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from first_d to 19, inclusive.
For each value of d, the code calculates the hi value as the minimum of (10^d - 1 - a) // b and l - 1.
The code calculates the cnt value as hi - lo.
The code calculates the coe value as a 3x3 matrix with elements pow(10, d, m), 0, and 0, 1, and 0, b % m, and 1.
The code calculates the coe value using the exp_np function.
The code updates the state value using the dot product of the state and coe values.
The code updates the lo value to hi.
If hi is equal to l - 1, the code breaks out of the loop.
The code prints the first element of the first row of the state matrix.
