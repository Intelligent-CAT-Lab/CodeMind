<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in three integers as input, n, a, and b.
The code then calculates the difference between b and a, which is (b-a).
The code checks if the difference is even or odd by checking if the remainder of the division of (b-a) by 2 is 0.
If the remainder is 0, the code prints "Alice", otherwise it prints "Borys".
<<<Output>>>
Borys
