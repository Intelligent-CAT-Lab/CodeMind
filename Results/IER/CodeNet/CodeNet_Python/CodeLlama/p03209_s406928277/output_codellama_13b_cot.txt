  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input n and x from the user.
n is initialized to 2 and x is initialized to 7.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n-1.
For each iteration, the code calculates the size of the current pattern and appends it to the size list.
The pattern size is calculated as the previous pattern size multiplied by 2 plus 3.
The code also calculates the number of pati in the current pattern and appends it to the pati list.
The number of pati is calculated as the previous number of pati multiplied by 2 plus 1.
The code then enters another loop that iterates from 0 to n-1.
For each iteration, the code checks if x is equal to 1, which is the base case.
If x is equal to 1, the code breaks out of the loop and prints the final value of ans, which is 1.
If x is not equal to 1, the code checks if x is equal to the size of the current pattern.
If x is equal to the size of the current pattern, the code adds the number of pati in the current pattern to ans and breaks out of the loop.
If x is not equal to the size of the current pattern, the code checks if x is equal to the size of the previous pattern plus 2.
If x is equal to the size of the previous pattern plus 2, the code adds the number of pati in the previous pattern plus 1 to ans and breaks out of the loop.
If x is not equal to the size of the previous pattern plus 2, the code subtracts the size of the previous pattern plus 2 from x and continues the loop.
If x is equal to 1 after the loop finishes, the code adds 1 to ans and prints the final value of ans.
