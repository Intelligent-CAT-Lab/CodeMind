  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in four integers as input, t1, t2, r1, and r2.
The code then checks if r1 or r2 is equal to -1. If either of them is equal to -1, the code checks if t1 is less than t2. If t1 is less than t2, the code prints "Alice". If t1 is greater than t2, the code prints "Bob". If t1 is equal to t2, the code prints "Draw".
If neither r1 nor r2 is equal to -1, the code checks if r1 is greater than r2. If r1 is greater than r2, the code prints "Alice". If r1 is less than r2, the code prints "Bob". If r1 is equal to r2, the code prints "Draw".
<<<Output>>>
Bob
