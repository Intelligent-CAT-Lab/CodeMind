The code first imports the math, operator, functools, and fractions libraries.
It then defines a function called ncr, which calculates the number of combinations of n things taken r at a time.
The code also defines a function called rd, which reads input from the user.
The code then defines a function called find, which finds the parent of a node in a disjoint set.
The code also defines a function called uni, which unites two nodes in a disjoint set.
