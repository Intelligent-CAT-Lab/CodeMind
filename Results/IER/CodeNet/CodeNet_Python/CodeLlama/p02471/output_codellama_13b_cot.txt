  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first defines a function rec(a, b) that takes two integers a and b as input and returns three values: x, y, and gcd. The function is recursive and uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of a and b.
The code then reads two integers a and b from the input and calls the rec function with a and b as arguments. The function returns three values: x, y, and gcd.
The code then calculates the values of dx and dy using the formulae:
dx = b // gcd
dy = -a // gcd
The code then calculates the values of x and y using the formulae:
x = x0 + (b/gcd) * k
y = y0 + (-a/gcd) * k
The code then calculates the magnitude of the vector (x, y) using the formula:
mag = abs(x) + abs(y)
The code then enters a loop that iterates until the magnitude of the vector (x, y) is greater than or equal to the initial magnitude. The loop calculates the new values of x and y using the formulae:
x1 = x + dx
y1 = y + dy
The loop then calculates the new magnitude of the vector (x, y) using the formula:
mag1 = abs(x1) + abs(y1)
If the new magnitude is greater than or equal to the initial magnitude, the loop breaks.
The code then enters another loop that iterates until the magnitude of the vector (x, y) is less than the initial magnitude. The loop calculates the new values of x and y using the formulae:
x1 = x - dx
y1 = y - dy
The loop then calculates the new magnitude of the vector (x, y) using the formula:
mag1 = abs(x1) + abs(y1)
If the new magnitude is greater than the initial magnitude, the loop breaks.
The code then prints the final values of x and y.
