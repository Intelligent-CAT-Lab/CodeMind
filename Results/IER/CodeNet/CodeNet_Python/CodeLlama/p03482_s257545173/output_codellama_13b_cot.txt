<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input string S as "010".
The variable N is initialized to the length of S, which is 3.
The variable ans is initialized to N, which is 3.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to N-1 (exclusive), meaning it will consider the first two characters of the string.
For each iteration, the code checks if the current character is different from the next character. If it is, the code calculates the minimum of the current index plus 1 and the length of the string minus the current index minus 1. This is done to find the length of the longest substring that contains only one type of character.
The loop finishes and the code prints the final value of ans, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
