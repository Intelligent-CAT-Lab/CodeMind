  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs, n and k, from the user.
n is the number of dice rolled, and k is the target number.
The code initializes a variable score to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider the sum of each possible combination of dice rolls.
For each dice roll, the code calculates the number of times the roll will exceed k, and adds the probability of that roll to the score.
The probability of a roll is calculated using the formula (1/n) \* (1/2)^counter, where counter is the number of times the roll will exceed k.
The code then prints the final value of score, rounded to 12 decimal places.
<<<Output>>>
