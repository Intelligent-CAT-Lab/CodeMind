<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input as a string and converts it to an integer using the int() function.
The variable total is then initialized to the value of the input.
The code then calculates the number of 500s that can be obtained from the total using integer division (//).
The result is stored in the variable num_500.
The code then calculates the remainder when the total is divided by 500 using the modulo operator (%).
The result is stored in the variable remain.
The code then calculates the number of 5s that can be obtained from the remainder using integer division (//).
The result is stored in the variable num_5.
Finally, the code prints the sum of the number of 500s and the number of 5s, multiplied by 5 and 1000, respectively.
