<<<Analysis>>>
The code imports the fractions module, which provides a function for calculating the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two numbers.
The code then reads in four integers from the input, which are assigned to the variables a, b, c, and d.
The code then calculates the absolute difference between c and a, and stores the result in c.
The code then calculates the absolute difference between d and b, and stores the result in d.
The code then calculates the gcd of the maximum and minimum of c and d, and stores the result in g.
The code then calculates the integer quotient of c divided by g, and stores the result in j.
The code then calculates the integer quotient of d divided by g, and stores the result in k.
The code then prints the product of j, k, and g.
