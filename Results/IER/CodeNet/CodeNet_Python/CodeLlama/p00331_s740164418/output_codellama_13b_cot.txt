<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes input from the user in the form of two integers separated by a space.
The variables H and R are initialized to the values of the first and second integers, respectively.
The code then calculates the sum of H and R and stores it in a variable called sum.
The code then checks if sum is equal to 0. If it is, it prints 0.
If sum is not equal to 0, the code checks if sum is greater than or equal to 0. If it is, it prints 1.
If sum is less than 0, it prints -1.
<<<Output>>>
-1
