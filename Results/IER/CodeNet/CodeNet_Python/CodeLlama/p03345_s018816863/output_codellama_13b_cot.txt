<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in four integers as input, separated by spaces.
The variables a, b, c, and k are initialized to the first four integers, respectively.
The code checks if k is even (i.e., if k % 2 == 0).
If k is even, the code prints a - b.
If k is odd, the code prints b - a.
The input given is 1 2 3 1, so k is odd.
The code prints b - a, which is 2 - 1 = 1.
