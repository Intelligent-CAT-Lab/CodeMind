  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first initializes an empty dictionary called dic.
It then takes the input string S and converts it into a list of characters.
The code then iterates over each character in the list and checks if it is already in the dictionary. If it is not, it adds it to the dictionary with a value of 1. If it is already in the dictionary, it increments its value by 1.
The code then iterates over each key in the dictionary and checks if its value is odd. If it is, it adds 1 to the variable ans.
Finally, the code prints the value of ans divided by 2.
