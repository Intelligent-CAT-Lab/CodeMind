The code first takes input from the user and splits it into two numbers, N and M.
The code then initializes a variable thres to 10^9+7, which is a large prime number.
The code then checks if the absolute difference between N and M is equal to 1, which is the case in this input.
If this condition is met, the code sets N to the minimum of N and M, which is 2.
The code then initializes a variable retVal to 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N+1 (inclusive).
For each iteration, the code calculates the square of the current iteration number and multiplies it by retVal.
The code then checks if the result is greater than or equal to thres, which is not the case in this input.
The code then increments retVal by the square of the current iteration number.
The code then checks if the result is greater than or equal to thres, which is not the case in this input.
The code then increments retVal by the square of the current iteration number.
