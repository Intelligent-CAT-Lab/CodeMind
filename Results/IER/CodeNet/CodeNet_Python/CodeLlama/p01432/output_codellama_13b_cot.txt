  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module and defines two functions, mul and fast_pow.
The mul function takes four arguments, n, A, B, and C, and performs a matrix multiplication between A and B, storing the result in C.
The fast_pow function takes four arguments, n, MA, A, and k, and performs a matrix power of A to the power of k, storing the result in A.
The solve function takes three arguments, S, N, and K, and performs a series of calculations to find the solution.
The code then reads the input from stdin and splits it into three integers, S, N, and K.
The code then checks if S is 0, and if so, prints 0 and returns.
If N is 1, the code calculates the solution and prints it, rounded to 16 decimal places.
If N is greater than 1, the code calculates the solution using the fast_pow function and prints it, rounded to 16 decimal places.
