  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the string module and defines a function called toggle_case.
The function takes a single character as input and returns the same character if it is not a letter, or the opposite case letter if it is a letter.
The code then reads a line of input from the user and stores it in the variable s.
The code then uses the map function to apply the toggle_case function to each character in the string s, and joins the resulting list of characters into a single string using the join method.
The code then prints the resulting string.

<<<Output>>>
fAIR, LATER, OCCASIONALLY CLOUDY.
