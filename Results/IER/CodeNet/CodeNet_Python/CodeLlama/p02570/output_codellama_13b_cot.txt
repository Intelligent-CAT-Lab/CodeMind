<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user and splits it into a list of integers using the split() method.
The list is then converted to a map object using the map() function.
The code then checks if the first element of the list divided by the second element is less than or equal to the third element.
If the condition is met, the code prints 'Yes', otherwise it prints 'No'.

In this case, the input is 1000 15 80.
The first element of the list is 1000, the second element is 15, and the third element is 80.
The first element divided by the second element is 66.67, which is less than the third element.
Therefore, the output of the code is 'Yes'.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
