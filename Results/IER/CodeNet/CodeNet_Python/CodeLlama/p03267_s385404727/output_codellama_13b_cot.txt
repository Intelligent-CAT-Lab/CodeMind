  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first reads an integer L from standard input and initializes it to 4.
The function main() is then called, which calculates the number of nodes and edges in the graph.
The number of nodes is calculated by taking the floor of the logarithm of L to the base 2 and adding 1. In this case, the number of nodes is 3.
The number of edges is calculated by taking 2 times the number of nodes minus 1 and adding the number of edges that connect the last node to the first node. In this case, the number of edges is 5.
The function main() then yields the number of nodes and edges, which are 3 and 5, respectively.
The function main() then yields the edges of the graph, which are (1, 2, 0), (1, 3, 0), (2, 3, 0), (2, 4, 2), and (3, 4, 4).
The code then prints the output of the function main() using a for loop.
