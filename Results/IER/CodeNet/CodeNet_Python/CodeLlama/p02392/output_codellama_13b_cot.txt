<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in three integers as input, separated by spaces.
The variables a, b, and c are initialized to the values of the input.
The code then checks if a is less than b and b is less than c.
Since 1 is less than 3 and 3 is less than 8, the condition is met.
The code then prints "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
