<<<Analysis>>>
The code first initializes the variable ans to 100000.
It then enters a loop that iterates int(input()) times, which is 5 in this case.
For each iteration, the code multiplies ans by 1.05.
The code then checks if ans % 1000 is not equal to 0, which is the case for the first 4 iterations.
If this condition is met, the code adds 1000 - ans % 1000 to ans.
The final value of ans after the loop finishes is 105000.
<<<Output>>>
105000
