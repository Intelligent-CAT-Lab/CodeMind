<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs from the user, separated by a space.
The first input is stored in variable a, and the second input is stored in variable b.
The code then checks if either both inputs are "H" or both inputs are "D".
If either of these conditions is met, the code prints "H". Otherwise, it prints "D".
<<<Output>>>
H
