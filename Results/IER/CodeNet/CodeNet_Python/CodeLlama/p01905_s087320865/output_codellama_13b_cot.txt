  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports several modules, including math, string, itertools, fractions, heapq, collections, re, array, bisect, sys, random, and time.
It then sets the recursion limit to 10^7 and defines a few functions for reading input: LI() returns a list of integers from input, LF() returns a list of floats from input, II() returns an integer from input, LS() returns a list of strings from input, and S() returns a string from input.
The main() function is defined, which takes two integers n and m as input and returns n-m-1.
The code then calls the main() function and prints its output.
