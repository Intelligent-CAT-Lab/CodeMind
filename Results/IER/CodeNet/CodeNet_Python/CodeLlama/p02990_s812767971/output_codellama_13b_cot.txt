  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the reduce function from the functools module and defines a function called nCr that takes four arguments: n, r, DIV, and mod.
The code then takes input from the user in the form of two integers n and k.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to k-1.
For each iteration, the code calculates the value of ans using the nCr function.
The nCr function calculates the number of ways to choose r objects from a set of n objects, where the order of the objects does not matter.
The code then prints the value of ans for each iteration.
<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will be a list of integers, where each integer represents the number of ways to choose a subset of size i+1 from a set of size n-k+1, where the order of the elements does not matter.
The output will be in the form of a list, with each element on a new line.
The first element of the list will be the number of ways to choose a subset of size 1 from a set of size n-k+1, which is equal to nCr(k-1, 0, mod).
The second element of the list will be the number of ways to choose a subset of size 2 from a set of size n-k+1, which is equal to nCr(k-1, 1, mod).
The third element of the list will be the number of ways to choose a subset of size 3 from a set of size n-k+1, which is equal to nCr(k-1, 2, mod).
The fourth element of the list will be the number of ways to choose a subset of size 4 from a set of size n-k+1, which is equal to nCr(k-1, 3, mod).
The fifth element of the list will be the number of ways to choose a subset of size 5 from a set of size n-k+1, which is equal to nCr(k-1, 4, mod).
The sixth element of the list will be the number of ways to choose a subset of size 6 from a set of size n-k+1, which is equal to nCr(k-1, 5, mod).
The seventh element of the list will be the number of ways to choose a subset of size 7 from a set of size n-k+1, which is equal to nCr(k-1, 6, mod).
The eighth element of the list will be the number of ways to choose a subset of size 8 from a set of size n-k+1, which is equal to nCr(k-1, 7, mod).
The ninth element of the list will be the number of ways to choose a subset of size 9 from a set of size n-k+1, which is equal to nCr(k-1, 8, mod).
The tenth element of the list will be the number of ways to choose a subset of size 10 from a set of size n-k+1, which is equal to nCr(k-1, 9, mod).
The eleventh element of the list will be the number of ways to choose a subset of size 11 from a set of size n-k+1, which is equal to nCr(k-1, 10, mod).
The twelfth element of the list will be the number of ways to choose a subset of size 12 from a set of size n-k+1, which is equal to nCr(k-1, 11, mod).
The thirteenth element of the list will be the number of ways to choose a subset of size 13 from a set of size n-k+1, which is equal to nCr(k-1, 12, mod).
The fourteenth element of the list will be the number of ways to choose a subset of size 14 from a set of size n-k+1, which is equal to nCr(k-1, 13, mod).
The fifteenth element of the list will be the number of ways to choose a subset of size 15 from a set of size n-k+1, which is equal to nCr(k-1, 14, mod).
The sixteenth element of the list will be the number of ways to choose a subset of size 16 from a set of size n-k+1, which is equal to nCr(k-1, 15, mod).
The seventeenth element of the list will be the number of ways to choose a subset of size 17 from a set of size n-k+1, which is equal to nCr(k-1, 16, mod).
The eighteenth element of the list will be the number of ways to choose a subset of size 18 from a set of size n-k+1, which is equal to nCr(k-1, 17, mod).
The nineteenth element of the list will be the number of ways to choose a subset of size 19 from a set of size n-k+1, which is equal to nCr(k-1, 18, mod).
The twentieth element of the list will be the number of ways to choose a subset of size 20 from a set of size n-k+1, which is equal to nCr(k-1, 19, mod).
The output will be in the form of a list, with each element on a new line.
