The code first imports the sys module and sets the recursion limit to 10^8.
It then defines a function power(x, y) that calculates x^y modulo mod.
The function uses a recursive approach, with a base case of y=0, where it returns 1.
For y=1, it returns x modulo mod.
For y>1, it checks if y is even, and if so, it returns power(x, y//2)**2 modulo mod.
If y is odd, it returns power(x, (y-1)//2)**2 * x modulo mod.
The function also defines a function mul(a, b) that calculates (a modulo mod) * (b modulo mod) modulo mod.
The function div(a, b) calculates a * b^-1 modulo mod, where b^-1 is the modular multiplicative inverse of b.
The function div2(a, b) calculates a * b^-1 modulo mod, where b^-1 is the modular multiplicative inverse of b.
The function modinv(a) calculates the modular multiplicative inverse of a modulo mod.
The function cmb(n, r) calculates the binomial coefficient n choose r modulo mod.
The function cmb(n, r) first checks if r is within the range [0, n].
If not, it returns 0.
If r is within the range, it returns g1[n] * g2[r] * g2[n-r] modulo mod.
The function g1[n] is defined as the product of the first n integers modulo mod.
The function g2[n] is defined as the product of the first n integers modulo mod, except for the first integer, which is 1.
The function inverse[n] is defined as the modular multiplicative inverse of n modulo mod.
