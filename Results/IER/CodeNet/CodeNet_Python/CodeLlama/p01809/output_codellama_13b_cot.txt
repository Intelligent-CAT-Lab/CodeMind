  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports several modules, including math, string, itertools, fractions, heapq, collections, re, array, bisect, sys, random, time, copy, and functools.
It then sets the recursion limit to 10^7 and defines several functions for reading input and printing output.
The main function is defined, which takes no arguments.
It defines a list called rr and sets it to an empty list.
It then enters an infinite loop, which will only exit when the loop condition is false.
The loop condition is whether the input is empty.
If the input is not empty, the loop will continue.
The loop first reads two integers, p and q, from the input using the LI function.
It then calculates the greatest common divisor of p and q using the fractions module.
It then calculates t as q divided by the greatest common divisor.
It then sets k to 1.
If t is even, it multiplies k by 2 and divides t by 2 until t is odd.
It then iterates through the range of integers from 3 to the square root of t, incrementing k by 2 for each integer i that divides t.
It then appends the product of t and k to the rr list.
It then breaks out of the loop.
The main function returns the rr list, which is a list of integers.
The main function is then called and its return value is printed.
