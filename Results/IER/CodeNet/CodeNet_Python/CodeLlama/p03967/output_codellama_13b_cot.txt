<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string input s from the user.
The variable ret is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of the differences between the indices of the characters in the string and the corresponding values in the list [0,1].
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the characters in the string s.
For each character, it calculates the difference between its index and the corresponding value in the list [0,1].
If the character is "p", it subtracts 1 from the difference, otherwise it adds 0.
The code then adds the result of this calculation to ret.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ret.
<<<Output>>>
0
