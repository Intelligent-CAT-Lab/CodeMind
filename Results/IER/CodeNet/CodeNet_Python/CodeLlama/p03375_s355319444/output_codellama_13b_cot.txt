  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first sets the recursion limit to 10^6 and imports the sys module.
It then reads two integers from standard input using the readline function and assigns them to the variables n and MOD.
The code then initializes the variables inv, fac, and finv to arrays of size 3001, and sets the values of inv[1] and fac[0] and fac[1] to 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to n+1, and for each value of i, it calculates the value of inv[i] using the formula inv[i] = MOD - (MOD//i)*inv[MOD%i]%MOD.
The code then calculates the values of fac[i] and finv[i] using the formula fac[i] = fac[i-1]*i%MOD and finv[i] = finv[i-1]*inv[i]%MOD.
The code then defines a function choose(n,r) that calculates nCk mod MOD using the formula choose(n,r) = (fac[n]*finv[r]%MOD)*finv[n-r]%MOD.
The code then defines a function size(s) that calculates the value of the Sterling number of the second kind using the formula size(s) = (f[s][b]*pow(2,b*(n-s),MOD))%MOD.
The code then initializes the variable f to an array of size n+1, and sets the values of f[0][0] and f[1][0] to 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n+1, and for each value of i, it calculates the values of f[i][0] and f[i][1] using the formula f[i][0] = 1 and f[i][1] = 1.
The code then enters a nested loop that iterates from 2 to n+1, and for each value of i, it calculates the values of f[i][k] using the formula f[i][k] = (f[i-1][k] + f[i-1][k-1] + k*f[i-1][k])%MOD.
The code then initializes the variable pp to an array of size n+1, and sets the values of pp[i] to 2*pp[i-1]%(MOD-1).
The code then defines a function size(s) that calculates the value of the Sterling number of the second kind using the formula size(s) = (f[s][b]*pow(2,b*(n-s),MOD))%MOD.
The code then initializes the variable ans to 0 and the variable sgn to 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n+1, and for each value of j, it calculates the value of ans using the formula ans += sgn*choose(n,j)*size(j).
The code then prints the value of ans.

<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will depend on the input values of n and MOD.
If the input values are 2 and 1000000007, respectively, the output will be 500000003.
