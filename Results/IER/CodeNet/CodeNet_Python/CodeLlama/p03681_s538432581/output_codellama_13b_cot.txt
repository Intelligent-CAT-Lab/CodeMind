  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes two inputs n and m from the user.
The code then initializes two variables ans1 and ans2 to 1.
The code then initializes a variable mod to 10^9 + 7.
The code then checks if the absolute difference between n and m is greater than or equal to 2. If it is, the code prints 0 and exits.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive) and calculates the factorial of each number and stores it in ans1. The code then enters another loop that iterates from 1 to m (inclusive) and calculates the factorial of each number and stores it in ans2.
The code then checks if the absolute difference between n and m is equal to 1. If it is, the code prints the product of ans1 and ans2 modulo mod. Otherwise, the code prints twice the product of ans1 and ans2 modulo mod.
