<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input x from the user.
It then calculates the number of 11s that divide x, which is stored in n.
The code then calculates the remainder of x when divided by 11, which is stored in x.
The code then checks the value of x and prints the appropriate output based on the condition.
If x is 0, the code prints 2n.
If x is between 1 and 6, the code prints 1+2n.
Otherwise, the code prints 2+2n.
<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will depend on the input given.
If the input is 7, the output will be 2.
If the input is 18, the output will be 3.
If the input is 29, the output will be 5.
If the input is 42, the output will be 7.
If the input is 55, the output will be 9.
If the input is 68, the output will be 11.
If the input is 81, the output will be 13.
If the input is 94, the output will be 15.
If the input is 107, the output will be 17.
If the input is 120, the output will be 19.
