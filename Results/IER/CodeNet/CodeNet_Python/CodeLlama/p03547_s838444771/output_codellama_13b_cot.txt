<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs X and Y from the user, separated by a space.
The code then checks if X is less than Y, if it is, it prints '<'.
If X is equal to Y, it prints '='.
If X is greater than Y, it prints '>'.
<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will depend on the values of X and Y.
If X is less than Y, the output will be '<'.
If X is equal to Y, the output will be '='.
If X is greater than Y, the output will be '>'.
