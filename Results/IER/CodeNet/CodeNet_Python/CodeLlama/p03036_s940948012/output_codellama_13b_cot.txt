<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in three inputs: r, d, and x.
r is initialized to 2, d is initialized to 10, and x is initialized to 20.
The code then enters a loop that iterates 10 times.
For each iteration, the code multiplies x by r and subtracts d.
The output of each iteration is printed.
The final output of the code is 20, 10, 5, 0, -5, -10, -15, -20, -25, and -30.
