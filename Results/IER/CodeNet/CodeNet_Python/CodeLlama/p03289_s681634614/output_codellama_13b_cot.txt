The code first imports the sys module and sets the recursion limit to 2147483647.
It then imports the re module and defines a pattern variable that matches strings starting with "A" followed by one or more lowercase letters and ending with "C" followed by one or more lowercase letters.
The code then defines a function called resolve that takes no arguments and prints "AC" if the input matches the pattern, and "WA" otherwise.
The code then calls the resolve function.
