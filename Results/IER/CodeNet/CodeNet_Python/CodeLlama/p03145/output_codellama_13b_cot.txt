  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports several modules from the Python standard library, including collections, heapq, itertools, math, bisect, copy, operator, functools, and fractions.
It then defines several functions for reading input and processing it in various ways, such as reading a single integer, reading a list of integers, reading a tuple of integers, reading a list of lists of integers, and reading a list of strings.
The code also sets the recursion limit to 10^6 and defines a constant MOD equal to 10^9+7.
The main part of the code begins with the line "a, b, c = Is()", which reads three integers from standard input and assigns them to the variables a, b, and c, respectively.
The code then prints the value of a*b/2, which is the integer division of a times b by 2.
