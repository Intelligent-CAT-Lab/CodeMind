  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input from the user and stores it in the variable sent.
The variable words is then initialized to the list of words in the sentence.
The code then initializes the variables max_f, freq_w, max_len, and len_w to 0 and "", respectively.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the list of words.
For each word in the list, the code checks if the current word is the most frequent word in the list. If it is, it updates the value of freq_w and max_f.
The code also checks if the current word is the longest word in the list. If it is, it updates the value of len_w and max_len.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the values of freq_w and len_w.
<<<Output>>>
