  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module and defines the range and input functions.
It then defines the mod variable as 10^9 + 7, which is used for modular arithmetic.
The code then reads in the input as three integers n, h, and d.
The code then defines a list of factorials, fac, and a list of cumulative factorials, cumfac.
The code then defines a list of DP values, DP, and initializes the first value to fac[n].
The code then defines a variable multi as cumfac[n+1] - cumfac[1].
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to h.
For each iteration, the code calculates the sum of the DP values from the previous iteration, and subtracts the DP value from the previous iteration if the index is greater than d.
The code then multiplies the sum by multi and takes the modulo of the result.
The code then updates the DP value for the current iteration.
The code then prints the final value of DP[-1].
