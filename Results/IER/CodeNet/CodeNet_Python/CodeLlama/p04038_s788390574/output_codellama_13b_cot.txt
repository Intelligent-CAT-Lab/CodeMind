  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first defines a function cmb(n, r, mod) that calculates the binomial coefficient (n choose r) modulo mod.
It then defines a few variables:
* mod: the modulo to use for the calculations
* N: the maximum value of n and r
* g1: a table of values of (n choose 0) modulo mod
* g2: a table of values of (n choose r) modulo mod
* inverse: a table of values of (mod/n) modulo mod

The code then initializes the tables g1 and g2 with values of 1, and the table inverse with values of 1.
It then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider values of n and r from 2 to 4 million.
For each value of n, the code calculates the value of (n choose r) modulo mod for r = 1, 2, ..., n, and stores it in the table g2.
It also calculates the value of (mod/n) modulo mod and stores it in the table inverse.

The code then reads the input from the user, which is a pair of integers N and K.
If K is 1, the code prints 1 and exits.
Otherwise, the code initializes a table dp with values of 0.
It then enters a loop that iterates from N to 0 (inclusive), meaning it will consider values of j from N to 0.
For each value of j, the code calculates the value of (N choose j) modulo mod, and stores it in the table dp.
It then enters a nested loop that iterates from j-1 to -1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider values of i from j-1 to 0.
For each value of i, the code calculates the value of (N choose i) modulo mod, and stores it in the table dp.
It then prints the final value of dp[0] multiplied by g1[N] modulo mod.
