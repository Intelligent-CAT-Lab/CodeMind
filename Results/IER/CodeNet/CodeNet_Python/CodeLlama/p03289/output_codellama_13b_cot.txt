<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user and stores it in the variable S.
The code then initializes a flag variable to 0, which will be used to indicate whether the input meets the conditions or not.
The code then checks if the first character of the input is not "A", if it is not, it sets the flag to 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to the length of the input minus 1, and checks if the character at the current index is "C", if it is, it increments a count variable.
If the count variable is not equal to 1 after the loop, the code sets the flag to 1.
The code then enters another loop that iterates over the input and checks if the current character is uppercase, if it is, it increments a count2 variable.
If the count2 variable is not equal to 2 after the loop, the code sets the flag to 1.
Finally, the code checks the value of the flag, if it is 0, it prints "AC", otherwise it prints "WA".
<<<Output>>>
WA
