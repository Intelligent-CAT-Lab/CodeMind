  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes in a string input S.
It then initializes a dictionary s_frq_dict with keys 'a', 'b', and 'c' and values 0.
The code then iterates through each character in S and increments the corresponding value in s_frq_dict.
The code then converts the values in s_frq_dict to a list frqs.
The code then checks if the difference between the maximum and minimum values in frqs is less than or equal to 1.
If the condition is met, the code prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'.

<<<Output>>>
YES
