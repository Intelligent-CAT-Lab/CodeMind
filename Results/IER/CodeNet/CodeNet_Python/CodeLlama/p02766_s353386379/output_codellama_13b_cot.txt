<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function Base_10_to_n that takes two arguments, X and n.
The function first checks if X is divisible by n. If it is, it recursively calls itself with X/n and n as arguments, and concatenates the result with the remainder of X divided by n.
If X is not divisible by n, the function returns the remainder of X divided by n.
The code then takes input from the user in the form of two numbers, N and K, and splits them into separate variables.
The code then calls the Base_10_to_n function with N and K as arguments, and prints the length of the resulting string.
