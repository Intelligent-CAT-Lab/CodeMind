<<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the math module, which provides mathematical functions.
The variable num_year is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of years.
The variable t_maney is initialized to 100, which is the initial amount of money.
The code then reads an integer x from the input.
The code enters a while loop that iterates as long as t_maney is less than x.
For each iteration, the code increments num_year by 1 and updates t_maney to the result of multiplying it by 1.01 (using the math.floor function to round the result to the nearest integer).
The loop stops when t_maney is greater than or equal to x.
The code then prints the final value of num_year.
