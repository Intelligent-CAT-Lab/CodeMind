  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes in two integers x and y as input, separated by a space.
The code then checks if x and y have the same sign, and if so, prints 0.
The code then checks if x is 0 and y is negative, and if so, prints the absolute value of y plus 1.
The code then checks if x is less than y, and if so, it calculates the difference between y and x.
If x is 0 or y is 0, the code prints the absolute value of the difference.
If x and y have different signs, the code calculates the difference between y and x and adds 1 to it.
The code then prints the result.
