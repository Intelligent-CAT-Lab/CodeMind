  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the math module and defines three variables a, b, and C.
The input is then split into three variables using the map function.
The code then converts the angle C from degrees to radians using the formula (C * pi) / 180.
The code then uses the cosine theorem to calculate the length of the sides of a triangle.
The code then calculates the height of the triangle using the formula b * sin(C).
The code then calculates the area of the triangle using the formula a * height * (1/2).
The code then calculates the length of the triangle using the formula a + b + c.
The code then prints the area, length, and height of the triangle.
<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will be:

size = 6.00000000
length = 7.00000000
height = 3.00000000
