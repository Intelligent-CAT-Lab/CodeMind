<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, a and b, and stores them in variables a and b, respectively.
The code then initializes a variable res to 0.
The code then calculates the maximum of a and b and adds it to res.
The code then calculates the maximum of the difference between the maximum of a and b and 1, and the minimum of a and b, and adds it to res.
The code then prints the final value of res.
