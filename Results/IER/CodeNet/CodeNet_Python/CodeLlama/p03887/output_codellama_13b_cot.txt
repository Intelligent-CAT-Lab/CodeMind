  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first defines three functions: inverse, comb, and fast_pow.
The inverse function calculates the inverse of a number modulo MOD.
The comb function calculates the binomial coefficient of two numbers.
The fast_pow function calculates x^y modulo MOD.

The code then reads in four integers n, a, b, and c from the input.
It then initializes two arrays FACT and INVERSE_FACT, which store the factorials and their inverses modulo MOD.

The code then calculates the answer by iterating over all possible values of y and z, where y is the number of 1s in the binary representation of a, and z is the number of 3s in the binary representation of c.
For each combination of y and z, the code calculates the number of ways to choose b 1s and the rest 3s, and then multiplies the result by the binomial coefficients and the factorials.
The code then adds up all the results and prints the final answer.

<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will be 0, since the input is 3 1 2 0, which means that a = 1, b = 2, and c = 0.
The code will not print anything since the condition b % 2 != 0 is not met, and the code will exit.
