  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the math module and the sys module.
The code then reads the input from the standard input and assigns it to the variables n and a.
The code then calculates the value of k using the ceil function, which is the smallest integer greater than or equal to the logarithm of n to the base 2.
The code then calculates the value of d using the ceil function, which is the smallest integer greater than or equal to n to the power of 1/k.
The code then calculates the value of l and r using the ceil and floor functions, which are the smallest integers greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to k, respectively.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from l+1 to r-1, and for each iteration, it calculates the value of c using the ceil function, which is the smallest integer greater than or equal to (l+r)/2.
The code then checks if n is less than or equal to (d-1) to the power of (k-c) times d to the power of c. If it is, it sets r to c. Otherwise, it sets l to c.
The code then calculates the value of t using the formula (d-1) times (k-r) plus d times r plus (k-1) times a.
The code then prints the value of t.
