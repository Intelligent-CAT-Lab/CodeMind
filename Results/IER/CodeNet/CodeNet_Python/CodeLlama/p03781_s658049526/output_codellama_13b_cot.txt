<<<Analysis>>>
The variable X is initialized to 6.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to X (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 6.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the value of i(i+1)//2 and checks if it is greater than or equal to X.
The condition is met when i is 3, so the code prints 3 and breaks out of the loop.
<<<Output>>>
3
