  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input string s as input.
The variable count is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the number of valid strings.
The variables a, c, and q are initialized to 0, which will be used to store the number of As, Cs, and ?s in the input string, respectively.
The length of the input string n is calculated.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each character in the input string.
For each character, it checks if it is 'C', '?', or 'A'.
If it is 'C', the variable c is incremented by 1.
If it is '?', the variable q is incremented by 1.
If it is 'A', the variable a is incremented by 3.
The code then calculates the value of p as pow(3, q-3).
The code then enters another loop that iterates over each character in the input string.
For each character, it checks if it is 'A', 'C', or 'B'.
If it is 'A', the variable a is incremented by 3.
If it is 'C', the variable c is decremented by 3.
If it is 'B', the variable count is incremented by 3*a*c.
The code then prints the final value of count multiplied by p, modulo 1000000007.
