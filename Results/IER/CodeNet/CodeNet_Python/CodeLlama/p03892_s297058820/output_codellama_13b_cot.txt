  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in four integers as input, a, b, c, and d.
The code then calculates the absolute difference between c and a, and the absolute difference between d and b.
The code then checks if either of these differences is equal to 0. If so, it prints 0 and exits the program.
If neither of these differences is equal to 0, the code calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the two differences.
The code then divides both differences by the gcd, and calculates the sum of the two differences minus 1.
The code then multiplies this result by the gcd.
