  <<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function named run() that takes no arguments.
The function first initializes the value of p to 10^9 + 7, which is a large prime number.
The function then reads two integers n and k from the input using the split() method and converts them to integers using the int() function.
The function then checks if n is greater than k, and if it is, it prints 0 and returns.
The function then initializes two lists named table_1 and table_2 with the values 1 and 1, respectively.
The function then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to k+1, and for each iteration, it calculates the value of temp as temp * nn and appends it to table_1.
The function then calculates the value of table_2 using the pow() function and the values in table_1.
The function then calculates the values of a, b, and c using the values in table_1 and table_2.
The function then prints the value of a%p * b%p * c%p.
