The output of the code will depend on the input provided by the user.
The code will prompt the user to enter a number n, which is 3 in this case.
The code will then prompt the user to enter 3 strings S[i].
The code will then filter out the duplicates from S and update the value of n.
The code will then initialize a 2D list P to store the prefix lengths of each string in S.
The code will then compute the prefix lengths of each string in S.
The code will then initialize a variable ALL to 2^n - 1.
The code will then initialize a variable up to 300.
The code will then initialize a dictionary memo to store the results of previous computations.
The code will then define a recursive function dfs that takes two arguments, state and i.
The function will check if the current state and i have already been computed.
If they have, the function will return the stored value.
The function will then initialize a variable res to up.
The function will then enter a loop that iterates n times.
For each iteration, the function will check if the current state has the i-th bit set.
If it does, the function will compute the minimum of res and the result of dfs with the updated state and j.
The function will then store the result in memo and return it.
The code will then print the minimum of the results of dfs with the initial state and each index i.
The output of the code will depend on the input provided by the user.
