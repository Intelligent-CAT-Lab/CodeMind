  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first prompts the user to enter a number n, which is 3 in this case.
The code then enters a loop that iterates n times.
For each iteration, the code prompts the user to enter a string S[i].
The code then initializes a list dup to store the indices of strings that are duplicates.
The code then enters another loop that iterates n times.
For each iteration, the code checks if S[i] is a substring of any other string in S.
If it is, the code sets dup[i] to 1.
The code then filters out the duplicates from S and updates the value of n.
The code then initializes a 2D list P to store the prefix lengths of each string in S.
The code then enters a loop that iterates n times.
For each iteration, the code calculates the prefix length of each string in S.
The code then initializes a variable ALL to 2^n - 1.
The code then initializes a variable up to 300.
The code then initializes a dictionary memo to store the results of previous computations.
The code then defines a recursive function dfs that takes two arguments, state and i.
The function checks if the current state and i have already been computed.
If they have, the function returns the stored value.
The function then initializes a variable res to up.
The function then enters a loop that iterates n times.
For each iteration, the function checks if the current state has the i-th bit set.
If it does, the function computes the minimum of res and the result of dfs with the updated state and j.
The function then stores the result in memo and returns it.
The code then prints the minimum of the results of dfs with the initial state and each index i.
