<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, separated by a space.
The first integer is assigned to variable a, and the second integer is assigned to variable b.
The code then checks if both a and b are less than or equal to 8.
If this condition is met, the code prints "Yay!". Otherwise, it prints ":(".
<<<Output>>>
Yay!
