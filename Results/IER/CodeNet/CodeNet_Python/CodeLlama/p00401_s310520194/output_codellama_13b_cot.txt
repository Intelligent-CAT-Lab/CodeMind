<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input n from the user.
It then initializes a variable ret to 1 and a variable i to 0.
The code enters a while loop that runs while ret is less than or equal to n.
In each iteration, the code calculates the value of ret as 2**i, where i is the current value of i.
It then increments i by 1.
The loop continues until ret is greater than n.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the value of ret//2.

The value of ret//2 is calculated as follows:
ret = 2**i
ret//2 = ret/2
ret/2 = 2**(i-1)

Since i starts at 0, the value of ret//2 is 2**(-1) = 1/2.

Therefore, the output of the code is 1/2.
<<<Output>>>
1/2
