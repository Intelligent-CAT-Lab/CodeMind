<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in a string input from the user, splits it into a list of strings using the split() method, and then converts the first element of the list to an integer using the int() method.
The code then multiplies the first element of the list by the second element of the list and prints the result.

In this case, the input is "5 8", which is split into a list ["5", "8"]. The code then converts "5" to an integer 5 and "8" to an integer 8, and multiplies them to get 40.

<<<Output>>>
40
