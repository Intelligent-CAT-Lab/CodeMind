  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input N from the user.
Then, it checks if N is equal to 1. If it is, it prints "YES" and the following lines, which are the coordinates of the two points that form a line.
If N is not equal to 1, it calculates the value of K, which is the number of points needed to form a line with N points.
If K is not equal to -1, it means that N can be formed into a line with K points.
It then initializes an empty list of lists called ans, which will store the coordinates of the points.
It then initializes a variable called num, which will be used to keep track of the number of points.
It then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to K - 1.
For each i in this range, it enters another loop that iterates from i + 1 to K - 1.
For each j in this range, it adds the current value of num to the list ans[i].
It then adds the current value of num to the list ans[j].
It then increments num by 1.
After the loops finish, it prints "YES" and the following lines, which are the coordinates of the points that form a line.
It then prints the length of each list in ans, followed by the coordinates of each point in each list, separated by spaces.
<<<Output>>>
