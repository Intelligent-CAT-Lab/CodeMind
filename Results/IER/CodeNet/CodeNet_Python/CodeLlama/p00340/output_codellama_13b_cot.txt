<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user and splits it into a list of integers using the split() method.
The list is then sorted using the sort() method.
The code then checks if the first two elements of the list are equal to each other and if the third and fourth elements are equal to each other.
If both conditions are met, the code prints "yes", otherwise it prints "no".

<<<Output>>>
yes
