The code first initializes the variable D to 20 and the list ds to a list of 20 zeros.
The code then imports the math module and defines the function calc.
The function calc takes an integer m as input and calculates the number of multiples of 3, 5, and 15 less than or equal to m.
The function returns the sum of these multiples.
The code then defines the function calc.
