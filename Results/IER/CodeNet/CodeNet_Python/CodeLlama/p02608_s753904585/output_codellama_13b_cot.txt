  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first initializes the variable N to 20, and initializes the list d to a list of 0s with length N.
The variable r is initialized to 100, and the variable ii is initialized to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to r (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 100.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in ii.
The code then enters another loop that iterates from 1 to i + 1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to i + 1.
For each number j in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in s.
The variable c is initialized to ii + s * j.
The variable l is initialized to 6, unless i == j, in which case it is initialized to 3.
The code checks if c + 1 + s > N, and if it is, it breaks out of the inner loop.
If c <= N, the code enters another loop that iterates from 1 to j + 1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to j + 1.
For each number k in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in c.
If c <= N, the code increments the value of d[c - 1] by l.
The code then breaks out of the inner loop.
After the inner loop finishes, the code breaks out of the outer loop.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the values in d, separated by newlines.
