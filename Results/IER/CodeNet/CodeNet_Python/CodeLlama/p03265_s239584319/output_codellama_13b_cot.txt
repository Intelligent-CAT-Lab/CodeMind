  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the numpy library as np.
The input is then split into four variables x1,y1,x2,y2.
The variables x1,y1,x2,y2 are then converted to integers using the int() function.
The code then creates two numpy arrays p1 and p2 using the np.array() function.
The code then calculates the difference between p2 and p1 and stores it in v1.
The code then calculates the perpendicular vector to v1 and stores it in v2.
The code then calculates the sum of p2 and v2 and stores it in p3.
The code then calculates the sum of p3 and the negative of v1 and stores it in p4.
The code then prints the values of p3 and p4 separated by a space.
