  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module and defines two functions, readline and write, which are used to read input from the user and write output to the console, respectively.
The code then reads two integers, N and K, from the user input and initializes an empty list R.
The code then enters a loop that iterates until v is greater than or equal to 2^N.
In each iteration, the code appends v to R, and then calculates the next value of v using the following formula:
v = ((v & ~y) // x >> 1) | y
where x is the least significant bit of v, and y is the least significant bit of v plus x.
The code then sorts the list R and iterates over it, printing each element i and the corresponding binary representation of i.
