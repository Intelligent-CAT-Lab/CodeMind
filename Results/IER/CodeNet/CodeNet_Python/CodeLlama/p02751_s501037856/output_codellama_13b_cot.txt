  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module and the numpy module.
The code then reads the input from stdin and splits it into two integers N and M.
The code then defines a function called solve that takes two integers N and M as input.
The function first checks if N is greater than M and if it is, it returns the transpose of the output of the function solve(M,N).
The function then initializes an array H with a single element 0.
The function then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to M-1.
For each iteration, the function tiles H by a factor of 2 and then XORs the upper right triangle of the resulting matrix with 1.
The function then calculates the difference of the resulting matrix along the rows and columns and stores the result in H.
The function then returns the first (1<<N) - 1 elements of H.
The code then calls the function solve with the input N and M and stores the result in a variable H.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the rows of H and joins the elements of each row into a string.
The code then prints the resulting string.
