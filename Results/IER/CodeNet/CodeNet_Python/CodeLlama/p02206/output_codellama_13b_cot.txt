  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first defines a function called ok, which takes an integer m as input.
The function calculates the sum of the digits of m and checks if it is less than or equal to k.
If the sum is greater than k, the function returns False.
If the sum is less than or equal to k, the function returns True.
The code then defines a function called main, which takes no arguments.
The function first reads two integers n and k from standard input using the MI function.
The function then initializes two variables l and r to 0 and k+1, respectively.
The function then enters a loop that iterates while l+1 is less than r.
The loop calculates a new value of m as the average of l and r.
The function then calls the ok function with m as an argument.
If the ok function returns True, the function sets l to m.
If the ok function returns False, the function sets r to m.
The loop continues until l+1 is greater than or equal to r.
The function then prints the value of l to standard output.
