<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, separated by a space.
The first integer is assigned to variable a, and the second integer is assigned to variable b.
The code then prints the product of a and b, minus 1.

In this case, the input is 3 and 4, so the output would be (3-1)*(4-1) = 6.
<<<Output>>>
6
