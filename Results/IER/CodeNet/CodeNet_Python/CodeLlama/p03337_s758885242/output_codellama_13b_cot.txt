<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, separated by a space.
The first integer is assigned to variable a, and the second integer is assigned to variable b.
The code then calculates the maximum of three expressions: a+b, a-b, and a*b.
The expressions are evaluated as follows:
* a+b = 3+1 = 4
* a-b = 3-1 = 2
* a*b = 3*1 = 3
The maximum of these expressions is 4, so the code prints 4.
<<<Output>>>
4
