  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the defaultdict class from the collections module and sets the INF variable to infinity.
It then maps the input to the variables N, X, and D.
The code then checks if D is 0, and if it is, it prints 1 if X is 0, and N + 1 otherwise.
If D is not 0, the code sets D to -D and X to -X.
The code then initializes a dictionary called memo with a default value of an empty list.
It then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N + 1.
For each k in this range, it calculates the left and right values of the current interval, which are l and r, respectively.
The code then appends the current interval to the list associated with the left value of the interval in the memo dictionary.
The code then sorts the list of intervals associated with each left value and sets the current value to -INF.
It then enters a loop that iterates over the sorted list of intervals.
For each interval, the code checks if the current value is less than the left value of the interval.
If it is, it adds the difference between the right and left values of the interval to the current value and sets the current value to the right value.
If the current value is less than the right value of the interval, it adds the difference between the right and current values to the current value and sets the current value to the right value.
The code then adds the current value to the answer.
The code then prints the final value of the answer.
