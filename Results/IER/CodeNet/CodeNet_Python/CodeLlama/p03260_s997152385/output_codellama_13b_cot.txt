<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes input from the user in the form of two integers separated by a space.
The input is then split into two variables a and b using the split() method.
The code then checks if a and b are both equal to 1 or 3 using the in operator.
If both conditions are met, the code prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
