  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module and sets the recursion limit to 10^7.
It then reads the input from stdin and splits it into two variables N and X.
The function F is defined, which calculates the distance between two points on a parallel line.
The code then calculates the answer by adding N and F(X,N-X) and prints the answer.
