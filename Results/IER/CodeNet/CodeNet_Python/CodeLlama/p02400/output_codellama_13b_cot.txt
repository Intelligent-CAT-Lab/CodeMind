<<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the math module, which provides mathematical functions.
The variable r is initialized to the input value, which is 2 in this case.
The code then calculates the area of a circle with radius r using the formula r * r * math.pi.
The code then calculates the length of a circle with radius r using the formula r * 2 * math.pi.
The code then prints the area and length of the circle using the format string %.5f %.5f, which specifies that the output should be formatted as a floating-point number with 5 decimal places.
