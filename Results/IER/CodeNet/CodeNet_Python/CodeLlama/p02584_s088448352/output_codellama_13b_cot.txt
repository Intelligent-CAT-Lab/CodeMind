  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in three inputs: x, k, and d.
x is an integer, k is an integer, and d is an integer.
The code then converts the input strings to integers using the int() function.
The code then calculates the absolute value of x using the abs() function.
The code then checks if the product of k and d is less than or equal to x.
If it is, the code prints the difference between x and the product of k and d.
If it is not, the code subtracts the integer part of x divided by d from k, and then calculates the remainder of x divided by d.
If the result of this calculation is odd, the code prints the difference between d and the remainder of x divided by d.
If the result of this calculation is even, the code prints the remainder of x divided by d.
