<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input x from the user.
The variable t is initialized to 0.
The code then enters a while loop that checks if t*(t+1)/2 is less than x.
The loop increments t by 1 each time it iterates.
The loop stops when t*(t+1)/2 is greater than or equal to x.
The final value of t is printed.

In this case, the input is 6.
The loop iterates 3 times, with t taking on the values 1, 2, and 3.
The loop stops when t is 3, and the final value of t is printed as 3.

<<<Output>>>
3
