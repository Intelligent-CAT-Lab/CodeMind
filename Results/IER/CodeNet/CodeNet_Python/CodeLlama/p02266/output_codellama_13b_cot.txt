  <<<Analysis>>>
The input string is "\\//".
The code defines a function func(c) that takes a character c as input and returns the value of the global variable cnt, which is initialized to 0. The function also increments the value of cnt based on the value of c.
The code then defines a list g, which is initialized to [[0, False]] followed by a list comprehension that iterates over the characters in the input string. The comprehension maps each character to a tuple containing the value of cnt and a boolean value indicating whether the character is a backslash or a forward slash.
The code then defines a variable gmax, which is initialized to the value of g[0][0], and a variable puddles, which is initialized to an empty list.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to the length of g - 1. For each iteration, the code checks if the value of g[i - 1][0] is less than the value of g[i][0] and if g[i][0] is less than or equal to gmax. If both conditions are true, the code sets the value of g[i][1] to True. The code then updates the value of gmax to the maximum of gmax and g[i][0].
The code then enters another loop that iterates from the length of g - 1 to 0. For each iteration, the code checks if saface_level is not None. If it is not None, the code increments the value of volume by the difference between saface_level and the value of g[i][0]. If saface_level is equal to the value of g[i][0], the code appends the value of volume to the list puddles and sets saface_level to None.
The code then prints the sum of the elements in the list puddles and the length of the list puddles followed by the elements of the list puddles.
