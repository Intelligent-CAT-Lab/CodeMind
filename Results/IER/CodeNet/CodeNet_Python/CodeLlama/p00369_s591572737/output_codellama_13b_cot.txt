  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input from the user and stores it in the variable n.
The length of the input is calculated and stored in the variable length.
The variable ans is initialized to 10.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to length - 1.
For each index ind in this range, the code checks if the character at ind is "1" and if ind + 1 is less than or equal to length - 1.
If both conditions are met, the code appends the substring of n starting at ind and ending at ind + 1 to the list lst.
The code then increments ind by 2.
If the first condition is not met, the code appends the character at ind to the list lst and increments ind by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if the length of lst is greater than or equal to 2.
If it is, the code calculates the minimum difference between the maximum and minimum elements of lst and assigns it to ans.
The code then enters another loop that iterates from 1 to length // 2 + 1.
For each index i in this range, the code checks if length is divisible by i.
If it is, the code appends i to the list divisors.
The code then enters another loop that iterates from 0 to length in steps of i.
For each index j in this range, the code appends the substring of n starting at j and ending at j + i to the list lst.
The code then calculates the minimum difference between the maximum and minimum elements of lst and assigns it to ans.
Finally, the code prints the value of ans.
