  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports several modules, including math, string, itertools, fractions, heapq, collections, re, array, bisect, sys, random, time, copy, and functools.
It then sets the recursion limit to 10^7 and defines some constants, including inf, eps, and mod.
It also defines two lists, dd and ddn, which are used later in the code.
The code then defines several functions, including LI, LI_, LF, LS, I, F, S, pf, and main.
The main function takes an integer n as input and performs the following steps:
1. It initializes a list a with the value 0 and then appends the sum of the first n integers to the list.
2. It uses the bisect module to find the index of the first element in the list a that is greater than or equal to n.
3. It initializes a list r with the value 1 repeated t times, where t is the index found in step 2.
4. It then iterates over the list r and performs the following steps for each element:
a. It calculates the value of ai, which is the element in the list a at the current index.
b. It calculates the value of ti, which is the current index plus the value of ai.
c. It checks if n is less than ai. If it is, it performs the following steps:
i. It calculates the value of ts, which is the minimum of t and ai-n.
ii. It swaps the values of the elements at indices ti and ti-ts in the list r.
iii. It subtracts the value of ts from n.
d. If n is not less than ai, it breaks out of the loop.
5. It returns the string ''.join(map(lambda x: '()'[x], r)), which is the final value of the list r.

The code then calls the main function with the input 1 and prints the output.
