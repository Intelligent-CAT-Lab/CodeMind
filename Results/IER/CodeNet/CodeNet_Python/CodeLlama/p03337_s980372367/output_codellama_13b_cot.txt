<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, A and B, and stores them in variables A and B, respectively.
The code then calculates the sum of A and B (a1), the difference of A and B (a2), and the product of A and B (a3).
The code then checks which of these values is the largest and prints it.
In this case, a1 = 4, a2 = 2, and a3 = 3. Since a1 is the largest, the code prints 4.
<<<Output>>>
4
