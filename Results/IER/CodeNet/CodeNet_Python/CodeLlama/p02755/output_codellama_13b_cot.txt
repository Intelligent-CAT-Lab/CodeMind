  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers A and B as input, and initializes variables f to False and ans to 0.
The code then calculates the range of values of i that satisfy the condition i * 8 // 100 == A and i // 10 == B.
The range is calculated as follows:
n = A * 100 // 8
m = (A + 1) * 100 // 8
The code then enters a loop that iterates from n to m + 1, and checks if the current value of i satisfies the condition.
If the condition is met, the code sets f to True and ans to i, and breaks out of the loop.
The code then prints ans if f is True, otherwise it prints -1.

<<<Output>>>
-1
