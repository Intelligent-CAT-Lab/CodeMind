  <<<Analysis>>>
The input is a list of integers: [5, 4, 2, 2, 1].
The code first converts the input to a list of integers using the map() function.
The code then checks if the sum of the 2nd and 4th elements of the list is less than or equal to the 1st element.
If this condition is met, the code checks if the difference between the 2nd and 4th elements is greater than or equal to 0.
If this condition is met, the code checks if the sum of the 3rd and 4th elements is less than or equal to the 2nd element.
If this condition is met, the code checks if the difference between the 3rd and 4th elements is greater than or equal to 0.
If all of these conditions are met, the code prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
