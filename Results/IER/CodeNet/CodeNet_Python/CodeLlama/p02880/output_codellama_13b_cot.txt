<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input N from the user.
It then enters a nested loop that iterates from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for both i and j.
For each combination of i and j, the code checks if i*j is equal to N.
If it is, the code prints 'Yes' and exits the loop.
If the loop finishes without finding a match, the code prints 'No'.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
