<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, S and C, from the user.
The code then checks if S*2 is less than or equal to C.
If it is, the code sets setn to S and subtracts S*2 from C.
Then, it adds C//4 to setn.
If S*2 is greater than C, the code sets setn to C//2.
Finally, the code prints the value of setn.
