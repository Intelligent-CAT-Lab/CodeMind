  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the Counter class from the collections module.
It then takes the input string and converts it into a list of characters.
The Counter class is then used to count the frequency of each character in the list.
The resulting counter is then converted into a list of three elements, where each element corresponds to the frequency of the characters "a", "b", and "c", respectively.
The code then checks if the difference between the maximum and minimum frequency is less than 2. If it is, it prints "YES", otherwise it prints "NO".
<<<Output>>>
YES
