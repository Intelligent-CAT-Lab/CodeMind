<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in three integers as input, which are stored in variables a, b, and c, respectively.
The code then calculates the absolute difference between a and b, and the absolute difference between c and a.
The code then checks if the first difference is less than the second difference.
If it is, the code prints 'A', otherwise it prints 'B'.
<<<Output>>>
A
