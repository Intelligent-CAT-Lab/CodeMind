  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the math module, which provides mathematical functions.
The code then reads in three integers A, B, and X from the input, and stores them in the variables A, B, and X, respectively.
The code then calculates three different expressions using the variables A, B, and X, and stores the results in the variables ans1, ans2, and ans3, respectively.
The expressions are:

* ans1 = math.ceil(X/1000) * A
* ans2 = math.ceil(X/500) * B
* ans3 = math.floor(X/1000) * A + math.ceil((X % 1000)/500) * B

The code then prints the minimum of the three expressions.

<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will be the minimum of the three expressions calculated.

Since X = 2400, the expressions are:

* ans1 = math.ceil(2400/1000) * 100 = 300
* ans2 = math.ceil(2400/500) * 100 = 400
* ans3 = math.floor(2400/1000) * 100 + math.ceil((2400 % 1000)/500) * 100 = 200 + 400 = 600

The minimum of these expressions is 200, so the output of the code will be 200.
