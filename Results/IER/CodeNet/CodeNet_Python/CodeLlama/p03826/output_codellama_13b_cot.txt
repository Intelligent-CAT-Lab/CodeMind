The code takes in four integers as input, which are assigned to the variables a, b, c, and d, respectively.
The code then calculates the product of a and b, and stores it in the variable s.
The code then calculates the product of c and d, and stores it in the variable t.
The code then checks if s is greater than t, and if it is, it prints s. Otherwise, it prints t.
