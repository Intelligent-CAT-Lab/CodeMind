  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module, which provides access to the standard input and output streams.
The function solve() is defined, which reads a line of input from the standard input stream using the readline() method of the sys.stdin object.
The input string is stored in the variable S, and the first character of the string is stored in the variable current.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the remaining characters of the string, starting from the second character.
For each character, the code checks if it is equal to the current character. If it is not, the turn variable is incremented by 1, and the current character is updated to the new character.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of turn, which is the number of turns required to solve the problem.
