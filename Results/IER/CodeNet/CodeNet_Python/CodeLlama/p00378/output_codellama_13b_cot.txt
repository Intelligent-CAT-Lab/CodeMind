  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first initializes the variables A, B, and X to 180, 100, and 2400, respectively.
The code then calculates the value of k as X // 1000, which is 2.
The code then calculates the value of ans as k * min(A, 2*B), which is 2 * min(180, 200), which is 360.
The code then calculates the value of r as X - 1000*k, which is 2400 - 2000, which is 400.
The code then checks if 0 < r <= 500, which is true.
The code then adds the value of min(A, B) to ans, which is 100.
The code then prints the final value of ans, which is 460.
<<<Output>>>
460
