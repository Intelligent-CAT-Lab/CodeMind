  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user in the form of three space-separated integers x, a, and b.
It then checks if b is less than or equal to a, and if so, prints "delicious" and exits.
If b is greater than a, it checks if (b - a) is less than or equal to x, and if so, prints "safe" and exits.
If (b - a) is greater than x, it prints "dangerous" and exits.
<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will depend on the input given by the user.
If the input is "4 3 6", the output will be "safe".
