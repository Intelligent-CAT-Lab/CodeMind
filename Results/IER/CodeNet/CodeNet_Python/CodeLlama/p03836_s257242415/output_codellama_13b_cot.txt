  <<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called solve that takes four integer arguments: sx, sy, tx, and ty.
The function first calculates the first string by concatenating "U" with a string of length (ty-sy) and then concatenating "R" with a string of length (tx-sx).
The function then calculates the second string by concatenating "D" with a string of length (ty-sy) and then concatenating "L" with a string of length (tx-sx).
The function then calculates the third string by concatenating "L" with a string of length (ty-sy+1) and then concatenating "R" with a string of length (tx-sx+1) and then concatenating "D".
The function then calculates the fourth string by concatenating "R" with a string of length (ty-sy+1) and then concatenating "D" with a string of length (tx-sx+1) and then concatenating "U".
The function then prints the concatenation of the four strings.

The code then defines a main function that takes no arguments.
The main function calls the solve function with the input arguments sx, sy, tx, and ty.

The input arguments are 0, 0, 1, and 2, respectively.
