<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input from the user and stores it in a variable called a.
The code then converts the input string to a list of characters using the list() function.
The code then iterates over the list of characters and checks if each character is equal to "?". If it is, it replaces the character with "D".
The code then creates an empty string called b and iterates over the list of characters again. For each character, it appends it to the string b.
Finally, the code prints the string b.
