<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input N, A, and B as integers.
The code then checks if the difference between A and B is even.
If it is, the code prints the difference between A and B divided by 2.
If it is not, the code prints the minimum of A-1 and N-B plus 1 plus the difference between A and B divided by 2.

In this case, the difference between A and B is 2, which is even.
The code prints (B-A)//2, which is 1.
<<<Output>>>
