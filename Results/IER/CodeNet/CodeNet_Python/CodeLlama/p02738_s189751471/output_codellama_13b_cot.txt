  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the lru_cache function from the functools module.
It then takes two inputs from the user, N and M, and assigns them to the variables N and M, respectively.
The code then defines a function called mod_inv, which takes an integer x as input and returns its modular multiplicative inverse modulo M.
The function uses the extended Euclidean algorithm to find the modular multiplicative inverse of x.
The code then defines two functions called gen_Y and gen_X, which generate the values of Y and X, respectively.
The function gen_Y takes an integer i as input and returns the values of Y for that i.
The function gen_X takes no input and returns the values of X.
The code then defines a function called acc_mulmod, which takes an iterable it and an optional initial value init as input and returns the accumulated product of the values in it modulo M.
The code then calculates the sum of the products of the values of Y and X modulo M and prints the result.
<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will depend on the values of N and M.
For the input 1 998244353, the output will be 499122176.
