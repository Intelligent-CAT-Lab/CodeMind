<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input n from the user and initializes three variables a, b, and i to 1, 1, and 0, respectively.
The code then enters a while loop that iterates until i is less than n.
In each iteration, the code calculates the next Fibonacci number by adding a and b, and stores the result in b.
The code then increments i by 1 and repeats the process.
The loop will terminate when i is equal to n, and the code will print the final value of a, which is the nth Fibonacci number.
