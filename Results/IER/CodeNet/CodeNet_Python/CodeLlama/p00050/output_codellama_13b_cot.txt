<<<Analysis>>>
The code imports the re module, which provides regular expression functionality.
The code then defines a lambda function that takes a single argument, m, and returns a list of strings ["apple","peach"].
The code then calls the re.sub() function, which replaces all occurrences of the regular expression (apple|peach) with the result of the lambda function.
The regular expression (apple|peach) matches either "apple" or "peach".
The lambda function checks if the matched string is "apple" or "peach" using the m.group(0) method, which returns the entire matched string.
If the matched string is "apple", the lambda function returns "apple".
If the matched string is "peach", the lambda function returns "peach".
The code then calls the input() function to get the input from the user.
The code then prints the result of the re.sub() function.
<<<Output>>>
the cost of one peach is higher than that of one apple.
