<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input as a string and stores it in a list called n.
The code then iterates through the list and calculates the sum of the digits in the string.
The sum is stored in the variable ans.
The code then checks if the sum is divisible by 9.
If it is, the code prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
