  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs, n and y, from the user.
n is an integer that represents the number of times the loop will run.
y is an integer that represents the target value.
The code then enters a nested loop that iterates from 0 to n.
For each iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop iterates from 0 to n-i.
The code checks if the expression (y-(i*10000+j*5000))/1000 is equal to (n-i-j).
If the condition is met, the code prints the values of i, j, and n-i-j and exits the program.
If the condition is not met, the code prints -1 -1 -1 and exits the program.
