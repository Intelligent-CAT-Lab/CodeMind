The variable x is initialized to 7, which is the input given.
The variable ans is initialized to x//11, which is 0.
The code then checks if x - 11*ans is greater than 6.
Since x - 11*ans = 7 - 0 = 7, which is less than 6, the condition is not met.
The code then checks if x - 11*ans is equal to 0.
Since x - 11*ans = 7 - 0 = 7, which is not equal to 0, the condition is not met.
The code then prints 2*ans+1, which is 2*0+1 = 1.
