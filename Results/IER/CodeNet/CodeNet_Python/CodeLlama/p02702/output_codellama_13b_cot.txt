  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input string s and converts it into a list of integers.
The code then initializes a list remain with 2020 elements, each initialized to 0.
The code then initializes two variables now and ans to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from the length of s-1 to 0, inclusive.
For each iteration, the code calculates the value of now by adding the current digit of s multiplied by the power of 10 raised to the length of s minus the current index minus 1, modulo 2019.
The code then adds the value of remain[now%2019] to ans.
The code then increments the value of remain[now%2019] by 1.
The code then increments the value of ans by the value of remain[0].
The code then prints the value of ans.
