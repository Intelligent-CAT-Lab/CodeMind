  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first replaces each operator with a space-separated string containing the operator and a space.
For example, the input "3-2*3" becomes "3 - 2 * 3".
The code then splits the string into a list of tokens, where each token is either a number or an operator.
The code then defines two functions, number and expr, which are used to parse the input.
The number function returns the value of the next number in the input, and the expr function returns the value of the next expression in the input.
The expr function calls itself recursively to parse the expression, and it uses the pri dictionary to determine the precedence of the operators.
The code then defines a function called parse, which takes a priority dictionary and a current position in the input as arguments.
The parse function calls the expr function to parse the expression, and it returns the value of the expression.
The code then defines a variable called ans, which will be used to store the maximum value of the expression.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over all possible combinations of operator priorities.
For each combination, the code calls the parse function to parse the input, and it stores the maximum value of the expression in the ans variable.
Finally, the code prints the value of the ans variable, which is the maximum value of the expression.
