The code first takes input from the user in the form of two integers, n and r.
The variable n is assigned the value 2, and the variable r is assigned the value 2919.
The code then checks if n is less than 10.
Since n is less than 10, the code enters the if block and prints the value of r + 100(10-n).
The value of r is 2919, and the value of 10-n is 8.
Therefore, the output of the code is 2919 + 800 = 3719.
<<<Output>>>
3719
