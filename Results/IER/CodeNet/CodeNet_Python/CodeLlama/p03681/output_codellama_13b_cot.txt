<<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the factorial function from the math module and defines a constant MAX equal to 10^9+7.
The code then reads two integers N and M from the input using the map function.
The code calculates the difference between N and M and stores it in a variable diff.
The code then checks if the absolute value of diff is greater than 1, if it is, it prints 0 and exits.
If diff is equal to 0, the code calculates the product of the factorials of N and M and multiplies it by 2, then takes the remainder of the result modulo MAX.
If diff is not equal to 0, the code calculates the product of the factorials of N and M and takes the remainder of the result modulo MAX.
The code then prints the result.
