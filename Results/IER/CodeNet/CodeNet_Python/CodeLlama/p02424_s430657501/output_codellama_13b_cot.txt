  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input and splits them into two variables a and b.
The code then defines a constant MASK with the value (1 << 32)-1, which is 2^32-1.
The code then formats the binary representation of a and b using the format string "{:032b}".
The code then prints the binary representation of a & b, a | b, and a ^ b.
