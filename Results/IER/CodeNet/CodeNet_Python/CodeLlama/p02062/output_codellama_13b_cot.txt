  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first reads the input as a string and splits it into a list of tokens, where each token is a character in the string.
The code then defines a set of functions for parsing the input string into a formula.
The parse_formula function calls the parse_or function, which in turn calls the parse_and function, which calls the parse_term function.
The parse_term function checks if the current token is a question mark, which indicates a variable, and returns a list with two elements: [1, 1] if it is, and [0, 0] otherwise.
If the current token is an ampersand (&), the parse_and function calls the parse_term function twice and returns a list with two elements: the sum of the two lists and the minimum of the two lists.
If the current token is a vertical bar (|), the parse_or function calls the parse_and function twice and returns a list with two elements: the sum of the two lists and the minimum of the two lists.
The parse_formula function returns the result of the parse_or function.
The code then prints the result of the parse_formula function, which is a list with two elements: the number of variables that can be true and the number of variables that can be false.
