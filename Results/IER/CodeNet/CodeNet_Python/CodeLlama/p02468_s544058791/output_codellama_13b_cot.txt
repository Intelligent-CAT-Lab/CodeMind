  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the pow function from the math module.
The code then takes two inputs m and n from the user, and stores them in variables m and n, respectively.
The code then calculates the modulus of 10^9 + 7, which is 1000000007.
The code then calculates the power of m to the power of n, using the pow function, and stores the result in the variable ans.
The code then prints the value of ans.
