<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three inputs a, b, and c.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the number of integers between a and b that are divisible by c.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from a to b (inclusive), meaning it will consider integers from 5 to 14.
For each integer i in this range, it checks if c is divisible by i. If it is, it adds 1 to ans. The condition is met when i is 5, 7, 11, 13, and 14.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 5.
<<<Output>>>
5
