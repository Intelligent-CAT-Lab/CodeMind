  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first initializes the modulus and range variables.
The fctr list is initialized with 1 and 0s.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to rng (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 2000100.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the factorial of i and stores it in fctr[i].
The code defines a function finv(x) that returns the inverse of x modulo mod.
The code defines a function cmb(n,k) that returns the binomial coefficient of n and k.
The code then takes input from the user and assigns it to the variables x1, y1, x2, and y2.
The code then prints the result of the equation (cmb(x2+y2+2,x2+1)-cmb(x2+y1+1,y1)-cmb(x1+y2+1,x1)+cmb(x1+y1,x1))%mod.
