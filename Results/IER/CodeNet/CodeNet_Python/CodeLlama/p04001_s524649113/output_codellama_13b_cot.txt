  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input from the user and stores it in a variable called S.
It then creates an instance of the Formula class and passes the input S as an argument to the constructor.
The constructor initializes the input, sum, input_len, input_split_pos, and mask variables.
The calc_sum method is then called with the input S and the mask variable as arguments.
The method splits the input S into substrings based on the mask variable and calculates the sum of the substrings.
The sum is then added to the sum variable in the Formula class.
The while loop iterates over all possible mask values and calls the calc_sum method for each mask value.
The final sum is then printed.
