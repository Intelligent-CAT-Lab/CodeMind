<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user in the form of two integers n and m, separated by a space.
The variable n is assigned the value of the first integer, and the variable m is assigned the value of the second integer.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to n-1.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is less than or equal to n/2. If it is, it prints a 0. Otherwise, it prints the value of m.
After the loop finishes, the code prints a newline character.
<<<Output>>>
0 0 0
