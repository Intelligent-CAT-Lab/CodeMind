  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input from the user and splits it into a list of strings using the dot (.) as the delimiter.
The code then uses the itertools.product() function to generate all possible combinations of the input string using the characters '0', '1', '+', '-', '*', '(', and ')' with a length of len(s)-1.
The code then iterates over each combination and checks if the expression is valid using the ok() function.
If the expression is valid, the code evaluates the expression using the eval() function and checks if the result is less than 1024.
If the result is less than 1024, the code updates the maximum value of mx if it is greater than the current value of mx.
Finally, the code prints the maximum value of mx.
