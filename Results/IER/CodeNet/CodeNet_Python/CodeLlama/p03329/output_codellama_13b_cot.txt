The code first imports the copy module.
The variable N is initialized to 127.
The variable six is initialized to a list of the first 7 powers of 6 in reverse order.
The variable nine is initialized to a list of the first 7 powers of 9 in reverse order.
The function DP is defined.
The function DP takes an integer n as input.
If n is less than 6, the function returns n.
The function then initializes a temporary variable tmp to n.
The function then initializes two variables count6 and count9 to 0.
The function then iterates through the list six and checks if each element is less than or equal to n.
If an element is less than or equal to n, the function subtracts the element from n and sets count6 to 1.
The function then breaks out of the loop.
The function then recursively calls itself with the new value of n.
The function then sets n to tmp.
If n is less than 9, the function returns count6.
The function then iterates through the list nine and checks if each element is less than or equal to n.
If an element is less than or equal to n, the function subtracts the element from n and sets count9 to 1.
The function then breaks out of the loop.
The function then recursively calls itself with the new value of n.
The function then sets n to tmp.
The function then returns the minimum of count6 and count9.
The function DP is then called with the input N.
The function returns the output of DP(N).
