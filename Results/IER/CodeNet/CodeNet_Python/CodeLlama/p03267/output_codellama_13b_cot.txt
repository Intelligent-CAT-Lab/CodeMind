  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first reads an integer L from standard input using the sr() function.
The code then calculates the number of bits needed to represent L using the bit_length() method.
The code then creates a list of edges, where each edge is a tuple of three integers (i, i+1, 2**(i-1)) or (i, i+1, 0).
The first element of each edge is the index of the edge, the second element is the index of the next edge, and the third element is the weight of the edge.
The code then iterates over the edges and checks if the current edge is a valid edge.
If the current edge is a valid edge, the code updates the value of L and adds a new edge to the list of edges.
The code then prints the number of edges and the list of edges.
