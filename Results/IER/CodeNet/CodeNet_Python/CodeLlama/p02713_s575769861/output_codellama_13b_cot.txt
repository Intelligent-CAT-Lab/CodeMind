  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the fractions module as fr.
The variable k is initialized to 2, which is the input given.
The variable ans is initialized to (k+1)*k//2, which is 6.
The variable tttt is initialized to a 2D list of size (k+1)x(k+1) filled with 0s.
The code then enters a nested loop that iterates over the indices i, j, and l.
For each iteration, the code checks if tttt[i][j] is not equal to 0, and if it is, it sets g to tttt[i][j].
If tttt[i][j] is equal to 0, the code sets g to the greatest common divisor of i and j, and sets tttt[i][j] and tttt[j][i] to g.
The code then adds 3*g to ans.
The code then enters another nested loop that iterates over the indices i, j, and l.
For each iteration, the code sets temp to tttt[i][j] and temp2 to tttt[temp][l].
The code then adds 6*temp2 to ans.
The code then prints ans.
