  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the factorial function from the math module.
It then takes in four integers as input, h, w, a, and b, and assigns them to variables of the same name.
The code then initializes a list called fact with the value 1, and a list called inv_fact with the value 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to h+w-1, and for each iteration, it calculates the product of the previous value in the list and the current iteration number, and stores the result in the list.
The code then enters another loop that iterates from h+w-2 to 0, and for each iteration, it calculates the product of the previous value in the list and the current iteration number, and stores the result in the list.
The code then defines a function called comb that takes two integers as input and returns the result of the product of the factorial of the first integer and the inverse of the factorial of the second integer, and the inverse of the factorial of the first integer minus the second integer.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from b to w, and for each iteration, it calculates the result of the function comb with the current iteration number and the first integer minus the second integer, and stores the result in the variable ans.
The code then prints the value of ans.
