  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first checks if the input string is not empty. If it is, it initializes two variables: inputStrings, which is the input string, and outputStrings, which is an empty list that will be used to store the output.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each character in the input string.
For each character, it checks if the character is "A" or "Z". If it is, it appends the character to the outputStrings list.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if the outputStrings list is not empty. If it is, it checks if the last character in the list is "A". If it is, it removes the last character from the list.
Finally, the code joins the characters in the outputStrings list into a single string and prints it.
