<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, separated by a space.
The first integer is assigned to variable a, and the second integer is assigned to variable b.
The code then calculates the average of a and b, which is (a+b)/2.
The result is then rounded down to the nearest integer and stored in variable c.
The code then prints the value of c.
