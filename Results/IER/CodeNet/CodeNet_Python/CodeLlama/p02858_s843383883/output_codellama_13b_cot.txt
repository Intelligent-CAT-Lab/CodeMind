  <<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function gcd(x, y) that returns the greatest common divisor of x and y.
The code then reads three integers H, W, and T from the input and assigns them to the variables H, W, and T, respectively.
The code then calculates the greatest common divisors of H and T, and W and T, and assigns them to the variables gh and gw, respectively.
The code then calculates the values of h and w as H // gh and W // gw, respectively.
The code then calculates the value of pow(2, h, MOD) + pow(2, w, MOD) + pow(2, gcd(h, w), MOD) - 3 and assigns it to the variable result.
The code then prints the value of result.
