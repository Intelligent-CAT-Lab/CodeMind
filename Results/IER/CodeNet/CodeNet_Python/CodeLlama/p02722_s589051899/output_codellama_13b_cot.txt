  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input N and then defines a function f(N, i) that returns True if N is divisible by i and False otherwise.
The code then initializes a variable ans to 0 and sets i to 1.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to the square root of N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 3.
For each number i in this range, the code checks if N is divisible by i and if so, it adds 1 to ans.
The code also checks if i is a factor of N//i and if so, it adds 1 to ans.
The code then enters another loop that iterates from 1 to the square root of (N-1) (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 2.
For each number i in this range, the code checks if N-1 is divisible by i and if so, it adds 1 to ans.
The code also checks if i is a factor of (N-1)//i and if so, it adds 1 to ans.
Finally, the code prints the value of ans.
