The output of the code will depend on the input given by the user.
If the input is "abaababaab", the code will print "2" because the substring "ab" is equal to the substring "ba" and the indices of these substrings are 2 and 4, respectively.
If the input is any other string, the code will not print anything because the condition in the if statement will not be met.
