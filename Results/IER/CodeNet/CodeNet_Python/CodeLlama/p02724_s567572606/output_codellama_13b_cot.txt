The variable X is initialized to 1024, which is the input given.
The code then enters a loop that subtracts 500 from X while X is greater than or equal to 500. This loop will run 2 times, since 1024 is greater than 500 and 500 is greater than 500.
After the loop finishes, X will be equal to 24.
The code then enters another loop that subtracts 5 from X while X is greater than or equal to 5. This loop will run 4 times, since 24 is greater than 5 and 5 is greater than 5.
After the loop finishes, X will be equal to 0.
The code then prints the value of 1000*s+5*p, which is 1000*2+5*4=1024.
<<<Output>>>
1024
