<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in four integers as input, H, W, x, and y.
The code then checks if the product of H and W is odd and if the sum of x and y is odd.
If both conditions are true, the code prints "No", otherwise it prints "Yes".

In this case, the input is 3, 5, 1, and 4.
The product of H and W is 15, which is odd.
The sum of x and y is 5, which is odd.
Therefore, the output of the code is "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
