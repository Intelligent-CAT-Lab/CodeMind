<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input as a string and stores it in the variable s.
The code then counts the number of "x" and "o" in the string using the count() method.
The number of "x" is stored in the variable batu, and the number of "o" is stored in the variable maru.
The length of the string is stored in the variable leng.
The code then checks if the number of "x" is greater than or equal to 8, and if it is, it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".
<<<Output>>>
YES
