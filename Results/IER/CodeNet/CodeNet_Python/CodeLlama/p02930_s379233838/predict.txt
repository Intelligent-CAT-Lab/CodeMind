The output of the code will depend on the input N.
If N is less than or equal to 2^K for some K, the code will print a 2D array E of size N+1 x N+1, where each element is either an empty string or a non-negative integer.
If N is greater than 2^K for all K, the code will print a 2D array E of size N+1 x N+1, where each element is either an empty string or a non-negative integer.
