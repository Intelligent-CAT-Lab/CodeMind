The code first initializes a list called sosu with the value 2.
The variable now is initialized to 3.
The code then enters a while loop that iterates until now ** 2 is greater than 10 ** 9.
The loop first checks if now is divisible by any of the numbers in sosu. If it is, it sets the flag variable to False and breaks out of the loop.
If the flag variable is still True, the code appends the current value of now to the sosu list.
The code then increments now by 1 and repeats the loop.
The code then enters another while loop that iterates until the square root of S is greater than 10 ** 9.
The loop first calculates the square root of S and stores it in r.
The code then initializes two variables called st1 and st2 to the value of r.
The code then enters a while loop that iterates until st1 * st2 is greater than S.
The loop first calculates the difference between st1 * st2 and S and stores it in cd.
The code then checks if cd is divisible by any of the numbers in sosu and if the result is less than or equal to 10 ** 9. If it is, it prints the result and breaks out of the loop.
The code then increments st1 by 1 and repeats the loop.
The code then enters another while loop that iterates until st2 is greater than 10 ** 9.
The loop first increments st2 by 1 and repeats the loop.
