  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module and the collections module.
The code then sets the recursion limit to 10^6.
The variable k is initialized to the input value, which is 6 in this case.
The variable g is initialized to a list of empty lists, with length k.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to k-1.
For each iteration, the code appends two elements to the list g[i].
The first element is a tuple containing the value (i+1)%k and 1.
The second element is a tuple containing the value 10*i%k and 0.
The code then initializes a deque called q with the value 1.
The variable res is initialized to a list of floats with length k.
The code then enters a while loop that continues until the deque q is empty.
The code pops the first element from the deque q and assigns it to the variable v.
The code then checks if v is equal to 0.
If it is, the code breaks out of the loop.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the elements of the list g[v].
For each element, the code checks if the value of res[c] is less than or equal to the value of res[v] plus d.
If it is, the code continues to the next iteration.
The code then updates the value of res[c] to the value of res[v] plus d.
The code then checks if d is equal to 1.
If it is, the code appends the value c to the end of the deque q.
If it is not, the code appends the value c to the front of the deque q.
The code then continues to the next iteration.
The code then prints the value of res[0].
