  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the numpy library as np.
The input is then read and split into four variables x1, y1, x2, and y2.
The variables a and b are then initialized to complex numbers with real and imaginary parts x1 and y1, and x2 and y2, respectively.
The length of the line segment between a and b is calculated and stored in length.
The code then calculates the coordinates of two points c and d, which are the reflections of a and b about the line passing through the origin with a slope of -1.
The coordinates of c and d are then rounded to the nearest integer and stored in x3, y3, x4, and y4.
The code then prints the coordinates of c and d.
<<<Output>>>
