  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first initializes the variable MOD to 998244353, which is a large prime number.
The code then initializes the variable n to 4, a to 1, b to 2, and k to 5.
The code then initializes an array fac with length n + 1, and sets each element to 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n - 1, and calculates the factorial of each element using the formula fac[i + 1] = fac[i] * (i + 1) % MOD.
The code then defines a function comb that calculates the binomial coefficient of two numbers, using the formula fac[n] * pow(fac[n - k], MOD - 2, MOD) * pow(fac[k], MOD - 2, MOD).
The code then initializes the variable ans to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n + 1, and calculates the value of ans using the formula ans += (comb(n, x) * comb(n, y)) % MOD.
The code then prints the value of ans % MOD.
