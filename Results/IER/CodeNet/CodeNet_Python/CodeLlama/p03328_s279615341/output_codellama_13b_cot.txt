<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes two integers a and b as input, separated by a space.
It then initializes a list lis with 1000 elements, all set to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 1000.
For each iteration, it calculates the value of the expression (i+2)*(i+1)//2 and stores it in the ith element of lis.
The code then checks if the current value of i is greater than or equal to 1. If it is, it checks if the difference between b and a is equal to the difference between the current value of lis[i] and lis[i-1]. If this condition is met, the code prints the value of lis[i] minus b and breaks out of the loop.
The code then exits.
<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will be 13-8=5.
