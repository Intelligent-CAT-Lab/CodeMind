The code takes two integers A and B as input, separated by a space.
The code then checks if A is equal to 1, and if it is, it sets A to 14.
The code then checks if B is equal to 1, and if it is, it sets B to 14.
The code then checks if A is greater than B, and if it is, it prints "Alice".
The code then checks if B is greater than A, and if it is, it prints "Bob".
The code then checks if A is equal to B, and if it is, it prints "Draw".
The code then prints the final output.
<<<Output>>>
