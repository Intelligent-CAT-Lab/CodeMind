  <<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called atack that takes an integer argument called tairyoku.
The function checks if tairyoku is equal to 1, and if it is, it returns 1.
If tairyoku is not equal to 1, the function divides tairyoku by 2 and calls itself recursively with the result.
The function then multiplies the result by 2 and adds 1 to it.
The code then reads an integer from standard input and assigns it to a variable called H.
The code then calls the atack function with the value of H as an argument and assigns the result to a variable called ans.
Finally, the code prints the value of ans to standard output.
