  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports several modules from the Python standard library, including sys, functools, itertools, collections, and bisect.
The read() function is defined, which reads a single integer from standard input and returns it.
The reads() function is defined, which reads a line of space-separated integers from standard input and returns a list of integers.
The MOD variable is defined, which is the modulus used for the calculations.
The N variable is read from standard input using the read() function.
The NN variable is defined, which is N+1.
The fact variable is defined, which is a list of length NN that stores the factorial of each number from 0 to N.
The inv() function is defined, which calculates the modular multiplicative inverse of a number.
The invfact variable is defined, which is a list of length NN that stores the modular multiplicative inverse of each number from 0 to N.
The comb() function is defined, which calculates the binomial coefficient of two numbers.
The S variable is defined, which is a list of length N that stores the sum of the binomial coefficients of each number from 0 to N.
The ans variable is defined, which is the final answer.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from (N+1)//2 to N-1, meaning it will consider numbers from 2 to N-1.
For each number k in this range, it calculates the sum of the binomial coefficients of each number from 0 to k-1.
The code then calculates the difference between the sum of the binomial coefficients of k and the sum of the binomial coefficients of k-1.
The code then adds the product of k and the difference to the ans variable.
The code then prints the final value of ans.
