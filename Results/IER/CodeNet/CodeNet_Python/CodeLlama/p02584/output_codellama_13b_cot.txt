  <<<Analysis>>>
The variable X, variable K, and variable D are initialized to 6, 2, and 4, respectively.
The code calculates the number of moves required to reach the origin from the current position, which is abs(X) // D.
The variable count is initialized to the result of this calculation, which is 1.
The code checks if count is greater than K, which is 2 in this case. If it is, the code calculates the distance between the current position and the origin, which is abs(X) - D * K.
The variable ans is initialized to the result of this calculation, which is 2.
The code prints the final value of ans, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
