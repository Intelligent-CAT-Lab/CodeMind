  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input string S and initializes a list l with length equal to the length of S plus 1.
The code then sets the first two elements of l to 0 and 1, respectively.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 3 to the length of S plus 1.
For each iteration, the code checks if the current character of S is different from the previous two characters.
If it is, the code adds 1 to the current element of l.
If it is not, the code adds 2 to the current element of l.
The code then prints the last element of l, which is the length of the longest substring of S that does not contain any repeated characters.
