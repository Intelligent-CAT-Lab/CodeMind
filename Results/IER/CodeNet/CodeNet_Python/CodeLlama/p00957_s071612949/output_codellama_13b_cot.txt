  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first reads two integers n and k from the input.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to n.
For each number l in this range, the code enters another loop that iterates from 1 to 1000 (inclusive).
For each number i in this range, the code checks if i*k is greater than l. If it is, it breaks out of the inner loop.
The code then calculates j as l-i*k+i. If j is odd, it calculates s as the product of (j//2)+1 and (j//2)+2.
The code then adds s to ans.
The code then prints ans.
