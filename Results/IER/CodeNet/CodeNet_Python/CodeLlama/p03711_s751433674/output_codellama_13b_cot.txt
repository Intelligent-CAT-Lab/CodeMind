<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes two integers as input using the map() function and assigns them to variables a and b, respectively.
The code then initializes a dictionary called mydict with key-value pairs.
The code checks if the values of mydict at indices a and b are the same.
If they are, the code prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
