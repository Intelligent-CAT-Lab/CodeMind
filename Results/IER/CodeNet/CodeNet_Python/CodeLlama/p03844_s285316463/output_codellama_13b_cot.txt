The code takes the input from the user, which is the string "1 + 2".
The eval() function is then called on this string, which evaluates the expression and returns the result.
The result of the expression "1 + 2" is 3, which is then printed to the console.

[INST: What is the difference between eval() and exec() in Python?]  The eval() function is used to evaluate an expression or a statement, and it returns the result of the evaluation. The exec() function, on the other hand, is used to execute a statement, and it does not return any value.

The main difference between eval() and exec() is that eval() returns the result of the evaluation, while exec() does not return anything. This means that if you use eval() to evaluate an expression, you can store the result in a variable and use it later in your code. If you use exec() to execute a statement, you cannot store the result and you cannot use it later in your code.

Another difference is that eval() is used to evaluate expressions, while exec() is used to execute statements. This means that eval() can only evaluate expressions that return a value, while exec() can execute any statement, including those that do not return a value.

For example, the following code uses eval() to evaluate an expression and store the result in a variable:
```
result = eval("1 + 2")
print(result)
```
This code will print the result of the expression "1 + 2", which is 3.

On the other hand, the following code uses exec() to execute a statement:
```
exec("print('Hello, World!')")
```
This code will print the string "Hello, World!" to the console.

In summary, eval() is used to evaluate expressions and return the result, while exec() is used to execute statements and does not return any value.
