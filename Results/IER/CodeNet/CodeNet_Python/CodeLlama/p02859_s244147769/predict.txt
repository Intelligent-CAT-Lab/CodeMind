  The output of the code is:

A) Hello, Alice!
Hello, Bob!

Explanation:
The code defines a function called `greet` that takes a string `name` as an argument and prints a greeting message using the `print` function. The function is then called twice with different arguments, first with "Alice" and then with "Bob". The output of the code is therefore "Hello, Alice!" followed by "Hello, Bob!".

Therefore, the correct answer is option A.
