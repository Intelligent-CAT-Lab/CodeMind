<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function main() that takes two arguments X and A.
The function first maps the input to integers using the map() function.
The function then checks if X is less than A.
If it is, the function prints 0.
If it is not, the function prints 10.
The code then checks if the name of the module is __main__, which is the name of the module that is executed when the script is run directly.
If it is, the function main() is called.
<<<Output>>>
10
