<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes the input as a string, splits it into three parts using the space character as a delimiter.
The first part is assigned to variable a, the second part is assigned to variable op, and the third part is assigned to variable b.
The code then converts the strings to integers using the int() function.
The code then checks the value of variable op, if it is '+', it prints the sum of a and b, otherwise it prints the difference of a and b.
