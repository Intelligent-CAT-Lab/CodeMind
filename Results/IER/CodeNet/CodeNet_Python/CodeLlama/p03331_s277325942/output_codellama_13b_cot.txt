  <<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function DigitsSum that takes an integer n as input and returns the sum of its digits.
The code then prompts the user to input an integer N and initializes a variable min_sum to 10^5.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 15.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits using the DigitsSum function and stores it in sum.
The code then calculates the sum of the digits of the complement of i (N-i) and adds it to sum.
The code checks if sum is less than min_sum and updates min_sum if it is.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of min_sum, which is 15.
<<<Output>>>
15
