  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input N, which is 3 in this case.
It then initializes a list of dictionaries called memo, which will be used to store the results of previous computations.
The code then defines a function called ok, which takes a string of length 4 as input and returns True if the string does not contain the substring "AGC" and False otherwise.
The code then defines a function called dfs, which takes two inputs: the current position in the string (cur) and the last 3 characters of the string (last3).
The dfs function first checks if the current position is equal to N, in which case it returns 1.
If not, it iterates over the possible characters (A, C, G, and T) and checks if the current character is ok to be added to the string.
If it is, it recursively calls dfs with the updated current position and last 3 characters.
The function then returns the sum of the results of all these recursive calls.
The code then calls dfs with the initial values of cur = 0 and last3 = "TTT".
<<<Output>>>
The output of the code is 4.
