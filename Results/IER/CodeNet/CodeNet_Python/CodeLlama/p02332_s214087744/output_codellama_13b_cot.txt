  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the functools module and the sys module.
The code then defines a function called lru_cache, which is used to cache the results of a function.
The code then defines a variable called mod, which is used to calculate the modulus of a number.
The code then defines two variables called n and k, which are initialized to the values of the first two numbers in the input.
The code then defines a list called facts, which is initialized to a list of 1s with length k+1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to k+1, and for each iteration, it calculates the factorial of i and stores it in the facts list.
The code then checks if n is greater than k, and if it is, it prints 0 and exits the program.
The code then prints the result of the calculation (facts[k]//facts[k-n])%mod.
