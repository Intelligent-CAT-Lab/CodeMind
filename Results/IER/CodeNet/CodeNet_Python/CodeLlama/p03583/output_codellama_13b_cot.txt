  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input N from the user and initializes three variables n, h, and w to 0.
The code then enters a nested loop that iterates from 1 to 3500 for both i and j.
The code calculates the values of tmp1 and tmp2 using the formulae provided in the code.
The code checks if tmp2 is not equal to 0 and if the values of s and m are both 0 and s is greater than or equal to 0.
If these conditions are met, the code prints the values of n, h, and w and exits the loop.
The code does not print anything if the conditions are not met.
<<<Output>>>
The code does not print anything because the conditions are not met.
