<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input N from the user.
It then defines a function num2alpha that takes an integer num as input and returns a string representing the corresponding alphabetical character.
The function first checks if num is less than or equal to 26, in which case it returns the corresponding ASCII character (64+num).
If num is greater than 26, it checks if num is divisible by 26. If it is, it returns the result of calling num2alpha with num//26-1 and the ASCII character for the letter Z (90).
Otherwise, it returns the result of calling num2alpha with num//26 and the ASCII character for the letter A plus the remainder of num%26.
Finally, the code calls num2alpha with the input N and prints the result in lowercase.
