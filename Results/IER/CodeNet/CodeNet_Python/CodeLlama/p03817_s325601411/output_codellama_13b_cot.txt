<<<Analysis>>>
The variable x is initialized to 7, which is the input given.
The variable ans is initialized to (x // 11) * 2, which is (7 // 11) * 2 = 0 * 2 = 0.
The variable sub is initialized to x % 11, which is 7 % 11 = 4.
The code checks if sub is greater than or equal to 7, which is true.
Therefore, the code adds 2 to ans, making it 2.
The code then prints the final value of ans, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
