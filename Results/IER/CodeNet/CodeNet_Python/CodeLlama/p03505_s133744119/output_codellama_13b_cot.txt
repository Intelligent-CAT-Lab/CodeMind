  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first reads the input from the user, which is a string of three numbers separated by spaces.
The variable K, variable A and variable B are initialized to the first, second and third numbers in the input string, respectively.
The code then checks if K is less than or equal to A, and if so, it prints 1.
If K is greater than A but less than or equal to B, it prints -1.
If K is greater than B, it calculates the value of x as (K-B-1)/(A-B)+1 and prints 2*x-1.
