  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes in the input as a string and splits it into a list of integers using the split() method.
The list is then unpacked into the variables n, a, b, and c.
The code then defines two functions, fact() and invfact(), which calculate the factorial and inverse factorial of a number, respectively.
The code then defines a function called comb() which calculates the binomial coefficient of two numbers.
The code then initializes two lists, pow_a and pow_b, which will be used to store the powers of a and b, respectively.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 2n-1, and for each iteration, it calculates the binomial coefficient of the current iteration and the previous iteration, and adds it to the answer.
The code then multiplies the answer by the inverse of c and prints it.
<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will be 1000000007, which is the remainder of the calculation after dividing it by 1000000007.
