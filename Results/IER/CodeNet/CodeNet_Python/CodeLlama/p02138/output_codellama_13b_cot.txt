  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first defines a function inpl() that takes no arguments and returns a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string on whitespace and mapping each element to an integer.
The code then calls inpl() to get the input values N and M.
The code then initializes the variables n1, n2, m1, m2, mall, and nall to N * 1, N * 1, M * 1, M * 1, M * 2, and N * 2, respectively.
The code then enters a loop that iterates until mall is less than or equal to 0.
In each iteration, the code subtracts n1 from mall and calculates the integer part of mall divided by 2, storing the result in m1.
If mall is less than or equal to 0, the code breaks out of the loop.
The code then increments ans1 by 1 and subtracts m1 from n2.
If n2 is less than or equal to 0, the code adds n2 to n1 and sets n2 to 0.
If n1 is less than or equal to 0, the code breaks out of the loop.
The code then increments ans1 by 1.
The code then enters another loop that iterates until m2 is less than or equal to 0.
In each iteration, the code subtracts n1 from m2 and calculates the integer part of m2 divided by 2, storing the result in m1.
If m2 is less than or equal to 0, the code breaks out of the loop.
The code then increments ans2 by 1 and subtracts m1 from n2.
If n2 is less than or equal to 0, the code adds n2 to n1 and sets n2 to 0.
If n1 is less than or equal to 0, the code breaks out of the loop.
The code then increments ans2 by 1.
The code then prints the minimum value of ans1 and ans2.
