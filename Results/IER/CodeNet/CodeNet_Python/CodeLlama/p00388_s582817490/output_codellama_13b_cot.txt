<<<Analysis>>>
The variable H, variable A and variable B are initialized to 100, 2 and 4, respectively.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from A to B (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 2 to 4.
For each number i in this range, it checks if H is divisible by i. If it is, it adds 1 to ans. The condition is met when i is 2 and 4.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
