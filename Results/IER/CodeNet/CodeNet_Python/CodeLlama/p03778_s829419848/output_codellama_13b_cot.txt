The code first imports several modules from the Python standard library, including heapq, math, itertools, functools, and copy.
It then reads in three integers from the input, W, A, and B, using the map() function to convert the input to integers.
The code then calculates the values of x, y, and z using the given formulae.
Finally, the code prints the minimum of x, y, and z.
