  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input h and w as integers and checks if either h or w is divisible by 3. If it is, the code prints 0 and quits.
The code then defines a function main(h,w) that takes two integers h and w as input.
The function main first initializes a variable a to h.
It then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to h//2 (inclusive).
For each iteration, the loop calculates three values:
i*w, (h-i)*(w//2), and (h-i)*(w-w//2).
The loop then calculates the minimum and maximum of these three values and stores the difference between them in a.
The loop repeats until it reaches h//2.
The function main then returns the minimum of a and the result of calling itself with w and h as inputs.
The code then prints the minimum of the result of calling main with h and w as inputs and the result of calling main with w and h as inputs.
