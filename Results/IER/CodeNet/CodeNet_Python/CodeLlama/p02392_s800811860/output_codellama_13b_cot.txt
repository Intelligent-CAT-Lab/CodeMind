<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user and splits it into a list of strings using the split() method.
The list is stored in the variable s.
The code then checks if the first element of the list (s[0]) is less than the second element (s[1]) and if the second element is less than the third element (s[2]).
If both conditions are true, the code prints 'Yes', otherwise it prints 'No'.

In this case, the input is '1 3 8', which means s = ['1', '3', '8'].
The first element is less than the second element, and the second element is less than the third element.
Therefore, the output of the code is 'Yes'.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
