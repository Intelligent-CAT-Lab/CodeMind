<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, a and b, from the user.
The code then checks if any of the following conditions are met:

* a is divisible by 3
* b is divisible by 3
* a + b is divisible by 3

If any of these conditions are met, the code prints "Possible". Otherwise, it prints "Impossible".

Based on the input 4 and 5, the code will print "Possible" because 4 is divisible by 3 and 5 is divisible by 3.

<<<Output>>>
Possible
