<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input n from the user.
The code then checks if n is less than 105. If it is, it prints 0 and exits.
If n is greater than or equal to 105, the code enters a loop that iterates from 105 to n (inclusive), incrementing by 2 each time.
For each number i in this range, the code calculates the number of divisors of i that are also odd.
If the number of odd divisors is 8, the code increments the variable ans by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans.
<<<Output>>>
0
