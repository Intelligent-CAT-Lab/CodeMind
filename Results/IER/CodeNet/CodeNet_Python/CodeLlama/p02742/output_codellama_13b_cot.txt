  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports several modules and defines some functions for input and output.
The main function takes two integers H and W as input using the MAP function.
The code then calculates the area of the rectangle with height H and width W, which is H*W.
The code then calculates the perimeter of the rectangle, which is 2(H+W).
The code then calculates the minimum number of rectangles needed to cover the area and perimeter of the rectangle, which is ceil(H*W/2) and ceil(2(H+W)/2), respectively.
The code then prints the minimum number of rectangles needed to cover the area and perimeter of the rectangle.
