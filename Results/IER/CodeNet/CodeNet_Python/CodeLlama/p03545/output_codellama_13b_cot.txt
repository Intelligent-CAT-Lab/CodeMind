  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user and stores it in the variable n.
The variable n is then converted into a list of integers using the map() function.
The code then assigns the first, second, third, and fourth elements of the list to the variables a, b, c, and d, respectively.
The code then checks if any of the following conditions are true:

* (a+b+c+d) == 7
* (a+b+c-d) == 7
* (a+b-c+d) == 7
* (a+b-c-d) == 7
* (a-b+c+d) == 7
* (a-b+c-d) == 7
* (a-b-c+d) == 7
* (a-b-c-d) == 7

If any of these conditions are true, the code prints the corresponding expression.

Since the input is "1222", the variables a, b, c, and d will be assigned the values 1, 2, 2, and 2, respectively.
The code will check each of the conditions and find that (a+b+c+d) == 7 is true, so it will print "1+2+2+2=7".

<<<Output>>>
1+2+2+2=7
