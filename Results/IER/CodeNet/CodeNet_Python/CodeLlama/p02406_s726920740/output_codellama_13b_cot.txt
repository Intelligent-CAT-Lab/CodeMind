  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input n from the user.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 30.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is divisible by 3. If it is, it prints the number i with a space after it.
If i is not divisible by 3, the code divides i by 10 and checks if the last digit is 3. If it is, it prints the number i with a space after it.
The code then prints a newline character at the end.
<<<Output>>>
3 6 9 12 15 18 21 24 27 30
