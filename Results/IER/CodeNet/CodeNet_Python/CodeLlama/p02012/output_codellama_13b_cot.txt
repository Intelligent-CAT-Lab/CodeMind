  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first reads an integer s from standard input and stores it in a variable.
The code then defines a function called fact that takes an integer n as input and returns a list of all the positive divisors of n.
The code then defines a function called sum that takes two integers a and b as input and returns the sum of all the positive integers between a and b, inclusive.
The code then defines a function called solve that takes no input and performs the following steps:
1. It checks if s is equal to 1 and if so, it prints 1 and returns.
2. It calculates the list of all the positive divisors of s using the fact function.
3. It initializes two dictionaries, f and p, to store the number of ways to express s as a sum of two positive integers and the number of ways to express s as a sum of two positive integers with no common factors, respectively.
4. It sorts the list of divisors in ascending order.
5. It iterates over the list of divisors and for each divisor k, it calculates the number of ways to express k as a sum of two positive integers and the number of ways to express k as a sum of two positive integers with no common factors.
6. It iterates over the list of divisors and for each divisor k, it calculates the number of ways to express s/k as a sum of two positive integers and the number of ways to express s/k as a sum of two positive integers with no common factors.
7. It calculates the total number of ways to express s as a sum of two positive integers and the number of ways to express s as a sum of two positive integers with no common factors.
8. It prints the total number of ways to express s as a sum of two positive integers and the number of ways to express s as a sum of two positive integers with no common factors.
9. It returns.

The code then sets the recursion limit to 1000000 and sets the modulus to 1000000007.
The code then calls the solve function.

<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will be the number of ways to express 25 as a sum of two positive integers and the number of ways to express 25 as a sum of two positive integers with no common factors.

The number of ways to express 25 as a sum of two positive integers is 10.
The number of ways to express 25 as a sum of two positive integers with no common factors is 5.

Therefore, the output of the code will be:
10 5
