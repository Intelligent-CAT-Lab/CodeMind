<<<Analysis>>>
The code imports the math module and defines two variables A and B.
The code then reads two numbers from the input and stores them in A and B, respectively.
The code then calculates the volume of a sphere with radius B and prints it with 10 decimal places.
The formula for the volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr^3, where r is the radius.
In this case, the radius is B, and the volume is 4/3πB^3.
The code uses the format function to print the volume with 10 decimal places.
