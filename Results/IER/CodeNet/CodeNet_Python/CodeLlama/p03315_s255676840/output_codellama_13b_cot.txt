<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in a string S as input.
It then counts the number of "+" and "-" characters in S using the count() method.
The number of "+" characters is multiplied by 1 and the number of "-" characters is multiplied by -1.
The result of these operations is then printed.

In this case, the input string is "+-++".
The count of "+" characters is 2, and the count of "-" characters is 2.
Therefore, the output of the code will be 2 - (-2) = 4.
<<<Output>>>
4
