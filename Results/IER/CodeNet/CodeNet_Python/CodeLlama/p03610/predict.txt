 
The output of the code is:

Hello, Alice!

Explanation:

The code defines a function called `greet` that takes a single argument `name`. The function returns a string that says "Hello, " followed by the value of the `name` argument, and then a exclamation mark.

The code then calls the `greet` function with the argument "Alice", and prints the return value of the function. Since the return value is a string, it is printed to the console.

Therefore, the output of the code is the string "Hello, Alice!".
