The code takes two integers as input, a and b, and splits them into separate variables.
The code then checks if a+b is greater than or equal to a-b and a*b.
If a+b is greater than or equal to both a-b and a*b, it prints a+b.
If a-b is greater than or equal to both a+b and a*b, it prints a-b.
If none of the above conditions are met, it prints a*b.

In this case, a is -13 and b is 3.
a+b is 10, which is greater than or equal to a-b and a*b.
So, the output of the code is 10.
