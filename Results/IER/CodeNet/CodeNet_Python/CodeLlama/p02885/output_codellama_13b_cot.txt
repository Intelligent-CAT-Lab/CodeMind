<<<Analysis>>>
The code first splits the input string into two parts using the split() method.
The first part is assigned to the variable A, and the second part is assigned to the variable B.
The code then calculates the difference between A and B multiplied by 2, and stores it in the variable diff.
The code then checks if diff is less than 0, and if it is, it prints 0. Otherwise, it prints the value of diff.
