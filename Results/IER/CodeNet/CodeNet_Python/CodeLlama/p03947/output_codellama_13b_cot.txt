<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input string S from the user.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to the length of S minus 1 (exclusive).
For each index i in this range, the code checks if the character at index i is different from the character at index i+1.
If the characters are different, the code increments the variable ans by 1.
The loop finishes when i reaches the last index of S minus 1.
The code then prints the final value of ans.
