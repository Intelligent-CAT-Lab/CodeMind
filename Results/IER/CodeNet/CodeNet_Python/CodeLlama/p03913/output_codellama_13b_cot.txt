  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module and reads the input from stdin.
The input is split into two numbers, N and A, and the variables N and A are initialized to these values.
The code then defines a function F(K) that takes a parameter K and returns the minimum cost of buying N items with a cost of A per item.
The function first calculates the number of items that can be bought with a cost of A per item, which is n^K.
It then calculates the number of items that can be bought with a cost of A+1 per item, which is (n+1)^K.
The function then calculates the number of items that can be bought with a cost of A per item and a cost of A+1 per item, which is n^x(n+1)^y.
The function then calculates the cost of buying these items, which is A(x+y-1) + nx + (n+1)y.
The function then returns the minimum cost of buying N items with a cost of A per item.
The code then calculates the minimum cost of buying N items with a cost of A per item for K=1 to 50 and prints the minimum cost.
