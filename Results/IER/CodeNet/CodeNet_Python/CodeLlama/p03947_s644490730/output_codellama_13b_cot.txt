<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in a string input s and initializes a variable now to the first character of the string.
It then initializes a variable ans to 0, which will be used to count the number of times the character changes.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the remaining characters of the string, starting from the second character.
For each character i in the string, the code checks if it is different from the current character now. If it is, it increments ans by 1 and updates now to the current character.
The loop finishes when all characters have been processed.
The code then prints the final value of ans, which is the number of times the character changes.
