<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in a string input from the user, splits it into a list of strings using the split() method, and then converts the first and second elements of the list to integers using the int() method.
The code then subtracts the second element from the first element and prints the result.

In this case, the input is "5 8", which means that s[0] = "5" and s[1] = "8".
The code will subtract 8 from 5, resulting in -3.
<<<Output>>>
-3
