  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input from the user and stores it in a variable called n.
The code then defines two functions called solve1 and solve2.
The solve1 function takes a string as input and returns the sum of the digits in the string.
The solve2 function takes a string as input and returns the minimum number of operations required to convert the string to a palindrome.
The code then calls the solve2 function with the input n and prints the output.

The solve2 function first reverses the input string and appends a 0 to the end of it.
It then initializes a 2D array called dp with the size of the length of the input string + 1 and 2.
The dp array is used to store the minimum number of operations required to convert the string to a palindrome.
The dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of operations required to convert the first i characters of the string to a palindrome if the last character is j.
The dp[0][0] is initialized to 0, which represents the minimum number of operations required to convert the empty string to a palindrome.

The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to the length of the input string - 1.
For each iteration, the code calculates the minimum number of operations required to convert the first i characters of the string to a palindrome if the last character is 0 or 1.
If the last character is 0, the code calculates the minimum number of operations required to convert the first i characters of the string to a palindrome if the last character is 0.
If the last character is 1, the code calculates the minimum number of operations required to convert the first i characters of the string to a palindrome if the last character is 1.
The code then updates the dp array with the minimum number of operations required to convert the first i characters of the string to a palindrome if the last character is 0 or 1.

After the loop finishes, the code prints the minimum number of operations required to convert the input string to a palindrome, which is stored in dp[n_len][0].

<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will be the minimum number of operations required to convert the input string to a palindrome.
Since the input string is "36", the output will be 1, which is the minimum number of operations required to convert the string to a palindrome.
