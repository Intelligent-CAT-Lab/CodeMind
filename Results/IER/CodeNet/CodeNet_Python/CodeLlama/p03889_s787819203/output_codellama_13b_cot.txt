  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input string and converts it into a list of characters using the list() function.
It then reverses the list of characters using the reversed() function and stores the result in a variable called sr.
The code then calculates the length of the original string and divides it by 2, storing the result in a variable called t.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to t (inclusive).
For each iteration, the code checks if the character at position i in the original string is equal to "b" and the character at position i in the reversed string is equal to "d", or if the character at position i in the original string is equal to "d" and the character at position i in the reversed string is equal to "b", or if the character at position i in the original string is equal to "p" and the character at position i in the reversed string is equal to "q", or if the character at position i in the original string is equal to "q" and the character at position i in the reversed string is equal to "p".
If any of these conditions are not met, the code prints "No" and breaks out of the loop.
If all the conditions are met, the code prints "Yes".

<<<Output>>>
No
