  <<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called sort that takes a list of integers as input and returns a sorted list of integers.
The function uses the bubble sort algorithm to sort the list.
The code then takes input from the user and stores it in a list called A.
The code then calls the sort function with the list A as an argument and stores the result in a variable called B.
The code then joins the elements of the list B into a string using the join method and prints the result.
