  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in three inputs: H, W, and d.
H and W are integers representing the height and width of a grid, respectively.
d is an integer representing the number of rows and columns to be skipped.
The code then checks if d is odd or even using the modulo operator.
If d is odd, the code enters the first if block and prints a grid of characters using a list comprehension.
The list comprehension iterates over the range of W and prints "R" if the sum of the current row number and column number is even, and "Y" otherwise.
The grid is printed with each row separated by a newline character.
If d is even, the code enters the else block and prints a grid of characters using a nested for loop.
The nested for loop iterates over the range of W and checks if the sum of the current row number and column number is less than d and if the difference between the current row number and column number is less than d.
If both conditions are met, the code prints "R".
If the sum of the current row number and column number is greater than or equal to d and the difference between the current row number and column number is less than d, the code prints "Y".
If the sum of the current row number and column number is less than d and the difference between the current row number and column number is greater than or equal to d, the code prints "G".
If none of the above conditions are met, the code prints "B".
The grid is printed with each row separated by a newline character.
