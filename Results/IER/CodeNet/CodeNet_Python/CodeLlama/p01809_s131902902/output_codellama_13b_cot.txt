  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first reads two integers from the input, n and m, and stores them in variables n and m, respectively.
The code then enters a while loop that iterates until n and m are both 0.
The loop first initializes a list of lists v, where v[i] is a list of integers representing the neighbors of vertex i.
The code then iterates over the edges in the graph, represented by the list of lists v, and adds each edge to the graph.
The code then initializes a list bfs_map, where bfs_map[i] is 1 if vertex i has not been visited yet, and 0 otherwise.
The code then initializes a list f, where f[i] is 0 if vertex i has not been visited yet, and 1 otherwise.
The code then initializes a queue q, where q is a deque of integers representing the vertices that have not been visited yet.
The code then sets fl to 1, which will be used to indicate whether the graph is bipartite or not.
The code then enters a while loop that iterates until q is empty.
The loop first pops the first element x from the queue q.
The loop then iterates over the neighbors of vertex x, and for each neighbor y, it checks if y has not been visited yet.
If y has not been visited yet, the code adds y to the queue q, sets bfs_map[y] to 0, and sets f[y] to the opposite of f[x].
If y has already been visited, the code checks if f[y] is equal to f[x]. If it is, the code sets fl to 0 and breaks out of the loop.
The code then checks if fl is still 1. If it is, the code sets ans to the sum of the values in f.
The code then checks if ans is even. If it is, the code sets ans to ans//2.
The code then checks if the number of vertices that have not been visited yet is even. If it is, the code sets ans to ans//2.
The code then sets ans to the list of unique elements in ans, and sorts ans in ascending order.
The code then prints the length of ans, followed by each element in ans on a new line.
