The code first imports several modules, including sys, math, bisect, heapq, collections, itertools, and operator.
It then sets the recursion limit to 2147483647 and defines two functions, I and LI, which read input from stdin.
The code then reads two integers, t and x, from stdin using the LI function.
It then prints the result of dividing t by x.
