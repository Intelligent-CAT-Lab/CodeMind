  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input n and m from the user.
n is 4 and m is 1.
The code then checks if n is odd or even.
Since n is odd, the code enters the first if block.
The code initializes l to 1 and r to n-1, which is 3.
The code then enters a loop that iterates m times.
The loop prints the values of l and r, which are 1 and 3, respectively.
The loop then increments l by 1 and decrements r by 1.
The loop repeats this process m times.
The code then exits the loop and prints the final values of l and r, which are 1 and 3, respectively.
<<<Output>>>
