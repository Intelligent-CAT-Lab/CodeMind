<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input string "C0DEFESTIVAL2O16" and stores it in a list called S.
It then creates a list called C with the string "CODEFESTIVAL2016".
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the length of C (which is 16).
For each index i in this range, it checks if the corresponding character in S (at index i) is equal to the corresponding character in C (at index i). If they are not equal, it increments a counter called cnt.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of cnt, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
