  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first initializes the variables n, m, and k to 3, 2, and 1, respectively.
The code then defines a function mod_comb_k(n,k,mod) that calculates the binomial coefficient of n and k modulo mod.
The function first calculates the factorial of n and stores it in fact[n].
It then calculates the factorial of k and stores it in fact_inv[k].
It then calculates the factorial of n-k and stores it in fact_inv[n-k].
It then calculates the binomial coefficient of n and k by multiplying the factorials of n and k and dividing by the factorial of n-k.
The function then returns the result modulo mod.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to k+1.
For each value of x in this range, the code calculates the term m*pow(m-1,n-1-x,mod)*mod_comb_k(n-1,x,mod) and adds it to ans.
The code then prints the final value of ans.
