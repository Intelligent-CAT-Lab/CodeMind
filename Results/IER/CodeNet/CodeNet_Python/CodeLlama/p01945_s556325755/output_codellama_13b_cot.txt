<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input string S from the user.
It then initializes two variables, n and ans, to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each character in the input string S.
For each character i in the input string, the code checks if it is an opening parenthesis "(". If it is, it increments the value of n by 1. If it is a closing parenthesis ")", it decrements the value of n by 1. If it is neither, it prints the value of n and breaks out of the loop.
The code then prints the final value of n, which is 0.
<<<Output>>>
