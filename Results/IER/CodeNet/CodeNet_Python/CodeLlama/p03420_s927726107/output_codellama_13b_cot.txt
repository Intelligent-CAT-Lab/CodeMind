  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first reads two integers n and k from the input.
The function solve() is then called.
Inside the solve() function, the code first checks if k is equal to 0. If it is, the code prints n**2 and returns.
The code then initializes a variable ans to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from k+1 to n+1. For each value of b in this range, the code calculates the value of s as n//b.
The code then calculates the value of ans as the sum of two expressions:
1. s*(b-k)
2. max(0,n-s*b-k+1)
The code then adds the value of ans to the previous value of ans.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans.
