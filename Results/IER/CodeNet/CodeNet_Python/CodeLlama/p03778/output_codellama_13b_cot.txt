<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in three integers as input: w, a, and b.
The code then checks if the absolute difference between a and b is less than w.
If it is, the code prints 0.
If it is not, the code prints the absolute difference between a and b minus w.

In this case, the input is 3, 2, and 6.
The absolute difference between 2 and 6 is 4, which is greater than 3.
The code prints 4 - 3 = 1.
