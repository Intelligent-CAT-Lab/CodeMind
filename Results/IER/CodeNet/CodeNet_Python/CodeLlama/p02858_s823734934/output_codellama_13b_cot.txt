  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the gcd function from the fractions module.
The code then defines the MOD variable as 10**9 + 7.
The code then maps the input to the variables H, W, and T.
The code then calculates the greatest common divisor of H and T, and the greatest common divisor of W and T.
The code then divides H and W by their respective greatest common divisors.
The code then calculates the sum of the powers of 2 for H and W, and subtracts 1.
The code then calculates the power of 2 for the greatest common divisor of H and W.
The code then subtracts 2 from the result.
The code then calculates the modulus of the result.
The code then prints the result.
