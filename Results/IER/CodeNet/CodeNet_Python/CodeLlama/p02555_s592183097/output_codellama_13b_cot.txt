  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the necessary modules, including sys, bisect, math, collections, and heapq.
It then sets the recursion limit to 1000000 and defines a cache dictionary to store the results of previous calculations.
The M variable is defined as 10**9 + 7, which is a large prime number used for modular arithmetic.
The solve function is defined, which takes a single argument S.
The function first checks if S is less than 3, in which case it returns 0.
If S is less than 6, it returns 1.
If S is already in the cache, it returns the cached value.
The function then defines a variable ans and sets it to 1.
It then enters a loop that iterates from S - 3 to 2, inclusive, and for each remaining value, it calls the solve function recursively with the remaining value as an argument.
The function then adds the result of the recursive call to ans and takes the modulus of M.
Finally, the function stores the result of the calculation in the cache and returns it.
The code then checks if the __name__ variable is equal to "__main__", which is only true when the code is run as a script.
If it is, it reads a single line of input from the user and stores it in the S variable.
It then calls the solve function with the value of S as an argument and prints the result.
