<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input from the user and stores it in the variable n.
The code then checks if n is less than 1200, and if it is, it prints "ABC".
If n is greater than or equal to 1200 but less than 2800, it prints "ARC".
If n is greater than or equal to 2800, it prints "AGC".
Since the input is 1199, the code will print "ABC".
<<<Output>>>
ABC
