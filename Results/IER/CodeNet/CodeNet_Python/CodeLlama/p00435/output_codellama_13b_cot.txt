  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input string "MRL" and stores it in the variable w.
It then initializes an empty list called list.
The code then enters a loop that iterates through each character of the input string.
For each character, it checks if it is equal to 'C', 'B', or 'A'. If it is, it appends the corresponding character to the list.
If the character is not equal to 'C', 'B', or 'A', it subtracts 3 from the ASCII value of the character and appends the resulting character to the list.
After the loop finishes, the code joins the elements of the list into a single string using the join() method and stores it in the variable l.
Finally, the code prints the value of l.
<<<Output>>>
"MRL"
