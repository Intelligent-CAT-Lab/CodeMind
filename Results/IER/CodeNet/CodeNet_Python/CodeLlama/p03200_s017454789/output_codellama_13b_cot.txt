<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input string s from the user.
It then initializes two variables a and b to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each character x in the string s.
For each character x, the code checks if x is equal to "W" and if so, it adds the value of b to a.
It then checks if x is equal to "B" and if so, it adds 1 to b.
The loop finishes and the code prints the final value of a, which is 1.
