<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input, separated by spaces.
The variables a, b, and c are initialized to the values of the input.
The code then checks if a is greater than c. If it is, it prints the difference between a and c, followed by b.
If a is not greater than c, the code checks if a + b is less than c. If it is, it prints 0,0.
If a + b is not less than c, the code prints 0, a + b - c.

In this case, the input is 2 3 3.
a is 2, b is 3, and c is 3.
a is not greater than c, so the code checks if a + b is less than c.
a + b is 5, which is not less than c, so the code prints 0, a + b - c, which is 0, 5 - 3, which is 2.
