  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input n from the user.
It then initializes two lists, odd and even, with the values 3, 5, 7, ..., n+1.
The code then initializes a list, ans, with the values (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), ..., (1, n).
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to n+1 in steps of 2.
For each value i in this range, the code checks if i is even or odd.
If i is even, the code appends the values (3, i), (5, i), ..., (n+1, i) to the list ans.
If i is odd, the code appends the values (2, i), (4, i), ..., (n, i) to the list ans.
The code then enters another loop that iterates from n to 0 in steps of -1.
For each value i in this range, the code checks if i is divisible by 3.
If i is divisible by 3, the code continues to the next iteration.
If i is not divisible by 3, the code appends the values (2, i), (4, i), ..., (n, i) to the list ans.
The code then sorts the list ans and prints its length.
The code then prints the values in the list ans in the format (a - 1, b - 1), where a and b are the values in the list.
