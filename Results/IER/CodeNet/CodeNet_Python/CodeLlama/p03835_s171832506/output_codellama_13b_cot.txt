The variable K and variable S are initialized to 2 and 2, respectively.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the number of valid combinations.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to K (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 2.
For each number i in this range, it enters another loop that iterates from 0 to K (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 2.
For each number j in this range, it calculates the value of k as S-i-j.
The code checks if 0<=k<=K, which is true when k is between 0 and 2. If it is, it adds 1 to ans.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 6.
<<<Output>>>
6
