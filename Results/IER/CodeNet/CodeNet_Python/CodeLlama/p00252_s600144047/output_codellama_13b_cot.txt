<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes input in the form of three integers separated by spaces.
The variables a, b, and c are initialized to the values of the input.
The code then checks if the tuple (a, b, c) is equal to the tuple (1, 1, 0).
If it is, the code prints "Open".
If it is not, the code checks if the tuple (a, b, c) is equal to the tuple (0, 0, 1).
If it is, the code prints "Open".
If it is not, the code prints "Close".

In this case, the input is 0 0 1, so the code prints "Open".
<<<Output>>>
Open
