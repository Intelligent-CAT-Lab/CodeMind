  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input T from the user.
It then initializes four variables i, r, a, and k to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each character c in T.
For each character c, the code performs the following operations:
1. a is incremented by (i//2-k//2+(~k&1)*(len(T)-i))*(c=="1").
2. i is incremented by 1.
3. k is decremented by (~k&1)*(c=='0')-1.

The code then prints the final value of a.
