  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first initializes the variables M, m, f, g, h, i, A, B, a, b, j to their respective values.
M is initialized to 8^7, which is 16777216.
m is initialized to M*476+1, which is 16777216*476+1, which is 74380801.
f, g, and h are initialized to lists of 1s with length M.
i is initialized to 2.
The code then enters a while loop that iterates from 2 to M (exclusive).
For each iteration, the code calculates f[i], g[i], and h[i] using the previous values of f, g, and h.
The code also updates the values of a, b, and j.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of a, which is 1.
