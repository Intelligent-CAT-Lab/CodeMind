  <<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function check(num) that takes an integer num as input.
The function checks if num is greater than 1 and if it is, it iterates through the range of numbers from 2 to num-1.
For each number i in this range, it checks if num is divisible by i.
If num is divisible by any number in this range, the function returns False.
If num is not divisible by any number in this range, the function returns True.
The code then defines a variable a and assigns it the value of the input.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from a to 100500.
For each number i in this range, the code calls the check function with i as input.
If the check function returns True, the code prints i and breaks out of the loop.
If the check function returns False, the code continues to the next iteration of the loop.
