<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user and stores it in the variable C.
The code then initializes an empty list called al.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 97 to 122 (inclusive), which are the ASCII codes for the lowercase letters of the English alphabet.
For each iteration, the code appends the corresponding lowercase letter to the list al.
The code then finds the index of the input character C in the list al and stores it in the variable idx.
The code then prints the character at the index idx+1 in the list al.
<<<Output>>>
