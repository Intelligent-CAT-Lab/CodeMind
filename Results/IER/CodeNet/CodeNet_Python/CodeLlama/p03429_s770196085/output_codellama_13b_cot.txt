  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first maps the input to the variables N, M, A, and B.
The function solve is called with the variables N, M, A, and B as arguments.
The function solve first checks if the number of tiles is greater than the number of tiles that can be placed.
If it is, it returns False.
If not, it initializes the variable ans to a 2D list of dots.
It then initializes the variables remainA and remainB to the values of A and B, respectively.
It then enters a loop that iterates over the number of tiles that need to be placed.
For each tile, it checks if the tile is a 2x2 tile.
If it is, it places the tile and updates the variables remainA and remainB.
If not, it checks if the tile is a 1x2 tile.
If it is, it places the tile and updates the variables remainA and remainB.
If not, it checks if the tile is a 2x1 tile.
If it is, it places the tile and updates the variables remainA and remainB.
If not, it checks if the tile is a 1x1 tile.
If it is, it places the tile and updates the variables remainA and remainB.
After the loop finishes, the function checks if there are any tiles left to place.
If there are, it returns False.
If not, it returns the variable ans.
The function then checks if the variable ans is False.
If it is, it prints "NO".
If not, it prints "YES" and then prints the variable ans.
