<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input K from the user.
It then calculates the value of K // 2, which is the integer division of K by 2.
It then calculates the value of K % 2, which is the remainder of K divided by 2.
Finally, it calculates the value of (K // 2+ K % 2) * (K // 2), which is the product of the sum of K // 2 and K % 2, and K // 2.
The code then prints the final value.
<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will be 3 * 1 = 3.
