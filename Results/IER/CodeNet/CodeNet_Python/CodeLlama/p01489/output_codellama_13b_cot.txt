  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input k from the user.
It then initializes two variables l and r to 0 and k, respectively.
The code then enters a while loop that iterates until the difference between r and l is less than or equal to 1.
The loop calculates the midpoint m of the range [l, r] and checks if the product of m and its successor is less than or equal to k.
If it is, the code sets l to m and continues the loop.
If it is not, the code sets r to m and continues the loop.
The loop exits when the difference between r and l is less than or equal to 1.
The code then sets b to l, which is the number that satisfies the condition.
The code then calculates the difference between k and b times (b + 1) and stores it in ad.
The code then calculates the number of digits in ad and stores it in d.
The code then calculates the value of x and y based on the values of b, ad, and d.
The code then defines a function mul that multiplies two matrices modulo 1000000007.
The code then defines a function fib that calculates the nth Fibonacci number modulo 1000000007.
The code then calculates the product of the (x-1)th and (y-1)th Fibonacci numbers and stores it in ans.
The code then prints the value of ans.
