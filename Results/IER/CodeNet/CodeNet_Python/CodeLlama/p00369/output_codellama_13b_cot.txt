  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first defines two functions: sub and checkEqual.
The sub function takes two lists of integers as input, maxs and mins, and returns the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the lists.
The checkEqual function takes a string S as input and returns the minimum difference between the maximum and minimum values of all possible substrings of length k, where k ranges from 1 to the length of S.
The code then defines a function check12, which takes a string S as input and returns the difference between the maximum and minimum values of all possible substrings of length 2.
The code then takes a string S as input and prints the minimum of the differences returned by checkEqual and check12.

<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will depend on the input string S.
If S is "11121314", the output will be 1, which is the minimum difference between the maximum and minimum values of all possible substrings of length 2.
