  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input as a list of integers using the map function.
The list is then iterated over using a for loop.
For each element i in the list, the code checks if i is equal to the remainder of i divided by 2.
If the condition is met, the code increments the first element of the ans list by 1.
If the condition is not met, the code increments the second element of the ans list by 1.
The code then prints the minimum value of the ans list.
