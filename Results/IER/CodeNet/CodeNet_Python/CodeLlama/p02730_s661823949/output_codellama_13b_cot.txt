  <<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function check that takes a string s as input and returns True if the string is a palindrome, and False otherwise.
The function first checks if the length of the string is even or odd by dividing the length by 2. If the length is even, it checks if the first half of the string is the same as the second half. If the length is odd, it checks if the first half of the string is the same as the second half, except for the middle character.
The code then checks if the string is a palindrome by calling the check function with the input string.
The code then checks if the first half of the string is a palindrome by calling the check function with the first half of the input string.
The code then checks if the second half of the string is a palindrome by calling the check function with the second half of the input string.
If all three checks return True, the code prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
