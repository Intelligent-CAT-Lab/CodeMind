<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user and stores it in the variable s.
The variable cnt is initialized to a list of 26 zeros.
The code then iterates over each character in the input string s and increments the corresponding index in the cnt list.
The code then iterates over each index in the cnt list and checks if the value is odd. If it is, it increments the variable odd.
Finally, the code prints the value of odd divided by 2.
