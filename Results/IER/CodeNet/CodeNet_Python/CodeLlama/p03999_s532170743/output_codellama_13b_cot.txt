  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input string S = "125" and calculates its length I_MAX = 3.
The function calc is defined to take three arguments: val, add, and i.
The function first checks if i is equal to I_MAX, which is 3 in this case. If it is, it adds the value of add to val and appends the result to the list values.
If i is not equal to I_MAX, the function calls itself twice with different values of add and i.
The first call adds the value of add to val and passes the result to the next call with the same value of add and i+1.
The second call multiplies the value of add by 10 and adds the value of S[i] to it, then passes the result to the next call with the same value of i+1.
The function calc is called with the initial values of val = 0, add = int(S[0]) = 1, and i = 1.
The function then recursively calls itself with the following values:

* val = 0, add = 1, i = 2
* val = 1, add = 2, i = 3
* val = 1, add = 20, i = 3
* val = 11, add = 5, i = 4
* val = 11, add = 50, i = 4
* val = 111, add = 5, i = 5
* val = 111, add = 50, i = 5

The function then returns and the values in the list values are summed to produce the output.
