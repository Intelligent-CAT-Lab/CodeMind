  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first initializes the variables mod, size, f, and invf.
The function inv is defined, which calculates the modular multiplicative inverse of a number.
The function comb is defined, which calculates the binomial coefficient of two numbers.
The function init is defined, which initializes the values of f and invf.
The code then takes input from the user in the form of four integers n, a, b, and c.
The function init is called with the value of n, which initializes the values of f and invf.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n-1, meaning it will consider the values of k from 0 to n-1.
For each value of k, the code calculates the value of m using the formula (m+comb(n+k,n)*(pow(a,n,mod)*pow(b,k,mod)+pow(a,k,mod)*pow(b,n,mod))*inv(pow(100-c,n+k+1,mod)))%mod.
The code then prints the value of m multiplied by n and 100, modulo mod.
<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will depend on the input given.
For the input 1 25 25 50, the output will be 100.
