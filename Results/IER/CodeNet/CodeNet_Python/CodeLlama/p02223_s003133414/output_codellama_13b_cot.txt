  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the necessary modules, including sys, collections, and math.
The function getN() returns the integer value of the input, which is 2 in this case.
The function getList() returns a list of integers, which is not used in this case.
The main function is called, which first checks if n is equal to 1 or 2. If it is, it prints the corresponding output and returns.
If n is not equal to 1 or 2, it prints n-1, which is 1 in this case, and then prints "11".
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 1.
For each number i in this range, it prints "1" followed by i zeros and then "1".
The loop finishes and the code returns.
