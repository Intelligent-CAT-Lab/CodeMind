<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input n from the user and initializes two variables, ans and tmp, to 0 and 1, respectively.
The code then enters a while loop that iterates as long as tmp is less than or equal to n+1.
In each iteration, the code multiplies tmp by 2 and increments ans by 1.
The loop stops when tmp is greater than n+1, which happens when tmp is 5 (2^3) in this case.
The code then prints the final value of ans-1, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>
