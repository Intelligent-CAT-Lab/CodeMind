  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three inputs a, b, and k.
The code then enters a loop that iterates k times.
For each iteration, the code checks if the current iteration is even or odd.
If the current iteration is even, the code checks if a is odd. If it is, it subtracts 1 from a and divides it by 2. It then adds the result to b.
If the current iteration is odd, the code checks if b is odd. If it is, it subtracts 1 from b and divides it by 2. It then adds the result to a.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final values of a and b.
