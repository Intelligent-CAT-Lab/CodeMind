<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in three integers as input, separated by spaces.
The first integer is assigned to variable a, the second to variable b, and the third to variable c.
The code then checks if c is greater than or equal to a and less than or equal to b.
If the condition is met, the code prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
