<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, separated by a space.
The first integer is assigned to variable a, and the second integer is assigned to variable b.
The code then checks if a is less than b, greater than b, or equal to b.
If a is less than b, the code prints 'a < b'.
If a is greater than b, the code prints 'a > b'.
If a is equal to b, the code prints 'a == b'.
<<<Output>>>
a < b
