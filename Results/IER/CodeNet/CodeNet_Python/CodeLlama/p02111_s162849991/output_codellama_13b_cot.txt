<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input s from the user.
The code then calculates s // 30, which is the integer division of s by 30.
The code then calculates 2 * (s % 30), which is the result of multiplying 2 by the remainder of s divided by 30.
Finally, the code prints the result of these calculations.

Since the input is 0, the output will be 0 0.
<<<Output>>>
0 0
