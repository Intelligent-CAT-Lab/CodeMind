  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes in the input H, W, a, and b as integers.
The code then checks if H%a or W%b is true, which means that H and W are not divisible by a and b, respectively.
If this condition is true, the code prints "Yes" and then calculates the value of k as (H//a) * (W//b).
The code then initializes a 2D list ansss with dimensions H and W, and fills it with 0s.
The code then enters two nested loops that iterate over the rows and columns of ansss.
For each row and column, the code calculates the value of x as k+2 and assigns it to the corresponding element of ansss.
The code then prints the contents of ansss as a 2D list of strings, with each element separated by a space and each row separated by a newline character.
If the condition H%a or W%b is false, the code prints "No".
