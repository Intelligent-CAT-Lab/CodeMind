<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in three integers n, m, and k as input.
The variable ans is initialized to "No".
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n//2 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 1.
For each number i in this range, it enters another loop that iterates from 0 to m (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 2.
For each number j in this range, it calculates the value of o as i*j+(m-j)*(n-i).
The code checks if o or x (which is calculated as n*m-o) is equal to k. If it is, it sets ans to "Yes".
The loop finishes and the code prints the final value of ans, which is "No" because no value of o or x is equal to 2.
<<<Output>>>
No
