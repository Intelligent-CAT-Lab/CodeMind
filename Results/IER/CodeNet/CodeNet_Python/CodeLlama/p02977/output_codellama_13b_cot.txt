  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module and defines a few functions:

* mii: a lambda function that takes a string as input and returns a list of integers.
* get: a function that takes an integer n as input and returns a list of edges (i, j) that form a line graph with n vertices.

The code then reads an integer n from standard input and calls the get function with n as an argument. The get function returns a list of edges (i, j) that form a line graph with n vertices.

The code then checks if the list of edges is empty or not. If it is not empty, the code prints "Yes" and then prints each edge (i, j) in the list. If the list of edges is empty, the code prints "No".

<<<Output>>>
No
