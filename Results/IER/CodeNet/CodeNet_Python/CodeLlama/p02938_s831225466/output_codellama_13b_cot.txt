  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers L and R as input.
The code initializes a 64x2x2 matrix DP_ini with all elements set to 0.
The code then initializes a 64x2x2 matrix DP with all elements set to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 63 to 0 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 2^63 to 2^0.
For each number i in this range, it checks if L and R are within the range [2^i, 2^(i+1)].
If they are, it checks if L and R are both within the range [2^i, 2^(i+1)] or if one of them is within the range [2^i, 2^(i+1)] and the other is not.
If the condition is met, it sets the elements of DP to the values of DP_ini.
The code then enters another loop that iterates from the current number i-1 to 0 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 2^(i-1) to 2^0.
For each number keta in this range, it checks if L and R are both within the range [2^keta, 2^(keta+1)] or if one of them is within the range [2^keta, 2^(keta+1)] and the other is not.
If the condition is met, it updates the elements of DP based on the values of DP_ini.
The code then updates the value of ANS by summing the elements of DP.
The code then prints the final value of ANS modulo 10^9+7.
