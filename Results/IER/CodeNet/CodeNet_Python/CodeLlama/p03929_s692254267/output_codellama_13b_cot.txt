  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first initializes the variable mod to 11 and then takes input n and k from the user.
The code then calculates k as (k-8)%mod.
The code then calculates the last value of the loop as 7*n-7*2-2.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to last+1.
For each value of i, the code calculates 3*(i+i+1+i+2)%mod and checks if it is equal to k.
If it is, the code sets idx to i and breaks out of the loop.
The code then enters another loop that iterates from 1 to n+1.
For each value of i, the code calculates (7*i-1-idx)%11 and checks if it is equal to 0.
If it is, the code sets r2idx to 7*i-1 and breaks out of the loop.
The code then enters another loop that iterates from 1 to n+1.
For each value of i, the code calculates (7*i-idx)%11 and checks if it is equal to 0.
If it is, the code sets r1idx to 7*i and breaks out of the loop.
The code then checks if idx is equal to -1.
If it is, the code prints 0 and exits.
If r1idx is equal to -1, the code checks if r2idx is equal to -1.
If it is, the code prints (last-idx)/11+1.
If it is not, the code prints (last-idx)/11+1-(last-r2idx)/(n*11)-1.
If r2idx is not equal to -1, the code checks if r1idx is equal to -1.
If it is, the code prints (last-idx)/11+1-(last-r2idx)/(n*11)-1-(last-r1idx)/(n*11)-1.
If it is not, the code prints (last-idx)/11+1-(last-r2idx)/(n*11)-1-(last-r1idx)/(n*11)-1.
