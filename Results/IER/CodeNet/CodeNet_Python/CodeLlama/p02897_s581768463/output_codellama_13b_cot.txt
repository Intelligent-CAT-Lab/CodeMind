<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 4, which is an even number.
The code checks if n is even by checking if n%2 is equal to 0. Since n%2 is equal to 0, the code enters the first branch of the if statement.
In the first branch, the code calculates (n/2)/n, which is (4/2)/4, which is 0.5/4, which is 0.125.
The code then prints 0.125.
<<<Output>>>
0.125
