<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes input from the user in the form of a string, and then splits it into a list of strings using the space character as a delimiter.
The first element of the list is assigned to variable n[0], the second element is assigned to variable n[1], the third element is assigned to variable n[2], and the fourth element is assigned to variable n[3].
The code then calculates the product of the first two elements (n[0] and n[1]) and stores it in variable a1.
The code then calculates the product of the third and fourth elements (n[2] and n[3]) and stores it in variable a2.
The code then prints the maximum value of a1 and a2.
