  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the necessary libraries: sys, numpy, and math.
It then reads the input from stdin and splits it into two integers A and B.
The code then initializes a 2001x2001 matrix comb with all elements set to 0.
The code then initializes a 2001x2001 matrix S with all elements set to 1.
The code then initializes a variable x to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to A+1.
For each value of k in this range, the code calculates the value of x as follows:
x += comb[B-1,k] * (S[k,:A-k+1].sum() % MOD) % MOD
The code then prints the final value of x.
