  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input N from the user.
The function dfs takes a string argument num.
The function dfs checks if the number represented by num is greater than N. If it is, it returns 0.
The function then checks if num contains the digits 7, 5, and 3. If it does, it increments the variable cnt by 1.
The function then calls itself recursively with the argument num + i, where i is each of the digits 7, 5, and 3.
The function returns the value of cnt.
The code then calls the function dfs with the argument "0".
<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will depend on the value of N. If N is less than 753, the output will be 0. If N is greater than or equal to 753, the output will be 1.
