<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in three integers a, b, and c as input.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 100 (inclusive).
For each number n in this range, the code checks if (a*n) % b is equal to c.
If this condition is met, the code prints "YES" and exits the loop.
If the loop finishes without finding a match, the code prints "NO".

In this case, the input is 7, 5, and 1.
The code will iterate from 1 to 100 and check if (7*n) % 5 is equal to 1.
The first number that meets this condition is 7, so the code will print "YES" and exit the loop.
<<<Output>>>
YES
