<<<Analysis>>>
The code first converts the input string "725" to an integer using the int() function.
The code then checks if the integer is within the range of each if-elif statement.
The first if-elif statement checks if the integer is between 400 and 599, which is not the case.
The second if-elif statement checks if the integer is between 600 and 799, which is not the case.
The third if-elif statement checks if the integer is between 800 and 999, which is not the case.
The fourth if-elif statement checks if the integer is between 1000 and 1199, which is not the case.
The fifth if-elif statement checks if the integer is between 1200 and 1399, which is not the case.
The sixth if-elif statement checks if the integer is between 1400 and 1599, which is not the case.
The seventh if-elif statement checks if the integer is between 1600 and 1799, which is not the case.
The eighth if-elif statement checks if the integer is between 1800 and 1999, which is not the case.
Since none of the if-elif statements are true, the code does not print anything.
<<<Output>>>
