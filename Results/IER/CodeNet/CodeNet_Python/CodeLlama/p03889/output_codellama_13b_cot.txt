  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input string and stores it in a list called s.
The code then creates a new list called t, which is a copy of s but with the elements reversed.
The code then iterates through the elements of t and checks if each element is equal to "p", "q", "b", or "d".
If an element is equal to "p", the code replaces it with "q". If an element is equal to "q", the code replaces it with "p". If an element is equal to "b", the code replaces it with "d". If an element is equal to "d", the code replaces it with "b".
The code then checks if s and t are equal. If they are, the code sets ans to "Yes". If they are not, the code sets ans to "No".
The code then prints the value of ans.
<<<Output>>>
No
