  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string input from the user and stores it in the variable s.
The length of the string is stored in the variable n.
The code then enters two loops.
The first loop iterates from 0 to n-2 and checks if the ith character of the string is equal to the (i+1)th character. If it is, the code prints the indices of the two characters and exits.
The second loop iterates from 0 to n-3 and checks if the ith character of the string is equal to the (i+2)th character. If it is, the code prints the indices of the two characters and exits.
If neither of the loops finds a match, the code prints -1, -1.
<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will depend on the input string. If the input string is "needed", the output will be -1, -1.
