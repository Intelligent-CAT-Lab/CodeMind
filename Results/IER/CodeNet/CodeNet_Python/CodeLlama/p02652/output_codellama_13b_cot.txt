  <<<Analysis>>>
The input string is "0??"
The code first defines a dictionary d with keys '0', '1', and '?' and values (-1,), (1,), and (-1,1), respectively.
The code then defines a function judge that takes two integers target_lo and target_hi as input.
The function judge first initializes lo and hi to 0 and target_lo, respectively.
It then iterates over the characters in the input string S, and for each character c, it updates lo and hi using the values in the dictionary d.
The function judge returns True if hi-lo is greater than or equal to the target_lo-target_hi, and False otherwise.
The code then defines a function solve that takes a string S as input.
The function solve first converts the input string S to a tuple of integers using the dictionary d.
It then initializes the variables n0, n1, and n2 to the number of 0s, 1s, and ?s in the input string, respectively.
The function solve then initializes the variables lo and hi to -n0-n2 and n1+n2, respectively.
It then enters a loop that iterates until hi-lo is greater than or equal to the best value.
The loop first updates hi to the result of the bisect function with the arguments -1, hi, and a lambda function that calls the judge function with the arguments lo and hi.
It then updates lo to the result of the bisect function with the arguments 1, lo, and a lambda function that calls the judge function with the arguments lo and hi.
The loop then updates the variable best to the minimum of the current value of best and hi-lo.
The loop then breaks if hi-lo is greater than or equal to the best value.
The function solve then returns the value of best.
The code then defines a function naive that takes a string S as input.
The function naive first converts the input string S to a tuple of integers using the dictionary d.
It then returns the minimum of the maximum of the accumulated values of the tuple minus the minimum of the accumulated values of the tuple.
The code then defines a main function that takes no arguments.
The main function first takes a string S as input.
It then prints the result of the solve function with the input string S.
The main function then enters a loop that iterates 50 times.
The loop first generates a random string S with 15 0s, 15 1s, and 14 ?s.
The loop then shuffles the string S.
The loop then prints the input string S, the result of the naive function with the input string S, and the result of the solve function with the input string S.
