  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input n and initializes the variables A, C, G, T, M, and R.
The code then initializes a 4-dimensional list dp with n+1 rows, 4 columns, and 4 rows.
The code sets dp[0][T][T][T] to 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n+1, meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to n+1.
For each number i in this range, it iterates over the values of j, k, l, and m in R.
For each combination of j, k, l, and m, the code checks if any of the following conditions are met:

* Any of the values of t in ((A,G,C),(A,C,G),(G,A,C)) is equal to (k,l,m).
* (j,l,m) is equal to (A,G,C).
* (j,k,m) is equal to (A,G,C).

If any of these conditions are met, the code sets dp[i][k][l][m] to (dp[i][k][l][m] + dp[i-1][j][k][l]) mod M.
The code then prints the sum of the elements in dp[n] mod M.
