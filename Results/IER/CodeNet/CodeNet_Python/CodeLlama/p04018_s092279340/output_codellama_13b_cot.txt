  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module and reads the input from stdin.
The input is a string "aab".
The code then defines a function Z_Algorithm that takes a string S as input and returns an array arr where arr[i] is the length of the longest common prefix of S[i:] and S[i+1:].
The code then defines a function find_good_substr that takes a string W as input and returns an array is_good where is_good[i] is True if the substring W[i:i+n] is a good substring for some n, and False otherwise.
The code then defines a function solve that takes a string W as input and returns a tuple (x,y) where x is the number of good substrings in W and y is the number of good substrings in W[::-1].
The code then calls the solve function with the input string "aab" and assigns the result to x and y.
The code then prints x and y.
