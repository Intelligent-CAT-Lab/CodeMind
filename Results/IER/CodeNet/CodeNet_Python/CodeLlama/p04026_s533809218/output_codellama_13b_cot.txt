The code first imports various libraries and defines a function called graph() that takes no arguments and returns two values: n, g.
The function graph() defines a variable n and initializes it to the value of the input. It then defines a list g with n empty lists and iterates over the range of n. For each i in the range, it defines a variable a and initializes it to the value of the input. It then appends a to the list g[i] and appends i to the list g[a].
The function graph() returns the values of n and g.
The function main() defines a variable s and initializes it to the value of the input. It then defines a dictionary called dic and initializes it to the value of the input. It then defines a variable e and initializes it to the value of the input. It then defines a variable i and initializes it to the value of the input.
The function main() returns the values of s, dic, e, and i.
The function main() calls the function graph() and assigns the return values to the variables n and g.
The function main() checks the length of s and if it is equal to 2, it prints 1, 2 and returns.
The function main() checks the length of s and if it is equal to 2, it prints -1, -1 and returns.
