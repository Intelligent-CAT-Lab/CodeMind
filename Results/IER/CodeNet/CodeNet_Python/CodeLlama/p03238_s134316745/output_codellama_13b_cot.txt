The code first takes an integer input N from the user.
The code then checks if N is equal to 1. If it is, the code prints "Hello World".
If N is not equal to 1, the code takes two more integer inputs A and B from the user.
The code then calculates the sum of A and B and prints the result.
<<<Output>>>
