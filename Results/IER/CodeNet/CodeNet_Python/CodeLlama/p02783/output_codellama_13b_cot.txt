<<<Analysis>>>
The code imports the math module and defines two variables H and A.
The input is then read and split into two integers, which are assigned to H and A, respectively.
The code then uses the ceil function from the math module to calculate the ceiling of H/A.
The ceil function returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to the input.
In this case, the output would be 3.
