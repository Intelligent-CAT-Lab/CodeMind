<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user and stores it in the variable S.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each character in the string S.
For each character s in S, the code checks if the character s appears more than once in the string S.
If it does, the code prints 'no' and exits the program with a status code of 0.
If the character s does not appear more than once in the string S, the code continues to the next character.
If the loop completes without finding any duplicate characters, the code prints 'yes'.
<<<Output>>>
yes
