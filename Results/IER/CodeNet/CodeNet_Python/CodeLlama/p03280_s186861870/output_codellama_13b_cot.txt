<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, separated by a space.
The first integer is assigned to variable a, and the second integer is assigned to variable b.
The code then calculates the product of a and b, and prints the result.

In this case, the input is 2 2, so a = 2 and b = 2.
The product of a and b is 4, so the output of the code is 4.
<<<Output>>>
