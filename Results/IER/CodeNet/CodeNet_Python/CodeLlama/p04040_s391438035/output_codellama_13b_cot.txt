  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first initializes the variables H, W, A, and B to 2, 3, 1, and 1, respectively.
The code then checks if H - A > W - B, which is true in this case.
The code then swaps the values of H and W, and A and B.
The code then initializes ans1 to [1] and enters a loop that iterates from H - A - 1 times.
For each iteration, the code calculates the value of ans1 by multiplying the previous value by (H - A - 1 + B - i) and raising it to the power of (MOD - 2) modulo MOD.
The code then calculates c by multiplying the previous value of c by (W - B - 1 + A - i) and raising it to the power of (MOD - 2) modulo MOD.
The code then calculates ans by adding the value of c to the previous value of ans.
The code then enters another loop that iterates from W - H + A - B times.
For each iteration, the code calculates the value of c by multiplying the previous value of c by (H - 1 - i) and raising it to the power of (MOD - 2) modulo MOD.
The code then calculates ans by adding the value of c to the previous value of ans.
The code then prints the final value of ans.
