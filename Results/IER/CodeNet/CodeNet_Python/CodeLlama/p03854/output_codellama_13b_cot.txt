  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input string S from the user.
It then checks if the length of S is less than 5, and if it is, it prints 'NO' and exits the program.
If the length of S is greater than or equal to 5, it initializes a variable i to 0.
The code then enters a while loop that continues until the end of the string S is reached.
In each iteration of the loop, the code checks if the substring S[i:i+5] is equal to 'dream', 'erase', 'eraser', or 'dreamer'.
If it is, the code prints 'YES' and exits the program.
If the substring is not equal to any of these strings, the code checks if S[i:i+5] is equal to 'dream' and if i+8 is less than or equal to the length of S.
If it is, the code checks if S[i+5:i+8] is equal to 'erd' or 'ere', and if it is, it increments i by 7.
If it is not, the code checks if S[i+5:i+8] is equal to 'era' or 'd', and if it is, it increments i by 5.
If it is not, the code prints 'NO' and exits the program.
If S[i:i+5] is equal to 'erase' and i+7 is less than or equal to the length of S, the code checks if S[i+5:i+6] is equal to 'e' or 'd', and if it is, it increments i by 5.
If it is not, the code checks if S[i+5:i+6] is equal to 'r', and if it is, it increments i by 6.
If it is not, the code prints 'NO' and exits the program.
If none of the above conditions are met, the code prints 'NO' and exits the program.
