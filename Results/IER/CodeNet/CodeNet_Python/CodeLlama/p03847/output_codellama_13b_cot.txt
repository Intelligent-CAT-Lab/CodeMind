  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input N from the user.
It then initializes a dictionary memo with two key-value pairs: 0 and 1.
The function func is defined, which takes an integer N as input.
The function checks if N is already in memo. If it is, it returns the value of memo[N].
If N is not in memo, it calculates the result by calling itself with N/2, (N-1)/2, and N/2-1.
The result is then modulo 10^9+7 and stored in memo[N].
The function returns the value of memo[N].
The code then calls func with the input N and prints the result.
