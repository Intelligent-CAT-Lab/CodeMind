<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in three integers a, b, and c as input.
The code then checks if a is equal to the sum of b and c, or if a is equal to the sum of b and c, or if a is equal to the sum of b and c.
If none of these conditions are met, the code prints 'No'.

In this case, the input is 10, 30, and 20.
The sum of 10 and 30 is 40, which is not equal to 20.
The sum of 10 and 20 is 30, which is not equal to 30.
The sum of 30 and 20 is 50, which is not equal to 10.
Therefore, the code prints 'No'.
<<<Output>>>
No
