  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module and defines several functions, including input(), list2d(), list3d(), list4d(), ceil(), INT(), MAP(), LIST(), Yes(), No(), YES(), NO(), and ModTools.
The code then defines a class called ModTools, which is used to perform modular arithmetic operations. The class takes two arguments: MAX, which is the maximum value of the input, and MOD, which is the modulus.
The code then reads two integers N and K from standard input using the MAP() function, and initializes a ModTools object called mt with MAX = N + K + 1 and MOD = 10^9 + 7.
The code then calculates the number of combinations of N objects taken K at a time using the nCr() method of the ModTools class, and prints the result modulo MOD.
