  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the deque data structure from the collections module.
It then takes in a string input A and calculates its length N.
The code then initializes a 2D array edge with N+1 rows and 26 columns, where each element is initialized to N+1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from N-1 to 0 (inclusive), meaning it will consider the characters of the input string in reverse order.
For each character c in the input string, the code calculates the index of c in the alphabet (a = 0, b = 1, ..., z = 25) and stores it in c.
The code then updates the edge array by setting the value of edge[i][c] to i+1, where i is the index of the current character in the input string.
The code then checks if the value of recon[ni] is None, where ni is the value of edge[i][c]. If it is, the code sets recon[ni] to (i, c) and adds ni to the queue.
The code then enters a loop that iterates while the queue is not empty. It pops the first element from the queue and assigns it to i. If i is equal to N+1, the code breaks out of the loop.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from N+1 to 0 (inclusive). For each i, the code checks if recon[i] is not None. If it is, the code appends the character stored in recon[i] to the list ans.
The code then prints the list ans in reverse order.
