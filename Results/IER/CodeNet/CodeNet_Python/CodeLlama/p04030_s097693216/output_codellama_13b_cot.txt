<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input string S from the user.
It then initializes an empty string w.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each character c in S.
For each character c, it checks if it is equal to "B".
If it is, it checks if the length of w is greater than 0. If it is, it removes the last character from w.
If c is not equal to "B", it adds c to w.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of w.
