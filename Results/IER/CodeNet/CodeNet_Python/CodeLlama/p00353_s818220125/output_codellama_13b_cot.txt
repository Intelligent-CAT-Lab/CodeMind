<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input, separated by spaces.
The variables a, b, and c are initialized to the values of the input.
The code checks if c is less than or equal to a, and if it is, it prints "0".
If c is greater than a but less than or equal to a+b, it prints c-a.
If none of the above conditions are met, it prints "NA".

In this case, the input is 1000 3000 3000, so the values of a, b, and c are 1000, 3000, and 3000, respectively.
The condition c <= a is not met, so the code moves on to the next condition.
The condition c <= a+b is met, so the code prints c-a, which is 3000-1000 = 2000.

<<<Output>>>
2000
