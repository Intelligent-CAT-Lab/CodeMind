  The output of the code is:

C) Hello, Alice!

Explanation:
The function greet() takes a string as an argument and returns a string with the message "Hello, " followed by the name passed as an argument and an exclamation mark. In the code, the function greet() is called with the argument "Alice", and the returned string is printed to the console. Therefore, the output of the code is "Hello, Alice!".
