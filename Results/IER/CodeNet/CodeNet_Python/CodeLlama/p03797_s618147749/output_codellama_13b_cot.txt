<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user in the form of two integers n and m, separated by a space.
The variables n and m are then initialized to the values of the input.
The code then checks if n * 2 is greater than or equal to m.
If it is, the code prints m//2, which is the integer division of m by 2.
If n * 2 is less than m, the code calculates the difference between m and n * 2, which is stored in the variable amari.
The code then prints amari//4 + n, which is the integer division of amari by 4, plus n.
<<<Output>>>
2
