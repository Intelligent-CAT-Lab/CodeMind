  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module and defines the input function as sys.stdin.readline.
It then reads the input from the user and splits it into two integers, n and k, using the map function.
The code then defines a function called modinv, which is used to calculate the modular multiplicative inverse of a number.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n-1, meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 2.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the product of (x*y)%INF, where x and y are defined as follows:
x=n-1-i
y=n
The code then calculates the modular multiplicative inverse of i+1 using the modinv function.
It then updates the values of x and y using the formulae:
x=(x*a*b)%INF
y=(y*a*b)%INF
where a=n-1-i and b=modinv(i+1,INF).
The code then calculates the sum of the first k+1 elements of the array p using the formula:
ans=(ans+p[i])%INF
The code then prints the final value of ans.
