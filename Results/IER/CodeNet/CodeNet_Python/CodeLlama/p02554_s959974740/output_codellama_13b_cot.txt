  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input n and initializes variables ans, sub, and sub2 to 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates n times.
For each iteration, the code multiplies ans by 10, takes the modulo of (10**9+7) and stores the result in ans.
The code also multiplies sub by 9 and takes the modulo of (10**9+7) and stores the result in sub.
The code also multiplies sub2 by 8 and takes the modulo of (10**9+7) and stores the result in sub2.
The code then subtracts 2*sub and sub2 from ans and stores the result in ans.
The code then prints the final value of ans modulo (10**9+7).
<<<Output>>>
