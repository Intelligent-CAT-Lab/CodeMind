<<<Analysis>>>
The variables L, R, and d are initialized to 5, 10, and 2, respectively.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from L to R (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 5 to 10.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is divisible by d (2). If it is, it increments the variable cnt by 1.
The condition is met when i is 6, 8, and 10.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of cnt, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>
