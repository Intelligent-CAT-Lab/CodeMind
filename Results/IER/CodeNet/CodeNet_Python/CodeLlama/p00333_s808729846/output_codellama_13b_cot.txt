<<<Analysis>>>
The code imports the math module, which provides a function for calculating the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two numbers.
The code then reads in three integers from the input, w, h, and c, using the map function to convert the input string to a list of integers.
The code calculates the size of the rectangle by taking the gcd of w and h.
The code then calculates the cost of the rectangle by dividing the area of the rectangle by the size and multiplying by the cost per unit area.
The code then prints the cost.
<<<Output>>>
