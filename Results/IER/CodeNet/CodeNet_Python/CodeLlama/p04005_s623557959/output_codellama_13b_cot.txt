  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module and uses it to read input from the standard input stream.
It then maps the input to three variables A, B, and C using the map function.
The code then checks if any of the variables A, B, or C are even. If any of them are, it prints 0.
If none of them are, it calculates the products AB, BC, and CA and prints the minimum of these three values.
