<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in four integers as input, h, w, s, and t.
The first line of the code checks if h * w is odd or even. If it is odd, the code enters the second if statement.
The second if statement checks if s + t is odd or even. If it is odd, the code prints "No". Otherwise, it prints "Yes".
If h * w is even, the code prints "Yes" regardless of the value of s + t.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
