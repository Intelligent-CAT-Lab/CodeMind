  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input N from the user.
The function carmichael(x) is defined to calculate the Carmichael number of x.
The function solve(x, c) is defined to calculate the order of N modulo the Carmichael number of N.
The function lcm(m, n) is defined to calculate the least common multiple of m and n.
The function gcd(m, n) is defined to calculate the greatest common divisor of m and n.
The function carmichael(x) calculates the Carmichael number of x by finding the smallest integer r such that N**r is congruent to 1 modulo c.
The function solve(x, c) calculates the order of N modulo the Carmichael number of N by finding the smallest integer k such that N**k is congruent to 1 modulo c.
The function lcm(m, n) calculates the least common multiple of m and n by finding the smallest integer r such that m*r and n*r are both divisible by m and n, respectively.
The function gcd(m, n) calculates the greatest common divisor of m and n by finding the largest integer r such that m and n are both divisible by r.
The code then calculates the Carmichael number of N and the order of N modulo the Carmichael number of N.
If the order of N modulo the Carmichael number of N is not 1, the code prints -1.
If the order of N modulo the Carmichael number of N is 1, the code prints the order of N modulo the Carmichael number of N.
