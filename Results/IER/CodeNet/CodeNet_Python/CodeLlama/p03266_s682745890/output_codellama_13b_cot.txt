<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input N and K as integers from the user.
It then initializes a variable ans to 0.
The code then calculates a = int(N/K) and stores it in a.
The code then calculates ans = a**3 and stores it in ans.
The code then checks if K is even by checking if K%2==0.
If K is even, the code calculates b = int((N+int(K/2))/K) and stores it in b.
The code then calculates ans += b**3 and stores it in ans.
Finally, the code prints the value of ans.
