  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first prompts the user to input a number n.
The variable root is initialized to the square root of n plus 1.
The variable isPrime is initialized to a list of n+3 elements, with all elements set to True.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 4 to n+3 in steps of 2, and sets the corresponding elements of isPrime to False.
The variable ans is initialized to 0.
The variable prePrime is initialized to -1.
The code then enters another loop that iterates from 3 to n+3 in steps of 2.
If the current element of isPrime is True, the code checks if the current element is equal to prePrime plus 2. If it is, the code adds 2 to ans.
The variable prePrime is set to the current element.
If the current element is greater than root, the code continues to the next iteration.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from the square of the current element to n+3 in steps of the current element.
The code sets the corresponding elements of isPrime to False.
The code then prints the final value of ans.
