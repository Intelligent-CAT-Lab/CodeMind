<<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the math module, which is not used in the code.
The code then reads two integers from the input, a and b, and stores them in variables a and b, respectively.
The code then initializes a variable av to the value of a, and a variable n to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates while num is less than b.
In each iteration, the code increments n by 1, and adds av-1 to num.
The loop stops when num is greater than or equal to b.
The code then prints the value of n.

The input given is 4 and 10.
The code will first initialize n to 0 and num to 1.
In the first iteration, n will be incremented by 1, and num will be set to 4.
In the second iteration, n will be incremented by 1 again, and num will be set to 8.
In the third iteration, n will be incremented by 1 again, and num will be set to 12.
In the fourth iteration, n will be incremented by 1 again, and num will be set to 16.
Since 16 is greater than or equal to 10, the loop will stop.
The code will then print the value of n, which is 4.

<<<Output>>>
4
