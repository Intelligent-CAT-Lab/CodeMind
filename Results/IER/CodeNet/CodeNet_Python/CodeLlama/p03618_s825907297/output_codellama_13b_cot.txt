  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input string and converts it into a list of characters using the list() function.
The length of the list is calculated and stored in the variable count.
The code then initializes an empty dictionary called dic.
The code enters a loop that iterates over the list of characters.
For each character, it checks if it is already present in the dictionary.
If it is not present, it adds the character as a key in the dictionary and its index as a value.
If it is already present, it appends the index of the character to the list of values associated with the key.
The code then enters another loop that iterates over the values of the dictionary.
For each list of indices, it calculates the number of pairs of indices that can be formed by selecting two indices from the list.
The number of pairs is calculated using the formula (n*(n-1))/2, where n is the length of the list.
The code then subtracts the number of pairs from the variable count.
The code then prints the final value of count.
