  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input from the user and assigns it to the variables N, A, and B.
The function solve() is then called, which checks if the condition A + B - 1 <= N and N <= A * B is met.
If the condition is met, the function returns a list of numbers that meet the condition.
If the condition is not met, the function returns -1.
The code then joins the list of numbers into a string and prints it.

<<<Output>>>
[3, 2, 1]
