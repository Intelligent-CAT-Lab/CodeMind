<<<Analysis>>>
The variables A and B are initialized to 4 and 6, respectively.
The code first checks if B is divisible by A with no remainder. Since 6 is not divisible by 4 with no remainder, the code does not print -1 and does not exit.
The variable _k is calculated using the ceiling division of B by A, which results in -(-6//4) = 2 because -(-6//4) is the same as -(1) = 2.
The code then enters a loop starting from _k (which is 2) and will go up to _k + 10^7 (which is a very large number and ensures that the loop will run until the condition is met).
Inside the loop, the code calculates bn and rem by dividing k*A by B. For the first iteration, k is 2, so k*A is 8. Dividing 8 by 6 gives bn = 1 and rem = 2.
Then, it calculates an and rem by dividing the previous rem by A. Since rem is 2 and A is 4, an is 0 and rem remains 2.
The variable n is calculated as the sum of bn, an, and rem, which is 1 + 0 + 2 = 3.
The code checks if n is greater than k. Since n (3) is greater than k (2), the condition is met.
The code prints k*A, which is 2*4 = 8, and exits.
