<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized to 11.
The code then enters a nested loop, with the outer loop iterating 25 times (i from 0 to 24) and the inner loop iterating 20 times (j from 0 to 19).
For each combination of i and j, the code checks if the equation 4*i + 7*j equals N.
If a combination is found that satisfies the equation, the code prints 'Yes' and exits the loop.
If no such combination is found after all iterations, the code prints 'No'.
In this case, there is no combination of i and j that satisfies the equation 4*i + 7*j == 11, because 11 cannot be expressed as a sum of multiples of 4 and 7.
Therefore, the output will be 'No'.
<<<Output>>>
No
