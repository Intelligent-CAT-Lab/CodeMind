<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a and b are initialized to 1 and 2, respectively.
The code checks if a is greater than b, which is not the case here (1 is not greater than 2).
Since a is not greater than b, the code executes the else block.
The else block calculates the volume of a sphere with radius b using the formula (4/3 * pi * b^3).
The value of b is 2, so the calculation is 4/3 * pi * 2^3.
The result of the calculation is 4/3 * pi * 8, which simplifies to 32/3 * pi.
The code then prints this result.
