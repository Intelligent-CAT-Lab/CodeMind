<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a and b are initialized to 2 and 2, respectively.
The variable ans is initialized to -1, which will be used to store the answer if a suitable tax value is found.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 1000 (inclusive), representing possible tax values.
For each tax value, the code calculates 8% of the tax (as an integer) and checks if it equals a (which is 2).
It also calculates 10% of the tax (as an integer) and checks if it equals b (which is 2).
If both conditions are met, ans is set to the current tax value, and the loop breaks.
The code finds that when tax is 25, int(tax * 0.08) equals 2 and int(tax * 0.1) equals 2, satisfying both conditions.
Therefore, ans is set to 25, and the loop breaks.
After the loop, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 25.
<<<Output>>>
25
