<<<Analysis>>>
The input string "5 8" is split into two parts "5" and "8" using the split function with a space as the delimiter.
The split parts are then assigned to variables a and b respectively.
The variables a and b are converted from strings to integers using the int function.
The code then prints the sum of a and b, which is 5 + 8.
