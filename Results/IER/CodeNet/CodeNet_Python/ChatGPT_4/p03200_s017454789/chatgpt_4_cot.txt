<<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized to the string "BBW".
Variables a and b are both initialized to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each character x in the string s.

1. For the first character 'B':
   - a remains 0 because x=="W" is False, so a += b*(x=="W") does nothing.
   - b becomes 1 because x=="B" is True, so b += x=="B" increments b by 1.

2. For the second character 'B':
   - a remains 0 because x=="W" is False.
   - b becomes 2 because x=="B" is True, so b is incremented by 1 again.

3. For the third character 'W':
   - a becomes 2 because x=="W" is True, and b is 2, so a += b*(x=="W") adds 2 to a.
   - b remains 2 because x=="B" is False.

After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of a, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
