<<<Analysis>>>
The code is designed to calculate the coordinates of two additional points (x3, y3) and (x4, y4) to form a rectangle given the coordinates of two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) that form one of its sides.

1. The input coordinates are read and assigned to x1, y1, x2, y2. For the given input, these are 0, 0, 0, 1 respectively.
2. Two complex numbers 'a' and 'b' are created from these coordinates, representing the points (0, 0) and (0, 1).
3. The length of the side formed by 'a' and 'b' is calculated using the absolute value of their difference. Since 'a' and 'b' differ only by their imaginary part (1 unit), the length is 1.
4. The code then calculates the coordinates of point 'c' by rotating point 'a' 90 degrees counterclockwise around point 'b'. This is done by subtracting 'a' from 'b', multiplying by a complex number representing a 90-degree rotation (cos(-pi/2), sin(-pi/2)), and then adding 'b' back.
5. The real and imaginary parts of 'c' are rounded and converted to integers to get the coordinates x3 and y3. Since the rotation of (0, 0) around (0, 1) by 90 degrees counterclockwise will result in (-1, 1), the coordinates (x3, y3) will be (-1, 1).
6. Similarly, the code calculates the coordinates of point 'd' by rotating point 'b' 90 degrees clockwise around point 'a'. This is done by subtracting 'b' from 'a', multiplying by a complex number representing a 90-degree rotation (cos(pi/2), sin(pi/2)), and then adding 'a' back.
7. The real and imaginary parts of 'd' are rounded and converted to integers to get the coordinates x4 and y4. Since the rotation of (0, 1) around (0, 0) by 90 degrees clockwise will result in (1, 0), the coordinates (x4, y4) will be (1, 0).
8. Finally, the code prints the coordinates of points 'c' and 'd', which are (-1, 1) and (1, 0) respectively.
