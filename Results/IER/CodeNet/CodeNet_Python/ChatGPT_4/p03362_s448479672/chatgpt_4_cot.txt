<<<Analysis>>>
The code is designed to enumerate prime numbers that are congruent to 1 modulo 5, up to a limit of 55555. It uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to find these prime numbers.

1. The variable M is set to 55555, and m is set to the integer square root of M plus 1.
2. A list S of length M+1 is created, initialized with zeros. This list will be used to mark non-prime numbers.
3. The Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm is applied: for each number i from 2 to m (inclusive), the code marks all multiples of i as non-prime by setting the corresponding index in S to 1.
4. The variable N is set to the input value, which is 5 in this case.
5. The variable cnt is initialized to 0, which will count the number of primes found that satisfy the condition.
6. The code then iterates over the range from 2 to M+1. For each number i, it checks if S[i] is 0 (indicating a prime number) and if i is congruent to 1 modulo 5.
7. If both conditions are met, the code prints the number i followed by a space, and increments cnt by 1.
8. Once cnt reaches the value of N (which is 5), the code will quit, meaning it will stop executing.

The output will be the first 5 prime numbers that are congruent to 1 modulo 5.

Let's find the first 5 such prime numbers:
- The first prime number congruent to 1 modulo 5 is 11.
- The second is 31.
- The third is 41.
- The fourth is 61.
- The fifth is 71.

After finding and printing these 5 numbers, the code will quit.
