<<<Analysis>>>
The variables n and m are initialized to 2 and 2, respectively.
The code checks if either n or m is equal to 1. Since neither is equal to 1, it skips the if block and goes to the else block.
In the else block, it calculates (n - 2) * (m - 2), which is (2 - 2) * (2 - 2) = 0 * 0 = 0.
The code then prints the result of this calculation.
