<<<Analysis>>>
The input is `3`, which is assigned to the variable `n`.
The variable `root` is calculated as the integer square root of `n` plus 1, which is `2` in this case.
An array `isPrime` is created with `n + 3` elements, all initialized to `True`. This array will be used to mark non-prime numbers as `False`.
A loop is run to mark all even numbers (starting from 4) as `False` in the `isPrime` array, since they are not prime (except for 2).
The variable `ans` is initialized to `0`, which will be used to accumulate the sum of twin primes.
The variable `prePrime` is initialized to `-1`, which will be used to store the previous prime number found.
Another loop is run starting from 3 to `n + 3` with a step of 2 (to consider only odd numbers, as even numbers cannot be prime except for 2).
Inside this loop, if the current number `i` is marked as prime in the `isPrime` array, the code checks if the previous prime number `prePrime` plus 2 equals the current number `i`. If it does, it means `i` and `prePrime` are twin primes, and `ans` is incremented by 2.
The current number `i` is then set as the new `prePrime`.
If `i` is greater than `root`, the loop continues without marking the multiples of `i` as non-prime, because it's unnecessary for numbers greater than the square root of `n`.
For numbers not greater than `root`, the inner loop marks all multiples of `i` as non-prime in the `isPrime` array.
Finally, the code prints the value of `ans`.
Since `n` is 3, there are no twin primes (pairs of primes that are exactly two numbers apart) less than or equal to 3. Therefore, `ans` remains `0`.
