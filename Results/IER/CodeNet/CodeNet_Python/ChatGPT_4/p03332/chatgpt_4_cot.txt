The input variables N, A, B, and K are initialized to 4, 1, 2, and 5, respectively.

The function `getInv(N)` is defined to calculate the modular multiplicative inverse of numbers from 1 to N (inclusive) under the modulus MOD (998244353). It initializes an array `inv` of size N+1 with zeros and sets `inv[1]` to 1 twice (which seems to be a redundant line of code). Then, it calculates the inverse for each number from 2 to N using the formula provided and stores it in the `inv` array.

The function `getCmb(N)` is defined to calculate the binomial coefficients (nCr) for r ranging from 0 to N (inclusive). It first gets the inverses by calling `getInv(N)`. It initializes an array `nCr` of size N+1 with zeros and sets `nCr[0]` to 1 twice (which is also redundant). Then, it calculates the binomial coefficients using the formula provided and the precomputed inverses, storing the results in the `nCr` array.

The function `solve(N, A, B, K)` is defined to calculate the number of ways to choose a and b such that A * a + B * b equals K, where a and b are non-negative integers not greater than N. It initializes `ans` to 0 and gets the binomial coefficients by calling `getCmb(N)`. Then, it iterates over all possible values of a from 0 to N, calculates the corresponding b, and checks if the equation A * a + B * b equals K and b is within the valid range. If the conditions are met, it adds the product of the binomial coefficients of a and b to `ans`, taking the modulus MOD.

Finally, the main part of the code reads the input, calls the `solve` function with the input values, and prints the result.

Let's calculate the output step by step:
- `getInv(4)` will calculate the inverses for 1 to 4.
- `getCmb(4)` will calculate the binomial coefficients for 0 to 4.
- `solve(4, 1, 2, 5)` will iterate over a from 0 to 4 and calculate the corresponding b. The valid pairs (a, b) that satisfy the equation are (1, 2) and (3, 1).
- For (a, b) = (1, 2), nCr[a] * nCr[b] = nCr[1] * nCr[2].
- For (a, b) = (3, 1), nCr[a] * nCr[b] = nCr[3] * nCr[1].
- The sum of these products modulo MOD will be the final answer.

Now, let's calculate the binomial coefficients:
- nCr[0] = 1
- nCr[1] = 4 (since 4 * inv[1] % MOD = 4)
- nCr[2] = 6 (since 4 * 3 * inv[2] % MOD = 6)
- nCr[3] = 4 (since 6 * 2 * inv[3] % MOD = 4)
- nCr[4] = 1 (since 4 * 1 * inv[4] % MOD = 1)

Now, let's calculate the answer:
- For (a, b) = (1, 2), the product is 4 * 6 % MOD = 24.
- For (a, b) = (3, 1), the product is 4 * 4 % MOD = 16.
- The sum is 24 + 16 = 40.

Therefore, the final answer is 40 % MOD = 40, since 40 is less than MOD.
