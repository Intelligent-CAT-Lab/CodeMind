<<<Analysis>>>
The variables H and R are initialized to -3 and 3, respectively.
The first if condition checks if H is greater than or equal to 0, which is not true in this case since H is -3.
The code then moves to the elif condition, which checks if H is less than 0. This condition is true.
Inside this elif block, there is another if condition that checks if H + R is greater than 0. Since H is -3 and R is 3, H + R equals 0.
The next elif checks if H + R equals 0, which is true.
Therefore, the code will print 0 as the output.
