<<<Analysis>>>
The variables A, B, C, and D are initialized to 3, 8, 7, and 1, respectively.
The code then checks the sum of A and B against the sum of C and D.
The sum of A and B is 3 + 8 = 11.
The sum of C and D is 7 + 1 = 8.
Since 11 is greater than 8, the condition A+B < C+D is false.
The code then checks if A+B is equal to C+D, which is also false since 11 is not equal to 8.
Finally, the code executes the else block because both the if and elif conditions were false.
The else block prints "Left" because A+B is greater than C+D.
<<<Output>>>
Left
