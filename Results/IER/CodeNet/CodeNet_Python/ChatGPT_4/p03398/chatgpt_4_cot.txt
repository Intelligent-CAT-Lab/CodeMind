<<<Analysis>>>
The code is trying to print an element from a predefined list based on the index provided by the input. The list is:
[0,1,2,12,84,770,8340,106400,1546888,25343766,461133960,232367169,627905865,632459808,928262728,919805769,382796331,887217496,639768068,869694124,205875097,205589953,487772376,239955313,998339621,31622834,902930073,146839084,449786840,982224660,865803735,21834818,721531716,26008837,471774471,69010090,700009308,776938882,645550477,526939604,142728157,654489641,128201240,185493259,789721045,977049419,589149550,700648836,25087729,874433491,352791804]

The input provided is `3`, which means the code will attempt to access the element at index 3 of the list.

Indexing in Python starts from 0, so the element at index 3 is the fourth element in the list, which is `12`.

Therefore, the expected output is `12`.
