<<<Analysis>>>
The variable K is initialized to 2.
The code checks if K is less than or equal to 500, which it is.
Since K is less than or equal to 500, the code prints the value of K, which is 2.
Then, it enters a loop that iterates from 1 to K (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 2.
For each number i in this range, it prints the string representation of i followed by a space, repeated K times. This will result in two lines, each with the number 1 or 2 repeated twice.
The else block is not executed because the condition K <= 500 is true.
