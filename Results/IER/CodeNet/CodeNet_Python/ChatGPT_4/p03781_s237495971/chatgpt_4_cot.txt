<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function `cal(n)` which calculates the sum of the first `n` natural numbers using the formula `n*(n+1)//2`.

The variable `x` is initialized to 6, which is the input value.
The variable `ans` is initialized to a list `[1, cal(x)]`, which is `[1, 21]` because `cal(6)` equals `6*(6+1)//2` which is `21`.

The variable `a` is initialized to 0 and is used as a counter for the while loop.

The while loop starts and will continue indefinitely until a break statement is executed.

Inside the loop, `a` is incremented by 1 each time.

The variable `tmp` is assigned the value of `cal(sum(ans)//2)`. Initially, `sum(ans)//2` is `11` because `(1+21)//2` is `11`. So `tmp` is `cal(11)` which is `66`.

Since `tmp` is greater than `x` (66 > 6), the second element of `ans` is updated to `sum(ans)//2`, which is `11`.

The loop continues, and now `sum(ans)//2` is `6` because `(1+11)//2` is `6`. So `tmp` is `cal(6)` which is `21`.

Since `tmp` is greater than `x` (21 > 6), the second element of `ans` is updated to `sum(ans)//2`, which is `6`.

The loop continues, and now `sum(ans)//2` is `3` because `(1+6)//2` is `3`. So `tmp` is `cal(3)` which is `6`.

Since `tmp` is equal to `x` (6 == 6), the condition `tmp == x` is met, and the loop breaks after printing `sum(ans)//2`, which is `3`.

Therefore, the output of the code is `3`.
