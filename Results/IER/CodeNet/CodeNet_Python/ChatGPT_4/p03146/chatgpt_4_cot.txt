<<<Analysis>>>
The variable `s` is initialized to 8.
The function `solve()` is called.
Inside `solve()`, variable `m` is initialized to 1, `pre` is set to `s` (which is 8), and a set `st` is created with `s` as its initial element.
The code enters an infinite loop.
On the first iteration, `m` is incremented to 2.
Since `pre` (8) is even, `tmp` is set to `pre / 2`, which is 4.
`tmp` (4) is not in `st`, so it is added to `st`.
On the second iteration, `m` is incremented to 3.
`pre` is now 4, which is even, so `tmp` is set to `pre / 2`, which is 2.
`tmp` (2) is not in `st`, so it is added to `st`.
On the third iteration, `m` is incremented to 4.
`pre` is now 2, which is even, so `tmp` is set to `pre / 2`, which is 1.
`tmp` (1) is not in `st`, so it is added to `st`.
On the fourth iteration, `m` is incremented to 5.
`pre` is now 1, which is odd, so `tmp` is set to `3 * pre + 1`, which is 4.
`tmp` (4) is in `st`, so the loop ends and `m` (which is 5) is printed.
