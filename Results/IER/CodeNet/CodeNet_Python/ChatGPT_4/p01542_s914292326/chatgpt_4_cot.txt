<<<Analysis>>>
The input string `s` is "000".
The string is split by '.', but since there is no '.' in the input, the list `s` will contain just one element ["000"].
The variable `mx` is initialized to -1, which will be used to keep track of the maximum value.
The `product` function from the `itertools` module is used to generate all possible combinations of '01+-*()', but since the length of `s` is 1, `repeat` is set to 0, meaning no combinations will be generated, and the loop will not execute.
Since the loop does not execute, `mx` remains -1.
The final value of `mx` is printed, which is -1.

<<<Output>>>
-1
