<<<Analysis>>>
The input string '2019/04/30' is assigned to the variable s.
The year is extracted from the string by slicing the first four characters and converting them to an integer, resulting in the value 2019.
The month is extracted by slicing characters at index 5 and 6 and converting them to an integer, resulting in the value 4.
The date is extracted by slicing characters at index 8 and 9 and converting them to an integer, resulting in the value 30.
The code then checks if the year is less than or equal to 2019, which is true.
Since the year is 2019, it checks if the month is less than or equal to 4, which is also true.
Because both conditions are met, the code prints 'Heisei'.
<<<Output>>>
Heisei
