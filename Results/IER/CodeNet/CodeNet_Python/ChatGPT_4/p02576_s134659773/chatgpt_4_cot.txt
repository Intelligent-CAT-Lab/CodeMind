<<<Analysis>>>
The variables n, x, and t are initialized to 20, 12, and 6, respectively.
The code uses the math.ceil function to calculate the smallest integer greater than or equal to n/x, which is the smallest integer greater than or equal to 20/12.
20 divided by 12 is 1.666..., and the smallest integer greater than this is 2.
The result of math.ceil(n/x) is then multiplied by t, which is 6.
So, the final calculation is 2 * 6, which equals 12.
The code then prints this result.
<<<Output>>>
12
