<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a main function that includes a nested function `make_prime_nums(n)` to enumerate prime numbers up to a given number `n`. The main function is then called at the end of the script.

The `make_prime_nums` function initializes a list `prime_nums` with 2 if `n` is greater than or equal to 2. It then iterates from 3 to `n` (inclusive) to find all prime numbers within that range. For each number `i`, it checks divisibility by all previously found prime numbers that are less than or equal to the square root of `i`. If `i` is not divisible by any of these, it is considered a prime number and added to the `prime_nums` list.

In the main function, `n` is read from the input, which is `5` in this case. The `make_prime_nums` function is called with `2000` as an argument to generate a list of prime numbers up to 2000.

The variable `ans` is initialized as an empty list. The code then iterates over the list of prime numbers `p`. For each prime number `pi`, it checks if the last digit is `1`. If so, it appends `pi` to the `ans` list. This process continues until the length of `ans` is equal to `n`, which is `5`.

The output is the first `n` prime numbers whose last digit is `1`, separated by spaces.

Given the input `5`, the code will output the first 5 prime numbers less than or equal to 2000 whose last digit is `1`.

The first few prime numbers whose last digit is `1` are 11, 31, 41, 61, 71, so these should be the output.
