The variable s is initialized to the string 'aabbaa'.
The variable t is initialized to an empty string, which will be used to accumulate characters.
The variable k is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of distinct substrings.
The variable prev is initialized to an empty string, which will be used to store the previous distinct substring.

The code then enters a loop that iterates over each character in the string s.

1. In the first iteration, i = 0, s[i] = 'a'. t becomes 'a'. Since prev is not equal to t, k is incremented to 1, prev is set to 'a', and t is reset to ''.
2. In the second iteration, i = 1, s[i] = 'a'. t becomes 'a'. Since prev is equal to t, nothing happens.
3. In the third iteration, i = 2, s[i] = 'b'. t becomes 'b'. Since prev is not equal to t, k is incremented to 2, prev is set to 'b', and t is reset to ''.
4. In the fourth iteration, i = 3, s[i] = 'b'. t becomes 'b'. Since prev is equal to t, nothing happens.
5. In the fifth iteration, i = 4, s[i] = 'a'. t becomes 'a'. Since prev is not equal to t, k is incremented to 3, prev is set to 'a', and t is reset to ''.
6. In the sixth iteration, i = 5, s[i] = 'a'. t becomes 'a'. Since prev is equal to t, nothing happens.

After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of k, which is 3, representing the number of distinct substrings 'a', 'b', and 'a' again.
