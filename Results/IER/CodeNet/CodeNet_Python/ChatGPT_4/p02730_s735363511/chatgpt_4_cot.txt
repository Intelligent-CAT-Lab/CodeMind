<<<Analysis>>>
The input string `s` is initialized to 'akasaka'.
The variable `n` is initialized to the length of `s`, which is 7.

The code then creates a reversed version of `s` called `r_s`. After reversing 'akasaka', `r_s` is also 'akasaka'.

The code checks if `s` is not equal to `r_s`. Since they are equal (both 'akasaka'), the code does not print 'No' and does not exit.

Next, the code initializes an empty string `top` and populates it with the first half of `s` excluding the middle character, which is 'aka'.

The code then creates a reversed version of `top` called `r_top`. After reversing 'aka', `r_top` is also 'aka'.

The code checks if `top` is not equal to `r_top`. Since they are equal (both 'aka'), the code does not print 'No' and does not exit.

Next, the code initializes an empty string `last` and populates it with the second half of `s` starting from the character after the middle character, which is 'saka'.

The code then creates a reversed version of `last` called `r_last`. After reversing 'saka', `r_last` is also 'saka'.

The code checks if `last` is not equal to `r_last`. Since they are equal (both 'saka'), the code does not print 'No' and does not exit.

Since all checks have passed, the code prints 'Yes'.
