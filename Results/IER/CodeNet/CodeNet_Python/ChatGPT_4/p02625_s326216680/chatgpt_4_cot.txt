The input `2 2` initializes N and M to 2.

The `solve` function is called with these values. Inside `solve`, the `factorials_with_inv` function is called to compute the factorials and their modular inverses up to the maximum of N and M, which is 2 in this case.

The `factorials_with_inv` function computes the factorials and their inverses modulo `MOD = 10**9+7`. The factorials array `fac` will be `[1, 1, 2]` and the inverses array `inv` will be `[1, 1, 500000004]` after the function execution.

Back in the `solve` function, a loop runs from 0 to N (inclusive), which means it will run for k = 0 and k = 1.

For k = 0:
- `t` is calculated as `fac[M-k]*inv[k]*inv[N-k]` which is `fac[2]*inv[0]*inv[2]` which is `2*1*500000004` which is `1000000008` modulo `MOD` which is `1`.
- Since `sign` is `True`, `res` is incremented by `t`, so `res` becomes `1`.
- `sign` is toggled to `False`.

For k = 1:
- `t` is calculated as `fac[M-k]*inv[k]*inv[N-k]` which is `fac[1]*inv[1]*inv[1]` which is `1*1*1` which is `1`.
- Since `sign` is now `False`, `res` is decremented by `t`, so `res` becomes `0`.
- `sign` is toggled to `True`.

After the loop, `res` is multiplied by `fac[N]*fac[M]*inv[M-N]**2` which is `1*2*1` which is `2`.

Finally, `res` is taken modulo `MOD` which leaves it unchanged as `2`.

Therefore, the output of the function `solve` for the input `2 2` is `2`.

The `naive` function is not called in the main block, so we can ignore it.

The final output of the program is the result of the `solve` function, which is `2`.
