<<<Analysis>>>
The variable S is initialized to the string "needed".
The code first checks if the length of S is 2. If it is, it checks if the first and second characters are the same. If they are, it prints "1 2", otherwise it prints "-1 -1" and exits. Since the length of "needed" is not 2, this block is skipped.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from the start of the string to the third-to-last character (since it's checking slices of length 3).
For each index i, it creates a slice of the string from index i to i+2 (inclusive), which is a substring of length 3, and converts it to a list s.
It then checks if the number of unique characters in s (using set(s)) is less than or equal to 2.
If this condition is met, it prints the starting index (i+1) and the ending index (i+3) of the substring and breaks the loop.
If the loop completes without finding such a substring, it prints "-1 -1".
For the input "needed", the loop will check the following substrings: "nee", "eed", "ede", "ded". The substring "eed" at indices 2 to 4 has only 2 unique characters ('e' and 'd'), so it meets the condition.
Therefore, the output will be the starting and ending indices of this substring, which are 2 and 4.
