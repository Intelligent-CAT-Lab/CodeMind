<<<Analysis>>>
The input string "3 1 4" is split into a list of strings ['3', '1', '4'] using the split() method.
This list is then converted into a set, which removes any duplicate elements. However, since there are no duplicates in the list, the set will be the same as the list: {'3', '1', '4'}.
The len() function is then used to determine the number of elements in the set, which is 3.
The code prints the length of the set, which is the number of unique elements in the input.
<<<Output>>>
3
