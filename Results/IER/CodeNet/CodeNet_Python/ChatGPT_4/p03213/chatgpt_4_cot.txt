The variable n is initialized to 9.
The list cnt is initialized with 101 elements, all set to 1. This list will be used to count the number of times each number from 2 to 100 can be factored into prime factors.

The code then enters a nested loop where i ranges from 2 to n (inclusive) and j ranges from 2 to n (inclusive). For each pair (i, j), the inner loop divides i by j as long as i is divisible by j, and each time this division occurs, cnt[j] is incremented by 1. This effectively counts the prime factors of each number from 2 to 9.

After the nested loops, the code initializes five variables (san, go, jugo, nijugo, shitigo) to 0. These variables will count the number of times a prime factor appears at least 3, 5, 15, 25, and 75 times, respectively.

The code then iterates over the range 2 to 100, updating the counts for san, go, jugo, nijugo, and shitigo based on the values in cnt.

Finally, the code prints the sum of the following:
- shitigo (the number of prime factors that appear at least 75 times)
- nijugo*(san-1) (the number of prime factors that appear at least 25 times, multiplied by the number of prime factors that appear at least 3 times minus one)
- jugo*(go-1) (the number of prime factors that appear at least 15 times, multiplied by the number of prime factors that appear at least 5 times minus one)
- go*(go-1)//2*(san-2) (the number of prime factors that appear at least 5 times, multiplied by the number of prime factors that appear at least 5 times minus one, divided by 2, and then multiplied by the number of prime factors that appear at least 3 times minus two)

For n=9, the prime factorization counts will be as follows:
- 2 appears as a factor in 2, 4, 6, 8 (4 times)
- 3 appears as a factor in 3, 6, 9 (4 times)
- 4, 5, 7, and 8 appear as factors only in their own numbers (1 time each)
- 9 appears as a factor in 9 (1 time)

Therefore, san will be incremented for 2 and 3 (since they appear at least 3 times), and go will not be incremented (since no prime factor appears at least 5 times). The other counts (jugo, nijugo, shitigo) will remain 0.

The final print statement will evaluate to:
0 + 0*(2-1) + 0*(0-1) + 0*(0-1)//2*(2-2) = 0
