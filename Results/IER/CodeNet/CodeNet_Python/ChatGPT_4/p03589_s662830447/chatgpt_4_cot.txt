<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized to 2.
The code then enters a nested loop where the outer loop variable n iterates from 1 to 2*N+1 (which is 5 in this case), and the inner loop variable w iterates from 1 to N+1 (which is 3 in this case).
For each combination of n and w, the code tries to calculate the value of h using the formula h = w*n*N // (4*w*n-(n+w)*N). If the denominator of this formula is zero, a ZeroDivisionError would occur, and the code would continue to the next iteration of the loop without executing the rest of the block.
If h is calculated successfully, the code checks if h is greater than 0 and if h*(4*w*n-(n+w)*N) - w*n*N equals 0. If both conditions are true, it prints h, n, and w, and then exits the program immediately using sys.exit().
The first combination of n and w that satisfies the condition is when n=1 and w=1. The calculation of h would be h = 1*1*2 // (4*1*1-(1+1)*2) = 2 // (4-4) which would raise a ZeroDivisionError, so the code continues to the next iteration.
The next combination that does not raise an exception is when n=2 and w=1. The calculation of h would be h = 1*2*2 // (4*1*2-(2+1)*2) = 4 // (8-6) = 4 // 2 = 2. Since h is greater than 0, we check the second condition: 2*(4*1*2-(2+1)*2) - 1*2*2 = 2*(8-6) - 4 = 2*2 - 4 = 4 - 4 = 0. Both conditions are satisfied, so the code prints h, n, and w, which are 2, 2, and 1, respectively, and then exits.
