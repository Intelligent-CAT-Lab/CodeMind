<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized to 20.
The code calculates the cost of N items, each costing 800, which is 800*20 = 16000.
Then it calculates a discount for every set of 15 items. Since 20 divided by 15 is 1 with a remainder (20//15 equals 1), there is a discount for one set of 15 items, which is 200*1 = 200.
The total discount is subtracted from the total cost, resulting in 16000 - 200 = 15800.
The code then prints the final amount after the discount, which is 15800.
<<<Output>>>
15800
