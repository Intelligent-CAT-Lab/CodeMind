<<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized to the string "aba".
The variable n is initialized to the length of s, which is 3.
The code checks if the first and last characters of s are the same. Since s[0] is 'a' and s[-1] is also 'a', the condition is true.
Because the condition is true, 1 is added to n, changing its value from 3 to 4.
The code then prints "First" if n is odd, and "Second" if n is even. Since n is now 4, which is even, it will print "Second".
<<<Output>>>
Second
