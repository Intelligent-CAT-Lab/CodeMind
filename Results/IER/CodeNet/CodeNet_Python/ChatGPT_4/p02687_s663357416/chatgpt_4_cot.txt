<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines several functions for reading different types of input, but only the readChar() function is used in this snippet.
The variable s is assigned the value returned by readChar(), which reads a string from the input.
The input provided is 'ABC'.
The code then checks if the value of s is equal to the string "ABC".
Since s is indeed "ABC", the condition is true, and the code prints "ARC".
If s were any other value, the code would print "ABC".
<<<Output>>>
ARC
