<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a, s, d, and f are initialized to 0, 0, 0, and 1, respectively.
The code calculates x3 as d - f + s, which is 0 - 1 + 0 = -1.
The code calculates y3 as f + d - a, which is 1 + 0 - 0 = 1.
The code calculates x4 as a - f + s, which is 0 - 1 + 0 = -1.
The code calculates y4 as s + d - a, which is 0 + 0 - 0 = 0.
The code then prints the values of x3, y3, x4, and y4 in that order.
<<<Output>>>
-1 1 -1 0
