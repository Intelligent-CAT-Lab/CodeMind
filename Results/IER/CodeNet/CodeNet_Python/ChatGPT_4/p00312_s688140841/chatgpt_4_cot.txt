<<<Analysis>>>
The variables D and L are initialized to 10 and 5, respectively.
The variable ans is calculated as the integer division of D by L plus the remainder of D divided by L.
The integer division of 10 by 5 is 2.
The remainder of 10 divided by 5 is 0.
Therefore, ans is 2 + 0, which equals 2.
The code then prints the value of ans.
<<<Output>>>
2
