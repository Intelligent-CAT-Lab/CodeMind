<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function `solve()` that calculates a certain mathematical expression involving combinations and factorials, modulo `10**9 + 7`. The input `6 4 0` initializes N, M, and K to 6, 4, and 0, respectively.

The variable `L` is calculated as `N + M + 2*K`, which is `6 + 4 + 2*0 = 10`.

Two lists, `fact` and `rfact`, are initialized to have `L+1` elements, all set to 1. These lists will store factorial and reverse factorial values modulo `MOD`.

The loop calculates the factorial of each number from 1 to `L` and stores it in `fact`. The reverse factorial is calculated using the modular inverse of the factorial, and stored in `rfact`.

The function `C(n, k)` calculates the combination of `n` choose `k` using the precomputed factorials and reverse factorials.

The function `F(n, k)` calculates a modified factorial expression used in the final answer.

The variable `ans` is initialized to 0. A loop runs for `a` from 0 to `K` (inclusive), but since `K` is 0, it will only run once with `a = 0`. Inside the loop, `b` is calculated as `K - a`, which is also 0.

The expression inside the loop calculates a value using the `C` and `F` functions and adds it to `ans`. Since `a` and `b` are both 0, the expression simplifies to `C(N + M, N) * F(N, 0) * F(M, 0)`.

After the loop, `ans` is taken modulo `MOD` and written to the standard output.

Given that `N = 6`, `M = 4`, and `K = 0`, the calculation inside the loop will be:
`C(10, 6) * F(6, 0) * F(4, 0)`

`C(10, 6)` is the combination of 10 choose 6, which is `10! / (6! * 4!)`.
`F(6, 0)` is `fact[6] * (6 - 0 + 1) * (rfact[0] * rfact[6 + 1])`, which simplifies to `7 * fact[6] * rfact[7]`.
`F(4, 0)` is `fact[4] * (4 - 0 + 1) * (rfact[0] * rfact[4 + 1])`, which simplifies to `5 * fact[4] * rfact[5]`.

The final answer is the product of these values modulo `MOD`.

The output will be the value of `ans` after the calculation.
