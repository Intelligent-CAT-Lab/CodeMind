<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines two dictionaries, `encode` and `decode`, which are used to encode and decode characters to and from a binary-like string representation.

The `while True` loop is designed to read input until an EOFError occurs, which signals the end of input. Since we have a single line of input, the loop will process this line and then break due to the EOFError.

The input string is `?D-C'KOPUA?`.

The first for loop iterates over each character in the input string and uses the `encode` dictionary to convert each character to its encoded binary-like string. The encoded string is concatenated to `code0`.

The second for loop iterates over each character in `code0` and builds a temporary string `temp`. If `temp` matches a key in the `decode` dictionary, the corresponding decoded character is added to `code`, and `temp` is reset to an empty string.

The final decoded message is printed.

Let's go through the encoding and decoding process step by step:

1. The input string `?D-C'KOPUA?` is encoded as follows:
   - `?` -> "11111"
   - `D` -> "00011"
   - `-` -> "11101"
   - `C` -> "00010"
   - `'` -> "11110"
   - `K` -> "01010"
   - `O` -> "01110"
   - `P` -> "01111"
   - `U` -> "10100"
   - `A` -> "00000"
   - `?` -> "11111"
   The concatenated encoded string is "1111100011111010001011110010101001110011111010000000011111".

2. The decoding process will then match the encoded string with keys in the `decode` dictionary:
   - "11111" -> `?`
   - "00011" -> `D`
   - "11101" -> `-`
   - "00010" -> `C`
   - "11110" -> `'`
   - "01010" -> `K`
   - "01110" -> `O`
   - "01111" -> `P`
   - "10100" -> `U`
   - "00000" -> `A`
   - "11111" -> `?`
   The decoded string is `?D-C'KOPUA?`.

3. The decoded string is printed as the output.
