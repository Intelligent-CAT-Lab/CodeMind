<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a, b, and x are initialized to 3, 5, and 4, respectively.
The code checks if x is greater than or equal to a and less than or equal to the sum of a and b.
In this case, since 3 <= 4 and 3+5 >= 4, the condition is true.
Therefore, the code will print 'YES'.
<<<Output>>>
YES
