<<<Analysis>>>
The variables X and Y are initialized to 2 and 1, respectively.
The code checks the absolute difference between X and Y using the expression abs(X - Y).
Since X is 2 and Y is 1, the absolute difference is abs(2 - 1), which equals 1.
The condition abs(X - Y) <= 1 is true because 1 is less than or equal to 1.
Since the condition is true, the code prints 'Brown'.
<<<Output>>>
Brown
