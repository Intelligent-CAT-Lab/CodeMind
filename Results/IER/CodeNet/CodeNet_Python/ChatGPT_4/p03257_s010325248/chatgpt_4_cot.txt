<<<Analysis>>>
The input is `2`, which is assigned to the variable N.

The code first checks if N is equal to 2. If it is, it prints two lines "4 7" and "23 10" and then exits the program using sys.exit(). Since N is indeed 2, the rest of the code is not executed.

Therefore, the output will be the two lines printed before the sys.exit() call.

<<<Output>>>
4 7
23 10
