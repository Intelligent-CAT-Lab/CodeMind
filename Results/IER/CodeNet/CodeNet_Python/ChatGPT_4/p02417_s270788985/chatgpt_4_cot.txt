<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads lines from the standard input (stdin) and counts the occurrences of each letter in the input, regardless of case (it converts all letters to lowercase before counting).

1. The `cnt` dictionary is initialized to store the counts of each letter.
2. The code reads the input line by line. In this case, the input is a single line: "This is a pen."
3. For each character `c` in the line, it converts the character to lowercase by using the bitwise OR operation with `0x20`. This is a trick to convert uppercase letters to lowercase assuming ASCII encoding.
4. It then checks if the character `d` is a lowercase letter (between 'a' and 'z').
5. If it is, it increments the count for that letter in the `cnt` dictionary. If the letter is not already in the dictionary, it uses the `get` method to return 0 and then adds 1.
6. After processing the input, the code iterates over the range from 'a' to 'z' and prints the count for each letter. If a letter does not appear in the input, it prints 0 for that letter.

For the given input "This is a pen.", the counts would be:
- 't': 1
- 'h': 1
- 'i': 2
- 's': 2
- 'a': 1
- 'p': 1
- 'e': 1
- 'n': 1

All other letters would have a count of 0.
