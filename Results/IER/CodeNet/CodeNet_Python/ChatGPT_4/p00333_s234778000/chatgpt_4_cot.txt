<<<Analysis>>>
The variables w, h, and c are initialized to 10, 20, and 5, respectively.
The code calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of w and h using math.gcd(w, h), which is math.gcd(10, 20) = 10.
It then calculates the square of the gcd, which is 10^2 = 100.
The area of the rectangle is calculated by w * h, which is 10 * 20 = 200.
The code then divides the area by the square of the gcd and multiplies by c, which is (200 / 100) * 5 = 2 * 5 = 10.
Finally, the result is converted to an integer and printed out. Since the result is already an integer, the int conversion does not change the value.
<<<Output>>>
10
