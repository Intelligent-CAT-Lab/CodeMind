<<<Analysis>>>
The variables N and K are initialized to 3 and 2, respectively.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the answer.
The variable a is calculated as the integer division of N by K, which is int(3/2) = 1.
ans is updated by adding a^3, which is 1^3 = 1.
The code then checks if K is even by K%2==0, which is true since 2%2 equals 0.
Since K is even, it calculates b as the integer division of (N + K/2) by K, which is int((3 + 2/2)/2) = int((3 + 1)/2) = int(4/2) = 2.
ans is updated by adding b^3, which is 2^3 = 8.
The final value of ans is now 1 + 8 = 9.
The code prints the final value of ans.
<<<Output>>>
