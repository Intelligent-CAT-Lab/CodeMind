<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 3.
The code calculates the sum of the first n natural numbers using the formula (n + 1) * n / 2.
For n = 3, the calculation is (3 + 1) * 3 / 2, which simplifies to 4 * 3 / 2.
This further simplifies to 12 / 2, which equals 6.
The result is then converted to an integer (although it is already an integer) and printed.
<<<Output>>>
6
