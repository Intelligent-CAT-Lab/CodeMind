<<<Analysis>>>
The variables A, B, and C are initialized to 50, 100, and 120, respectively.
The code checks if the sum of A and B is less than C.
In this case, A + B equals 150, which is not less than C (120).
Since the condition A + B < C is false, the code will execute the else block.
The else block contains a print statement that outputs "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
