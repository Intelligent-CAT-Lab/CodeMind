<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a, b, and c are initialized to 1, 3, and 8, respectively, from the input.
The if statement checks if a is less than b and b is less than c.
Since 1 < 3 < 8 is true, the condition of the if statement is satisfied.
Therefore, the code will execute the print statement under the if block.
The output will be "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
