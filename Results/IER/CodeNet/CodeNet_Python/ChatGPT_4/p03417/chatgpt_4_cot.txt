<<<Analysis>>>
The variables N and M are initialized to 2 and 2, respectively.
The first if condition checks if the maximum of N and M is 1, which is not the case here, so it is skipped.
The second elif condition checks if the minimum of N and M is 1, which is also not the case here, so it is skipped as well.
The code then executes the else block, which calculates (N-2)*(M-2). Since both N and M are 2, the calculation is (2-2)*(2-2) which equals 0*0.
Therefore, the output of the code will be 0.
<<<Output>>>
