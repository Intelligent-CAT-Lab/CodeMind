<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines several functions and variables, but the main execution starts after the `if __name__ == "__main__":` check. The variable R is read from standard input and converted to an integer. The input provided is `1199`.

The code then checks the value of R against three conditions:
1. If R is greater than or equal to 0 and less than 1200, it prints "ABC".
2. If R is greater than or equal to 1200 and less than 2800, it prints "ARC".
3. If R is greater than or equal to 2800, it prints "AGC".

Since the input value is 1199, it satisfies the first condition (0 <= R < 1200). Therefore, the code will print "ABC".
<<<Output>>>
ABC
