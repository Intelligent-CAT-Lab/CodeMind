<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines several functions for different types of input, but only `getNM()` is used in this snippet. The `input()` function is redefined to read from `sys.stdin` and strip the trailing newline, which is a common pattern in competitive programming to speed up input operations.

The `getNM()` function is called, which expects two space-separated integers from the standard input. The input provided is `1 1`, so `N` is set to 1 and `M` is set to 1.

The variable `total` is calculated as `1900 * M + 100 * (N - M)`. With `N` and `M` both being 1, the calculation is `1900 * 1 + 100 * (1 - 1)`, which simplifies to `1900`.

The final output is `total * (2 ** M)`, which is `1900 * (2 ** 1)`. This simplifies to `1900 * 2`, which equals `3800`.

Therefore, the output of the code will be `3800`.
