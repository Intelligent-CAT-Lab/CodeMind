<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a and b are initialized with the values 5 and 10, respectively, from the input.
The code then evaluates the expression `a <= b`, which checks if a is less than or equal to b.
Since 5 is indeed less than or equal to 10, the expression evaluates to True.
The `int()` function is then used to convert the boolean result True to an integer.
In Python, the integer value of True is 1.
Therefore, the code prints the integer value corresponding to the boolean result of the comparison, which is 1.
