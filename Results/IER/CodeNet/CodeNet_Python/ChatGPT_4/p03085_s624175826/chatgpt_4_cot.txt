<<<Analysis>>>
The variable b is initialized with the input, which is 'A'.
The code then checks the value of b using a series of if-elif statements.
Since b is 'A', the first condition is met, and the code prints 'T'.
No other conditions are checked after the first match, so the code execution is complete after printing 'T'.
<<<Output>>>
T
