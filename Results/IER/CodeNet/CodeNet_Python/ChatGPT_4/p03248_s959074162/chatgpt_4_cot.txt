<<<Analysis>>>
The input string S is '1111', and its length N is 4.
The string S is then modified by adding '0' at the beginning, resulting in S = '01111'.
The code checks if the first character after the added '0' is '0', if the last character is '1', and if the string S is not equal to its reverse. If any of these conditions are true, it prints -1 and exits. In this case, none of these conditions are met because:
- S[1] is '1', not '0'.
- S[N] is '1'.
- S is equal to its reverse ('01111' == '11110') after adding '0' at the beginning.

Since the conditions for printing -1 are not met, the code proceeds to construct edges.
It initializes an empty list called edges and a variable base with the value 1.
The code then enters a loop from 1 to N (not including N), which means it will iterate from 1 to 3.
For each iteration, it appends a tuple (base, i+1) to the edges list.
If the character at position i in S is '1', it updates the base to i + 1.

The loop iterations will be as follows:
- i = 1: edges.append((1, 2)), S[1] is '1', so base becomes 2.
- i = 2: edges.append((2, 3)), S[2] is '1', so base becomes 3.
- i = 3: edges.append((3, 4)), S[3] is '1', so base becomes 4.

After the loop, the edges list contains [(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4)].
Finally, the code prints each edge in the edges list on a separate line.

1 2
2 3
