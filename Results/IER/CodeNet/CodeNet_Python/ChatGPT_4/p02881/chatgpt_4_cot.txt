The variable n is initialized to 10.
The function ij(x) is defined to find two factors of n, i and j, such that i * j = n and i is the largest possible factor less than or equal to x.
The function is called with the argument int(sqrt(n)), which is the integer part of the square root of n. For n = 10, sqrt(n) is approximately 3.16, so int(sqrt(n)) is 3.
The function ij(3) starts with i = 3 and checks if 10 divided by 3 is an integer division. Since it is not (10/3 is approximately 3.33), it decrements i to 2.
With i = 2, 10 divided by 2 is an integer division (10/2 is exactly 5), so the function returns the tuple (2, 5).
The sum of the returned tuple (2, 5) is 7.
The final print statement prints the sum minus 2, which is 7 - 2 = 5.
