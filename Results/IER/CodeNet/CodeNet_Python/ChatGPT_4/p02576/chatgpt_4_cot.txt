<<<Analysis>>>
The variables N, X, and T are initialized to 20, 12, and 6, respectively.
The code checks if N is not divisible by X using the modulo operator. Since 20 % 12 is 8, which is not equal to 0, the condition is true.
Since the condition is true, the code executes the first print statement.
It calculates the integer division of N by X, which is 20 // 12, resulting in 1.
It then multiplies this result by T, which is 1 * 6, resulting in 6.
Finally, it adds T to this result, which is 6 + 6, resulting in 12.
The code prints the final result, which is 12.
<<<Output>>>
12
