<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string and applies the `upper()` method to it. The `upper()` method converts all lowercase letters in the string to uppercase. The input string is "this is a pen.".
After applying the `upper()` method, the string becomes "THIS IS A PEN.".
The code then prints the resulting uppercase string.
<<<Output>>>
THIS IS A PEN.
