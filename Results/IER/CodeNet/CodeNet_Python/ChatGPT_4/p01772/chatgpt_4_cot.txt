<<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized with the string "AIZUNYANPEROPERO".
The variable ans is initialized as an empty string, which will be used to accumulate the result.
The variable flag is initialized as False, which will be used to track whether an 'A' has been found without a subsequent 'Z'.

The code then enters a loop that iterates over each character c in the string s.

1. When c is 'A' and flag is not True, flag is set to True.
2. When c is 'Z' and flag is True, "AZ" is appended to ans and flag is set to False.

The loop processes the characters in the string as follows:
- 'A' sets flag to True.
- 'I' does nothing because flag is True but the character is not 'Z'.
- 'Z' appends "AZ" to ans and sets flag to False.
- The rest of the characters do nothing because they are neither 'A' nor 'Z'.

After the loop, the code checks if ans is still an empty string. If it is, it prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the value of ans.

In this case, ans is not empty because "AZ" was appended to it, so the code will print the value of ans, which is "AZ".

<<<Output>>>
AZ
