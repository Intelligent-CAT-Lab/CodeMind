<<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized with the string "CODEFESTIVAL".
The variable f is initialized to 0, which will be used as a flag to indicate whether the letter "C" has been found.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the length of the string s.
During the iteration, the code checks if the current character is "C" and if the flag f is 0. If both conditions are true, it increments f by 1.
After finding "C", the code continues to iterate through the string looking for the character "F".
When it finds "F" and the flag f is 1 (meaning "C" has been found before), it prints "Yes" and exits the loop and the program.
In the given string "CODEFESTIVAL", "C" is found at the first position, so f becomes 1. Then, as the loop continues, it finds "F" at the fifth position. Since f is 1, it prints "Yes" and exits.
If the loop completes without finding "F" after "C", it would print "No", but in this case, it finds both in the correct order.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
