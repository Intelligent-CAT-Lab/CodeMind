<<<Analysis>>>
The variables K, A, and B are initialized to 4000, 2000, and 500, respectively.
The first condition checks if K is less than or equal to A. Since K (4000) is greater than A (2000), this condition is false, so we move to the next condition.
The second condition checks if A is less than or equal to B. Since A (2000) is greater than B (500), this condition is also false, so we move to the else block.
In the else block, we calculate the value of x using the formula (K-B-1)/(A-B)+1. Plugging in the values, we get (4000-500-1)/(2000-500)+1 = (3499)/(1500)+1 = 2.33266666667 + 1 = 3.33266666667. Since we are using integer division, the decimal part is discarded, and we get x = 3.
Finally, we print 2*x-1, which is 2*3-1 = 6-1 = 5.
