<<<Analysis>>>
The code imports the numpy library and then reads a line of input, which is expected to be a sequence of integers separated by spaces.
The input `1 6 3` is converted into a list of integers [1, 6, 3].
This list is then sorted, resulting in the numpy array A with the elements [1, 3, 6].
The expression `A[1:]` creates a new array that contains all elements of A except the first one, which is [3, 6].
The expression `A[:-1]` creates another array that contains all elements of A except the last one, which is [1, 3].
The subtraction `A[1:] - A[:-1]` computes the difference between each pair of consecutive elements, resulting in the array [2, 3].
Finally, the sum of the elements in this array is computed with `.sum()`, which results in 2 + 3 = 5.
The code prints the result of this sum, which is 5.
<<<Output>>>
5
