<<<Analysis>>>
The code is a one-liner that reads an integer input, assigns it to the variable n, and then uses a chained conditional expression to print a string based on the value of n.
The conditional expression checks:
- If n is less than 1200, it prints "ABC".
- If n is not less than 1200 but less than 2800, it prints "ARC".
- If n is not less than 2800, it prints "AGC".
Given the input 1199, the first condition (n < 1200) is true, so the code will print "ABC".
<<<Output>>>
ABC
