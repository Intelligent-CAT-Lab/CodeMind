<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers H and W, which are initialized to 4 and 5, respectively.
It then checks if either H or W is equal to 1. If this condition is true, it prints 1 and exits the program. Since neither H nor W is 1, the program continues.
The variable ans is calculated as the integer division of (H*W+1) by 2. This is equivalent to rounding up the result of (H*W)/2, which is the formula for the number of squares that can be used in a chessboard-like pattern on a grid of size HxW.
For H=4 and W=5, the calculation is (4*5+1) // 2, which is (20+1) // 2, which is 21 // 2, which equals 10.
The result, 10, is then printed.
<<<Output>>>
10
