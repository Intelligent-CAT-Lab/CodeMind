<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 4.
The variable m is calculated as 2 raised to the power of n, which is 2^4 = 16.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to m-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 15.
For each number i in this range, it initializes a list temp with n zeros.
The variable j is set to the current value of i, and count is initialized to 0.
The code enters a while loop that continues as long as j is greater than 0.
Inside the while loop, if j modulo 2 equals 1, it sets the corresponding index in temp to 1. This is essentially converting the number i to its binary representation.
After the while loop, the code initializes an empty list temp2.
It then iterates over the range of n, and if the value at index k in temp is 1, it appends k to temp2.
Finally, the code prints the current value of i, followed by a colon. If i is not 0, it prints the elements of temp2 separated by spaces.
The output will be the numbers from 0 to 15 followed by a colon, and for numbers other than 0, it will print the indices of the bits that are set to 1 in their binary representation.
