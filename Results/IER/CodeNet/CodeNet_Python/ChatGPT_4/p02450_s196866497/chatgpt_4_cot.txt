<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 2.
The permutations function from the itertools module is used to generate all possible permutations of the list [1, 2].
The permutations function returns an iterator that will produce tuples of all permutations of the given list.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each permutation tuple in the iterator.
For each tuple, it joins the elements of the tuple into a string with spaces between them and prints the resulting string.
Since n is 2, there are only two permutations: (1, 2) and (2, 1).
The code will print each permutation on a separate line.
<<<Output>>>
1 2
2 1
