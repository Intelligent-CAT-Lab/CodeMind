<<<Analysis>>>
The variables N and K are initialized to 3 and 2, respectively.
The code checks if N is even by using the condition N%2 == 0. Since 3 is not even, the condition is False, and the code proceeds to the else block.
In the else block, the code checks if N//2 + 1 is greater than or equal to K. Since N is 3, N//2 is 1 (integer division), and adding 1 gives us 2, which is equal to K.
Since 2 is equal to K, the condition N//2 + 1 >= K is True.
Therefore, the code will print "YES".
<<<Output>>>
YES
