The variable S is initialized to the string 'C0DEFESTIVAL2O16'.
The variable A is initialized to the string 'CODEFESTIVAL2016'.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of characters that differ between S and A.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the indices of the strings S and A.
For each index i, the code compares the character at position i in S with the character at position i in A.
If the characters are different, ans is incremented by 1.
The differences occur at the following positions:
- Position 1: '0' in S vs 'O' in A
- Position 14: 'O' in S vs '0' in A
There are 2 differences in total.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 2.
