<<<Analysis>>>
The input string "SENW" is converted into a list of characters.
The variable ans is initialized to "Yes".
A Counter object c is created from the list, which will count the occurrences of each character in the list.
The code checks if the product of the counts of "N" and "S" is zero. Since both "N" and "S" appear once, their product is 1, so the condition is false and the code does not change the value of ans.
The code then checks if the product of the counts of "W" and "E" is zero. Since both "W" and "E" appear once, their product is 1, so the condition is false and the code does not change the value of ans.
Since the value of ans was not changed, it remains "Yes".
The code prints the value of ans.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
