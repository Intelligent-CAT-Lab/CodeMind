<<<Analysis>>>
The variables d, t, and s are initialized to 1000, 15, and 80, respectively.
The code checks if the division of d by t is less than or equal to s.
The division of d by t (1000/15) is approximately 66.67.
Since 66.67 is less than s (80), the condition is true.
Therefore, the code will print 'Yes'.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
