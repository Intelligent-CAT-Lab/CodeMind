The code takes two integers as input, separated by a space. These integers are assigned to variables a and b, respectively.
The input provided is '2 5', so a is assigned the value 2 and b is assigned the value 5.
The code then prints the product of a and b, which is 2 * 5.
The output will be the result of this multiplication, which is 10.
