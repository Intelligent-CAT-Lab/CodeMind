<<<Analysis>>>
The variable x is initialized to 0.
The variable year is calculated by integer division of x by 100, which results in 0 // 100 = 0.
The code then prints "ai1333" concatenated with "3" repeated year times. Since year is 0, "3" is repeated 0 times.
Therefore, the output will be just "ai1333".
<<<Output>>>
ai1333
