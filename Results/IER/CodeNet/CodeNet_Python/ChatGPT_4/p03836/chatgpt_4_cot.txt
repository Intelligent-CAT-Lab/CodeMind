The variables sx, sy, tx, and ty are initialized to 0, 0, 1, and 2, respectively.
The variable x is calculated as (tx - sx), which is (1 - 0) = 1.
The variable y is calculated as (ty - sy), which is (2 - 0) = 2.

The variable order is initialized with the string "L".

The following steps are then executed to build the order string:
1. "U"*(y+1) adds "UUU" to order (since y is 2, y+1 is 3).
2. "R"*(x+1) adds "RR" to order (since x is 1, x+1 is 2).
3. "D" adds "D" to order.
4. "R" adds "R" to order.
5. "D"*(y+1) adds "DDD" to order (since y is 2, y+1 is 3).
6. "L"*(x+1) adds "LL" to order (since x is 1, x+1 is 2).
7. "U" adds "U" to order.
8. "U"*y adds "UU" to order (since y is 2).
9. "R"*x adds "R" to order (since x is 1).
10. "D"*y adds "DD" to order (since y is 2).
11. "L"*x adds "L" to order (since x is 1).

Combining all these steps, the final order string is "LUUUURRDDRUUDDLLURDDLUURDDL".
