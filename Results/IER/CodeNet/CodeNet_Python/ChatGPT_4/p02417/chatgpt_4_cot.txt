<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads input strings and extracts all alphabetic characters, converting them to lowercase and appending them to the list A. It continues to read input until an EOFError occurs, which signifies no more input is available.

The input provided is "This is a pen.".

The code then iterates over the list A and counts the occurrences of each character, storing the counts in the dictionary D.

Next, the code creates a list Str of all lowercase alphabetic characters from 'a' to 'z'.

Finally, the code iterates over the list Str and prints each character followed by its count in the dictionary D. If a character is not present in D, it prints 0.

For the given input "This is a pen.", the characters 't', 'h', 'i', 's', 'a', 'p', 'e', and 'n' will be counted. The counts are as follows:
- 't': 1
- 'h': 1
- 'i': 2
- 's': 2
- 'a': 1
- 'p': 1
- 'e': 1
- 'n': 1

All other letters will have a count of 0.
