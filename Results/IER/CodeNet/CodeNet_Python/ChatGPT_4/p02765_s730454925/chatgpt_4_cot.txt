<<<Analysis>>>
The variables n and r are initialized to 2 and 2919, respectively, from the input.
The code checks if n is less than 10, which it is in this case (n is 2).
Since n is less than 10, the code calculates z as r plus 100 times (10 minus n). This is 2919 + 100 * (10 - 2), which equals 2919 + 100 * 8.
The calculation results in 2919 + 800, which equals 3719.
The code then prints the value of z, which is 3719.
<<<Output>>>
3719
