<<<Analysis>>>
The variable B is initialized with the input string "0 0 1".
The list O contains two strings: "1 1 0" and "0 0 1".
The code checks if the value of B is present in the list O.
Since "0 0 1" is exactly one of the strings in the list O, the condition B in O is True.
Therefore, the code will execute the print statement under the if clause and print "Open".
<<<Output>>>
Open
