The input variables N and M are initialized to 2 and 998244353, respectively.

The code initializes a 2D list DP with 6000 rows and 6000 columns, filled with -1. This list is used for memoization in the function P, which calculates the number of partitions of n using integers up to k.

The function P is a recursive function that calculates the number of partitions of n using integers up to k. It uses memoization to store previously calculated values in DP to avoid redundant calculations.

The code precomputes the values of P for all pairs (i+1, j+1) where i ranges from 0 to 5499 and j ranges from 0 to i. This is done to fill the DP table with the necessary values for later use.

The list X is initialized with a single element 0. Then, for each i from 0 to 5499, a new element is appended to X, which is the sum of the products of DP[j][j] and DP[i-j][i-j] for j ranging from 0 to i, modulo M.

The list Y is initialized with a single element 0. Then, for each i from 0 to 10799, a new element is appended to Y, which is the sum of Y[i] and X[i>>1], where i>>1 is the integer division of i by 2.

The variable P is initialized to 0. Then, for each i from 1 to N (which is 2 in this case), P is updated by adding X[i] modulo M. If 2*i is greater than N, then Y[2*i-N] is subtracted from P modulo M.

Finally, the code prints the value of P after the loop.

Given the input `2 998244353`, the code will calculate the number of partitions of 2 using integers up to 2, and then apply the modulo operation with M. Since the number of partitions of 2 is 2 (1+1 and 2), and there are no subtractions to be made (since 2*i is not greater than N), the final output will be 2 modulo 998244353, which is simply 2.
