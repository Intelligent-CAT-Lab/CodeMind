The variable S is initialized with the string "01B0".
An empty string w is created to store the result.
The code enters a loop that iterates over each character in S.
For the first character '0', since it is not 'B', it is added to w, making w "0".
For the second character '1', since it is not 'B', it is added to w, making w "01".
For the third character 'B', since it is 'B' and the length of w is greater than 0, the last character of w is removed, making w "0".
For the fourth character '0', since it is not 'B', it is added to w, making w "00".
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of w, which is "00".
<<<Output>>>
00
