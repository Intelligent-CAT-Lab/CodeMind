The variable n is initialized to 10.
The variable ans is initialized to 10^12, which is a very large number used as a starting point to find the minimum value of m.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over k, starting from 1 up to the square root of n plus 1, which in this case is int((10)**0.5)+2 = int(3.16)+2 = 3+2 = 5. So, k will take values from 1 to 5.
For each k in this range, the code checks if n is divisible by k (n % k == 0). If it is, it calculates m as n//k + k - 2.
The code then checks if the current value of m is less than ans. If it is, ans is updated to the current value of m.
For n = 10, the divisors are 1 and 10, 2 and 5. The calculations will be as follows:
- For k = 1: m = 10//1 + 1 - 2 = 10 + 1 - 2 = 9
- For k = 2: m = 10//2 + 2 - 2 = 5 + 2 - 2 = 5
- For k = 3: No calculation since 10 is not divisible by 3.
- For k = 4: No calculation since 10 is not divisible by 4.
- For k = 5: m = 10//5 + 5 - 2 = 2 + 5 - 2 = 5
The minimum value of m found is 5, so ans will be updated to 5.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 5.

5
