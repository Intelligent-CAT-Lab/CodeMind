The variable n is initialized to 8.
The variable m is initialized to (1<<32)-1, which is a 32-bit mask with all bits set to 1.

The first print statement prints the binary representation of n, which is 8, in a 32-bit format with leading zeros.
The second print statement prints the binary representation of the bitwise NOT of n, using the mask m to limit the result to 32 bits.
The third print statement prints the binary representation of n shifted left by 1 bit, again using the mask m to limit the result to 32 bits.
The fourth print statement prints the binary representation of n shifted right by 1 bit, without any mask since right shifting does not introduce any new bits from the left.

Now, let's calculate the binary representations:
1. The binary representation of 8 is '1000'. In 32-bit format with leading zeros, it is '00000000000000000000000000001000'.
2. The bitwise NOT of 8 is the complement of '1000', which is '11111111111111111111111111110111' before applying the mask. After applying the mask m, it remains the same since m has all bits set to 1.
3. Shifting 8 left by 1 bit results in '10000', which is 16 in decimal. In 32-bit format with leading zeros, it is '00000000000000000000000000010000'.
4. Shifting 8 right by 1 bit results in '100', which is 4 in decimal. In 32-bit format with leading zeros, it is '00000000000000000000000000000100'.
