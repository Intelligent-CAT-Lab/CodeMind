<<<Analysis>>>
The variables t1, t2, r1, and r2 are initialized to 9, 8, 1000, and 999, respectively.
The code first checks if either r1 or r2 is equal to -1. Since neither is -1, it skips this block.
Next, the code checks if r1 is greater than r2. Since 1000 is greater than 999, this condition is true.
Because r1 is greater than r2, the code prints 'Alice'.
<<<Output>>>
Alice
