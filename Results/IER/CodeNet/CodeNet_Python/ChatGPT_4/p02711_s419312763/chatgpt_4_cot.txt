<<<Analysis>>>
The code checks if the string "7" is present in the list created from the input string.
The input function reads the string "117".
The list function converts the string "117" into a list of characters ['1', '1', '7'].
The "if" condition checks if the string "7" is in the list ['1', '1', '7'].
Since "7" is indeed in the list, the condition is True.
Therefore, the code prints "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
