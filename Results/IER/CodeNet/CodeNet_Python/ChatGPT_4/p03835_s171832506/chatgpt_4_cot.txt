<<<Analysis>>>
The variables K and S are initialized to 2 and 2, respectively.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of valid combinations of (i, j, k) that satisfy the condition.

The code then enters a nested loop where i and j both range from 0 to K (inclusive), meaning they will consider the values 0, 1, and 2.

For each pair of (i, j), the code calculates k as S - i - j. For the given input, k will be calculated as 2 - i - j.

The code checks if k is within the range [0, K]. If it is, it increments ans by 1, indicating that one valid combination of (i, j, k) has been found.

The possible combinations of (i, j, k) that satisfy the condition 0 <= k <= K are:
(0, 0, 2), (0, 1, 1), (0, 2, 0), (1, 0, 1), (1, 1, 0), (2, 0, 0)

There are 6 valid combinations, so ans will be 6 after the loops finish.

After the loops finish, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 6.
<<<Output>>>
6
