<<<Analysis>>>
The variables N and M are initialized to 1 each from the input.
The variable time is calculated as 1900*M + (N-M)*100. Since N and M are both 1, the calculation becomes 1900*1 + (1-1)*100, which simplifies to 1900 + 0 = 1900.
The final print statement prints the value of time multiplied by 2 raised to the power of M. Since M is 1, this is 1900 * (2**1), which equals 1900 * 2 = 3800.
<<<Output>>>
3800
