<<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized to 8.
An empty list a is created, and the value of s (which is 8) is appended to it.
The variable elm is also set to the value of s, which is 8.
The code enters an infinite loop.
Since 8 is even (8%2 == 0), elm is halved (8//2), resulting in 4.
4 is not in the list a, so it is appended to a.
Now elm is 4, which is even, so it is halved again to 2.
2 is not in the list a, so it is appended to a.
Now elm is 2, which is even, so it is halved again to 1.
1 is not in the list a, so it is appended to a.
Now elm is 1, which is odd, so the next value is 3*1 + 1, which is 4.
4 is already in the list a, so the loop breaks.
The length of the list a is now 4, and the code prints the length of a plus 1, which is 5.
