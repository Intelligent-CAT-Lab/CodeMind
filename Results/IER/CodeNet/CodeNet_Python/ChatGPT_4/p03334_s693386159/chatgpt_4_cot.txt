<<<Analysis>>>
The input variables N, D1, and D2 are initialized to 2, 1, and 2, respectively.
The variable M is set to N*2, which is 4 in this case.

The helper function is called twice, once with arguments (4, D1) and once with (4, D2).

For the first call with D1=1, since D1%2 == 1, a 4x4 grid of boolean values is created with alternating True and False values in a checkerboard pattern.

For the second call with D2=2, since D2%4 == 2, a 4x4 grid of boolean values is created with True values in every other row starting from the first row.

The two grids g1 and g2 are then element-wise 'anded' together to produce the final grid 'ans'. This operation will result in True values only where both g1 and g2 have True values.

Finally, the code prints the x and y coordinates of the non-zero (True) elements of the 'ans' grid, but only up to N*N (which is 4) elements.

Let's visualize the grids:
g1 (D1=1):
True  False True  False
False True  False True
True  False True  False
False True  False True

g2 (D2=2):
True  True  True  True
False False False False
True  True  True  True
False False False False

ans (g1 & g2):
True  False True  False
False False False False
True  False True  False
False False False False

The non-zero elements of 'ans' are at coordinates (0,0), (0,2), (2,0), and (2,2). These are the coordinates that will be printed, in that order.

<<<Output>>>
0 0
0 2
2 0
2 2
