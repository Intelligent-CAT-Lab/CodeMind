<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a and b are initialized to 20 and 30, respectively.
The code checks if a minus b equals 0, which it does not in this case (20 - 30 is not 0).
Next, the code checks if a is greater than b, which is also not true (20 is not greater than 30).
Since neither of the first two conditions are met, the code executes the else block.
The else block prints the absolute difference between b and a, which is 30 - 20.
The output will be the absolute difference, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
