<<<Analysis>>>
The variables X, Y, and Z are initialized to 13, 3, and 1, respectively.
The variable isu is calculated as X - Z, which is 13 - 1 = 12.
The variable hito is calculated as Y + Z, which is 3 + 1 = 4.
The code then prints the integer division of isu by hito, which is 12 // 4.
The result of this division is 3, as integer division discards any remainder.
<<<Output>>>
3
