The variables n, k, and s are initialized to 4, 2, and 3, respectively.
The variable num is initialized to 998245637.
The code creates an array 'arr' of length k, with each element being the value of s. Since k is 2, 'arr' will be [3, 3].
The code creates another array 'arr2' of length n-k, with each element being the value of num. Since n-k is 4-2=2, 'arr2' will be [998245637, 998245637].
The code then prints the concatenation of 'arr' and 'arr2', which results in [3, 3, 998245637, 998245637].
The output is printed with the * operator, which unpacks the list, so the elements are printed without brackets or commas.
<<<Output>>>
