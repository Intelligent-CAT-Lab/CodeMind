<<<Analysis>>>
The variable x is initialized to the string "TSTTSS".
The variable n is initialized to the length of x, which is 6.
A deque named st is created to act as a stack.

The code then enters a loop that iterates over each character in the string x.

1. For the first character 'T', since st is empty, 'T' is appended to st.
2. For the second character 'S', 'S' is appended to st.
3. For the third character 'T', since st is not empty, it pops the last element which is 'S'. Since 'S' is not equal to 'T', it continues without doing anything.
4. For the fourth character 'T', since st is empty (because 'S' was popped and not replaced), 'T' is appended to st.
5. For the fifth character 'S', 'S' is appended to st.
6. For the sixth character 'S', another 'S' is appended to st.

After the loop finishes, the deque st contains 'T', 'T', 'S', 'S'. The length of st is 4.
