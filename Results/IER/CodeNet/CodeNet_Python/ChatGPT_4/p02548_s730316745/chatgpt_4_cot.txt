<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 3.
The variable c is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum.

The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 2 (since n is 3).

For i = 1, the expression (n - 1) // i evaluates to (3 - 1) // 1 = 2 // 1 = 2. The value 2 is added to c, so c becomes 2.

For i = 2, the expression (n - 1) // i evaluates to (3 - 1) // 2 = 2 // 2 = 1. The value 1 is added to c, so c becomes 2 + 1 = 3.

The loop finishes as there are no more numbers to consider.

The code prints the final value of c, which is 3.

<<<Output>>>
3
