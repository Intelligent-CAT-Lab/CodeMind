<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a, b, c, and d are initialized to 3, 8, 7, and 1, respectively.
The code then compares the sum of a and b with the sum of c and d.
The sum of a and b is 3 + 8 = 11.
The sum of c and d is 7 + 1 = 8.
Since 11 (the sum of a and b) is greater than 8 (the sum of c and d), the condition (a + b) > (c + d) is true.
Therefore, the code will execute the first branch of the if statement and print 'Left'.
<<<Output>>>
