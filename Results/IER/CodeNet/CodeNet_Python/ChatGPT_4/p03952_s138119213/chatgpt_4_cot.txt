<<<Analysis>>>
The input `4 4` initializes n to 4 and x to 4.
The function `solve()` is called.
The first condition checks if x is equal to 1 or 2 * n - 1, which would be 7 in this case. Since x is 4, the condition is not met and the function continues.
An array `a` of length 2 * n - 1 (which is 7) is created, filled with None.
The middle index `m` is calculated as (2 * n - 1) // 2, which is 3.
The values at indices m (3), m - 1 (2), and m + 1 (4) are set to x (4), x - 1 (3), and x + 1 (5), respectively.
A variable `y` is initialized to 1 and is used to fill the rest of the array `a`.
The loop iterates over the range of 0 to 6 (inclusive) and skips the indices 2, 3, and 4 because they are already filled.
For each iteration, if `y` is equal to x - 1, x, or x + 1 (which are 3, 4, and 5), `y` is set to x + 2 (which is 6).
The array `a` is filled with the values of `y`, incrementing `y` by 1 each time, but skipping the values 3, 4, and 5.
The final array `a` will be [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], but with the values 3, 4, and 5 placed at indices 2, 3, and 4, respectively.
The output will be "Yes" followed by the elements of the array `a` printed on separate lines.
