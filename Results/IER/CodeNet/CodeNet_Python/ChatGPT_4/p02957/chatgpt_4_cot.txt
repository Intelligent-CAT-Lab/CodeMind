<<<Analysis>>>
The variables A and B are initialized to 2 and 16, respectively.
The code calculates the value of x using the formula (A^2 - B^2) / (2 * (A - B)).
Substituting the values of A and B, we get x = (2^2 - 16^2) / (2 * (2 - 16)) = (4 - 256) / (2 * (-14)) = (-252) / (-28) = 9.
Since x is a whole number (9 % 1 equals 0), the code will print the integer value of x.
<<<Output>>>
9
