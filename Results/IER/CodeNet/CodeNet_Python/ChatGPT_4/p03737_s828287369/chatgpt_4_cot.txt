<<<Analysis>>>
The input string "atcoder beginner contest" is split into a list of words ['atcoder', 'beginner', 'contest'] and stored in the variable S.
The variable out is initialized with the concatenation of the first character of each word in the list S, which results in 'abc'.
The print function then outputs the uppercase version of 'abc', which is 'ABC'.
<<<Output>>>
ABC
