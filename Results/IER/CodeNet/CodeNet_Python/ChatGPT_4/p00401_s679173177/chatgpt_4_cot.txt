The variable n is initialized to 54.
The variable c is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of times n can be right-shifted until it is no longer greater than 1.
The code enters a while loop that continues as long as n is greater than 1.
In each iteration of the loop, n is right-shifted by 1 bit (n = n >> 1), which is equivalent to integer division by 2.
The variable c is incremented by 1 in each iteration.
The loop runs as follows:
- First iteration: n = 54 >> 1 = 27, c = 1
- Second iteration: n = 27 >> 1 = 13, c = 2
- Third iteration: n = 13 >> 1 = 6, c = 3
- Fourth iteration: n = 6 >> 1 = 3, c = 4
- Fifth iteration: n = 3 >> 1 = 1, c = 5
- The loop stops because n is no longer greater than 1.
The code then prints the result of 1 left-shifted by c bits (1 << c), which is equivalent to 2 raised to the power of c.
The output is 1 << 5 = 32.
