The variables n, m, and k are initialized to 3, 2, and 1, respectively.
The variable mod is set to 998244353, which is a large prime number often used in competitive programming for modulo operations to avoid overflow.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the answer.

The code then initializes a list called fact with a single element 1, and a list called fact_inv with MAX_N+4 elements, all initialized to 0. MAX_N is set to 10**6.

The code populates the fact list with factorial values modulo mod. It calculates the factorial iteratively and takes the modulo at each step to keep the numbers within the bounds of mod.

The code then calculates the modular inverse of the factorial of MAX_N+3 and stores it in the last element of fact_inv. It uses the pow function with three arguments, which calculates the inverse using modular exponentiation.

The code then populates the rest of the fact_inv list with the modular inverses of the factorials in descending order.

The function mod_comb_k is defined to calculate the binomial coefficient modulo mod using the precomputed factorials and their inverses.

The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to k (inclusive), which in this case means it will consider x = 0 and x = 1.

For each x, the code calculates a term to add to ans. This term is the product of m, (m-1) raised to the power of (n-1-x), and the binomial coefficient of (n-1) choose x, all modulo mod.

For x = 0, the term is 2 * (2-1)^(3-1-0) * mod_comb_k(3-1,0,mod) = 2 * 1^2 * 1 = 2.
For x = 1, the term is 2 * (2-1)^(3-1-1) * mod_comb_k(3-1,1,mod) = 2 * 1^1 * 2 = 4.

The ans is the sum of these terms modulo mod, which is (2 + 4) % 998244353 = 6.

The code checks if ans is negative, and if so, it adds mod to ans. This is not the case here, so the final ans remains 6.

The code prints the final value of ans.
