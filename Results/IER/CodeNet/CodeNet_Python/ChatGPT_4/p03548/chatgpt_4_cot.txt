The variables X, Y, and Z are initialized to 13, 3, and 1, respectively.
The variable answer is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of times a width of Y+2*Z can fit into X.
The variable width is initialized to Y+2*Z, which is 3+2*1 = 5.
The code enters a while loop that continues as long as width is less than or equal to X.
Inside the loop, answer is incremented by 1, and width is increased by Y+Z, which is 3+1 = 4.
The loop runs as follows:
1. width = 5, answer = 0 -> width <= X (5 <= 13) -> answer = 1, width = 5+4 = 9
2. width = 9, answer = 1 -> width <= X (9 <= 13) -> answer = 2, width = 9+4 = 13
3. width = 13, answer = 2 -> width <= X (13 <= 13) -> answer = 3, width = 13+4 = 17
4. width = 17, answer = 3 -> width > X (17 > 13) -> exit loop

The loop exits because width is now greater than X.
The final value of answer, which is 3, is printed.
