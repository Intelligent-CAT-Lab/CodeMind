<<<Analysis>>>
The input string '4 5 3' is split into a list of strings ['4', '5', '3'].
Each string in the list is then converted to an integer, resulting in the list A = [4, 5, 3].
The min() function is called on the list A, which returns the smallest element in the list, which is 3.
The max() function is called on the list A, which returns the largest element in the list, which is 5.
The print() function then prints the minimum and maximum values separated by a space, resulting in the output "3 5".
<<<Output>>>
3 5
