<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a and b are initialized to 5 and 4, respectively, from the input.
The code then checks if both a and b are less than or equal to 8.
Since both 5 and 4 satisfy the condition (5 <= 8 and 4 <= 8), the code will execute the first part of the ternary conditional operator, which is to print 'Yay!'.
<<<Output>>>
Yay!
