<<<Analysis>>>
The variable x is initialized to 33.
The code then enters a nested loop, with the outer loop iterating i from -1000 to 999 and the inner loop iterating j from -1000 to 999.
For each pair of (i, j), the code checks if i raised to the power of 5 minus j raised to the power of 5 equals x.
The first pair of (i, j) that satisfies the condition i**5 - j**5 == 33 will be printed out, and both loops will be terminated using the break statement.
The else block attached to the inner for loop will be skipped if the break statement is executed, which means it will only continue if the inner loop completes without finding a match.
The first pair that satisfies the condition is (2, -1) because 2**5 - (-1)**5 equals 32 + 1 which is 33.
After printing the pair (2, -1), the loops are terminated, and no further pairs are checked or printed.
<<<Output>>>
2 -1
