<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a, b, and c are initialized to 5, 2, and 4, respectively, from the input.
The code checks if the absolute difference between b and c is even by using the modulus operator `% 2` and comparing it to 0.
The absolute difference between b (2) and c (4) is 2, which is even.
Since the condition `abs(b-c)%2==0` is True, the code will print "Alice".
<<<Output>>>
Alice
