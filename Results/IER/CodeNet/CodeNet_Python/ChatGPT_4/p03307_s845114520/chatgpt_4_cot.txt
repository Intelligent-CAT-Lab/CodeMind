<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized to 3.
The code checks if N is even by using the modulo operator (N%2 == 0). Since 3 is not an even number, the condition is False.
The else block is executed, which prints 2 times N (2*N).
Therefore, the output will be 2 times 3, which is 6.
<<<Output>>>
6
