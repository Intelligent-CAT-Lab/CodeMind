<<<Analysis>>>
The input string 'CODEFESTIVAL' is taken by the input() function.
The str() function is redundant here since input() already returns a string.
The slicing operation '[:-8]' removes the last 8 characters from the string.
Therefore, the output will be the first part of the string 'CODEFESTIVAL' with the last 8 characters removed, which leaves 'CODE'.
