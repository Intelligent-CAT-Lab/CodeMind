The variable N is initialized to 4.
The variable w is initialized to 0, which will be used to find the largest triangular number less than or equal to N.
The code enters the first loop, which iterates up to 10 ** 5. It checks for the smallest i such that the triangular number i * (i + 1) // 2 is less than N and the next triangular number (i + 1) * (i + 2) // 2 is greater than or equal to N.
For N = 4, the loop finds that when i = 2, the condition is satisfied because 2 * (2 + 1) // 2 = 3 < 4 and (2 + 1) * (2 + 2) // 2 = 6 > 4. So, w is set to 2 + 1 = 3 and the loop breaks.
The code then enters the second loop, which counts down from w to 1. It prints each number i if N is greater than or equal to i and subtracts i from N.
The loop will print 3 because 4 >= 3 and then N becomes 4 - 3 = 1.
The loop will then print 1 because 1 >= 1 and then N becomes 1 - 1 = 0.
The loop ends because N is now 0 and cannot be greater than or equal to the next i (which would be 2).
The output will be the numbers 3 and 1 printed on separate lines.
