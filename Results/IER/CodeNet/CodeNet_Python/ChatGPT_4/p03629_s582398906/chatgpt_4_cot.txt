<<<Analysis>>>
The input string A is 'atcoderregularcontest'.
The list K is initialized with zeros and has the same length as A.
The set s and the variable cnt are initialized for later use.

The first for loop iterates over the string A in reverse. It updates K[i] with the value of cnt and adds the character A[i] to the set s. If the set s reaches a length of 26, cnt is incremented and s is reset to an empty set. This loop essentially counts how many unique characters from the end of the string A are needed to see all 26 letters of the alphabet.

The defaultdict d is used to store the indices of each character in A.

The list ans is initialized to store the answer, and the variable now is set to -1.

The second for loop iterates cnt times. For each iteration, it goes through the alphabet. It uses bisect_right to find the position in the list d[alpha] where now would be inserted to maintain order. If idx is equal to the length of d[alpha], it means there are no more occurrences of the character alpha after the index now, so alpha is added to ans and the loop breaks.

If idx is not equal to the length of d[alpha], it means there is an occurrence of alpha after now. The variable nex is set to the index of this occurrence. If K[nex] is equal to cnt-i-1, it means that starting from nex, there are enough unique characters to complete the set of 26 characters cnt-i-1 more times. In this case, now is updated to nex, alpha is added to ans, and the loop breaks.

The final answer is the concatenation of the characters in ans.

Let's go through the input 'atcoderregularcontest' step by step:

1. The first loop will create the list K with the number of unique characters needed from each position to the end to see all 26 letters. Since 'atcoderregularcontest' doesn't contain all 26 letters, cnt will remain 1, and all values in K will be 1.

2. The defaultdict d will contain the indices of each character in 'atcoderregularcontest'.

3. The second loop will run once (since cnt is 1). It will find the smallest character that can be placed at the beginning of the answer string such that the remaining string still contains all the unique characters of 'atcoderregularcontest'. This character is 'a'.

4. The loop will continue to find the next smallest character that can follow 'a' and still satisfy the condition. This process will continue until the answer string is complete.

5. The final answer will be the lexicographically smallest string that can be formed while maintaining the order of characters in 'atcoderregularcontest'.

Let's execute the steps:

- K will be [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
- d will have indices for each character in 'atcoderregularcontest'.
- ans will be built character by character, starting with 'a', then 'c', 'd', 'e', 'g', 'l', 'o', 'r', 's', 't', 'u'.

The final answer will be 'acdegloqrstu'.
