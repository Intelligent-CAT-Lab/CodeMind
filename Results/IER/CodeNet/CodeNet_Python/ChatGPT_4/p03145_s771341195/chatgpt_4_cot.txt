The variables a, b, and c are initialized to 3, 4, and 5, respectively, from the input.
A list named 'list' is created containing the values of a, b, and c.
The list is then sorted, which will arrange the numbers in ascending order, resulting in [3, 4, 5].
The code then prints the result of the expression int(list[0]*list[1]/2). This expression multiplies the first two smallest numbers in the list (which are now 3 and 4) and then divides the result by 2.
The calculation is as follows: (3 * 4) / 2 = 12 / 2 = 6.
The result is then converted to an integer, although it is already an integer, so this has no effect on the result.
The final output is 6.
