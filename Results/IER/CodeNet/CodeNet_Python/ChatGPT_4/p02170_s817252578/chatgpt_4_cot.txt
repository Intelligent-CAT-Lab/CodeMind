The variables N, K, and A are initialized to 1, 1, and 50, respectively.
The list dp is initialized with K+1 zeros followed by N ones, resulting in [0, 1].
dp[0] is set to 1.
The variable c is initialized to 1.
The variable mod is set to 998244353, which is a large prime number used for modular arithmetic to avoid overflow.
p_coin is calculated as A * pow(100, mod-2, mod) % mod, which simplifies to 50 * pow(100, 998244351, 998244353) % 998244353. Since 100 is coprime to 998244353, by Fermat's Little Theorem, pow(100, 998244351, 998244353) is the modular inverse of 100, which is 499122177. So p_coin is 50 * 499122177 % 998244353, which equals 245621087.
p_dice is calculated as pow(N, mod-2, mod), which simplifies to pow(1, 998244351, 998244353), which is 1.
The loop runs for i from 1 to K (inclusive), which is just 1 in this case.
Inside the loop, dp[i] is set to c * p_coin % mod, which is 1 * 245621087 % 998244353, which equals 245621087.
c is updated to c + (dp[i] - dp[i-N]) * p_dice % mod, which simplifies to 1 + (245621087 - 0) * 1 % 998244353, which equals 245621088.
Finally, the output is calculated as dp[K] * pow(p_coin, mod-2, mod) % mod, which is 245621087 * pow(245621087, 998244351, 998244353) % 998244353. The pow function here calculates the modular inverse of p_coin, which is 2. So the final output is 245621087 * 2 % 998244353, which equals 491242174.
