<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a, b, and c are initialized to 2, 5, and 4, respectively.
The variable x is assigned the value of the maximum of a, b, and c, which is 5.
The variable y is assigned the value of the minimum of a, b, and c, which is 2.
The variable z is calculated by subtracting x and y from the sum of a, b, and c, which gives us z = 2 + 5 + 4 - 5 - 2 = 4.
The code then checks if the difference (z - y) is even. In this case, (4 - 2) is 2, which is even.
Since the condition is true, it executes the first print statement: print(x - z + (z - y) // 2), which simplifies to print(5 - 4 + (4 - 2) // 2) = print(1 + 1) = print(2).
