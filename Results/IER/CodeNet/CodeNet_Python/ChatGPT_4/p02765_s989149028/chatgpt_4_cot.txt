<<<Analysis>>>
The variables n and r are initialized to 2 and 2919, respectively.
The code checks if n is less than 10, which it is since n is 2.
Since n is less than 10, the code executes the first print statement.
It calculates r + 100 * (10 - n), which is 2919 + 100 * (10 - 2), resulting in 2919 + 100 * 8.
This calculation equals 2919 + 800, which is 3719.
The code then prints the result of this calculation.
<<<Output>>>
3719
