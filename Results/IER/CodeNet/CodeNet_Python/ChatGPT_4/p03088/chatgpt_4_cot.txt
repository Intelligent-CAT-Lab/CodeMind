The variable N is initialized to 3, and MOD is set to 10^9 + 7.
A memoization list `memo` is created with N+1 empty dictionaries to store intermediate results for dynamic programming.

The `ok` function checks if a given string `last4` can be rearranged (by swapping adjacent characters) to contain the substring "AGC". If it can, the function returns False; otherwise, it returns True.

The `dfs` function is a recursive function that counts the number of valid strings of length N that do not contain "AGC" as a substring, even after any possible adjacent character swaps. It uses the `ok` function to check if appending a character 'c' to the last three characters `last3` would result in a valid string.

The initial call to `dfs` is made with `cur` set to 0 and `last3` set to "TTT".

Let's analyze the recursive calls:
- At cur = 0, last3 = "TTT", the function will try appending each character from "ACGT" and check if it's valid.
- For each valid last3 + c, it will call dfs with cur incremented by 1 and the new last3 (which is the last two characters of the previous last3 plus the new character c).

Since N is 3, the recursion will only go 3 levels deep. The base case is when cur == N, at which point the function returns 1, indicating a valid string has been found.

The function will count all valid strings of length 3 that do not contain "AGC" as a substring, even after any possible adjacent character swaps.

The output will be the total count of such strings modulo 10^9 + 7.

After analyzing the possible strings and considering the constraints, we can determine that the following strings are valid:
- "AAA", "AAC", "AAG", "AAT", "ACA", "ACC", "ACG", "ACT", "AGA", "AGG", "AGT", "ATA", "ATC", "ATG", "ATT"
- "CAA", "CAC", "CAG", "CAT", "CCA", "CCC", "CCG", "CCT", "CGA", "CGC", "CGG", "CGT", "CTA", "CTC", "CTG", "CTT"
- "GAA", "GAC", "GAG", "GAT", "GCA", "GCC", "GCG", "GCT", "GGA", "GGC", "GGG", "GGT", "GTA", "GTC", "GTG", "GTT"
- "TAA", "TAC", "TAG", "TAT", "TCA", "TCC", "TCG", "TCT", "TGA", "TGC", "TGG", "TGT", "TTA", "TTC", "TTG", "TTT"

Each of the four groups above contains 16 valid strings, so the total count is 4 * 16 = 64.

Therefore, the output will be 64.
