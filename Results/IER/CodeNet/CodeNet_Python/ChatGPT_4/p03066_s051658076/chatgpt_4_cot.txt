The variables N and X are initialized to 3 and 3, respectively.
The variable P is set to 998244353, which is a large prime number used for modulo operations to keep the numbers within a manageable range.

The 2D list A is initialized with N+1 rows, where the ith row has 2*i+1 columns, all initialized to 0. A[i][j] will represent the number of permutations of 1's and 2's whose length is i and whose sum is j. A[0][0] is set to 1 as there is one permutation of length 0 with sum 0, which is an empty permutation.

The list B is initialized with N+1 elements, all set to 0. B[i] will represent the number of permutations of 1's and 2's with length i none of whose consecutive subsequences is equal to X.

The first loop populates the A matrix. For each i from 0 to N-1, and for each j from i to 2*i, it calculates the number of permutations for the next length (i+1) by adding 1 or 2 to the sum. It also ensures that the values are taken modulo P.

The second loop calculates the number of permutations for B[i] where the sum is below X. It iterates over i from 0 to N+1 and j from i to the minimum of 2*i+1 and X, adding the values from A[i][j] to B[i].

The third loop handles the case where the sum is 2X or more. Since X is odd, it adds 1 to B[i] for i from X to N+1.

The fourth loop handles the case where the sum is between X and 2X (exclusive). It calculates the number of permutations for B[k] where k is the length of the permutation and a is the sum of the permutation of length j that can be extended to length k.

Finally, the variable ans is initialized to 0, and a loop is used to calculate the final answer. It iterates over the elements of B and multiplies each by the corresponding value from the last row of A, taken modulo P.

Now, let's calculate the values step by step for the given input `3 3`.

A matrix after the first loop:
A[0][0] = 1
A[1][1] = 1 (from A[0][0])
A[1][2] = 1 (from A[0][0])
A[2][2] = 1 (from A[1][1])
A[2][3] = 2 (from A[1][1] and A[1][2])
A[2][4] = 1 (from A[1][2])
A[3][3] = 1 (from A[2][2])
A[3][4] = 2 (from A[2][2] and A[2][3])
A[3][5] = 3 (from A[2][3] and A[2][4])
A[3][6] = 1 (from A[2][4])

B list after the second loop:
B[0] = 1 (from A[0][0])
B[1] = 1 (from A[1][1])
B[2] = 1 (from A[2][2])
B[3] = 1 (from A[3][3])

B list after the third loop:
Since X is odd, we add 1 to B[i] for i from X to N+1.
B[3] = 2 (previous value + 1)

B list after the fourth loop:
There are no changes because the loop condition is not met for the given values of X and N.

Calculating the final answer:
ans = (0 + B[0] * A[3][3]) % P
ans = (ans + B[1] * A[3][2]) % P
ans = (ans + B[2] * A[3][1]) % P
ans = (ans + B[3] * A[3][0]) % P

ans = (0 + 1 * 1) % P
ans = (1 + 1 * 1) % P
ans = (2 + 1 * 0) % P
ans = (2 + 2 * 0) % P

ans = 2
