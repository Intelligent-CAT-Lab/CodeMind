<<<Analysis>>>
The variables m, f, and b are initialized to 1000, 3000, and 3000, respectively.
The code first checks if the sum of m and f is less than b. In this case, 1000 + 3000 is not less than 3000, so the first condition is false.
Next, the code checks if m is greater than or equal to b. Since m is 1000 and b is 3000, this condition is also false.
Since neither of the first two conditions is met, the code proceeds to the else block.
In the else block, the code prints the result of b - m, which is 3000 - 1000.
The output will be 2000.
