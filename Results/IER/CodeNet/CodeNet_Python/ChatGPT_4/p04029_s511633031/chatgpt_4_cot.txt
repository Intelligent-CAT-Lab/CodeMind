<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized to 3.
The code calculates the sum of the first N natural numbers using the formula N * (N + 1) // 2.
For N = 3, the calculation is 3 * (3 + 1) // 2, which simplifies to 3 * 4 // 2.
This further simplifies to 12 // 2, which equals 6.
The integer division // ensures that the result is an integer.
Finally, the code prints the result of the calculation, which is 6.
<<<Output>>>
6
