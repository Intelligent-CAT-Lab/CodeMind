<<<Analysis>>>
The variable S is initialized to the string 'BBBWW'.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of times consecutive characters in the string are different.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to the length of S minus 2 (because it checks the current character and the next one, so it stops one character before the last).
For each index i in this range, it checks if the character at position i is different from the character at position i+1.
The condition is met twice: when i is 2 (S[2] is 'B' and S[3] is 'W'), and when i is 3 (S[3] is 'W' and S[4] is 'W'). However, since S[3] and S[4] are the same, the condition is only true once.
Each time the condition is met, ans is incremented by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 1.
