<<<Analysis>>>
The variables H1, M1, H2, M2, and K are initialized to 10, 0, 15, 0, and 30, respectively.
The code calculates the total minutes for the start time (H1*60 + M1) which is (10*60 + 0) = 600 minutes.
The code calculates the total minutes for the end time (H2*60 + M2) which is (15*60 + 0) = 900 minutes.
The code then calculates the difference between the end time and the start time, which is 900 - 600 = 300 minutes.
Finally, the code subtracts K (30 minutes) from this difference, resulting in 300 - 30 = 270 minutes.
The code prints the final result, which is 270.
<<<Output>>>
270
