<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function `main()` which reads a line from the standard input, sorts the digits, and then checks if they match the list `['1', '4', '7', '9']` (after sorting).
The input is `'1 7 9 4'`. The `sys.stdin.readline().split()` will split this input into a list `['1', '7', '9', '4']`.
The `sorted()` function will sort this list to `['1', '4', '7', '9']`.
The sorted list is then compared to `list('1479')`, which is also `['1', '4', '7', '9']`.
Since the sorted input list matches the target list, the condition in the if statement is True.
Therefore, the program will print 'YES'.
<<<Output>>>
YES
