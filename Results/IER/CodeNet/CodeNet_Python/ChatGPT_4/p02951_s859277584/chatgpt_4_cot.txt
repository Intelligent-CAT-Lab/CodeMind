<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a, b, and c are initialized to 6, 4, and 3, respectively.
The variable d is calculated as c - (a - b), which is 3 - (6 - 4), resulting in 3 - 2, which equals 1.
The if statement checks if d is less than 0. Since d is 1, which is not less than 0, the condition is false.
Therefore, the else block is executed, and the value of d, which is 1, is printed.
