<<<Analysis>>>
The variable x is initialized to 6.
The code checks if the square root of (8 * x + 1) is an integer by comparing it to its floor value.
The expression (8 * x + 1) for x = 6 is (8 * 6 + 1) = 49.
The square root of 49 is 7, which is indeed an integer and equal to its floor value.
Since the condition is true, the code calculates a as (-1 + math.sqrt(1 + 8 * x))/2.
Substituting x with 6, we get a = (-1 + math.sqrt(1 + 8 * 6))/2 = (-1 + math.sqrt(49))/2 = (-1 + 7)/2 = 6/2 = 3.
The code then prints the integer value of a, which is 3.
