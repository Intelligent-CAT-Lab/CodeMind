<<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized to the string "hihi".
The variable cnt is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the occurrences of 'h' at even indices and 'i' at odd indices.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the indices of the string s.
For each index i, the code checks two conditions:
- If i is even (i % 2 == 0) and the character at index i is 'h', cnt is incremented by 1.
- If i is odd (i % 2 == 1) and the character at index i is 'i', cnt is incremented by 1.
The string "hihi" has 'h' at indices 0 and 2 (both even) and 'i' at indices 1 and 3 (both odd), so cnt will be incremented for each character, resulting in cnt being 4 after the loop.
After the loop, the code checks if the length of s is even and if cnt is equal to the length of s. Since both conditions are true (length of "hihi" is 4 and cnt is 4), the code prints 'Yes'.

Yes
