<<<Analysis>>>
The variable S is initialized to the string 'serval'.
The variable ans is initialized to a very large number (10**9), which will be used to find the minimum number of operations.
The variable alphabet is created to store all lowercase English letters.
The variable hoge is a set of unique characters in the string S, which is {'a', 'e', 'l', 'r', 's', 'v'}.
The code then iterates over each character in the alphabet.
For each character, if the character is not in the set hoge, it continues to the next iteration.
If the character is in hoge, it initializes tmp to 0 and creates a copy of the string S as a list, copy_s.
The code then enters a while loop that continues until the set of characters in copy_s is equal to the set containing only the current character.
Inside the while loop, a new list copy_s_dash is created.
For each pair of adjacent characters in copy_s, if either is the current character, character is appended to copy_s_dash; otherwise, '?' is appended.
After the loop, copy_s_dash replaces copy_s.
The length of the original S minus the length of the final copy_s gives the number of operations required to fill the string with the current character.
This number is compared with ans, and the minimum is stored in ans.
After considering all characters in the alphabet that are also in hoge, the final value of ans is printed.

For the input 'serval', the characters 's', 'e', 'r', 'v', 'a', and 'l' will be considered.
For 's', the string will become 'ssssss' in one operation.
For 'e', the string will become 'eeeeee' in two operations.
For 'r', the string will become 'rrrrrr' in two operations.
For 'v', the string will become 'vvvvvv' in three operations.
For 'a', the string will become 'aaaaaa' in two operations.
For 'l', the string will become 'llllll' in three operations.

The minimum number of operations is 1, which occurs when filling the string with 's'.
