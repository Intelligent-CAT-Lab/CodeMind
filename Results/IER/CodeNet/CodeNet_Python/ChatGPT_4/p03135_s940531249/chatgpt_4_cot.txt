<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function `solve` that takes two integers T and X, and prints the result of dividing T by X.
The `main` function sets up an iterator `tokens` that reads from the standard input line by line and word by word.
It then extracts the first two tokens from the input, converts them to integers, and assigns them to T and X, respectively.
The `solve` function is called with T and X as arguments.
Given the input `8 3`, T is set to 8 and X is set to 3.
The `solve` function is called and it prints the result of `8 / 3`, which is `2.6666666666666665`.
<<<Output>>>
2.6666666666666665
