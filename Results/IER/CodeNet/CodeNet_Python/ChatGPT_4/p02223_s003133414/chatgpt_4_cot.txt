<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines several functions and imports, but the main execution starts when the `main()` function is called.
The input `2` is read and assigned to the variable `n`.
The code checks if `n` is equal to 1, which it is not, so it skips that block.
Next, it checks if `n` is equal to 2, which it is, so it enters that block.
It prints `2`, which is `n-1` in this case.
Then it prints `0`.
After that, it prints the string `"11"`.
Since `n` is 2, the loop and other conditions are not executed.
The function then returns, and the program ends.
<<<Output>>>

0
