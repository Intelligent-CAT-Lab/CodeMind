<<<Analysis>>>
The variables n, a, and b are initialized to 10, 3, and 5, respectively.
The variable ma is assigned the minimum of a and b, which is 3.
The variable mi is calculated as the sum of a and b minus n, which is 3 + 5 - 10 = -2.
Since mi is less than 0, it is reassigned to 0.
The code prints the values of ma and mi, which are 3 and 0, respectively.
<<<Output>>>
3 0
