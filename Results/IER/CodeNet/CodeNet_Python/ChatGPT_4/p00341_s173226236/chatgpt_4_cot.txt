<<<Analysis>>>
The input string '1 1 3 4 8 9 7 3 4 5 5 5' is split into a list of strings ['1', '1', '3', '4', '8', '9', '7', '3', '4', '5', '5', '5'].
The list is then sorted, resulting in ['1', '1', '3', '3', '4', '4', '5', '5', '5', '5', '7', '8', '9'].
The code checks if the first four elements are equal, the next four elements are equal, and the last four elements are equal.
In the sorted list, the first four elements are ['1', '1', '3', '3'], which are not all equal.
Therefore, the condition is not met, and the code will print 'no'.
<<<Output>>>
no
