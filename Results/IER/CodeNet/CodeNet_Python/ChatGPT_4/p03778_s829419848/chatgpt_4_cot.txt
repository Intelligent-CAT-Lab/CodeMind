<<<Analysis>>>
The variables W, A, and B are initialized to 3, 2, and 6, respectively.
The variable x is calculated using a complex conditional expression. The condition checks if the ranges [A, A+W] and [B, B+W] overlap. If they do, x is set to 0; otherwise, it is set to a large number (1 << 28, which is 268435456).
For the given input, the ranges are [2, 5] and [6, 9]. These ranges do not overlap, so x is set to 268435456.
The variable y is calculated as the absolute difference between A and (B + W), which is abs(2 - (6 + 3)) = abs(2 - 9) = 7.
The variable z is calculated as the absolute difference between B and (A + W), which is abs(6 - (2 + 3)) = abs(6 - 5) = 1.
The code then prints the minimum of x, y, and z, which is 1.
