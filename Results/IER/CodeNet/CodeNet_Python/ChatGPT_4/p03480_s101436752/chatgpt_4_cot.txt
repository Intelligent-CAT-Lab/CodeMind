<<<Analysis>>>
The variable S is initialized to the string "010" after stripping any leading or trailing whitespace.
The variable K is initialized to the length of S, which is 3.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to len(S)-2 (inclusive), meaning it will consider the indices 0 and 1 for the string "010".
For each index i, the code checks if the character at position i is different from the character at position i+1.
- When i is 0, S[i] is '0' and S[i+1] is '1', which are different. The code calculates ln as the maximum of i+1 (which is 1) and len(S)-i-1 (which is 2). ln is therefore 2. K is updated to the minimum of ln (2) and K (3), so K becomes 2.
- When i is 1, S[i] is '1' and S[i+1] is '0', which are different. The code calculates ln as the maximum of i+1 (which is 2) and len(S)-i-1 (which is 1). ln is therefore 2. K is updated to the minimum of ln (2) and K (2), so K remains 2.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of K, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
