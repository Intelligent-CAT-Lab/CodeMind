<<<Analysis>>>
The variables X and Y are initialized to 3 and 20, respectively.
The code enters a loop that will iterate up to 10^18 times, but it will break out of the loop before reaching that number based on a condition.
The condition inside the loop is checking if X multiplied by 2 raised to the power of i is greater than Y.
The loop starts with i = 0 and checks if 3 * 2^0 (which is 3) is greater than 20. It is not, so the loop continues to the next iteration.
Next, i = 1 and checks if 3 * 2^1 (which is 6) is greater than 20. It is not, so the loop continues.
Next, i = 2 and checks if 3 * 2^2 (which is 12) is greater than 20. It is not, so the loop continues.
Next, i = 3 and checks if 3 * 2^3 (which is 24) is greater than 20. It is, so the loop prints the value of i, which is 3, and then breaks.
Therefore, the output of the code will be 3.
