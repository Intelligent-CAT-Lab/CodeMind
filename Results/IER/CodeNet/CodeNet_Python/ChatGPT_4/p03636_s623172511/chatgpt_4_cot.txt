<<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized with the string 'internationalization'.
The variable l is assigned the string representation of the length of s minus 2, which is the length of 'internationalization' (20 characters) minus 2, resulting in 18.
The code then prints the first character of s, which is 'i', followed by the value of l, which is '18', and then the last character of s, which is 'n'.
The output will be the first character of the input string, the number of characters between the first and last character, and the last character of the input string.
