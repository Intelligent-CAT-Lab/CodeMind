<<<Analysis>>>
The code has a predefined list `ans` with specific values.
The code reads an integer input and uses it as an index to access the corresponding element in the `ans` list.
Given the input `1`, the code will access the element at index 1 of the `ans` list.
The element at index 1 in the `ans` list is `1`.
Therefore, the code will output the value `1`.
