<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a list named 'List' with a sequence of integers.
The variable K is initialized with the input value, which is 6 in this case.
The code then prints the value at the index K-1 of the list 'List', because list indices in Python are 0-based.
For the input 6, the code will print the value at index 6-1, which is index 5.
Looking at the list, the value at index 5 is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
