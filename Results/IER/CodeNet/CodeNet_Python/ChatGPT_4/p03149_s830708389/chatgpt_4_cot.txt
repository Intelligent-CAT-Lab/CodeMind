<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to a list of integers from the input, which are [1, 7, 9, 4].
The variable check is calculated as the product of the counts of 1s, 9s, 7s, and 4s in the list n.
The code uses list comprehensions to count the occurrences of each number:
- sum(x==1 for x in n) counts the number of 1s, which is 1.
- sum(x==9 for x in n) counts the number of 9s, which is 1.
- sum(x==7 for x in n) counts the number of 7s, which is 1.
- sum(x==4 for x in n) counts the number of 4s, which is 1.
The product of these counts is 1 * 1 * 1 * 1, which equals 1.
Since check equals 1, the condition in the if statement is true, and "YES" is printed.
<<<Output>>>
YES
