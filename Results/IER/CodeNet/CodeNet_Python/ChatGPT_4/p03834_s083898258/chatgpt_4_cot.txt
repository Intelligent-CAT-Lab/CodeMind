<<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized with the string "happy,newyear,enjoy".
The code then calls the replace method on the string s, replacing all occurrences of the comma ',' with a space ' '.
The result of this operation is "happy newyear enjoy".
The code prints the resulting string.
<<<Output>>>
happy newyear enjoy
