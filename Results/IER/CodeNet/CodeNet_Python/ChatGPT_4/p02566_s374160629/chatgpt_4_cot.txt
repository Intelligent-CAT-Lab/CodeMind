<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function `SuffixArray` that takes a string `S`, appends a "$" to it, and computes its suffix array and longest common prefix (LCP) array. The main function reads the input string `S`, calls `SuffixArray` to get the suffix array and LCP array, and then calculates the number of distinct substrings in `S` by subtracting the sum of the LCP array from the total number of possible substrings in `S`, which is `N * (N+1) // 2`.

Given the input string `S = "abcbcba"`, the code will perform the following steps:

1. Append "$" to `S`, making it "abcbcba$".
2. Initialize the suffix array and character classes for the initial sorting based on the individual characters.
3. Perform the doubling algorithm to sort cyclic substrings of length 2^k for k from 0 to the number of bits needed to represent the length of `S`.
4. After sorting, compute the LCP array, which contains the lengths of the longest common prefixes between adjacent suffixes in the sorted suffix array.
5. Calculate the number of distinct substrings by subtracting the sum of the LCP array from the total number of possible substrings, which is `N * (N+1) // 2`.

The suffix array for "abcbcba$" is ["$", "a$", "abcbcba$", "ba$", "bcbcba$", "bcba$", "cbcba$", "cba$"].
The LCP array for this suffix array is [0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 1, 0].

The total number of possible substrings of "abcbcba" is `7 * (7+1) // 2 = 28`.
The sum of the LCP array is `0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 4`.

Therefore, the number of distinct substrings is `28 - 4 = 24`.
