<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a, b, and k are initialized to 8, 12, and 2, respectively.
An empty list named ans is created to store the common divisors of a and b.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to the minimum of a and b (inclusive), which is 1 to 8 in this case.
For each value val in this range, the code checks if both a and b are divisible by val (i.e., val is a common divisor).
The common divisors found are 1, 2, 4, and 8.
These divisors are appended to the ans list.
After the loop, the code prints the k-th last element of the ans list, which is the second last element in this case.
The second last element in the ans list is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
