<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a, b, and c are initialized to 1, 1, and 10, respectively.
The variable cnt is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of even numbers among a, b, and c.
The code checks if a is even. Since 1 is not even, cnt remains 0.
The code checks if b is even. Since 1 is not even, cnt remains 0.
The code checks if c is even. Since 10 is even, cnt is incremented by 1 and becomes 1.
After checking all three variables, cnt is 1, which is less than 2.
Since cnt is not greater than or equal to 2, the code prints 'Hom'.
<<<Output>>>
Hom
