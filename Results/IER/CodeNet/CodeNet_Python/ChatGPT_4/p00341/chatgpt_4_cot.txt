The code initializes a list 'a' with 100 elements, all set to 0.
The list 'b' is created by mapping the input to integers, resulting in the list [1, 1, 3, 4, 8, 9, 7, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5].
The code then iterates over the first 12 elements of 'b' (which are all the elements in this case) and increments the corresponding index in 'a' by 1 for each occurrence of a number. The index is determined by subtracting 1 from the number (since list indices are 0-based).
After this loop, 'a' will have the following non-zero values: a[0]=2, a[2]=2, a[3]=2, a[4]=3, a[6]=1, a[7]=1, a[8]=1.
Next, the code initializes a variable 'c' to 0, which will count the number of groups of 4 identical numbers.
The code then iterates over the list 'a' and checks if the value at each index is non-zero and a multiple of 4. If so, it adds the integer division of that value by 4 to 'c'.
In this case, none of the non-zero values in 'a' are multiples of 4, so 'c' remains 0.
Finally, the code prints 'yes' if 'c' equals 3, otherwise it prints 'no'. Since 'c' is 0, the output will be 'no'.
