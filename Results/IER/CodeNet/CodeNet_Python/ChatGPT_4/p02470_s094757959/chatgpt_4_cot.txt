<<<Analysis>>>
The input is a single integer, which is 6. Both n and m are initialized to this value.
The variable i is initialized to 2, which will be used to check for factors of n.
The while loop will run as long as i*i is less than or equal to n. For the input 6, the loop will run for i values 2 and 3.
When i is 2, since 6 is divisible by 2, m is updated to m//i*(i-1), which is 6//2*(2-1) = 3*1 = 3.
Inside the while loop, n is divided by i until it is no longer divisible by i. So n becomes 6//2 = 3.
i is then incremented to 3.
When i is 3, since 3 is divisible by 3, m is updated to m//i*(i-1), which is 3//3*(3-1) = 1*2 = 2.
Inside the while loop, n is divided by i until it is no longer divisible by i. So n becomes 3//3 = 1.
i is incremented to 4, but the loop stops because i*i (16) is no longer less than or equal to n (1).
Since n is now 1, the if condition after the loop is not executed.
The final value of m, which is 2, is printed.
