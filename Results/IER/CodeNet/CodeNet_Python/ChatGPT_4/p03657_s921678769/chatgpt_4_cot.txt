<<<Analysis>>>
The variables A and B are initialized to 4 and 5, respectively.
The code checks if either A or B is divisible by 3, or if their sum (A + B) is divisible by 3.
Since neither 4 nor 5 is divisible by 3, the first two conditions are false.
However, the sum of A and B is 9 (4 + 5), which is divisible by 3.
Therefore, the condition (A + B) % 3 == 0 is true.
Since one of the conditions for printing 'Possible' is met, the code will print 'Possible'.
<<<Output>>>
Possible
