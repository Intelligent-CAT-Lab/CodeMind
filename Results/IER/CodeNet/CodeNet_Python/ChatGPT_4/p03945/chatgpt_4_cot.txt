<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines an anonymous lambda function that takes a single argument x. This function counts the occurrences of the substring 'WB' and 'BW' in the input string x and returns the sum of these counts.
The input string 'BBBWW' is passed to this lambda function.
The function counts the occurrences of 'WB' in 'BBBWW', which is 0 because there is no such substring.
The function also counts the occurrences of 'BW' in 'BBBWW', which is 1 because there is one such substring.
The sum of these counts is 0 + 1, which equals 1.
The result of the lambda function is then printed out.
