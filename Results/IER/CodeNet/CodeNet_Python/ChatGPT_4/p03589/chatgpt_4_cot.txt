The variable N is initialized to 2.
The code then enters a nested loop where h ranges from 1 to 3500 and n ranges from h to 3500.
For each pair of (h, n), the code checks if the expression `4*n*h - N*h - N*n` is greater than 0.
If it is, the code then checks if `(N*h*n) % (4*n*h - N*h - N*n)` equals 0, which means that `(N*h*n)` is divisible by `(4*n*h - N*h - N*n)`.
If the divisibility condition is met, the code calculates `w` as `(N*h*n) / (4*n*h - N*h - N*n)`, prints the values of h, n, and w, and then exits the program immediately using `sys.exit()`.
The code is designed to find the first triplet (h, n, w) that satisfies the given conditions and then stop.

For N=2, the first triplet (h, n, w) that satisfies the conditions is found when h=1 and n=2:
- The expression `4*n*h - N*h - N*n` becomes `4*2*1 - 2*1 - 2*2` which equals 2, and is greater than 0.
- The expression `(N*h*n) % (4*n*h - N*h - N*n)` becomes `(2*1*2) % (4*2*1 - 2*1 - 2*2)` which equals 0, meaning the divisibility condition is met.
- The value of `w` is calculated as `(2*1*2) / (4*2*1 - 2*1 - 2*2)` which equals 4.

Therefore, the output will be the values of h, n, and w, which are 1, 2, and 4 respectively.
