The variables a and b are initialized to 54 and 20, respectively.
The function gcp(x, y) is defined to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.
The function enters a while loop that continues as long as the minimum of x and y is not 0.
Inside the loop, if x is less than y, their values are swapped. This ensures that x is always greater than or equal to y.
Then, x is assigned the value of x modulo y, which is the remainder of x divided by y.
This process repeats until y becomes 0, at which point the GCD is the non-zero value, which is the current value of x.
The function returns the maximum of x and y, which at the end of the loop will be the GCD.
For the input values 54 and 20, the loop will proceed as follows:
- First iteration: x = 54, y = 20, x % y = 14, so x becomes 14.
- Second iteration: x = 20, y = 14 (since x < y, they are swapped), x % y = 6, so x becomes 6.
- Third iteration: x = 14, y = 6 (swap again), x % y = 2, so x becomes 2.
- Fourth iteration: x = 6, y = 2, x % y = 0, so x becomes 0.
Now y is 2 and x is 0, so the loop ends and the function returns the maximum of x and y, which is 2.
The print statement then outputs the result of the gcp function, which is 2.
