<<<Analysis>>>
The variables w, h, x, and y are initialized to 2.0, 3.0, 1.0, and 2.0, respectively, as they are read from the input and converted to float.
The variables mx and my are calculated as the midpoints of the rectangle's width and height, which are w/2 and h/2, resulting in mx = 1.0 and my = 1.5.
An empty list named res is created.
The area of the rectangle is calculated as w*h/2, which is 2.0*3.0/2 = 3.0, and appended to the res list.
The code then checks if the point (x, y) is at the center of the rectangle (mx, my). Since x == mx (1.0 == 1.0) but y != my (2.0 != 1.5), the condition is not met.
Because the condition is not met, a 0 is appended to the res list.
Finally, the code prints the first and second elements of the res list, which are the area of the rectangle divided by 2 (3.0) and the value indicating whether the point is at the center (0).
