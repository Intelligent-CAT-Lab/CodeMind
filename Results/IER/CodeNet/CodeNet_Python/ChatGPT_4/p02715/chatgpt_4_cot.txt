<<<Analysis>>>
The variables N and K are initialized to 3 and 2, respectively.
The variable P is set to 10^9 + 7, which is a large prime number often used for modulo operations in competitive programming to avoid integer overflow.
An array X of size K+1 is created and initialized with zeros. This array will be used to store intermediate values.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the final answer.

The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to K (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 2.
For i = 1:
- X[1] is incremented by 1, so X[1] becomes 1.
- The inner loop does not execute because 1 * 2 is 2, which is the upper limit.
- ans is incremented by X[1] * pow(K//1, N, P), which is 1 * pow(2//1, 3, 10^9+7) = 1 * 8 = 8.

For i = 2:
- X[2] is incremented by 2, so X[2] becomes 2.
- The inner loop does not execute because 2 * 2 is 4, which is greater than K+1.
- ans is incremented by X[2] * pow(K//2, N, P), which is 2 * pow(2//2, 3, 10^9+7) = 2 * 1 = 2.

The final value of ans is 8 + 2 = 10.

The code prints ans % P, which is 10 % (10^9 + 7), and since 10 is much smaller than 10^9 + 7, the result is just 10.
