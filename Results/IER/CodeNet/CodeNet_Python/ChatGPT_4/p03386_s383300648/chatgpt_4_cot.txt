<<<Analysis>>>
The variables A, B, and K are initialized to 3, 8, and 2, respectively.
The code checks if A+K-1 is greater than or equal to B-K+1. In this case, it checks if 3+2-1 >= 8-2+1, which simplifies to 4 >= 7. This condition is false.
Since the condition is false, the code executes the else block.
The else block contains two for loops. The first loop prints the first K numbers starting from A, and the second loop prints the last K numbers up to B.
For the first loop, it will print numbers from 3 to 3+2 (exclusive), which are 3 and 4.
For the second loop, it will print numbers from 8-2+1 to 8+1 (exclusive), which are 7 and 8.
<<<Output>>>

4
7
