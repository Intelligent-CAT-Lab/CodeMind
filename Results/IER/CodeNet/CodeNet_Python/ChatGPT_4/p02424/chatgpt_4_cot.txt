<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a and b are initialized to 8 and 10, respectively.
The code prints the binary representation of the bitwise AND of a and b, bitwise OR of a and b, and bitwise XOR of a and b, each padded to 32 bits with leading zeros.

- The binary representation of 8 is 1000.
- The binary representation of 10 is 1010.

The bitwise AND of 8 and 10 is 1000 & 1010, which is 1000 in binary or 8 in decimal.
The bitwise OR of 8 and 10 is 1000 | 1010, which is 1010 in binary or 10 in decimal.
The bitwise XOR of 8 and 10 is 1000 ^ 1010, which is 0010 in binary or 2 in decimal.

The output will be the 32-bit binary representations of these results, with leading zeros.
