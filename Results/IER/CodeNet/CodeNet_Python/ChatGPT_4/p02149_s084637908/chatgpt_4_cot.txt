<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a series of functions for input processing, but only the LI() function is used in the provided code snippet. The LI() function reads a line from standard input, splits it into a list of integers, and returns that list.

The variable 'a' is assigned the list of integers returned by the LI() function. Given the input `1000 900 850`, 'a' will be `[1000, 900, 850]`.

The variable 's' is assigned the string "ABC".

The code then prints the character from the string 's' at the index corresponding to the maximum value in the list 'a'. The index() function is used to find the index of the maximum value in 'a', which is 1000. Since 1000 is the first element in the list, its index is 0.

The character at index 0 in the string "ABC" is 'A'.

Therefore, the output of the code will be 'A'.
