<<<Analysis>>>
The variables h and w are initialized to 3 and 5, respectively.
The first if statement checks if either h or w is divisible by 3. Since h is 3, which is divisible by 3, the condition is true.
Therefore, the program prints 0 and then calls quit(), which would terminate the program (if it were running as a script).
Since the condition is met and the program is supposed to quit, the function main(h,w) is never called, and the rest of the code is not executed.
