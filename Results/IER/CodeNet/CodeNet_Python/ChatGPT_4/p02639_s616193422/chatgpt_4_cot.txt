<<<Analysis>>>
The variable `a` is initialized with the list of strings `['0', '2', '3', '4', '5']`.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 4 (inclusive).
For each iteration, the code checks if the current index `i` is equal to the integer value of the element at the same index in list `a` minus 1.
The condition is checked as follows:
- When `i` is 0, `int(a[i])-1` is `int('0')-1`, which is `-1`. Since 0 is not equal to -1, the `else` block is executed and `1` is printed.
- When `i` is 1, `int(a[i])-1` is `int('2')-1`, which is `1`. Since 1 is equal to 1, the `continue` statement is executed and the loop moves to the next iteration without printing anything.
- When `i` is 2, `int(a[i])-1` is `int('3')-1`, which is `2`. Since 2 is equal to 2, the `continue` statement is executed and the loop moves to the next iteration without printing anything.
- When `i` is 3, `int(a[i])-1` is `int('4')-1`, which is `3`. Since 3 is equal to 3, the `continue` statement is executed and the loop moves to the next iteration without printing anything.
- When `i` is 4, `int(a[i])-1` is `int('5')-1`, which is `4`. Since 4 is equal to 4, the `continue` statement is executed and the loop moves to the next iteration without printing anything.

The loop ends after the fifth iteration, and the only number printed is `1`.
