<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a, b, and x are initialized to 3, 1, and 5, respectively.
The variable d is calculated as a - b, which is 3 - 1 = 2.
The variable n is calculated as the maximum of 0 and (x - b) // d, which is max(0, (5 - 1) // 2) = max(0, 4 // 2) = max(0, 2) = 2.
The variable ans is calculated as x + n * b, which is 5 + 2 * 1 = 7.
The final output is ans % 1000000007, which is 7 % 1000000007 = 7.
