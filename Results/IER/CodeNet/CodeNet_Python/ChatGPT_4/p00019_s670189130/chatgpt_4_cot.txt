<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 5.
The variable sum is initialized to 1, which will be used to calculate the factorial of n.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 5.
For each number i in this range, it multiplies the current value of sum by i.
The loop processes as follows:
- i = 1: sum = 1 * 1 = 1
- i = 2: sum = 1 * 2 = 2
- i = 3: sum = 2 * 3 = 6
- i = 4: sum = 6 * 4 = 24
- i = 5: sum = 24 * 5 = 120
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum, which is the factorial of n (5!), and in this case, it is 120.
<<<Output>>>
120
