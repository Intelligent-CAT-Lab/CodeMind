<<<Analysis>>>
The input is `2 1 3`, which means n=2, a=1, and b=3.

1. The `solve` function is called with n=2, a=1, and b=3.
2. It calculates `c = a ^ b`, which is `1 ^ 3 = 2`.
3. It checks if `popcnt(c)` is even. Since `popcnt(2)` is 1 (binary representation of 2 is '10'), it is odd, so the check passes.
4. It calls `solve2(n, c)` with `n=2` and `c=2`.
5. In `solve2`, it calculates `c_1 = popcnt(c)` which is 1, and `d = (1 << c_1) - 1` which is `1`.
6. It calls `solve3(n, d, c_1)` with `n=2`, `d=1`, and `c_1=1`.
7. In `solve3`, since `n != cnt`, it proceeds to generate a Gray code sequence `a` for `n - cnt = 1`, which is `[0, 1]`.
8. It also calls `solve4(cnt)` with `cnt=1`, which returns `[0, 1]`.
9. It then merges these sequences, alternating the order of `a` for each element in `b`, resulting in `[0, 1, 3, 2]`.
10. It calls `move(ret_d, n, d, c)` with `ret_d=[0, 1, 3, 2]`, `n=2`, `d=1`, and `c=2`.
11. In `move`, it creates a mapping of bit positions from `d` to `c` and applies this mapping to each element in `ret_d`, resulting in `[0, 2, 3, 1]`.
12. The `solve` function then returns `[i ^ a for i in ret_c]` with `a=1` and `ret_c=[0, 2, 3, 1]`, which results in `[1, 3, 2, 0]`.
13. The program prints 'YES' and the resulting list `[1, 3, 2, 0]`.
