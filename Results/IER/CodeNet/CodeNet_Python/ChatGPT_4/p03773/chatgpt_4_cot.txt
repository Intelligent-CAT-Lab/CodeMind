<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a and b are initialized to 9 and 12, respectively, from the input.
The code calculates the sum of a and b, which is 9 + 12 = 21.
Then, it calculates the remainder of the sum when divided by 24, which is 21 % 24.
Since 21 is less than 24, the remainder is 21 itself.
The code then prints the result of the remainder operation.
<<<Output>>>
21
