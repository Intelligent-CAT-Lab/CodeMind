The variable `mod` is initialized to 10^9 + 7, which is a large prime number often used for modulo operations in competitive programming to avoid integer overflow.

The function `modpow(x, n)` is defined to calculate x raised to the power of n modulo `mod`. It uses the binary exponentiation method to efficiently compute large powers.

The variable `N` is initialized to 2, based on the input.

The variable `ans` is calculated using the formula `(modpow(10,N) - 2*modpow(9,N) + modpow(8,N)) % mod`. This formula seems to be calculating the number of unique N-digit numbers where the digits can be from 0 to 9, subtracting the count of numbers where the digits are from 0 to 8 (since 9 is excluded twice), and then adding the count of numbers where the digits are from 0 to 7.

For N = 2, the calculations are as follows:
- `modpow(10, 2)` calculates 10^2 % mod, which is 100.
- `modpow(9, 2)` calculates 9^2 % mod, which is 81.
- `modpow(8, 2)` calculates 8^2 % mod, which is 64.

The final answer is calculated as `(100 - 2*81 + 64) % mod`, which simplifies to `(100 - 162 + 64) % mod` and further to `(2 + 64) % mod`, which is `66 % mod`.

Since 66 is less than `mod`, the modulo operation does not change the value, and the final answer is 66.
