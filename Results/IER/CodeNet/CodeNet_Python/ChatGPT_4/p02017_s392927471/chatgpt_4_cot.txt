<<<Analysis>>>
The variables H, W, x, and y are initialized to 3, 5, 1, and 4, respectively.
The code checks if the product of H and W is odd (which is 3*5=15, odd) and if the sum of x and y is odd (which is 1+4=5, odd).
Since both conditions are true (15 is odd and 5 is odd), the code prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
