<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a list `lis` with a sequence of integers.
It then prints the element of the list that corresponds to the index given by the input minus 1 (since list indices in Python are 0-based).
The input provided is `6`.
Therefore, the code will print the element at index 6 - 1 = 5, which is the sixth element in the list.
The sixth element in the list `lis` is `2`.
<<<Output>>>
