<<<Analysis>>>
The input string "3 5" is split into a list of strings ['3', '5'].
The variable A is initialized to the integer value of the first element of the list, which is 3.
The variable B is initialized to the integer value of the second element of the list, which is 5.
The variable kimawasi is calculated by integer division of B by A, which is 5 // 3, resulting in 1.
The code then checks if the remainder of B divided by A is greater than 0, which is true since 5 % 3 is 2.
Since the condition is true, kimawasi is incremented by 1, resulting in kimawasi being 2.
The code prints the value of kimawasi.
<<<Output>>>
2
