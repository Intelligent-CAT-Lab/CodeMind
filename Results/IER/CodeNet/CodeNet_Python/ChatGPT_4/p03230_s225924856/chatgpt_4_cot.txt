<<<Analysis>>>
The input N is initialized to 3.
The function solve(N) is called with N = 3.
The function first checks if N is 1, which it is not, so it skips the first if block.
The function then initializes K to -1 and enters a loop to find a K such that K * (K - 1) / 2 equals N.
The loop finds that when K is 2, K * (K - 1) / 2 equals 1, which does not match N (3), so it continues.
When K is 3, K * (K - 1) / 2 equals 3, which matches N, so K is set to 3 and the loop ends.
Since K is not -1, the function skips the next if block that would print "No".
The function then initializes a list of lists, ans, with K empty lists.
It then enters a nested loop to fill these lists with numbers in a way that each pair of lists shares exactly one number and no number is repeated within a list.
The outer loop runs from 0 to K (exclusive), and the inner loop runs from i + 1 to K (exclusive).
The first iteration of the outer loop sets i to 0, and the inner loop runs with j values 1 and 2.
The number 1 is appended to ans[0] and ans[1], and num is incremented to 2.
The second iteration of the inner loop appends the number 2 to ans[0] and ans[2], and num is incremented to 3.
The outer loop then increments i to 1, and the inner loop runs with j value 2.
The number 3 is appended to ans[1] and ans[2].
The function then prints "Yes" to indicate that a solution is found.
It prints K, which is 3.
It then prints the contents of ans, which are three lists: [1, 2], [1, 3], and [2, 3].
Each list is printed with its length followed by its elements, separated by spaces.
