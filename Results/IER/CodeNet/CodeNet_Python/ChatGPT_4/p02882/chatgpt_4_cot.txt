<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a, b, and x are initialized to 2, 2, and 4, respectively.
The variable h is calculated as x divided by a squared, which is 4 / (2^2) = 1.
The condition checks if h is greater than or equal to b/2, which is 2/2 = 1. Since h is equal to 1, the condition is true.
The code then calculates V as 2 times (a squared times b minus x) divided by a cubed, which is 2 * ((2^2 * 2 - 4) / (2^3)) = 2 * ((8 - 4) / 8) = 2 * (4 / 8) = 2 * 0.5 = 1.
The angle is then calculated using the arctangent of V, which is math.atan(1). The result of math.atan(1) is π/4 radians.
The angle in radians is converted to degrees using math.degrees, which converts π/4 radians to 45 degrees.
The code prints the value of ans, which is 45.
<<<Output>>>
45.0
