The input values are n=1.0, d=3.0, and x=3.0.
The function `solve` is called with these values.

The variable `ans` is initialized to 0.
The while loop will run as long as n is not zero.

In the first iteration:
- `ans` is updated to 0 + 3.0 + (2 * 1.0 - 1) * 3.0 / 2 = 3.0 + 1.5 = 4.5
- `d` is updated to ((1.0 + 1) * 3.0 + 5 * 3.0 / 2) / 1.0 = (2 * 3.0 + 7.5) / 1.0 = 13.5 / 1.0 = 13.5
- `x` is updated to 3.0 * (1.0 + 2) / 1.0 = 3.0 * 3.0 / 1.0 = 9.0
- `n` is decremented by 1, so n becomes 0.

The loop ends because n is now 0.

The function returns `ans` which is 4.5.

The print statement formats the answer to 10 decimal places, so the output will be 4.5000000000.
