<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized to 4 by the getN() function.
The code then enters a loop that iterates up to 10**4 (10000), looking for the smallest integer i such that the sum of integers from 1 to i (inclusive) is greater than or equal to N.
The sum of integers from 1 to i is given by the formula i*(i+1)/2.
For i = 1, 2, and 3, the sum is 1, 3, and 6, respectively. When i = 3, the sum is greater than N (4), so M is set to 3, and the loop breaks.
The variable upper is calculated as the sum of integers from 1 to M, which is 6.
The code then initializes an empty list tar and calculates the difference between upper and N, which is 6 - 4 = 2.
In the next loop, the code iterates from 0 to M-1 (which is 2), and for each i, it calculates j as i+1.
If j is not equal to diff (which is 2), the code would append j to the list tar and print j. However, the line to append j to tar is commented out, so only the print statement is executed.
The numbers 1 and 3 are printed because they are not equal to diff (2).
The commented out code at the end is not executed, so it has no effect on the output.
