<<<Analysis>>>
The variables A, B, C, X, and Y are initialized to 1500, 2000, 1600, 3, and 2, respectively.
The variable ans is initialized to a large number (10^9 + 7), which will be used to find the minimum cost.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 10^5 (inclusive).
For each iteration i, the code calculates the cost of buying i AB pizzas (which can be used as either A or B pizzas) at 2*C each, and then the necessary number of A pizzas (if X-i is positive) and B pizzas (if Y-i is positive) at their respective costs.
The code checks if the calculated cost is less than the current ans. If it is, it updates ans to this new cost.
The loop will check all possible combinations of AB, A, and B pizzas to find the minimum cost.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is the minimum cost.
For the given input, the minimum cost is achieved when i = 1, which gives us 1 AB pizza (which can be split into 1 A and 1 B), and then we need to buy 2 more A pizzas and 1 more B pizza. The total cost is 2*1600 + 2*1500 + 1*2000 = 8200.
<<<Output>>>
8200
