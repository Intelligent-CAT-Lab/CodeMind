<<<Analysis>>>
The code is designed to perform some combinatorial calculations based on the input values of `k` and `n`. The input `3 3` sets `k` to 3 and `n` to 3.

First, the code initializes a large number `INF` and the modulus `mod` to 998244353. It then defines several functions for input handling, which are not used because the input is provided directly in the code.

The code sets up factorial (`fac`) and modular inverse (`inv`) arrays for numbers up to `n + 1`, where `n` is set to 6000. These arrays are used to calculate combinations efficiently using the modular inverse property.

The `comb` function calculates the combination of `n` and `r` modulo `mod`. The `h` function calculates a combinatorial function using the `comb` function.

The main part of the code iterates over the range `2` to `2 * k + 1` (which is 2 to 7 for the input `3 3`). For each `i` in this range, it calculates a value `ret` based on whether `i` is even or odd, using different formulas. It uses the `comb` and `h` functions defined earlier to calculate parts of the formula.

For each `i`, the code prints the result `ret % mod`.

Now, let's calculate the output for each `i` from 2 to 7:

For `i = 2`:
- `m` is calculated as `min(1, 2)`, which is 1.
- Since `i` is even, the loop runs for `j` from 0 to 1.
- For `j = 0`, `ret` is calculated using the formula for `j = 0`.
- For `j = 1`, `ret` is calculated using the formula for `j > 0`.

For `i = 3` to `i = 7`, similar calculations are performed with the appropriate values of `m` and the formulas for even and odd `i`.

Finally, the code prints the calculated `ret % mod` for each `i`.

The output will be the sequence of these values for `i` from 2 to 7.
