<<<Analysis>>>
The variable x is initialized to 10.
The variable ans is initialized to 1, which will be used to store the maximum value of b raised to the power of p (b**p) that is less than or equal to x.
The code then enters a nested loop:
- The outer loop iterates over b from 0 to x-1 (0 to 9 in this case).
- The inner loop iterates over p from 2 to x-1 (2 to 9 in this case).
For each combination of b and p, the code checks if b**p is less than or equal to x.
If it is, the code updates ans to be the maximum of the current ans and b**p.
If b**p is greater than x, the inner loop breaks and no further powers of b are considered.
The maximum values of b**p that are less than or equal to 10 are:
- 2**2 = 4
- 2**3 = 8
- 3**2 = 9
All other combinations of b and p will result in values greater than 10 or will be less than the values already found.
The maximum value found is 9, so ans will be 9 after the loops finish.
The code prints the final value of ans, which is 9.
<<<Output>>>
9
