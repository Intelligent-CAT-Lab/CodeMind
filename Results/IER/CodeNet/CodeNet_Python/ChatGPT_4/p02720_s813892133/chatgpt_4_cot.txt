The variable K is initialized to 15.
The code imports sys and Queue, and initializes a queue with numbers 1 through 9.
If K is less than or equal to 9, the code would print K and exit. Since K is 15, this condition is not met.
The variable count is initialized to 0.
The code enters a while loop, where it will repeatedly get elements from the queue and increment count.
For each element j retrieved from the queue, the code checks if count equals K. If it does, it prints j and breaks the loop.
If j's last digit is not 0, it puts a new number formed by appending the last digit of j minus 1 to j into the queue.
It always puts a new number formed by appending the last digit of j to j into the queue.
If j's last digit is not 9, it puts a new number formed by appending the last digit of j plus 1 to j into the queue.
The sequence of numbers that will be put into the queue starting from the initial numbers (1-9) will be: 10, 12, 21, 11, 13, 22, 20, 12, 14, 23, 21, 22, 24, 32, 30, 31, 33, 42, 40, 41, 43, 52, 50, 51, 53, 62, 60, 61, 63, 72, 70, 71, 73, 82, 80, 81, 83, 92, 90, 91, 93, 102, ...
The 15th number in this sequence is 21.
Therefore, the output will be 21.
