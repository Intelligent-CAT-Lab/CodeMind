<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a, b, and c are initialized to 2, 3, and 9, respectively.
The commented line is not executed, so we ignore the condition involving square roots.
The code checks the condition `4*a*b < (c-a-b)**2 and c-a-b > 0`.
Substituting the values of a, b, and c, we get `4*2*3 < (9-2-3)**2 and 9-2-3 > 0`.
This simplifies to `24 < 16 and 4 > 0`.
The first part of the condition `24 < 16` is false, so the entire condition is false regardless of the second part.
Since the condition is false, the code will print "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
