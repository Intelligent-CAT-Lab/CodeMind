<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a and b are initialized to 15 and 25, respectively, from the input.
The code calculates the product of a and b, which is 15 * 25 = 375.
This product is then divided by 3.305785, resulting in approximately 113.376683.
The result is formatted to six decimal places using "{0:.6f}".format(), which will give us 113.376683 rounded to six decimal places.
The formatted result is then printed.
