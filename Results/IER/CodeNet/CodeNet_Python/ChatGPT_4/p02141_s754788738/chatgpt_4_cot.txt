<<<Analysis>>>
The input values are doubled and assigned to the variables W, H, w, h, x, y, resulting in W=12000, H=10000, w=40, h=20, x=800, y=600.
X1 and Y1 are set to half the width and height of the larger rectangle, but negative, resulting in X1=-6000 and Y1=-5000.
X2 and Y2 are set to half the width and height of the larger rectangle, resulting in X2=6000 and Y2=5000.
x1 is the maximum of x - w/2 and X1, which is the maximum of 800 - 40/2 and -6000, resulting in x1=780.
y1 is the maximum of y - h/2 and Y1, which is the maximum of 600 - 20/2 and -5000, resulting in y1=590.
x2 is the minimum of x + w/2 and X2, which is the minimum of 800 + 40/2 and 6000, resulting in x2=820.
y2 is the minimum of y + h/2 and Y2, which is the minimum of 600 + 20/2 and 5000, resulting in y2=610.
mx is the average of x1 and x2, which is (780 + 820) / 2.0, resulting in mx=800.0.
my is the average of y1 and y2, which is (590 + 610) / 2.0, resulting in my=600.0.
The output is the division of my by mx, which is 600.0 / 800.0, resulting in 0.75.
The output is printed with 10 decimal places, resulting in 0.7500000000.
