<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a, b, and k are initialized to 8, 12, and 2, respectively.
The function gcd(x, y) is defined to calculate the greatest common divisor of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.
The variable ans is initialized to the result of gcd(a, b), which is the greatest common divisor of 8 and 12. The gcd of 8 and 12 is 4.
The variable cnt is initialized to 1, which will be used to count the number of divisors found.
The code enters a while loop that continues until cnt is less than k, which is 2 in this case. Since cnt starts at 1, the loop will run only once.
Inside the loop, ans is decremented by 1 (ans becomes 3), and then it checks if both a and b are divisible by the new ans. Since 3 is not a divisor of 8 or 12, the if condition is not satisfied, and cnt is not incremented.
The loop continues, decrementing ans by 1 each time and checking the divisibility condition. The next value of ans that satisfies the condition (a % ans == 0 and b % ans == 0) is 2, because both 8 and 12 are divisible by 2.
When ans is 2, the if condition is satisfied, and cnt is incremented to 2, which equals k. The loop ends.
The final value of ans, which is 2, is printed.
