<<<Analysis>>>
The input `1` initializes the variable N to 1.
The code defines a class `Vector` with methods for printing, addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and rotation.
Two `Vector` instances are created, `a` with coordinates (0, 0) and `b` with coordinates (100, 0).
The `koch` function is a recursive function that draws a Koch curve of depth `d` between two points `a` and `b`.
Since N is 1, the function will perform one level of recursion.
The first call to `koch` is with `d` equal to 1, `a` as (0, 0), and `b` as (100, 0).
The function calculates points `s`, `u`, and `t` that divide the line segment `ab` into three equal parts and creates an equilateral triangle between `s` and `t`.
The coordinates of `s` are (33.3333, 0), `u` are (50, 28.8675), and `t` are (66.6667, 0) after the rotation by 60 degrees.
The function then makes recursive calls with `d` decremented by 1, which will not print anything since `d` becomes 0 and the base case is reached.
The points `s`, `u`, and `t` are printed in the order they are visited.
Finally, the point `b` is printed.
The output will be the coordinates of the points `a`, `s`, `u`, `t`, and `b` in that order, each on a new line.
