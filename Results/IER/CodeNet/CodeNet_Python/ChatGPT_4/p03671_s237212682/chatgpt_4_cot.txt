<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a, b, and c are initialized to 700, 600, and 780, respectively, by splitting the input string and converting each part to an integer.
The code then prints the minimum of the three possible sums of pairs of these numbers: a+b, b+c, and c+a.
The sums are as follows:
- a+b = 700 + 600 = 1300
- b+c = 600 + 780 = 1380
- c+a = 780 + 700 = 1480
The minimum of these sums is 1300, which is the sum of a and b.
Therefore, the output will be 1300.
