<<<Analysis>>>
The code imports the sys module, which is used to read from the standard input.
The variables a and b are initialized with the values 5 and 8, respectively, which are read from the standard input and converted to integers using the map function.
The print function is then called to output the sum of a and b, which is 5 + 8.
The output will be the result of this addition, which is 13.
<<<Output>>>
13
