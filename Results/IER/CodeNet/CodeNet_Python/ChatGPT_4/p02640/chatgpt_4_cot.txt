<<<Analysis>>>
The variables x and y are initialized to 3 and 8, respectively.
The variable count is initialized to 0, which will be used as a flag to indicate if a solution is found.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to x (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 3 for variable a.
For each value of a, it calculates the value of b as x - a.
It then checks if the equation (2*a + 4*b) equals y.
If the equation is satisfied, count is set to 1 and the loop breaks.
If the equation is not satisfied, the loop continues to the next iteration.
The loop will check the following pairs of (a, b): (0, 3), (1, 2), (2, 1), and (3, 0).
For the pair (a, b) = (2, 1), the equation (2*2 + 4*1) equals 8, which is the value of y.
Therefore, count is set to 1 and the loop breaks.
After the loop, the code prints "Yes" if count equals 1, otherwise it prints "No".
Since count is set to 1, the output will be "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
