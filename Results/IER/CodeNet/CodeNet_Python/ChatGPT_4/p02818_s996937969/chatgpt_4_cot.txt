<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a, b, and k are initialized to 2, 3, and 3, respectively.
The code checks if a is greater than or equal to k. Since a is 2 and k is 3, this condition is false.
Next, the code checks if a + b is greater than or equal to k. Since a + b is 5 and k is 3, this condition is true.
Since the second condition is true, the code executes the corresponding block and prints (0, a + b - k), which is (0, 5 - 3).
The output will be the tuple (0, 2).
<<<Output>>>
