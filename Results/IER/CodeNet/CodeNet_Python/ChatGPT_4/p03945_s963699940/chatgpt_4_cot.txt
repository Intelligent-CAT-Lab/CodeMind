<<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized to the string 'BBBWW'.
The code uses a generator expression within the sum function to count the number of times consecutive characters in the string are different.
The zip function is used to iterate over pairs of consecutive characters by combining s[1:] (which is 'BBWW') and s[:-1] (which is 'BBBW').
The pairs of consecutive characters generated by zip are ('B', 'B'), ('B', 'B'), ('B', 'W'), and ('W', 'W').
The generator expression (a != b for a, b in zip(s[1:], s[:-1])) evaluates to (False, False, True, False) because only the third pair ('B', 'W') consists of different characters.
The sum function then counts the number of True values in the generator expression, which is 1.
The code prints the result of the sum function, which is 1.
