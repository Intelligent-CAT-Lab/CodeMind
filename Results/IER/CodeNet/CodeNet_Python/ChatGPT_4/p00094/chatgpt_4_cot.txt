<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a and b are initialized to 15 and 25, respectively, by unpacking the input string split by spaces and converting each part to an integer.
The code checks if both a and b are less than or equal to 100, which they are.
Since the condition is met, it calculates the product of a and b, which is 15 * 25 = 375, and then divides this by 3.305785.
The result of the division is then formatted to 4 decimal places.
The formatted result is printed, which is 113.3776 when rounded to 4 decimal places.
<<<Output>>>
113.3776
