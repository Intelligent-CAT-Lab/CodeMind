<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a and b are initialized to 1000 and 3000, respectively, from the input.
The variable x is calculated as the integer division of the sum of a and b by 2. This is the average of the two numbers.
The sum of a and b is 1000 + 3000 = 4000.
The integer division of 4000 by 2 is 2000.
The code then prints the value of x, which is 2000.
<<<Output>>>
2000
