<<<Analysis>>>
The sets a, b, and c are initialized with specific integers representing months with 31 days, 30 days, and 28/29 days, respectively.
The variables x and y are initialized with the input values 1 and 3, respectively.
The code checks if both x and y belong to the same set among a, b, or c.
Since both 1 and 3 are in set a, the condition (x in a and y in a) evaluates to True.
As the condition is True, 'Yes' is printed.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
