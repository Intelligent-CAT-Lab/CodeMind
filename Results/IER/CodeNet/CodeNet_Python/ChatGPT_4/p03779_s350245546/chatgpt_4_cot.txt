The variable X is initialized to 6.
The main function is defined and then called.
Inside the main function, variable t is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of iterations.
Variable curr is also initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers from 1 to t.
The code enters a while loop that continues as long as curr is less than X (6 in this case).
In each iteration of the loop, t is incremented by 1 and curr is incremented by the new value of t.
The loop runs as follows:
- First iteration: t = 1, curr = 0 + 1 = 1
- Second iteration: t = 2, curr = 1 + 2 = 3
- Third iteration: t = 3, curr = 3 + 3 = 6
At this point, curr is equal to X, so the loop terminates.
The code then prints the final value of t, which is 3.
