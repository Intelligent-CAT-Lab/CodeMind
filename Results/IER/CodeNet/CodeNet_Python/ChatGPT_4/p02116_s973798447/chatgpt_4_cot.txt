The input is the integer 2.
The code increments the input by 1, resulting in n = 3.
The expression `-~~n` is equivalent to `-n` because `~~n` is a double bitwise NOT operation, which essentially leaves n unchanged.
Therefore, `-~~n` is `-3`.
The bitwise AND operation `n & -n` is a common way to isolate the rightmost 1-bit of n and set all other bits to 0.
For the number 3 (binary: 11), the rightmost 1-bit is in the least significant bit position.
The bitwise AND of 3 and -3 (binary: 11 & 11) results in 3, because the two's complement of 3 is also 11 in binary for a 2-bit representation.
Thus, the output of the code will be 3.
