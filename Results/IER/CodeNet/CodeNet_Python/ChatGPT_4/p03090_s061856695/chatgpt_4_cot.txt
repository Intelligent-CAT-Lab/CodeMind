<<<Analysis>>>
The variable num is initialized to 3.
The check_list is initialized to a list of zeros with a length of num * num, which is 3 * 3 = 9.

The make_bridge function is defined to set a value of 1 in the check_list to represent a bridge between two islands, island1 and island2. The index for this is calculated based on the island numbers.

Since num is 3, which is not even, sum_pair is set to num, which is 3.

The code then enters a nested loop where it iterates over pairs of islands (i, j) where i ranges from 0 to 2 and j ranges from 0 to i-1. For each pair, it checks if the sum of the island numbers (i+1 and j+1) is not equal to sum_pair (3). If it is not, it sets the corresponding value in check_list to 1.

After the nested loop, the code initializes bridge_num to 0 and then iterates over the check_list to count the number of 1s, which represent bridges. It increments bridge_num for each 1 found.

Finally, the code prints bridge_num and then iterates over check_list again, printing the pairs of islands (left+1 and right+1) for each 1 found in check_list.

For the input 3, the nested loop will set check_list[1], check_list[3], and check_list[5] to 1, because the sums of the island pairs (2+1, 1+2, and 3+1) are not equal to sum_pair (3). The pairs (1+3) and (2+3) are not considered because they are not within the range of the nested loop.

Therefore, bridge_num will be 3, and the pairs printed will be (1, 2), (2, 1), and (2, 3) corresponding to the indices 1, 3, and 5 in check_list.
