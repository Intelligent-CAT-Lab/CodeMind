<<<Analysis>>>
The variable k is initialized to 0.
The variable n is initialized to 50.
An array a of length n is created with all elements initialized to 49.
The variable c is calculated as the integer division of k by n, which is 0 // 50, resulting in 0.
Each element in the array a is increased by c, but since c is 0, the array remains unchanged.
Another variable c is calculated as the remainder of the division of k by n, which is 0 % 50, resulting in 0.
Since c is 0, the second loop does not execute.
The code prints the value of n, which is 50.
The code then prints each element of the array a, which are all 49, separated by spaces.
