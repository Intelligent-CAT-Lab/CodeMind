<<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized with the string 'oxo'.
The variable p is initialized with the value 700.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each character in the string s.
For each character c in the string, the code checks if c is equal to 'o'.
If c is 'o', it adds 100 to the value of p.
In the given string 'oxo', there are two 'o' characters.
Therefore, p will be increased by 100 two times, resulting in an increase of 200.
The initial value of p is 700, so after adding 200, the final value of p will be 900.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of p.
<<<Output>>>
900
