<<<Analysis>>>
The variables n and k are initialized to 2 and 2, respectively.
The code calculates the value of k raised to the power of (k-1) raised to the power of (n-1).
Since n is 2, (n-1) is 1, so (k-1) raised to the power of 1 is just (k-1).
Therefore, the expression simplifies to k*(k-1).
Since k is 2, (k-1) is 1, and the expression simplifies further to 2*1.
The code then prints the result of this calculation, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
