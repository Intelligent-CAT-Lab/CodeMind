<<<Analysis>>>
The variable x is initialized to the input value, which is 5.
The code then checks if x is equal to 3, 5, or 7 using an if-else statement.
Since x is equal to 5, the condition is true.
Therefore, the code will execute the print statement within the if block and print 'YES'.
<<<Output>>>
YES
