<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a, b, and k are initialized to 2, 3, and 3, respectively.
The code checks if a is less than or equal to k. Since a (2) is less than k (3), the condition is true.
k is reduced by the value of a (k = k - a), so k becomes 1 (3 - 2).
a is set to 0 because the condition was true.
The code does not enter the else block because the if condition was satisfied.
The code then prints 0 and the maximum of b - k and 0. Since b is 3 and k is 1, b - k is 2.
The max function will return 2 because it is greater than 0.
The final output is 0 and 2.
