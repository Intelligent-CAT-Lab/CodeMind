<<<Analysis>>>
The code is designed to calculate a combinatorial value under a modular arithmetic system with a modulus of p = 10^9 + 7. It precomputes factorials and their modular inverses up to 2*M (where M = 10^5) to use in the calculation.

1. The variable p is set to 10^9 + 7, and M is set to 10^5.
2. A list F is initialized with the value [1], and a list FI is initialized with zeros of length M+1.
3. A loop precomputes the factorial of each number up to 2*M and stores it in F, each time taking the modulus p.
4. The modular inverse of F[M] is calculated using the pow function with exponent p-2 and modulus p, and stored in FI[M].
5. A loop calculates the modular inverses of all factorials from M down to 1 and stores them in FI.
6. The variables H, W, A, and B are set to 2, 3, 1, and 1 respectively from the input.
7. The variables hx and hy are initialized to B+1 and H-A, which are 2 and 1 respectively.
8. The variable ans is initialized to 0.
9. A while loop calculates a temporary value tmp for each position (hx, hy) while hx is less than or equal to W and hy is greater than 0. The calculation uses the precomputed factorials and their inverses to find the number of paths from (0,0) to (hx-1, hy-1) and from (hx, hy) to (W-1, H-1), then multiplies these together and takes the modulus p.
10. The value of tmp is added to ans, and the modulus p is taken.
11. The values of hx and hy are updated by incrementing hx and decrementing hy.
12. The loop continues until hx is greater than W or hy is less than or equal to 0.
13. The final value of ans is printed.

Given the input `2 3 1 1`, the code will calculate the number of paths from (0,0) to (W-1, H-1) without passing through a certain rectangle of size AxB starting from (0,0). The calculation is done in a modular arithmetic system with modulus p.

The loop will run only once because hx will be incremented to 3, which is equal to W, and hy will be decremented to 0, which is not greater than 0. Therefore, only one value of tmp will be calculated and added to ans.

The calculation of tmp will be as follows:
tmp = F[hx+hy-2] * FI[hx-1] * FI[hy-1] % p * F[W-hx+H-hy] * FI[W-hx] * FI[H-hy] % p
tmp = F[2+1-2] * FI[2-1] * FI[1-1] % p * F[3-2+2-1] * FI[3-2] * FI[2-1] % p
tmp = F[1] * FI[1] * FI[0] % p * F[2] * FI[1] * FI[1] % p
tmp = 1 * 1 * 1 % p * 2 * 1 * 1 % p
tmp = 2 % p

Since the loop runs only once, ans will be equal to tmp, which is 2.
