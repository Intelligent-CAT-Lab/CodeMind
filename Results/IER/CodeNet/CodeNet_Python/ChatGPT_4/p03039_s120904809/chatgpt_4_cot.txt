The variables n, m, and k are initialized to 2, 2, and 2, respectively.
The variable num is calculated as n * m, which is 2 * 2 = 4.
MOD is set to 10^9 + 7.

The function inv_mod(a, p=MOD) is defined to calculate the modular multiplicative inverse of a under modulo p using the extended Euclidean algorithm.

The function comb_mod(n, k) is defined to calculate the binomial coefficient C(n, k) modulo MOD using precomputed factorials and their inverses.

The lists f_mod and f_mod_inverse are initialized with 1s and have a length of num + 1 (which is 5 in this case).

A loop is run from 1 to num (inclusive) to fill the f_mod list with factorial values modulo MOD and f_mod_inverse with their inverses modulo MOD.

The variables N and M are initialized to 0.

A loop is run from 1 to n-1 (which is 1 in this case) to calculate the sum of i * (n - i) modulo MOD and store it in N.

A loop is run from 1 to m-1 (which is 1 in this case) to calculate the sum of i * (m - i) modulo MOD and store it in M.

Finally, the result is calculated using the formula:
(N * (m^2) % MOD + M * (n^2) % MOD) * comb_mod(n * m - 2, k - 2) % MOD

For the given input, the calculations are as follows:
N = 1 * (2 - 1) % MOD = 1
M = 1 * (2 - 1) % MOD = 1
comb_mod(4 - 2, 2 - 2) = comb_mod(2, 0) = 1 (since C(n, 0) = 1 for any n)

The final result is:
(1 * (2^2) % MOD + 1 * (2^2) % MOD) * 1 % MOD
= (4 + 4) * 1 % MOD
= 8 % MOD
= 8 (since 8 is less than MOD)
