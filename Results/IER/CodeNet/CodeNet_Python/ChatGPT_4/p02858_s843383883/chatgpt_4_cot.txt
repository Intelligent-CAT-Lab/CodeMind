<<<Analysis>>>
The input values for H, W, and T are initialized to 2, 2, and 1, respectively.
The gcd function is defined to calculate the greatest common divisor of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.

The code calculates the greatest common divisor of H and T, which is gcd(2, 1) = 1, and assigns it to gh.
Similarly, it calculates the greatest common divisor of W and T, which is gcd(2, 1) = 1, and assigns it to gw.
The code then calculates h and w by dividing H by gh and W by gw, respectively. Since both gh and gw are 1, h = H / 1 = 2 and w = W / 1 = 2.
The MOD constant is set to 1000000007, which is a large prime number used for modular arithmetic to avoid integer overflow.

The code calculates the power of 2 raised to h modulo MOD, which is pow(2, 2, 1000000007) = 4.
It calculates the power of 2 raised to w modulo MOD, which is pow(2, 2, 1000000007) = 4.
It calculates the power of 2 raised to the gcd of h and w modulo MOD, which is pow(2, gcd(2, 2), 1000000007) = pow(2, 2, 1000000007) = 4.
It then adds these three values and subtracts 3, resulting in (4 + 4 + 4 - 3) = 9.
Finally, it calculates the power of this sum raised to gh * gw modulo MOD, which is pow(9, 1 * 1, 1000000007) = 9.

The code prints the result of this final calculation, which is 9.
