<<<Analysis>>>
The variable abc is initialized with the list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and mapping each part to an integer. With the input `1 5 2`, abc becomes [1, 5, 2].
The list abc is then sorted, resulting in [1, 2, 5].
The code concatenates the string representation of the third element (abc[2], which is 5) and the second element (abc[1], which is 2) of the sorted list, resulting in the string "52".
This string is then converted back to an integer, resulting in the integer 52.
Finally, the code adds the first element of the sorted list (abc[0], which is 1) to this integer, resulting in 52 + 1.
The code prints the result of this addition, which is 53.
<<<Output>>>
53
