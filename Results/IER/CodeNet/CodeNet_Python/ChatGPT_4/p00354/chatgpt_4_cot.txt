<<<Analysis>>>
The variable X is initialized to 1.
The list Day contains the abbreviations of the days of the week.
The variable a is calculated as the remainder of X divided by 7, which is 1%7 = 1.
The code then checks the value of a and enters the corresponding conditional branch.
Since a is 1, it matches the last condition (elif a==0 or a==1).
According to the condition, it prints Day[a+3], which is Day[1+3] = Day[4].
Day[4] corresponds to the fifth element in the list Day, which is "fri".
<<<Output>>>
fri
