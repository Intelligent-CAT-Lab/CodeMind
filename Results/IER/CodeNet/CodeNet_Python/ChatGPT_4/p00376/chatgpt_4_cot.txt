<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a and b are initialized to 20 and 30, respectively.
The code checks if a is less than b, which is true in this case (20 < 30).
Since the condition is true, it executes the first print statement, which prints the result of b - a.
The result of 30 - 20 is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
