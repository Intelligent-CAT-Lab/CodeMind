<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines several functions and sets some configurations, but the main execution starts in the `main` function.

1. The `main` function reads two space-separated values from the input and assigns them to variables A and B. In this case, A is '198' and B is '1.10'.
2. It then converts both A and B to `Decimal` types and multiplies them together. The `Decimal` type is used for precise decimal arithmetic in Python.
3. The result of the multiplication is then converted back to an integer using the `int` function.
4. Finally, the code prints the result of this operation.

Given the input '198' and '1.10', the multiplication in decimal would be 198 * 1.10, which equals 217.8. When converted to an integer, the decimal part is truncated, resulting in 217.

217
