<<<Analysis>>>
The variable X is initialized to 6.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to X (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 6.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of the first i natural numbers using the formula i*(i+1)//2, which is the sum of an arithmetic series.
The code checks if this sum is greater than or equal to X.
When i is 1, the sum is 1*(1+1)//2 = 1, which is not greater than or equal to 6.
When i is 2, the sum is 2*(2+1)//2 = 3, which is not greater than or equal to 6.
When i is 3, the sum is 3*(3+1)//2 = 6, which is equal to X.
At this point, the code prints the current value of i, which is 3, and breaks out of the loop.
