<<<Analysis>>>
The variable S is initialized to the string 'abac'.
The list comprehension creates a list nums with the counts of 'a', 'b', and 'c' in the string S. For 'abac', this will be [2, 1, 1].
The list nums is then sorted, resulting in [1, 1, 2].
The last element of nums is decreased by the first element, changing nums to [1, 1, 1].
The second element of nums is decreased by the first element, but since they are equal, nums remains [1, 1, 1].
The check function is called. Inside the function, the following conditions are checked:
- If nums[1] is 0 and nums[-1] is greater than 1, return False. This is not the case because nums[1] is 1.
- If nums[1] is greater than 1 or nums[-1] is greater than 1, return False. This is not the case because both are 1.
Since neither condition is met, the function returns True.
The print statement prints "YES" because the check function returned True.
<<<Output>>>
YES
