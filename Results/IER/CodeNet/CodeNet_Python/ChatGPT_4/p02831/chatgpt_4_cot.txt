<<<Analysis>>>
The input values for A and B are 2 and 3, respectively.
The gcd function is defined using the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of two numbers.
The lcm function is defined to find the least common multiple of two numbers by multiplying them and then dividing by their greatest common divisor.
The gcd function is called within the lcm function to calculate the greatest common divisor of A and B, which in this case is gcd(2, 3).
Since 2 and 3 are both prime numbers and do not share any common divisors other than 1, the gcd(2, 3) will return 1.
The lcm function then calculates the least common multiple by multiplying A and B (which is 2 * 3 = 6) and dividing by the gcd (which is 1), so the result is 6.
The lcm function returns 6, which is then printed as the output.
<<<Output>>>
6
