<<<Analysis>>>
The variable `moji` is initialized to the string "119".
The variable `ans` is initialized to an empty string, which will be used to accumulate the transformed characters.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the length of `moji`, which is 3 in this case.
For each index `i` in the range of 0 to 2, the code checks if the character at position `i` in `moji` is "1".
If it is "1", it appends "9" to `ans`; otherwise, it would append "1". However, since the input "119" contains only the character "1", the condition will always be true.
The resulting string `ans` after the loop will be "999", as each "1" in "119" is replaced with a "9".
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of `ans`.
<<<Output>>>
999
