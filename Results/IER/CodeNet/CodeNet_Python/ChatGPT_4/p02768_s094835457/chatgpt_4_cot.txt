<<<Analysis>>>
The variables n, a, and b are initialized to 4, 1, and 3, respectively.
The function cmb(n, r, p) is defined to calculate the combination of n choose r modulo p, where p is a prime number (10 ** 9 + 7 in this case).

The variable N is set to the value of n, which is 4.

The variable p is set to 10 ** 9 + 7.

The variable ans is initialized with the value of (2^n - 1) % p, which is (2^4 - 1) % p = (16 - 1) % p = 15 % p = 15.

The code then calculates cmb(n, a, p) which is cmb(4, 1, p), and cmb(n, b, p) which is cmb(4, 3, p). Both combinations are equal since choosing 1 out of 4 is the same as choosing 3 out of 4 (because of symmetry in combinations).

The cmb function calculates the combination using a loop and the pow function for modular inverse. The result for both cmb(4, 1, p) and cmb(4, 3, p) is 4.

The code then subtracts the sum of these two combination values from ans, which is 15 - (4 + 4) = 15 - 8 = 7.

Finally, the code prints ans % p, which is 7 % p = 7, since 7 is less than p.
