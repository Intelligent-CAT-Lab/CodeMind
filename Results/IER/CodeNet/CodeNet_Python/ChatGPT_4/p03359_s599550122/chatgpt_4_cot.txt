<<<Analysis>>>
The variables A and B are initialized with the input values '5' and '5', respectively, and then converted to integers.
The code checks if B is greater than or equal to A. Since both A and B are 5, the condition is true.
Because the condition is true, the code prints the value of A, which is 5.
<<<Output>>>
5
