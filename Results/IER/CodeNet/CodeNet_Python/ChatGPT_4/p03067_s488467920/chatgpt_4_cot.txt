<<<Analysis>>>
The variables A, B, and C are initialized to 3, 8, and 5, respectively.
The code checks if C is between A and B (A < C < B) or if C is between B and A (A > C > B).
Since A is 3, B is 8, and C is 5, the condition A < C < B is true because 3 < 5 < 8.
Therefore, the code will execute the first print statement, printing 'Yes'.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
