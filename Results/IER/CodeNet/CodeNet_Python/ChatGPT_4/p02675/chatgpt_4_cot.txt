<<<Analysis>>>
The input number is 16.
The code takes the input number and calculates the remainder when divided by 10, which gives the last digit of the number. For 16, this results in 6.
The variable n is then compared to 3 to check if it is equal. Since n is 6, it is not equal to 3, so the first if condition is not satisfied.
Next, the code checks if n is in the list [2,4,5,7,9]. Since 6 is not in the list, the elif condition is also not satisfied.
Finally, the code reaches the else statement, which means that if n is not 3 and not in the list [2,4,5,7,9], it should print "pon".
Therefore, the output will be "pon".
