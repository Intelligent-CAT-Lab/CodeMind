<<<Analysis>>>
The variables N and M are initialized to 4 and 3, respectively.
MOD is set to 1000000007, which is used for modular arithmetic to prevent integer overflow.

Two lists, pow and dp, are initialized with N+1 zeros. These lists will store intermediate results for powers of 2 and dynamic programming values, respectively.

pow[0] is set to 1, as 2^0 is 1.

A loop is run from 1 to N (inclusive) to fill the pow list with powers of 2 modulo MOD. The loop calculates 2^i for i from 1 to 4 and stores the results in pow.

dp[0] is set to 1, as the base case for the dynamic programming solution.

Another loop is run from 1 to M (inclusive) to initialize the dp list with the same values as pow for indices up to M.

dp[M] is then decremented by 1, so dp[3] becomes pow[3] - 1.

A final loop is run from M+1 to N (inclusive) to calculate the remaining values of dp using the recurrence relation given by the problem. This loop calculates dp[i] based on the previous values of dp and applies modulo MOD.

After the loops, the final result is calculated as (pow[N] - dp[N] + MOD) % MOD. This expression ensures that the result is non-negative by adding MOD before applying the final modulo operation.

Let's calculate the values step by step:

pow list after the first loop:
pow = [1, 2, 4, 8, 16]

dp list after the second loop:
dp = [1, 2, 4, 7]

dp list after the final loop:
dp[4] = dp[3] + (dp[3] - dp[0]) = 7 + (7 - 1) = 13 % MOD = 13

Final result calculation:
(pow[4] - dp[4] + MOD) % MOD = (16 - 13 + 1000000007) % 1000000007 = 1000000010 % 1000000007 = 3
