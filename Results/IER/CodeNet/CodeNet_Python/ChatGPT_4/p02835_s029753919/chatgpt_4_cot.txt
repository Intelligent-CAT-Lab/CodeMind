<<<Analysis>>>
The variables A, B, and C are initialized to 5, 7, and 9, respectively, from the input.
The code then checks if the sum of A, B, and C is greater than 21.
In this case, 5 + 7 + 9 equals 21, which is not greater than 21.
Since the sum is not greater than 21, the code will execute the else block.
The else block contains a print statement that outputs 'win'.
<<<Output>>>
win
