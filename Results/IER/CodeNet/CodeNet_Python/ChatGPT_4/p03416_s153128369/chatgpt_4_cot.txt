The variables A and B are initialized to 11009 and 11332, respectively.
The variable count is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a nested loop structure that iterates over three loops, each ranging from 0 to 9. These loops represent the digits i, j, and k of a 5-digit palindromic number, which has the form ijkkji (where the first and last digits are i, the second and second-to-last are j, and the middle digit is k).
For each combination of i, j, and k, the code constructs a palindromic number using the formula 10000*i + 1000*j + 100*k + 10*j + i and checks if it is within the range [A, B].
If the constructed number is within the range, count is incremented by 1.
After all iterations, the code prints the final value of count, which represents the total number of palindromic numbers within the given range.
The palindromic numbers within the range 11009 to 11332 are 11011, 11111, 11211, and 11311. Therefore, there are 4 such numbers.
