<<<Analysis>>>
The variables n, m, and d are initialized to 2, 3, and 1, respectively.
Since d is greater than 0, the code will execute the first branch of the if statement.
The expression calculates as follows:
2 * (n - d) * (m - 1) / n^2
= 2 * (2 - 1) * (3 - 1) / 2^2
= 2 * 1 * 2 / 4
= 4 / 4
= 1
The code will print the result of this calculation, which is 1.
<<<Output>>>
