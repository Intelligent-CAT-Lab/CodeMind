<<<Analysis>>>
The input `2 10 1` initializes m, n, and k to 2, 10, and 1, respectively.
The code checks if n < k or m < k, and if either is true, it prints 0 and returns. In this case, both conditions are false, so it continues.
The variable ans is initialized to pow(m, n, mod), which is 2^10 % 998244353, which equals 1024.
The list p is created to store pow(i, n, mod) for i in range(k+1), which is [1^10 % 998244353, 1^10 % 998244353] = [1, 1].
The variable c is initialized to m, which is 2.
The 2D list comb is created to store binomial coefficients. After the nested loops, comb will be [[1], [1, 1], [1, 2, 1]].
The code then enters a loop for i in range(1, k), but since k is 1, the loop is not executed.
The final value of ans is printed, which is 1024.
<<<Output>>>
1024
