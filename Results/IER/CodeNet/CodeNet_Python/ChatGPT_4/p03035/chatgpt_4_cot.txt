<<<Analysis>>>
The variables A and B are initialized to 30 and 100, respectively.
The code checks the value of A to determine the output.
Since A is 30, which is greater than or equal to 13, the condition A >= 13 is true.
Therefore, the code prints the value of B without any changes.
The output will be 100.
<<<Output>>>
100
