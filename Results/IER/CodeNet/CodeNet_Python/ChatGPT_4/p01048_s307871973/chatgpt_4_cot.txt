<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input and uses it as an index to access an element from a predefined list. The list is [0,1,2,4,6,16,12,64,24,36,48,1024,60]. The input provided is `1`. The code converts the input to an integer and uses it to index the list. Since lists in Python are zero-indexed, an input of `1` corresponds to the second element in the list, which is `1`. Therefore, the output will be the element at index 1 of the list, which is `1`.
