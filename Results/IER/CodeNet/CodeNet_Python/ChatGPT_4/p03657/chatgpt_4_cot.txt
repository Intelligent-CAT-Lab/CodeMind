<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a and b are initialized to 4 and 5, respectively.
The code checks if a is divisible by 3, which it is not (4 % 3 is 1).
Then it checks if b is divisible by 3, which it is not (5 % 3 is 2).
Finally, it checks if the sum of a and b is divisible by 3, which it is (4 + 5 = 9, and 9 % 3 is 0).
Since the sum of a and b is divisible by 3, the code prints 'Possible'.
<<<Output>>>
Possible
