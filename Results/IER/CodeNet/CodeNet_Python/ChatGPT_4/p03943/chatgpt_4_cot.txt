<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a, b, and c are initialized to 10, 30, and 20, respectively.
The variable ans is initialized to "No".
The code checks if any two of the three numbers sum up to the third number.
First, it checks if a + b equals c, which is not true (10 + 30 does not equal 20).
Second, it checks if a + c equals b, which is true (10 + 20 equals 30).
Since the second condition is true, ans is updated to "Yes".
The code does not need to check the third condition because ans is already "Yes".
Finally, the code prints the value of ans, which is "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
