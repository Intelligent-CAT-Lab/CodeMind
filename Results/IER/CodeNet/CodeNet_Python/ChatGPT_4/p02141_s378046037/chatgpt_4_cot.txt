<<<Analysis>>>
The variables W, H, w, h, x, and y are initialized to 6000, 5000, 20, 10, 400, and 300, respectively.
The code checks if the center of the smaller rectangle (w, h) is within the center of the larger rectangle (W, H). The center of the smaller rectangle is calculated by adding half of its width and height to its top-left corner coordinates (x, y). The center of the larger rectangle is simply half of its width and height (W//2, H//2).

The condition `x+w//2 <= W//2 and y+h//2 <= H//2` is checked:
- For x: 400 + 20//2 = 410, and W//2 = 6000//2 = 3000, so 410 <= 3000 is True.
- For y: 300 + 10//2 = 305, and H//2 = 5000//2 = 2500, so 305 <= 2500 is True.

Since both conditions are True, the code prints `y/x` which is 300/400 = 0.75 and then exits.

<<<Output>>>
0.75
