<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a and b are initialized to 2 and 900, respectively.
The code then checks if 500 times a is greater than or equal to b.
In this case, 500 * 2 equals 1000, which is indeed greater than 900.
Since the condition is true, the code will execute the print statement under the if clause.
Therefore, the output will be 'Yes'.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
