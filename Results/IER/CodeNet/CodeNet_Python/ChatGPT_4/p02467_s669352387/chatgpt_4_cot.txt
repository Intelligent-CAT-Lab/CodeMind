The input is `12`, which is assigned to the variable N.
The function `prime_factorization` is called with the argument `12`.
Inside the function, the variable `max_prime` is initialized to 0 and `ret` is initialized to an empty dictionary.
The first while loop divides `12` by `2` as long as the remainder is 0. This happens twice, so `12` becomes `3` and `cnt` becomes `2`.
Since `cnt` is greater than 0, `2` is added to the dictionary `ret` with the value `2`.
The for loop starts with `i` equal to `3` and increments by `2` up to the square root of `3` (rounded up), which is still `3`. However, since `3` is not divisible by `3` more than once, the inner while loop only runs once.
`max_prime` is updated to `3` and `cnt` is set to `1`.
Since `cnt` is greater than 0, `3` is added to the dictionary `ret` with the value `1`.
The final if condition checks if `x` is greater than `2`, which it is not, so nothing happens.
The function returns the dictionary `{2: 2, 3: 1}`.
Back in the `main` function, the `facts` dictionary is iterated over, and the string `ans` is constructed by repeating each prime factor by its count.
The output string is built as `"12: 2 2 3 "`, and the last space is removed before printing.
The final output is `"12: 2 2 3"`.
