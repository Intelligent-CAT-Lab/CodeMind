<<<Analysis>>>
The variables A, B, and C are initialized to 10, 10, and 5, respectively.
The variable time is initialized to 0, which will be used to keep track of the time in seconds.
The set ss is initialized to an empty set, which will be used to keep track of the unique remainders of time when divided by 60.

The code enters an infinite loop with the following steps:
1. It first checks if the current time in seconds modulo 60 equals C (which is 5). If it is, it prints the current time and exits the program.
2. It then enters another loop that increments the time by 1 for A times (which is 10 times). After each increment, it checks if the time modulo 60 equals C. If it does, it prints the time and exits the program.
3. After the inner loop, it increments the time by B (which is 10).
4. It then checks if the remainder of time divided by 60 is already in the set ss. If it is, it breaks the loop because it means the pattern will repeat and C will never be reached. If it's not in the set, it adds the remainder to the set ss.

Let's simulate the loop:
- Initial time is 0, which is not equal to C (5).
- The inner loop runs for A (10) seconds, incrementing time to 10. None of these seconds match C.
- After the inner loop, B (10) seconds are added, making the time 20. The remainder of 20 divided by 60 is 20, which is not in the set ss, so it's added to ss.
- The loop continues, and the inner loop runs again for A (10) seconds, incrementing time to 30. None of these seconds match C.
- After the inner loop, B (10) seconds are added, making the time 40. The remainder of 40 divided by 60 is 40, which is not in the set ss, so it's added to ss.
- The loop continues, and the inner loop runs again for A (10) seconds, incrementing time to 50. None of these seconds match C.
- After the inner loop, B (10) seconds are added, making the time 60. The remainder of 60 divided by 60 is 0, which is not in the set ss, so it's added to ss.
- The loop continues, and the inner loop runs again for A (10) seconds, incrementing time to 70. The remainder of 70 divided by 60 is 10, which is already in the set ss. Therefore, the loop breaks and the program prints -1.
