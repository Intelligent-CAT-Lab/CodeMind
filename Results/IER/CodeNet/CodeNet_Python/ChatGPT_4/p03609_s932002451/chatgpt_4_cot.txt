<<<Analysis>>>
The variables x and t are initialized to 100 and 17, respectively, from the input.
The code then prints the result of the expression `(x - t) if x > t else 0`.
Since x (100) is greater than t (17), the condition `x > t` is True.
Therefore, the code will execute the `(x - t)` part of the expression.
The result of `(100 - 17)` is `83`.
The code will print this result.
<<<Output>>>
83
