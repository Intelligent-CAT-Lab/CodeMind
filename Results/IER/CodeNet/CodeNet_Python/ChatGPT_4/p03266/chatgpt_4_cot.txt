<<<Analysis>>>
The variables n and k are initialized to 3 and 2, respectively.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to store the final answer.

The code checks if k is odd by checking if k % 2 equals 1. Since k is 2, this condition is false.
Since k is even, the code executes the else block:
- It calculates (n // k)**3 which is (3 // 2)**3 = 1**3 = 1.
- It calculates ((n + k // 2) // k)**3 which is ((3 + 2 // 2) // 2)**3 = (3 + 1) // 2)**3 = (4 // 2)**3 = 2**3 = 8.
- It adds these two results together to get ans = 1 + 8 = 9.

The code then prints the value of ans, which is 9.
<<<Output>>>
9
