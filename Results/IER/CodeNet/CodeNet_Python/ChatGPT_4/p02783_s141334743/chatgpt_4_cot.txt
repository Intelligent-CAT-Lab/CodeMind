<<<Analysis>>>
The variables H and A are initialized to 10 and 4, respectively.
The code checks if A is 0, which it is not, so it skips the first print statement.
The variable b is calculated as H divided by A, followed by floor division by 1, which is equivalent to just performing floor division. So b is 10/4 floored, which is 2.5 floored to 2.
The code then checks if H/A is greater than b. Since H/A is 2.5 and b is 2, the condition is true.
Because the condition is true, the code prints int(b+1), which is int(2+1), resulting in 3.
