<<<Analysis>>>
The variables n and m are initialized to 3 and 100, respectively.
The variable p is calculated as n//2+1, which is the integer division of n by 2 plus 1. For n=3, p is calculated as 3//2+1 = 1+1 = 2.
The code then prints a list that starts with p zeros followed by n-p occurrences of m. Since p is 2, the list starts with two zeros.
n-p is 3-2, which is 1, so there will be one occurrence of m (which is 100) in the list.
The list is printed without brackets and commas, as indicated by the * operator in the print function.
<<<Output>>>
0 0 100
