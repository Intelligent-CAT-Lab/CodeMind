<<<Analysis>>>
The input line is split into a list of strings and assigned to the variable input_line.
The first element of input_line is converted to an integer and assigned to variable a, which becomes 1.
The second element of input_line is converted to an integer and assigned to variable b, which becomes 3.
The third element of input_line is converted to an integer and assigned to variable c, which becomes 8.
The code then checks if a is less than b and b is less than c. Since 1 < 3 and 3 < 8, the condition is true.
Because the condition is true, 'Yes' is printed.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
