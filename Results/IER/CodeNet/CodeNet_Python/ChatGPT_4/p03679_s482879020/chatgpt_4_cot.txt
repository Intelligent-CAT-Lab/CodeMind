<<<Analysis>>>
The variables X, A, and B are initialized to 4, 3, and 6, respectively.
The variable 'over' is calculated as B - A, which is 6 - 3 = 3.
The first condition checks if 'over' is less than or equal to 0. Since 'over' is 3, this condition is false.
The second condition checks if 'over' is less than or equal to X. Since 'over' is 3 and X is 4, this condition is true.
Because the second condition is true, the program prints 'safe'.
The 'else' part is not executed because one of the previous conditions was true.
<<<Output>>>
safe
