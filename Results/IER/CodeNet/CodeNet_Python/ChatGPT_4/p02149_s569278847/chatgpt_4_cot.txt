<<<Analysis>>>
The variables A, B, and C are initialized to 1000, 900, and 850, respectively.
The code then checks which of the three variables is the largest using the max() function.
Since A is 1000, B is 900, and C is 850, the largest value is A (1000).
The first condition checks if the largest value is equal to A, which is true in this case.
Therefore, the code prints "A" and does not check the other conditions.
<<<Output>>>
A
