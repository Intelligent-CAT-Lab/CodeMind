<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a, b, and k are initialized to 8, 12, and 2, respectively.
An empty list named res is created to store common divisors of a and b.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 100 (inclusive).
For each number i in this range, it checks if both a and b are divisible by i without any remainder.
If i is a common divisor of a and b, it is appended to the list res.
The common divisors of 8 and 12 are 1, 2, 4, and the greatest common divisor 8.
After the loop, the list res is sorted in reverse order, so it becomes [8, 4, 2, 1].
The code prints the k-1 index of the sorted list, which is res[1] because k is 2.
The value at index 1 in the list res is 4.
