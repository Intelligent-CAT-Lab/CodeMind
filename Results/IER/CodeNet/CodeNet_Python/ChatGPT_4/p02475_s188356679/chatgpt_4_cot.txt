<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a and b are initialized to 5 and 8, respectively.
The code checks if the product of a and b is greater than or equal to 0. Since both a and b are positive, their product is also positive, so the condition is true.
Since the condition is true, the code executes the first print statement, which prints the integer division of a by b.
The integer division of 5 by 8 is 0, because 5 is less than 8 and we are performing integer division.
<<<Output>>>
0
