<<<Analysis>>>
The variables A and B are initialized to 12 and 4, respectively, from the input.
The variable diff is calculated as A - B * 2, which is 12 - 4 * 2 = 12 - 8 = 4.
The if statement checks if diff is less than 0, which it is not, so the else block is executed.
The code prints the value of diff, which is 4.
<<<Output>>>
4
