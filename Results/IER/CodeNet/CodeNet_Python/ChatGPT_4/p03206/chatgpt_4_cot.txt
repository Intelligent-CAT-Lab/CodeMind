<<<Analysis>>>
The variable D is initialized to the integer value of the input, which is 25.
A dictionary d is created with keys 25, 24, 23, and 22, each associated with a string representing the day before Christmas.
The code then prints the value associated with the key D in the dictionary d.
Since D is 25, it will print the value associated with the key 25 in the dictionary, which is 'Christmas'.
<<<Output>>>
Christmas
