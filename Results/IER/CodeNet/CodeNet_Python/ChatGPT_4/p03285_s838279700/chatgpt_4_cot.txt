<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 11.
The variable cnt is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of solutions to the equation 4*k + 7*j == n.
The code then enters a nested loop where k and j both iterate from 0 to n-1 (inclusive), meaning they will consider numbers from 0 to 10.
For each pair (k, j), the code checks if the equation 4*k + 7*j equals n (11 in this case). If it does, cnt is incremented by 1.
The inner loop runs for each value of k, so the total number of iterations is n^2 (121 in this case).
The condition 4*k + 7*j == 11 has no non-negative integer solutions for k and j in the range [0, 10], so cnt remains 0.
After the loops finish, the code checks if n is less than 4 or cnt is 0. Since n is not less than 4 but cnt is 0, the condition is true.
Therefore, the code prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
