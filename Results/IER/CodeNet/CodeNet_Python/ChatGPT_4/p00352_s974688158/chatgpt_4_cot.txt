<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a and b are initialized to 1000 and 3000, respectively, from the input.
The variable c is calculated as the integer division of the sum of a and b divided by 2, which is the average of a and b.
The sum of a and b is 1000 + 3000 = 4000.
Dividing 4000 by 2 gives 2000.
Since c is calculated using integer division, the result is an integer, so c is 2000.
The code then prints the value of c.
<<<Output>>>
2000
