The input string '198 1.10' is split into two parts: '198' and '1.10'.
The first part '198' is converted to an integer and assigned to variable a.
The second part '1.10' is converted to a Decimal and assigned to variable b.
The Decimal type is used for precise floating-point arithmetic in Python.
The code multiplies the integer a (198) by the Decimal b (1.10).
The result of this multiplication is a Decimal representing the exact value of 217.8.
The final result is then converted to an integer using the int() function, which truncates the decimal part and results in 217.
