<<<Analysis>>>
The variables A and B are initialized to 30 and 100, respectively.
The code checks if A is greater than or equal to 13, which it is since A is 30.
Since the condition is true, the code prints the value of B, which is 100.
The elif and else blocks are not executed because the first if condition was met.
<<<Output>>>
100
