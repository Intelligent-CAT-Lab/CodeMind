<<<Analysis>>>
The code uses the `re` module to perform a substitution on the input string using a regular expression.
The regular expression `(apple|peach)` matches the words "apple" or "peach".
The `re.sub` function is used to replace each match with a result of the lambda function.
The lambda function takes the match object `m` and returns "peach" if the matched group is "apple" and "apple" if the matched group is "peach". This is achieved by using a list `["apple","peach"]` and indexing it with a boolean expression `m.group(0)=="apple"`, which evaluates to `True` (1) when the match is "apple" and `False` (0) when the match is "peach".
The input string is `the cost of one peach is higher than that of one apple.`.
The word "peach" will be replaced with "apple" and the word "apple" will be replaced with "peach".
The output will be the input string with the words "apple" and "peach" swapped.
<<<Output>>>
the cost of one apple is higher than that of one peach.
