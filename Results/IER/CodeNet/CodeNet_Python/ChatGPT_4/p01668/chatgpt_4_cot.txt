The code defines a class `RollingHash` which is used to compute hash values for substrings of a given string, using a base and modulo for the hash calculation. The `solve` function is the main function that processes the input and calculates the result.

The input `1 3 2` is read as strings A, B, and C, representing the lower bound, upper bound, and the pattern we are looking for, respectively.

The `solve` function first calculates powers of 10 modulo `MOD` (which is 10^9 + 7) up to the maximum length of A or B.

The `calc` function is defined within `solve`. It calculates the number of times the pattern Y appears in the range from 0 to X, where X and Y are strings representing numbers.

The `calc` function first checks if the length of X is less than the length of Y, in which case the pattern cannot appear and the function returns 0.

If the length of X is greater or equal to the length of Y, it creates rolling hashes for both X and Y, and then iterates over the digits of X, calculating contributions to the result based on the occurrences of the pattern Y.

The `calc` function also handles the special case where Y is "0", adjusting the result accordingly.

After defining `calc`, the `solve` function calculates the result for B and C, and then subtracts the result of `calc(A-1, C)` if A is greater than 0.

Finally, the result is printed.

Given the input `1 3 2`, the `solve` function will calculate the number of times the pattern "2" appears in the range from "1" to "3". Since "2" appears exactly once in this range, the result should be 1.
