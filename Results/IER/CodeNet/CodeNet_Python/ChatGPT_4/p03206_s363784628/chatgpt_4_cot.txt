<<<Analysis>>>
The variable d is initialized to 25, which is the input value.
The string " Eve" is multiplied by (25 - d), which is (25 - 25) in this case, resulting in 0. Therefore, the string " Eve" is repeated 0 times, resulting in an empty string.
The code then concatenates the string "Christmas" with the empty string, resulting in "Christmas".
Finally, the code prints the resulting string, which is "Christmas".
<<<Output>>>
Christmas
