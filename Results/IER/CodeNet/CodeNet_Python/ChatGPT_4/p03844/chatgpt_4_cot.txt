<<<Analysis>>>
The input string '1 + 2' is split into three parts: '1', '+', and '2'.
The variable A is assigned the integer value 1, and the variable B is assigned the integer value 2.
The variable s is assigned the string '+'.
The code checks the value of s. Since s is '+', the condition of the first if statement is True.
The code executes the print statement inside the if block, which prints the result of A+B, which is 1+2.
The output will be the sum of A and B, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>
