The input variables n, a, b, c are initialized to 3, 1, 2, 0, respectively.
The MOD variable is set to 1000000007, which is a large prime number used for modular arithmetic to avoid integer overflow.

The FACT and INVERSE_FACT lists are initialized to have a length of n+1, which is 4 in this case. Both lists have their first element set to 1.

A loop is run from 1 to n (inclusive) to fill the FACT list with factorial values modulo MOD and the INVERSE_FACT list with modular multiplicative inverses of the factorial values.

The ans variable is initialized to 0, which will accumulate the answer.

The code checks if b is odd, and since b is 2 (even), the check fails and the code continues.

Two nested loops are used to iterate over possible values of y and z, where y ranges from 0 to min(a + 1, c + 1) which is 1, and z ranges from 0 to (c - y) // 3 + 1 which is 1.

Inside the nested loops, x is calculated as a - y, and rest3 is calculated as c - y - 3 * z.

If b is 0 and rest3 is not 0, the loop continues to the next iteration. This condition is never met because b is not 0.

cur_ans is calculated using the factorial values and the comb function, which calculates the binomial coefficient. The comb function uses the fast_pow function to compute the modular multiplicative inverse.

The final answer is the sum of all cur_ans modulo MOD.

The loops will iterate with the following values:
- For y = 0, z = 0, x = 1, rest3 = 0
  cur_ans = FACT[1] * INVERSE_FACT[1] * INVERSE_FACT[0] * comb(2, 1) * comb(1, 0) % MOD
  cur_ans = 1 * 1 * 1 * 1 * 1 % MOD
  cur_ans = 1
  ans = (0 + 1) % MOD
  ans = 1

- For y = 1, z = 0, x = 0, rest3 = 0
  cur_ans = FACT[1] * INVERSE_FACT[0] * INVERSE_FACT[1] * comb(2, 1) * comb(1, 0) % MOD
  cur_ans = 1 * 1 * 1 * 1 * 1 % MOD
  cur_ans = 1
  ans = (1 + 1) % MOD
  ans = 2

Since there are no more iterations, the final value of ans is 2.
