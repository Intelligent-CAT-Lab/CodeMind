<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 11.
The variable p is initialized to 0, which will be used to iterate and check different multiples of 7 subtracted from n.
The variable t is initialized to True, which will be used as a flag to determine if a solution is found.
The code enters a while loop that will run as long as p is less than 26.
Inside the loop, r is calculated as n minus 7 times p. For the first iteration, r is 11 - (7*0) = 11.
The code checks if r is non-negative and if r is divisible by 4. For the first iteration, r is 11, which is not divisible by 4.
Since the condition is not met, p is incremented by 1 and the loop continues.
The loop runs with p taking values 1, 2, and so on, each time checking if the new r value is non-negative and divisible by 4.
When p is 3, r is calculated as 11 - (7*3) = 11 - 21 = -10, which is negative. The loop continues without printing "Yes" because the condition is not met.
The loop continues to check for p values 4, 5, and so on, but since r is negative for all these values, the condition is never met.
Once p reaches 26, the loop ends.
Since the flag t remains True (no solution was found), the code prints "No".
