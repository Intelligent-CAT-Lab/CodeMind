<<<Analysis>>>
The input string '700 600 780' is split into a list of strings ['700', '600', '780'].
The map function converts each string in the list to an integer, resulting in the list [700, 600, 780].
The list is then sorted in ascending order to become [600, 700, 780].
The code prints the sum of the first two elements of the sorted list, which are 600 and 700.
The output is the sum of 600 and 700, which is 1300.
<<<Output>>>
1300
