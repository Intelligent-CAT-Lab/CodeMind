<<<Analysis>>>
The variable S is initialized to the string "keyofscience".
The code then enters a nested loop where it tries to find a substring of S that equals "keyence" by removing a continuous part of S.
In the first loop, i ranges from 0 to the length of S, and j ranges from i to the length of S + 1.
The condition checks if by removing the substring from index i to j-1 (inclusive) from S results in the string "keyence".
For the given input "keyofscience", the condition becomes true when i is 3 and j is 7, because S[:3] is "key" and S[7:] is "ence", and their concatenation "key"+"ence" equals "keyence".
Since the condition is met, the code prints "YES" and exits before reaching the second loop.
<<<Output>>>
YES
