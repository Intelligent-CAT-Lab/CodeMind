<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a, b, c, and d are initialized to 3, 8, 7, and 1, respectively, from the input.
The code then checks if the sum of a and b is greater than the sum of c and d.
In this case, a + b equals 3 + 8, which is 11, and c + d equals 7 + 1, which is 8.
Since 11 is greater than 8, the condition a + b > c + d is true.
Therefore, the code will execute the first print statement and print 'Left'.
<<<Output>>>
Left
