<<<Analysis>>>
The variables n, a, and b are initialized to 8, 3, and 4, respectively.
The code checks if the remainder of n divided by the sum of a and b (which is 8 % (3 + 4) = 8 % 7 = 1) is less than or equal to a (which is 3).
Since 1 is less than 3, the condition is true.
The code then calculates (n // (a + b)) * a + n % (a + b), which is (8 // (3 + 4)) * 3 + 8 % (3 + 4).
This simplifies to (8 // 7) * 3 + 8 % 7, which is 1 * 3 + 1, because 8 divided by 7 is 1 with a remainder of 1.
Therefore, the result is 3 + 1, which equals 4.
The code prints this result.
<<<Output>>>
4
