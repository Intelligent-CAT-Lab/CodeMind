<<<Analysis>>>
The variable x is initialized to 725.
The code then checks the value of x against a series of conditions to determine the value of the result variable.
Since x is 725, it is greater than 599 but less than or equal to 799, so the first condition is false, but the second condition is true.
Therefore, the result is set to 7.
After the if-elif-else block, the code prints the value of result, which is 7.
<<<Output>>>
7
