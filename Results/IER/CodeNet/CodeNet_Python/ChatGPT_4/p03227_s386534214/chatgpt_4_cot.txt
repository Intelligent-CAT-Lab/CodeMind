<<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized with the string 'abc'.
The code checks if the length of s is 2, which it is not, so the first print statement is skipped.
The code then checks if the length of s is 3, which it is, so it enters the second if block.
Inside the second if block, it prints the string s reversed, which is 'cba'.
<<<Output>>>
cba
