<<<Analysis>>>
The variable ss is initialized to 46979.
The variable hour is calculated by integer division of ss by 60^2 (3600), which gives the number of complete hours in 46979 seconds. 46979 // 3600 equals 13.
The variable second is calculated by taking the remainder of ss divided by 60^2, which gives the remaining seconds after the complete hours are accounted for. 46979 % 3600 equals 79 seconds.
The variable minute is calculated by integer division of the remaining seconds (second) by 60, which gives the number of complete minutes in the remaining seconds. 79 // 60 equals 1.
The variable second is then updated to the remainder of the remaining seconds divided by 60, which gives the remaining seconds after the complete minutes are accounted for. 79 % 60 equals 19.
The code then prints the formatted string with the calculated hour, minute, and second, resulting in '13:1:19'.
<<<Output>>>
13:1:19
