<<<Analysis>>>
The variables N and M are initialized to 4 and 1, respectively.
The variables a and b are initialized to 1 and N//2 (which is 2, since 4//2 is 2).
The variables c and d are initialized to N//2+1 (which is 3, since 4//2+1 is 3) and N (which is 4).
Since N is even (4%2 equals 0), the value of a is incremented by 1, so a becomes 2.
The variable i is initialized to 0, which will be used to control the loop.
The while loop is set to run while i is less than M (1 in this case).
In the first iteration of the loop, since i (0) is less than M (1), it prints the values of c and d, which are 3 and 4.
Then i is incremented by 1, and c and d are updated to c+1 and d-1, which would make them 4 and 3, respectively. However, since i is now equal to M (1), the loop will not continue to the next iteration.
The second if condition to print a and b is not executed because i is no longer less than M after the first iteration.
The loop ends after printing the pair (c, d) once, which is (3, 4).
