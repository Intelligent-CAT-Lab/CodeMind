<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a and b are initialized to 3 and 2, respectively.
The variable d is calculated as the integer division of a by b, which is 3 // 2, resulting in 1.
The variable r is calculated as the remainder of the division of a by b, which is 3 % 2, resulting in 1.
The variable f is calculated as the floating-point division of a by b, which is 3 / 2, resulting in 1.5.
The code then prints the values of d, r, and f formatted as specified, with f being formatted to 5 decimal places.
The output will be "1 1 1.50000" because d and r are both 1, and f is formatted to 5 decimal places as 1.50000.
<<<Output>>>
1 1 1.50000
