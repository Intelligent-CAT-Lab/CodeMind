<<<Analysis>>>
The input string "atcoder beginner contest" is split into three separate strings based on spaces and converted to uppercase, resulting in the list ['ATCODER', 'BEGINNER', 'CONTEST'].
The variables s1, s2, and s3 are assigned the values 'ATCODER', 'BEGINNER', and 'CONTEST', respectively.
The code then takes the first character of each string (s1[0], s2[0], s3[0]) which are 'A', 'B', and 'C', respectively.
These characters are concatenated to form the string 'ABC'.
The code prints the resulting string 'ABC'.
<<<Output>>>
ABC
