<<<Analysis>>>
The variables A, B, C, and D are initialized to 0, 75, 25, and 100, respectively.
The variable ans is calculated as the minimum of B and D (which is 75) minus the maximum of A and C (which is 25).
Therefore, ans = 75 - 25 = 50.
The if condition checks if ans is greater than 0, which it is (50 > 0).
Since the condition is true, the code prints the value of ans.
<<<Output>>>
50
