<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a and b are initialized to 8 and 10, respectively.
The MASK variable is not used in the given code, so it has no effect on the output.
The code prints the binary representation of the bitwise AND, OR, and XOR operations between a and b, each padded to 32 bits.

For the AND operation:
8 in binary is 1000
10 in binary is 1010
The bitwise AND of 8 and 10 is 1000 (since both have the fourth bit set to 1).

For the OR operation:
The bitwise OR of 8 and 10 is 1010 (since at least one of the corresponding bits in either number is 1).

For the XOR operation:
The bitwise XOR of 8 and 10 is 0010 (since the XOR operation results in 1 only when the corresponding bits are different).

The code formats these binary values as 32-bit binary strings with leading zeros.
