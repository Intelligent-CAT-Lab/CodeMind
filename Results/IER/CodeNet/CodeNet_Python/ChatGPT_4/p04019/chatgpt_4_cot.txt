<<<Analysis>>>
The input string 'SENW' is converted to a list of characters ['S', 'E', 'N', 'W'].
This list is then converted to a set to remove any duplicates, but since there are no duplicates in 'SENW', the set will be the same as the list.
The length of the set is checked. Since it has 4 unique characters, the length is 4.
The condition `if len(s)==4:` is satisfied, so "Yes" is printed.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
