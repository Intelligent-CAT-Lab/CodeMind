<<<Analysis>>>
The variables N, A, B, and C are initialized to 6, 3, 2, and 1, respectively, based on the input provided.
The code then calculates the expression N - A - B + C, which is equivalent to 6 - 3 - 2 + 1.
The calculation proceeds as follows:
6 - 3 = 3
3 - 2 = 1
1 + 1 = 2
The result of the calculation is 2.
The code then prints the result of the calculation.
<<<Output>>>
2
