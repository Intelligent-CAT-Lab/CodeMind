<<<Analysis>>>
The code uses the itertools.groupby function to group the input string by consecutive identical characters.
The input string is 'BBBWW'.
The groupby function will create two groups: ('B', 'BBB') and ('W', 'WW').
The sum function is used with a generator expression that counts 1 for each group created by groupby.
Since there are two groups, the generator expression will yield 1 two times.
The sum of these ones is 2.
However, the code subtracts 1 from the sum, so the final result is 2 - 1, which is 1.
