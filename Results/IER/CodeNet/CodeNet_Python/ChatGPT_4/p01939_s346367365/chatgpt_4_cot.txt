<<<Analysis>>>
The input string "3 9" is split into two parts '3' and '9', which are then converted to integers and assigned to variables n and m, respectively.
The condition checks if n is equal to 1, which it is not (n is 3), so the else block is executed.

Within the else block:
- The variable d is calculated as the integer division of m by (n - 1), which is 9 // (3 - 1) = 9 // 2 = 4.
- The variable A is calculated as m - d * (n - 1) + 1, which is 9 - 4 * (3 - 1) + 1 = 9 - 8 + 1 = 2.
- The variable B is calculated as m - (n - 1) + 1, which is 9 - (3 - 1) + 1 = 9 - 2 + 1 = 8.
- The variable ans is calculated as (A + B) * d + (m + 1), which is (2 + 8) * 4 + (9 + 1) = 10 * 4 + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50.
- The ans is then taken modulo 1000000007, which is 50 % 1000000007 = 50.

Finally, the value of ans is printed, which is 50.
