<<<Analysis>>>
The variables R1 and R2 are initialized to 2 and 3, respectively.
The code calculates the product of R1 and R2, which is 2 * 3 = 6.
Then it calculates the sum of R1 and R2, which is 2 + 3 = 5.
The code then divides the product by the sum, which is 6 / 5 = 1.2.
Finally, the code prints the result of the division.
<<<Output>>>
1.2
