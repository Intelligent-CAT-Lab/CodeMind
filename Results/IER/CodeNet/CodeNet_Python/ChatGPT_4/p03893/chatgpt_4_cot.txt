<<<Analysis>>>
The variable X is initialized to 2.
Two lists, g and h, each of length 50, are initialized with all elements set to None.
h[1] is set to 3 and g[1] is set to 6.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to X (inclusive), meaning it will consider the number 2.
For i equal to 2, the following calculations are performed:
    h[2] = g[1] + 1 = 6 + 1 = 7
    g[2] = 2 * h[2] = 2 * 7 = 14
After the loop finishes, the code prints the value of g[X], which is g[2].
The final value of g[2] is 14, so the output will be 14.
<<<Output>>>
14
