<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a, b, c, and d are initialized to 9, 8, 1000, and 999, respectively.
The code defines three functions: A_win, B_win, and Draw, which print "Alice", "Bob", and "Draw", respectively.
The code then checks if either c or d is equal to -1. Since neither c nor d is -1, it skips this condition.
Next, the code checks if c is greater than d. Since 1000 is greater than 999, the condition is true.
Therefore, the A_win function is called, and "Alice" will be printed.
<<<Output>>>
Alice
