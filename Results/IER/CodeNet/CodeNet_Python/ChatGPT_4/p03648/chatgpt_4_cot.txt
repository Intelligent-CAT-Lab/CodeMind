<<<Analysis>>>
The variable K is initialized to 0.
The code prints the number 50.
The variables a and b are calculated as the quotient and remainder of K divided by 50, respectively. Since K is 0, both a and b will be 0.
An empty list ans is created to store the answers.
The first for loop will iterate 50 times (since b is 0), appending the string representation of a+i to the ans list. Since a is 0, this will append the numbers 0 to 49 as strings to the list.
The second for loop will not execute because b is 0.
The code then prints the elements of ans joined by a space, which will be the numbers 0 to 49 separated by spaces.
