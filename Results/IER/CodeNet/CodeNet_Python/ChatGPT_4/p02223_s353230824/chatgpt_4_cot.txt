<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 2.
The code first checks if n is equal to 1, which it is not, so it skips that block.
Next, it checks if n is equal to 2, which it is, so it enters that block.
It prints the value 2.
It then prints the value 0.
After that, it prints the string "11".
Since there is an exit() call at the end of this block, the program will terminate after printing "11" and will not execute any further code.
<<<Output>>>
2
0
11
