<<<Analysis>>>
The variables n, a, and b are initialized to 5, 2, and 4, respectively.
The code checks if the difference between b and a is even by calculating (b-a)%2 and comparing it to 0.
Since (4-2)%2 equals 0, the condition is true.
Therefore, the code will print 'Alice' because the difference between b and a is even.
<<<Output>>>
Alice
