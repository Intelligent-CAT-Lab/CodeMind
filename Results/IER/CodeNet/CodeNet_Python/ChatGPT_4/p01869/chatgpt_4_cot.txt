<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines two functions, `f` and `g`, and initializes an empty list `a`. The function `f` is a recursive function that generates all numbers composed of digits 2 and 8 that are less than or equal to `n`. The function `g` is another recursive function that attempts to find the maximum number of times `n` can be divided by the elements of `a` before it becomes less than the square of the current element of `a`.

The input `n` is read and checked if it is odd. If `n` is odd, the program prints `-1` and exits because an odd number cannot be composed of only even digits (2 and 8).

Since the input is `1`, the program will immediately check if `n` is odd. Since `1` is odd, the program will print `-1` and exit without executing the rest of the code.

<<<Output>>>
-1
