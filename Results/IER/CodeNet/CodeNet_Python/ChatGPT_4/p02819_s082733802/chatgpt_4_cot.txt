<<<Analysis>>>
The function isPrime(n) is defined to check if a number n is prime. It does this by trying to divide n by all numbers from 2 up to the square root of n. If any division has no remainder, the function returns False, indicating n is not prime. If no divisors are found, it returns True, indicating n is prime.

The variable X is initialized to the input value, which is 20.
The while loop checks if X is not prime, and if it's not, it increments X by 1 and checks again.
The loop continues until a prime number is found.
Starting from 20, the next prime number is 23.
Once a prime number is found, the loop terminates, and the code prints the prime number.

<<<Output>>>
23
