<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a, b, x, and y are initialized to 2.0, 3.0, 1.0, and 2.0, respectively, as the input is split and converted to float.
The variable h is initialized to 1 if the condition a/2 == x and b/2 == y is true. In this case, since a/2 is 1.0 (which equals x) and b/2 is 1.5 (which does not equal y), the condition is false. Therefore, h is set to 0.
The code then prints the result of a*b/2 concatenated with a space and the value of h. The area of the rectangle with sides a and b is a*b/2, which is 2*3/2 = 3.0.
The final output is the string "3.0 0", representing the area and the value of h.
<<<Output>>>
3.0 0
