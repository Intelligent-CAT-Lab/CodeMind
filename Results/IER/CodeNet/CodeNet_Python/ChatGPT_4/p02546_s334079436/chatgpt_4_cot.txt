<<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized with the string 'apple'.
The code checks if the last character of s is 's' by accessing s[-1].
Since the last character of 'apple' is not 's', the condition is false.
Therefore, the code executes the else block, appending 's' to the string 'apple'.
The final string 'apples' is printed.
<<<Output>>>
apples
