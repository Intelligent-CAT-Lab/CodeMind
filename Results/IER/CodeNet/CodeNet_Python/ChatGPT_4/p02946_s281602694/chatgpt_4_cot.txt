<<<Analysis>>>
The input is split into a list of integers, resulting in n = [3, 7].
k is assigned the value 3, and x is assigned the value 7.
s1 is calculated as x - k + 1, which is 7 - 3 + 1 = 5.
s2 is calculated as x + k - 1, which is 7 + 3 - 1 = 9.
a1 is a list of integers ranging from s1 to s2 (inclusive), which is [5, 6, 7, 8, 9].
The list a1 is then converted to a list of strings and joined with spaces, resulting in the string "5 6 7 8 9".
The final output is printed, which is the string "5 6 7 8 9".
<<<Output>>>
5 6 7 8 9
