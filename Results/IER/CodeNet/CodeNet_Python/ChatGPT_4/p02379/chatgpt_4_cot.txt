<<<Analysis>>>
The input "0 0 1 1" is split into four separate strings and then each string is converted to a float using the map function. The variables x1, y1, x2, and y2 are assigned the values 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, and 1.0 respectively.
The code then calculates the distance between the points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) using the Euclidean distance formula, which is the square root of the sum of the squared differences of the coordinates.
The calculation is as follows: sqrt((0.0 - 1.0) ** 2 + (0.0 - 1.0) ** 2), which simplifies to sqrt((-1) ** 2 + (-1) ** 2), which further simplifies to sqrt(1 + 1), which is sqrt(2).
The result of sqrt(2) is then formatted to a floating-point number with six decimal places and printed.
The output will be the square root of 2, formatted to six decimal places.
