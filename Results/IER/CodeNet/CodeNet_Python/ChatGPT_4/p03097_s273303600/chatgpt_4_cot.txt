The variables n, a, and b are initialized to 2, 1, and 3, respectively, from the input.
The function `doit` is defined to take three arguments: a, b, and mask. It is used to generate a sequence of numbers from a to b with certain conditions.

The code checks if the number of 1s in the binary representation of a XOR b is odd. If it's not odd (i.e., it's even), it prints "NO" and stops. Since 1 XOR 3 is 2 (binary 10), and it has only one 1 in its binary representation, the condition is satisfied, and the code proceeds.

The code then prints "YES" and calls the `doit` function with the initial values of a, b, and 0 for the mask.

The `doit` function works as follows:
- It finds the first position where a and b differ and have not been masked yet (differ).
- It finds the first position where a and b are the same and have not been masked yet, and it is not the differ position (same).
- If there is no such position (same == -1), it returns a list containing a and b.
- Otherwise, it recursively calls itself twice, flipping the bit at the same position in a for the first call and flipping the bits at the same and differ positions in a for the second call, updating the mask to include the differ position.

For the input `2 1 3`, the binary representations are `01` and `11`. The differ position is 1 (since the second bit is different), and the same position is 0 (since the first bit is the same).

The first recursive call to `doit` will be with a = 1, a ^ (1 << same) = 0, and mask = 2 (binary 10).
The second recursive call to `doit` will be with a ^ (1 << same) ^ (1 << differ) = 2, b = 3, and mask = 2 (binary 10).

In the first recursive call, since same will be -1 (no same position left), it will return [1, 0].
In the second recursive call, since same will be -1 again, it will return [2, 3].

The final result will be the concatenation of these two lists: [1, 0, 2, 3].

The output will be "YES" followed by the numbers in the result list joined by spaces.
