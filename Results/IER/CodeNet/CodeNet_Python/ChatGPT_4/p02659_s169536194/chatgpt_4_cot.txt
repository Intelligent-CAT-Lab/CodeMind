<<<Analysis>>>
The variables A and B are initialized with the input values '198' and '1.10', respectively.
A is converted to an integer, so it remains 198.
B is converted to a Decimal, which is a data type that provides decimal floating-point arithmetic with more precision than the built-in float.
The code multiplies A and B, which results in 198 * 1.10. Since B is a Decimal, the multiplication is done with decimal precision, resulting in 217.8.
Finally, the code prints the result of the multiplication cast to an integer, which truncates the decimal part and results in 217.
<<<Output>>>
217
