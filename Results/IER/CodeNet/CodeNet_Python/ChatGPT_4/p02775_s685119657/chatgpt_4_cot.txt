<<<Analysis>>>
The input '36' is read as a string and passed to the function solve2.

The function solve2 reverses the string, resulting in '63', and appends a '0' to it, resulting in '630'.

The length of the string '630' is 3, so the dp array is initialized with dimensions 4x2 with all values set to INF (a very large number, 10**9).

The dp array is used to store the minimum number of operations needed to make each digit either 0 or 9, considering the possibility of carrying over a 1 to the next digit (denoted by the second dimension of the dp array).

The dp array is initialized with dp[0][0] = 0, meaning no operations are needed to start.

The algorithm iterates over each digit of the reversed string '630' and calculates the minimum operations needed for each digit, considering whether a carry is coming from the previous digit or not.

For the first digit '6':
- Without a carry, it can be turned into 0 with 6 operations, or into 9 with 4 operations (with a carry to the next digit).
- With a carry, it can be turned into 0 with 7 operations, or into 9 with 3 operations (with a carry to the next digit).

For the second digit '3':
- Without a carry, it can be turned into 0 with 3 operations, or into 9 with 7 operations (with a carry to the next digit).
- With a carry, it can be turned into 0 with 4 operations, or into 9 with 6 operations (with a carry to the next digit).

For the third digit '0' (which was appended):
- Without a carry, it remains 0 with 0 operations.
- With a carry, it can be turned into 9 with 1 operation (and no further carry).

The algorithm then prints the minimum number of operations needed to turn all digits into 0 without a carry, which is stored in dp[n_len][0].

The final result is the minimum number of operations needed to turn '36' into '00', which is 9 (turning '6' into '0' with 6 operations and '3' into '0' with 3 operations).
