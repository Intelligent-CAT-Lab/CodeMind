<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a and b are initialized to 1 and 3, respectively.
The variable c is calculated as the average of a and b, which is (1+3)/2 = 2.0.
The variable d is the integer part of c, which is int(2.0) = 2.
The code then checks if the decimal part of c is greater than 0, which is not the case here because c is exactly 2.0 and d is also 2.
Since c - d is not greater than 0 (it's exactly 0), the code will print the value of d.
<<<Output>>>
2
