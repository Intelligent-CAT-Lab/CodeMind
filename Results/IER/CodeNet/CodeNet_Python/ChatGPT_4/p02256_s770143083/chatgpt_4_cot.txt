The variables a and b are initialized to 54 and 20, respectively.
The gcd function is defined to calculate the greatest common divisor of two numbers.
Inside the gcd function, there is a check to ensure that a is greater than b. If b is greater, their values are swapped, but in this case, since a is already greater than b, no swap is needed.
The function then enters a while loop that continues as long as b is greater than 0.
Inside the loop, the modulo of a divided by b is calculated and stored in mod.
The value of a is then set to b, and the value of b is set to mod.
This process repeats until b becomes 0.
When b is 0, the loop ends, and the function returns the current value of a, which is the greatest common divisor.
For the given input, the sequence of operations in the loop will be:
- mod = 54 % 20 = 14, then a = 20, b = 14
- mod = 20 % 14 = 6, then a = 14, b = 6
- mod = 14 % 6 = 2, then a = 6, b = 2
- mod = 6 % 2 = 0, then a = 2, b = 0
The loop ends because b is now 0, and the function returns the current value of a, which is 2.
The gcd of 54 and 20 is 2, so the output will be 2.
