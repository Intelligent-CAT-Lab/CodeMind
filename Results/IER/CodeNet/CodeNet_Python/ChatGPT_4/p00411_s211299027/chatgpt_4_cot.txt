<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a, t, and r are initialized to 180, 120, and 90, respectively.
The code calculates the expression r / a * t, which is equivalent to (90 / 180) * 120.
First, it divides 90 by 180, resulting in 0.5.
Then, it multiplies 0.5 by 120, resulting in 60.
Finally, the code prints the result of the calculation, which is 60.
<<<Output>>>
60
