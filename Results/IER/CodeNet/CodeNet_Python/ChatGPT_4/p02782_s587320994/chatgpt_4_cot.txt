The variables r1, c1, r2, and c2 are initialized to 1, 1, 2, and 2, respectively.
The function cmb calculates the combination of n choose r modulo mod, where mod is 10^9 + 7.
The lists fact, factinv, and inv are initialized with base values for factorial, factorial inverse, and modular inverse, respectively.
The code then precalculates the factorials, modular inverses, and factorial inverses up to N = r2 + c2 + 3, which in this case is 2 + 2 + 3 = 7.
The code calculates the values of a, b, c, and d using the cmb function, which are combinations required for the final answer.
a = cmb(6, 3, mod) = 20
b = cmb(3, 1, mod) = 3
c = cmb(4, 1, mod) = 4
d = cmb(2, 1, mod) = 2
The final answer is calculated as ans = a - b - c + d, which is 20 - 3 - 4 + 2 = 15.
The output is the value of ans modulo mod, which is 15 % (10^9 + 7) = 15.
