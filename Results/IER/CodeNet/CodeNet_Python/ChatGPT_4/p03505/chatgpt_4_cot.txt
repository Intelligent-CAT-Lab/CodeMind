The variables K, A, and B are initialized to 4000, 2000, and 500, respectively.
The first if condition checks if A is less than or equal to B and K is greater than A. This is not true because A (2000) is greater than B (500).
The elif condition checks if A is greater than or equal to K. This is not true because A (2000) is less than K (4000).
Since neither the if nor the elif conditions are met, the code proceeds to the else block.
The expression in the else block calculates the number of days required for the task to be completed.
The expression `1 - int(- (K-A) // (A-B))*2` is evaluated as follows:
- (K-A) is (4000-2000) which equals 2000.
- (A-B) is (2000-500) which equals 1500.
- The division -(K-A) // (A-B) is -2000 // 1500 which equals -2 because // is the floor division operator.
- The int function is redundant here because the result of the floor division is already an integer.
- The final calculation is 1 - (-2)*2 which equals 1 - (-4) which equals 5.
Therefore, the output will be 5.
