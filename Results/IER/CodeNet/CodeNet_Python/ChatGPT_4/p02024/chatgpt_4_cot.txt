<<<Analysis>>>
The variables h, w, s, and t are initialized to 4, 5, 2, and 3, respectively.
The code first checks if the product of h and w is odd, which would be the case if h * w % 2 equals 1.
Since 4 * 5 equals 20 and 20 % 2 equals 0, the condition h * w % 2 == 1 is false.
Therefore, the code does not enter the if block and goes directly to the else block.
The else block contains a single print statement that outputs "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
