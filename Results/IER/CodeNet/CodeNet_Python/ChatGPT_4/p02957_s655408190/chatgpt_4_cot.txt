<<<Analysis>>>
The variables A and B are initialized to 2 and 16, respectively.
The code checks if the sum of A and B is even by using the modulo operator. In this case, 2 + 16 = 18, which is an even number.
Since the sum is even, the code proceeds to calculate the average of A and B, which is (A+B)/2. The average of 2 and 16 is 18/2 = 9.
The code then prints the integer value of the average, which is 9.
<<<Output>>>
9
