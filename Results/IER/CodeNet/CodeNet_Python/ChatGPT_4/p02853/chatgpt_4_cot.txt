<<<Analysis>>>
The variables x and y are initialized to 1 and 1, respectively.
The variable X is initialized to 0, and the variable Y is initialized to 0.
The code then checks the value of x:
- Since x is 1, it enters the elif block where x == 1 and sets X to 300000.
Next, the code checks the value of y:
- Since y is 1, it enters the elif block where y == 1 and sets Y to 300000.
After setting the values of X and Y, the code checks if both x and y are 1:
- Since both are 1, it enters the if block and calculates the sum of X and Y, which is 300000 + 300000, and then adds an additional 400000.
The code prints the result of this calculation, which is 1000000.
<<<Output>>>
1000000
