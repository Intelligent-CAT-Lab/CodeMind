<<<Analysis>>>
The code is designed to calculate the number of n-digit numbers that do not contain a haiku pattern. A haiku pattern is defined by the input parameters X, Y, and Z, which represent the lengths of three consecutive sequences of increasing digits by 1. The haiku pattern is a binary number with 1s in positions that correspond to the haiku pattern and 0s elsewhere.

The input parameters are n=3, X=5, Y=7, Z=5. Therefore, the haiku pattern is a binary number with 1s in the 5th, 12th, and 17th positions from the right, which is `0b1000000100000010` when shifted to the right by one position.

The variable `t` is set to `1 << (X + Y + Z)`, which is `1 << 17`, representing the total number of binary states to consider for the haiku pattern.

The variable `dp` is a list of length `t` initialized with zeros except for `dp[0]` which is set to 1. This represents the dynamic programming table where each index corresponds to a binary state, and the value at each index represents the number of ways to reach that state.

The main loop iterates `n` times, representing the addition of each digit to the number being constructed. For each iteration, a temporary list `tm` is created as a copy of `dp`.

The inner loop iterates over all possible states `k` and for each state, it iterates over all digits `d` from 0 to 9. It calculates the new state `m` by shifting `k` left by `d+1` positions and adding `1 << d`. If `m` contains the haiku pattern, it is skipped; otherwise, the count of ways to reach the state `m` is updated in `dp`.

After the loops, the variable `sub` is calculated as the sum of all values in `dp`, representing the total number of n-digit numbers that contain the haiku pattern.

The final answer is calculated as `pow(10, n, mo) - sub`, which is the total number of n-digit numbers minus the number of numbers that contain the haiku pattern. This result is printed modulo `mo`.

The `show` function calls at the end are not executed because `show_flg` is set to `False`.

Given the input `3 5 7 5`, the code will calculate the number of 3-digit numbers that do not contain the haiku pattern defined by X=5, Y=7, Z=5.
