The variable h is initialized to 2.
The variable l is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate a value based on the while loop's logic.
The while loop will continue to execute as long as h is greater than 0.
In the first iteration of the loop:
- l becomes 2*0 + 1, which is 1.
- h becomes 2//2, which is 1.
In the second iteration of the loop:
- l becomes 2*1 + 1, which is 3.
- h becomes 1//2, which is 0.
The loop stops because h is no longer greater than 0.
The final value of l, which is 3, is printed.
