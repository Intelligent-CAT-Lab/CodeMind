<<<Analysis>>>
The input string "1 5 2" is taken and split into a list of strings ['1', '5', '2'] using the split() method.
This list of strings is then converted into a list of integers [1, 5, 2] using a list comprehension.
The list of integers is sorted to become [1, 2, 5].
The third element of the sorted list (b[2]) is multiplied by 10 and then added to the second element (b[1]) and the first element (b[0]).
The calculation is as follows: 5*10 + 2 + 1 = 50 + 2 + 1 = 53.
The result of this calculation, 53, is printed.
<<<Output>>>
53
