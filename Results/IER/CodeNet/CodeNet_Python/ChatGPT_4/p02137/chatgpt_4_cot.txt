<<<Analysis>>>
The input is a string '5700', which is converted to an integer using int(input()).
This integer, 5700, is then divided by 500 using integer division (//), which results in 11 (since 5700 // 500 = 11).
The result of this division, 11, is then multiplied by 500, giving 5500.
Finally, the code prints this result, which is 5500.
<<<Output>>>
5500
