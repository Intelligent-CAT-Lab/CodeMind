<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a and b are initialized to 1 and 3, respectively, from the input.
The variable mean is calculated as the average of a and b, which is (1+3)/2 = 2.0.
The variable ans is the ceiling of mean, which is the smallest integer greater than or equal to mean. Since mean is 2.0, the ceiling of 2.0 is 2.
The code then prints the value of ans, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
