The variables N, A, B, C, and D are initialized to 5, 1, 5, 2, and 4, respectively.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 5 for the variable k.
For each iteration, it calculates the value of j as N-1-k. For k=0, j=4; for k=1, j=3; and so on.
The code checks if the inequality D*k - C*j >= B-A >= C*k - D*j holds true for any value of k and corresponding j.
The inequality simplifies to 4k - 2j >= 4 >= 2k - 4j.
We need to find at least one pair (k, j) that satisfies the inequality.
For k=0, j=4, the inequality becomes 0 - 8 >= 4 >= 0 - 16, which is false.
For k=1, j=3, the inequality becomes 4 - 6 >= 4 >= 2 - 12, which is false.
For k=2, j=2, the inequality becomes 8 - 4 >= 4 >= 4 - 8, which is true because 4 >= 4 >= -4.
Since the condition is met, the code prints 'YES' and breaks out of the loop.
If no such k and j were found to satisfy the condition, the code would execute the else clause and print 'NO'. However, in this case, the condition is satisfied for k=2, j=2.

YES
