<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 5 and variable k is initialized to 3.
The list l is created with elements from 0 to n-1, which is [0, 1, 2, 3, 4].
The list p is initialized as an empty list, which will store tuples of (bitmask, combination).
The code then enters a loop that generates all combinations of the elements in l taken k at a time, which are combinations of 3 elements from [0, 1, 2, 3, 4].
For each combination i, it initializes num to 0 and then iterates through the elements in the combination.
For each element j in the combination, it updates num by performing a bitwise OR operation with 1 shifted left by j positions. This effectively sets the j-th bit of num.
The tuple (num, i) is appended to the list p, where num is the bitmask representation of the combination and i is the combination itself.
After all combinations are processed, the list p is sorted. The sorting is done based on the first element of the tuple, which is the bitmask.
Finally, the code prints each bitmask and its corresponding combination in the sorted order.
The output will be the bitmasks and the combinations in ascending order of the bitmasks.
