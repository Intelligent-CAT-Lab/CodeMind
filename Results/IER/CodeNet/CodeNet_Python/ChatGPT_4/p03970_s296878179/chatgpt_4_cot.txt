The variable S is initialized to a list of characters from the input string "C0DEFESTIVAL2O16".
The variable C is initialized to a list of characters from the string "CODEFESTIVAL2016".
The variable cnt is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of differences between S and C.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the indices of the list C.
For each index i, it compares the character at position i in S with the character at position i in C.
If the characters are different, cnt is incremented by 1.
The differences are at index 1 ('0' vs 'O') and index 13 ('O' vs '0'), so cnt will be incremented twice.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of cnt, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
