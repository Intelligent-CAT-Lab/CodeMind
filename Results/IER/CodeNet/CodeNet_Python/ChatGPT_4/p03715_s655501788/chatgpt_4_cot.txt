The variables H and W are initialized to 3 and 5, respectively.
The function divide_h is defined to find the minimum difference between the largest and smallest pieces when a rectangle of height h and width w is divided into three parts.

The function divide_h is called twice, once with the original dimensions (H, W) and once with the dimensions swapped (W, H).

First call to divide_h with (H, W) = (3, 5):
- The loop iterates over x from 1 to h-1 (1 and 2 in this case).
- For x = 1:
  - s_A = 1 * 5 = 5
  - Vertical divide:
    - w1 = 5 // 2 = 2
    - s_B = 2 * (3 - 1) = 4
    - s_C = (5 - 2) * (3 - 1) = 3 * 2 = 6
    - The difference is max(5, 4, 6) - min(5, 4, 6) = 6 - 4 = 2
    - min_diff is updated to 2
  - Horizontal divide:
    - h1 = (3 - 1) // 2 = 1
    - s_B = 5 * 1 = 5
    - s_C = 5 * (2 - 1) = 5
    - The difference is max(5, 5, 5) - min(5, 5, 5) = 5 - 5 = 0
    - min_diff is updated to 0
- For x = 2:
  - s_A = 2 * 5 = 10
  - Vertical divide:
    - w1 = 5 // 2 = 2
    - s_B = 2 * (3 - 2) = 2
    - s_C = (5 - 2) * (3 - 2) = 3
    - The difference is max(10, 2, 3) - min(10, 2, 3) = 10 - 2 = 8
    - min_diff remains 0 as 8 > 0
  - Horizontal divide:
    - h1 = (3 - 2) // 2 = 0
    - s_B = 5 * 0 = 0
    - s_C = 5 * (1 - 0) = 5
    - The difference is max(10, 0, 5) - min(10, 0, 5) = 10 - 0 = 10
    - min_diff remains 0 as 10 > 0
- The function returns min_diff which is 0.

Second call to divide_h with (H, W) = (5, 3):
- The loop iterates over x from 1 to h-1 (1, 2, 3, and 4 in this case).
- For x = 1:
  - s_A = 1 * 3 = 3
  - Vertical divide:
    - w1 = 3 // 2 = 1
    - s_B = 1 * (5 - 1) = 4
    - s_C = (3 - 1) * (5 - 1) = 2 * 4 = 8
    - The difference is max(3, 4, 8) - min(3, 4, 8) = 8 - 3 = 5
    - min_diff is updated to 5
  - Horizontal divide:
    - h1 = (5 - 1) // 2 = 2
    - s_B = 3 * 2 = 6
    - s_C = 3 * (4 - 2) = 6
    - The difference is max(3, 6, 6) - min(3, 6, 6) = 6 - 3 = 3
    - min_diff is updated to 3
- For x = 2, 3, and 4, similar calculations are done, but none of them will result in a smaller min_diff than 3.

- The function returns min_diff which is 3.

Finally, the print statement prints the minimum of a1 and a2, which are 0 and 3, respectively.
