<<<Analysis>>>
The input string 'atcoderregularcontest' is converted into a set to remove duplicates, and then sorted to get a list of unique characters in alphabetical order. The resulting list 's' is:
['a', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'g', 'l', 'o', 'r', 's', 't', 'u']

The list 'abc' is created with all lowercase alphabets from 'a' to 'z'.

The code then enters a loop that iterates over each character in 'abc'.

The first condition checks if 's' is equal to 'abc', which it is not, so the code does not print 'None' and does not break out of the loop.

The second condition checks if the current character 'i' from 'abc' is not in 's'. The loop will continue until it finds the first character from 'abc' that is not in 's'.

The first character in 'abc' that is not in 's' is 'b'. When 'i' is 'b', the condition 'elif i not in s' is True, so the code prints 'b' and breaks out of the loop.

<<<Output>>>
b
