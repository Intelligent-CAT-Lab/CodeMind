<<<Analysis>>>
The input `6` is passed to the `solve` function as the value of `k`.
A deque `que` is initialized with a tuple `(1, 1)`, representing a number `x` and its count `c`.
A dictionary `dp` is initialized to keep track of the minimum count to reach each remainder when divided by `k`.

The while loop will continue until `que` is empty. Inside the loop:
- The last element of `que` is popped, which initially is `(1, 1)`.
- `y` is calculated as `(x + 1) % k`, which is `(1 + 1) % 6 = 2`.
- Since `2` is not in `dp` or `dp[2]` is greater than `c + 1`, `dp[2]` is set to `c + 1`, which is `2`, and `(2, 2)` is appended to the left of `que`.
- `z` is calculated as `(10 * x) % k`, which is `(10 * 1) % 6 = 4`.
- Since `4` is not in `dp` or `dp[4]` is greater than `c`, `dp[4]` is set to `c`, which is `1`, and `(4, 1)` is appended to the right of `que`.

The loop continues with the next iteration, where `x` is `4` and `c` is `1`:
- `y` is `(4 + 1) % 6 = 5`.
- `dp[5]` is set to `2` and `(5, 2)` is appended to the left of `que`.
- `z` is `(10 * 4) % 6 = 4`.
- Since `4` is already in `dp` with a value of `1`, which is not greater than `c`, nothing happens.

The loop continues with `x` being `5` and `c` being `2`:
- `y` is `(5 + 1) % 6 = 0`.
- `dp[0]` is set to `3` and `(0, 3)` is appended to the left of `que`.
- `z` is `(10 * 5) % 6 = 2`.
- Since `2` is already in `dp` with a value of `2`, which is not greater than `c`, nothing happens.

At this point, `dp[0]` has been set to `3`, and since we are looking for `dp[0]`, the function will return `3`.

The output of the function `solve(k)` with `k = 6` is `3`.
