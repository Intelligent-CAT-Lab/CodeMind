The variables b1, b2, and b3 are initialized to 0, 0, and 1, respectively.
The first if condition checks if b1 is equal to 1, which it is not (b1 is 0), so it goes to the else block.
Inside the else block, another if condition checks if b2 is equal to 1, which it is not (b2 is 0), so it goes to the else block.
Inside this else block, another if condition checks if b3 is equal to 1, which it is (b3 is 1), so it executes the print("Open") statement.
The output of the code will be "Open".
