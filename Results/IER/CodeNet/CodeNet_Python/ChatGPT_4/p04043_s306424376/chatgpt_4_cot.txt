<<<Analysis>>>
The input '5 5 7' is read as a string and split into a list `a` containing the strings ['5', '5', '7'].
The itertools.permutations function is used to generate all possible permutations of the string '575'.
These permutations are converted into a list `b`, which will contain tuples of all permutations of '575'.
The code then initializes a flag variable to 0, which will be used to indicate if a match is found.
The code enters a loop that iterates over the length of the list `b`.
For each tuple in `b`, it concatenates the elements to form a string `c`.
The code checks if the list of characters in `c` is equal to the list `a`.
If a match is found, the flag is set to 1.
After the loop, the code prints 'YES' if flag is 1, otherwise 'NO'.
Since '575' can be permuted to '557', which is the same as the input list when sorted, the flag will be set to 1.
Therefore, the output will be 'YES'.
