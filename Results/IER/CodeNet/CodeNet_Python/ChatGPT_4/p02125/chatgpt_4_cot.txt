The variable N is initialized to 2.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of times the while loop executes.
The variable x is initialized to 1.
The while loop condition checks if 2*x-1 is less than or equal to N. Since 2*1-1 equals 1, which is less than 2, the loop executes.
Inside the loop, x is updated to 2*x, which makes x equal to 2.
ans is incremented by 1, making ans equal to 1.
The loop condition is checked again. Now, 2*x-1 equals 2*2-1, which is 3. Since 3 is not less than or equal to 2, the loop terminates.
The final value of ans, which is 1, is printed.
