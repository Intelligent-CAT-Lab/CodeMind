<<<Analysis>>>
The variables n and l are initialized to 5 and 2, respectively.
The code then checks if l is greater than or equal to 0, which it is.
Since the condition is true, the code executes the first print statement.
The expression calculates as follows:
l * (n - 1) + (n - 1) * n // 2
2 * (5 - 1) + (5 - 1) * 5 // 2
2 * 4 + 4 * 5 // 2
8 + 20 // 2
8 + 10
18
The code prints the result of the expression, which is 18.
<<<Output>>>
18
