The variables N and A are initialized to 8 and 1, respectively.
The function F(K) is defined to calculate the minimum cost for a given K, where K is the sum of x and y (the number of times n and n+1 are used, respectively).

The function F(K) works as follows:
- It first finds the largest integer n such that n^K <= N. It does this by taking the K-th root of N and then adjusting n downwards if necessary.
- It then adjusts n upwards if n * (n+1)^(K-1) < N.
- Once the correct n is found, it searches for the smallest y (and corresponding x = K - y) such that n^x * (n+1)^y >= N.
- The cost is then calculated as A*(K-1) + n*x + (n+1)*y.

The answer is the minimum cost calculated by calling F(K) for K in the range from 1 to 49 (inclusive).

Let's calculate the cost for K = 1 to 4 (since the answer will likely be within this range for N = 8):
- For K = 1: n = 8, x = 1, y = 0, cost = 1*(1-1) + 8*1 + 9*0 = 8
- For K = 2: n = 2, x = 2, y = 0, cost = 1*(2-1) + 2*2 + 3*0 = 5
- For K = 3: n = 1, x = 3, y = 0, cost = 1*(3-1) + 1*3 + 2*0 = 5
- For K = 4: n = 1, x = 4, y = 0, cost = 1*(4-1) + 1*4 + 2*0 = 7

The minimum cost is 5, which occurs for both K = 2 and K = 3.
