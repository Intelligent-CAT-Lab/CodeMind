The variables N and M are initialized to 1 and 998244353, respectively.
A 2D list dp is created with dimensions (3*N+1) x (2*N+1), which in this case is 4 x 3, and all elements are initialized to 0.

The first loop initializes the first column (j=0 to N) of the first row (i=0) of dp to 1.

The nested loops then calculate the values for the rest of the dp table using the given recurrence relation. The relation depends on the values of dp at previous indices and the current indices i and j. The modulo operation with M ensures that the numbers stay within the range of the modulus.

Since N is 1, the loops will not iterate many times. The final result will be the value at dp[3*N][N] modulo M, which is dp[3][1] % 998244353.

The calculations for dp[i][j] are as follows:
- dp[1][0] = (dp[0][0] + dp[0][1] + dp[0][0]) % 998244353 = (1 + 0 + 0) % 998244353 = 1
- dp[1][1] = (dp[0][0] + dp[0][0]) % 998244353 = (1 + 0) % 998244353 = 1
- dp[2][0] = (dp[1][0] + dp[0][1] + dp[0][0]) % 998244353 = (1 + 0 + 0) % 998244353 = 1
- dp[2][1] = (dp[1][0] + dp[0][2] * 1 + dp[0][1] * 0) % 998244353 = (1 + 0 + 0) % 998244353 = 1
- dp[2][2] = (dp[1][1] + dp[0][2] * 0) % 998244353 = (1 + 0) % 998244353 = 1
- dp[3][0] = (dp[2][0] + dp[1][1] + dp[0][0]) % 998244353 = (1 + 1 + 0) % 998244353 = 2
- dp[3][1] = (dp[2][0] + dp[1][2] * 2 + dp[0][1] * 0) % 998244353 = (1 + 0 + 0) % 998244353 = 1

The final result is dp[3][1] % 998244353, which is 1 % 998244353.
