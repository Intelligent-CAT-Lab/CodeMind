<<<Analysis>>>
The input `4 3` initializes `n` to 4 and `k` to 3.

The code defines three dictionaries `m_comb`, `m_pow`, and `m_inv` to memoize the results of combinations, powers, and modular inverses, respectively.

The `comb` function calculates the binomial coefficient (N choose K) using a recursive approach with memoization. It uses the property that C(N, K) = C(N-1, K) + C(N-1, K-1) and modulo `MOD` to keep the numbers within the bounds of the modulus.

The `pow` function calculates N raised to the power of `n` modulo `MOD`, again using memoization to store previously calculated powers.

The `inv` function calculates the modular inverse of N modulo `MOD` using the exponentiation by squaring method and Fermat's little theorem, since `MOD` is a prime number.

The variable `ans` is initialized to `pow(k)`, which calculates `k` raised to the power of `n` modulo `MOD`.

The code then enters a loop that iterates from `k-1` down to 1, updating `ans` by adding the product of the combination `comb(k, i)`, `pow(i)`, and `sig` modulo `MOD`. The `sig` variable alternates between -1 and 1, effectively subtracting and adding terms alternately.

After this loop, another loop runs from 1 to `k` (inclusive), multiplying `ans` by the modular inverse of `i` modulo `MOD` and taking the result modulo `MOD`.

Finally, the code prints the value of `ans`.

Let's calculate the values step by step:

1. `ans = pow(k) = pow(3) = 3^4 % MOD = 81 % MOD = 81` (since 81 is less than `MOD`).
2. The first loop calculates the following:
   - For `i = 2`: `ans += (comb(3, 2) * pow(2) % MOD) * sig = (81 + (3 * 16 % MOD) * -1) % MOD = (81 - 48) % MOD = 33 % MOD = 33`.
   - For `i = 1`: `ans += (comb(3, 1) * pow(1) % MOD) * sig = (33 + (3 * 1 % MOD) * 1) % MOD = (33 + 3) % MOD = 36 % MOD = 36`.
3. The second loop calculates the following:
   - For `i = 1`: `ans *= inv(1) = 36 * 1 % MOD = 36`.
   - For `i = 2`: `ans *= inv(2) = 36 * (MOD/2 + 1) % MOD = 36 * 500000004 % MOD = 18000000144 % MOD = 18`.
   - For `i = 3`: `ans *= inv(3) = 18 * (MOD/3 + 1) % MOD = 18 * 333333336 % MOD = 60000000648 % MOD = 48`.

Therefore, the final value of `ans` is 48.
