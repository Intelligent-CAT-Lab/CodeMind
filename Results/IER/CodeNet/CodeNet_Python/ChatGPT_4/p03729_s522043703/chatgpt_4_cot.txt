<<<Analysis>>>
The variables A, B, and C are initialized to the strings 'rng', 'gorilla', and 'apple', respectively.
The code checks two conditions:
1. If the last character of A ('rng') is the same as the first character of B ('gorilla'), which is not true because 'g' is not equal to 'r'.
2. If the last character of B ('gorilla') is the same as the first character of C ('apple'), which is true because both are 'a'.
However, since the first condition is not met, the combined condition (A[-1] == B[0] and B[-1] == C[0]) is False.
Therefore, the code will execute the else block and print 'NO'.
