<<<Analysis>>>
The variable total is initialized to 1024.
The variable num_500 is calculated by integer division of total by 500, which results in 2 (since 1024 // 500 is 2).
The variable remain is calculated by subtracting num_500 times 500 from total, which results in 24 (since 1024 - 2 * 500 is 24).
The variable num_5 is calculated by integer division of remain by 5, which results in 4 (since 24 // 5 is 4).
The final print statement calculates num_500 times 1000 plus num_5 times 5, which results in 2000 + 20, equaling 2020.
<<<Output>>>
