The variables a, b, and c are initialized to 4, 12, and 20, respectively.
The code first checks if a, b, and c are all equal and even. If this is true, it prints -1. In this case, a, b, and c are not all equal, so it proceeds to the else block.
The variable res is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of operations performed.
The code enters a while loop that will continue indefinitely until a break condition is met.
Inside the loop, the code checks if any of a, b, or c is odd. If any of them is odd, the loop breaks and the current value of res is printed.
If none of a, b, or c is odd, the code performs the following operations:
- a is assigned the value of (b+c)//2, which is (12+20)//2 = 16.
- b is assigned the value of (a+c)//2, which is (4+20)//2 = 12.
- c is assigned the value of (a+b)//2, which is (4+12)//2 = 8.
- res is incremented by 1.
Now a, b, and c are 16, 12, and 8, respectively, and res is 1.
The loop continues, and the code checks again if any of a, b, or c is odd. They are all still even, so the operations are performed again:
- a is assigned the value of (b+c)//2, which is (12+8)//2 = 10.
- b is assigned the value of (a+c)//2, which is (16+8)//2 = 12.
- c is assigned the value of (a+b)//2, which is (16+12)//2 = 14.
- res is incremented by 1.
Now a, b, and c are 10, 12, and 14, respectively, and res is 2.
The loop continues, and this time, a is odd (10 is even, but due to integer division, the next value of a will be odd). Therefore, the loop breaks and the current value of res, which is 2, is printed.
