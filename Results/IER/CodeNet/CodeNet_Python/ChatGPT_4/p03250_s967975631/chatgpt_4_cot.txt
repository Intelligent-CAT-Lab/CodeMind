<<<Analysis>>>
The input list l is initialized with the numbers 1, 5, and 2.
The list is then sorted, resulting in the list [1, 2, 5].
The code concatenates the third and second elements of the sorted list (which are 5 and 2, respectively) into a string "52", and then converts it back to an integer 52.
It then adds the first element of the sorted list (which is 1) to this integer, resulting in 52 + 1.
The final result, which is 53, is printed.
<<<Output>>>
53
