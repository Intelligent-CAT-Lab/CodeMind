<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a, b, and n are initialized to 5, 7, and 4, respectively.
The code checks if b is less than or equal to n+1. Since b (7) is greater than n+1 (5), the else block is executed.
In the else block, x is set to the value of n, which is 4.
The variable g is calculated using the floor division of a*x by b, which is math.floor(5*4/7).
The calculation is as follows: 5*4 = 20, then 20/7 = 2.857..., and the floor of that is 2.
The code then prints the value of g, which is 2.
