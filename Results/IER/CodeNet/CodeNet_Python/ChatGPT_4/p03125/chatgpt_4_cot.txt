<<<Analysis>>>
The variables x and y are initialized to 4 and 12, respectively.
The code checks if y is divisible by x using the modulo operator. Since 12 is divisible by 4, the condition y%x == 0 is True.
Because the condition is True, the code executes the first print statement, which prints the sum of x and y.
The sum of x and y is 4 + 12, which equals 16.
<<<Output>>>
16
