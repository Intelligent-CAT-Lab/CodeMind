<<<Analysis>>>
The input numbers are stored in a list called num as integers: [1, 1, 3, 4].
The list is then sorted, which will result in the list [1, 1, 3, 4] (no change in this case as the first two numbers are already the smallest and are equal).
The code checks if the first two numbers are equal (num[0] == num[1]) and if the last two numbers are equal (num[2] == num[3]).
In this case, the first two numbers are equal (1 == 1), but the last two numbers are not equal (3 != 4).
Since the condition is not met, the code will print "no".
<<<Output>>>
no
