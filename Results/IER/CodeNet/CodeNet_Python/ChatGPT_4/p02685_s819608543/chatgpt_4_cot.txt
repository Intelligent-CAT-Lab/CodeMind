The code is designed to calculate a certain mathematical expression involving combinations and modular arithmetic. The input `3 2 1` initializes N, M, and K to 3, 2, and 1, respectively.

The `mod` variable is set to 998244353, which is a large prime number often used in problems involving modular arithmetic to avoid overflow issues.

The `power` function is a recursive function that calculates x raised to the power y modulo `mod`. It uses the property that x^y = (x^(y/2))^2 if y is even, and x^y = (x^((y-1)/2))^2 * x if y is odd.

The `mul` function multiplies two numbers a and b under modulo `mod`.

The `div` function divides a by b under modulo `mod` by multiplying a with the modular inverse of b.

The `modinv` function calculates the modular inverse of a number a under modulo `mod` using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm.

The `cmb` function calculates the combination of n choose r under modulo `mod` using precomputed factorials and their inverses.

The code precomputes factorials (`g1`) and their inverses (`g2`) up to 10^6.

The main part of the code calculates the sum of a series of terms, each term being a combination of N-1 choose i, multiplied by M, and multiplied by (M-1) raised to the power of N-i-1, all under modulo `mod`. The loop runs from i=0 to K (inclusive), which in this case is 1.

For the input `3 2 1`, the loop will calculate two terms:
- When i=0, cmb(2, 0) * 2 * pow(1, 2, mod) = 1 * 2 * 1 = 2
- When i=1, cmb(2, 1) * 2 * pow(1, 1, mod) = 2 * 2 * 1 = 4

The sum of these terms is 2 + 4 = 6. However, since the calculation is under modulo `mod`, the result is 6 % 998244353 = 6.

Finally, the code prints the result, which is 6.
