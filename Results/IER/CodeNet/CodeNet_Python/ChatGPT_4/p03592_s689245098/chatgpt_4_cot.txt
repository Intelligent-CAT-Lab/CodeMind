<<<Analysis>>>
The variables n, m, and k are initialized to 2, 2, and 2, respectively.
A list t of size n*m+1 is created and initialized with zeros. Since n and m are both 2, the size of the list t is 5 (2*2+1).

The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 2.
For each number i in this range, it calculates two values:
- a, which is i multiplied by m (2 in this case), so a will take on the values 0, 2, and 4 in the loop.
- b, which is n minus twice the value of i, so b will take on the values 2, 0, and -2 in the loop.

Inside the inner loop, which iterates m (2) times, the code sets the value of t at index a to 1 and then increments a by b. This means:
- When i is 0, a is 0 and b is 2. The loop will set t[0] to 1 and then t[2] to 1.
- When i is 1, a is 2 and b is 0. The loop will set t[2] to 1 (again, but it's already 1).
- When i is 2, a is 4 and b is -2. The loop will set t[4] to 1 and then t[2] to 1 (again, but it's already 1).

After the loops, the list t will look like this: [1, 0, 1, 0, 1].

Finally, the code checks if the value of t at index k (which is 2) is 0. Since t[2] is 1, the condition is false, and the code will print 'Yes'.
