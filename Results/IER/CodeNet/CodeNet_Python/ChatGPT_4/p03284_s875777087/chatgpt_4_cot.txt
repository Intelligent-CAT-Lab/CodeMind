<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a and b are initialized to 7 and 3, respectively, from the input.
The code checks if a is divisible by b using the modulo operator (%). If a is divisible by b, it will print '0'. Otherwise, it will print '1'.
Since 7 is not divisible by 3 (7 % 3 is not 0), the condition a%b is 0 is False.
Therefore, the code will print '1'.
