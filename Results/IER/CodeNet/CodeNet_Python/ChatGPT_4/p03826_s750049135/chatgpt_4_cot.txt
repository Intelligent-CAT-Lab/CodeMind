<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function `resolve()` which takes no arguments. Inside this function, it reads four integers from the input and assigns them to variables A, B, C, and D.
The input provided is `3 5 2 7`, so A=3, B=5, C=2, and D=7.
The function then calculates the products A*B and C*D, which are 15 and 14, respectively.
It compares the two products and prints the larger one.
Since 15 (A*B) is greater than 14 (C*D), the function will print 15.
The `if '__main__' == __name__:` line checks if the script is being run as the main program and not being imported as a module. If it is the main program, it calls the `resolve()` function.
Given that the script is being run directly, the `resolve()` function will be executed with the provided input.
<<<Output>>>
15
