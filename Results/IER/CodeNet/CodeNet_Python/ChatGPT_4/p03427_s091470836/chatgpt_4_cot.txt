<<<Analysis>>>
The input '100' is converted into a list of integers [1, 0, 0].
The length of the list, l, is 3.
Since l is not 1, the code proceeds to the elif statements.
The first digit of the list is not 9, so the code checks the next condition.
The code checks if all the remaining digits after the first one are the same and if they are 9. In this case, they are not, as they are 0s.
Therefore, the code executes the else block of the second if statement.
It calculates the output as the first digit minus one plus nine times the length of the list minus one: (1-1) + 9*(3-1) = 0 + 9*2 = 18.
<<<Output>>>
18
