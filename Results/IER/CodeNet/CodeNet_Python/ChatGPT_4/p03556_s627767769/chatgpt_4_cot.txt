<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized to 10.
The code calculates the square root of N using math.sqrt(N), which is math.sqrt(10).
The square root of 10 is approximately 3.1622776601683795.
The code then converts the square root to an integer using int(), which truncates the decimal part, resulting in 3.
The code multiplies this integer by itself, which is 3 * 3.
The result of this multiplication is 9.
The code prints the result, which is 9.
<<<Output>>>
9
