<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a and b are initialized to 3 and 4, respectively.
The code checks if the product of a and b is even by using the modulo operator. It calculates a*b which is 3*4=12.
Since 12%2 equals 0, the condition (a*b%2==0) is true.
Because the condition is true, the code prints 'Even'.
<<<Output>>>
Even
