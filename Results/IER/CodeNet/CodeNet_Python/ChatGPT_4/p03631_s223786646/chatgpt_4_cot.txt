<<<Analysis>>>
The input '575' is read as a string and unpacked into variables a, b, and c, with a being '5', b being '7', and c also being '5'.
The print statement uses a conditional expression to check if a is equal to c.
Since a ('5') is equal to c ('5'), the condition is True.
Therefore, the string "Yes" will be printed.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
