<<<Analysis>>>
The variable `sent` is initialized with the input string "Thank you for your mail and your lectures".
The `split()` function is used to split the sentence into words, resulting in the list `words` containing ["Thank", "you", "for", "your", "mail", "and", "your", "lectures"].
Two pairs of variables are initialized: `max_f` and `freq_w` for tracking the most frequent word and its frequency, and `max_len` and `len_w` for tracking the longest word and its length.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each word in the `words` list.
For each word, it checks if the count of that word in the list is greater than `max_f`. If it is, it updates `freq_w` to the current word and `max_f` to the new maximum frequency. The word "your" appears twice, which is more frequent than any other word.
It also checks if the length of the current word is greater than `max_len`. If it is, it updates `len_w` to the current word and `max_len` to the new maximum length. The word "lectures" is the longest with 8 characters.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the most frequent word and the longest word in the format "freq_w len_w".
The output will be "your lectures", as "your" is the most frequent word (appearing twice) and "lectures" is the longest word (8 characters).
<<<Output>>>
your lectures
