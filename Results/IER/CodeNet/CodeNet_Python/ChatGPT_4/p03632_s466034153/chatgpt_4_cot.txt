<<<Analysis>>>
The variables A, B, C, and D are initialized to 0, 75, 25, and 100, respectively.
The code checks if the minimum of B and D minus the maximum of A and C is greater than or equal to 0.
The minimum of B and D is 75, and the maximum of A and C is 25.
The difference between 75 and 25 is 50, which is greater than 0.
Since the condition is true, the code prints the difference, which is 50.
<<<Output>>>
50
