The input variables n, a, and b are initialized to 4, 1, and 3, respectively.
The variable mod is set to 1000000007, which is a large prime number used for modular arithmetic to avoid integer overflow.

The function mod_cmb calculates the modular combination (n choose k) modulo p. It has several checks:
- If n, k are negative or n < k, it returns 0.
- If n or k is 0, it returns 1.
- If k is greater than n - k, it calls itself with n and n - k to reduce the number of multiplications.
- It then calculates the combination using the formula c = n! / (k! * (n - k)!) modulo p.

The main function calculates the answer as follows:
- It calculates 2^n modulo mod and subtracts 1 to account for the empty set.
- It calculates the modular combination of n choose a and n choose b using the mod_cmb function.
- It subtracts the values of tmp_a and tmp_b from ans and takes the result modulo mod to get the final answer.

Let's calculate the values step by step:
- ans = 2^4 mod 1000000007 - 1 = 16 - 1 = 15
- tmp_a = mod_cmb(4, 1, 1000000007) = 4 (since 4 choose 1 is 4)
- tmp_b = mod_cmb(4, 3, 1000000007) = 4 (since 4 choose 3 is 4, which is the same as 4 choose 1)

The final print statement calculates (ans - tmp_a - tmp_b) % mod:
- (15 - 4 - 4) % 1000000007 = 7 % 1000000007 = 7

Therefore, the output of the code execution will be 7.
