<<<Analysis>>>
The input string "4 11" is split into a list of strings ['4', '11'] and assigned to variable N.
The first element of the list (string '4') is converted to an integer and assigned to variable a.
The second element of the list (string '11') is converted to an integer and assigned to variable b.
The code then checks if the sum of a and b equals 15. In this case, 4 + 11 equals 15, so the condition is true.
Since the first condition is true, the code will print '+' and not evaluate the elif condition.
