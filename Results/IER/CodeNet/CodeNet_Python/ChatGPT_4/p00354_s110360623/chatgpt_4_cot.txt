<<<Analysis>>>
The variable `day` is a list containing the abbreviations of the days of the week.
The variable `x` is initialized to the integer value of the input, which is `1`.
The code prints the element of the `day` list at the index calculated by `abs(x-1) % 7`.
Since `x` is `1`, `x-1` is `0`, and `abs(0)` is `0`.
Then `0 % 7` is `0`, so the index to access in the `day` list is `0`.
The element at index `0` in the `day` list is `"fri"`.
Therefore, the output will be `"fri"`.
