<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a, b, and c are initialized to the strings "rng", "gorilla", and "apple", respectively.
The code checks two conditions:
1. If the last character of string a ('rng') is the same as the first character of string b ('gorilla'), which is not true because 'g' is not equal to 'r'.
2. If the last character of string b ('gorilla') is the same as the first character of string c ('apple'), which is true because both are 'a'.
However, since the first condition is not met, the combined condition (a[-1]==b[0] and b[-1]==c[0]) is False.
Therefore, the code will execute the else block and print "NO".
