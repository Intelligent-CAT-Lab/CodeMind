<<<Analysis>>>
The variables n and m are initialized to 2 and 1, respectively.
The variable even is calculated as n * (n-1) // 2, which is 2 * (2-1) // 2 = 2 * 1 // 2 = 1.
The variable odd is calculated as m * (m-1) // 2, which is 1 * (1-1) // 2 = 1 * 0 // 2 = 0.
The code then prints the sum of even and odd, which is 1 + 0 = 1.
