<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a and p are initialized to 1 and 3, respectively, from the input.
The variable piece is calculated as p + 3*a, which is 3 + 3*1 = 6.
The code then prints the floor division of piece by 2, which is floor(6/2).
The floor division of 6 by 2 is 3, since 6 divided by 2 is exactly 3 with no remainder.
Therefore, the output will be 3.
<<<Output>>>
