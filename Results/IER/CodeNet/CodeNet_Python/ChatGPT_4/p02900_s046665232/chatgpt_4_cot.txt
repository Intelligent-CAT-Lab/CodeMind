The input values for n and m are 12 and 18, respectively.
The gcd function is called with 12 and 18 as arguments to find the greatest common divisor of these two numbers.
The gcd function works by repeatedly setting a to b and b to a % b until b becomes 0. At that point, a is the gcd.
For 12 and 18, the gcd function will work as follows:
- a = 12, b = 18, b becomes 18 % 12 = 6
- a = 18, b = 6, b becomes 6 % 18 = 6 (since 18 is now a multiple of 6)
- a = 6, b = 6, b becomes 6 % 6 = 0
- a = 6, b = 0, the loop ends and 6 is returned as the gcd.

The lcm function is not used in this code.

The factorization function is called with the gcd value, which is 6.
The factorization function finds the prime factors of 6 and their counts.
For 6, the factorization function will work as follows:
- The loop runs from 2 to int(-(-6**0.5//1))+1, which is 2 to 3.
- When i is 2, temp is 6, which is divisible by 2. The count (cnt) is incremented while temp is divisible by 2. temp becomes 3, and cnt is 1. The pair [2, 1] is added to arr.
- When i is 3, temp is 3, which is divisible by 3. The count is incremented while temp is divisible by 3. temp becomes 1, and cnt is 1. The pair [3, 1] is added to arr.
- The loop ends as i goes beyond 3.
- temp is now 1, so no further factors are added.
- arr now contains [[2, 1], [3, 1]], indicating that 6 has two prime factors: 2 and 3.

Since g is not 1, the else block is executed.
The length of the factorization array is 2 (since there are two prime factors), and 1 is added to this length.
The final result printed is 2 + 1, which is 3.
