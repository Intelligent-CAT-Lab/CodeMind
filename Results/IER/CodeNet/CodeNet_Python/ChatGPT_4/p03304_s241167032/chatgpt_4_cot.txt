<<<Analysis>>>
The variables n, m, and d are initialized to 2, 3, and 1, respectively.
The variable ans is calculated using the formula 2*(n-d)*(m-1)/pow(n,2). Substituting the values, we get 2*(2-1)*(3-1)/pow(2,2), which simplifies to 2*1*2/4, resulting in 1.
Since d is not equal to 0, the if condition is not executed.
The final value of ans, which is 1, is printed.
