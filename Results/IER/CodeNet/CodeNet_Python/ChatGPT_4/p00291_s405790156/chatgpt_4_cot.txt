The variables c1, c5, c10, c50, c100, and c500 are initialized with the values 3, 1, 4, 0, 4, and 1, respectively.
The variable sum is calculated as follows:
sum = c1 + 5*c5 + 10*c10 + 50*c50 + 100*c100 + 500*c500
     = 3 + 5*1 + 10*4 + 50*0 + 100*4 + 500*1
     = 3 + 5 + 40 + 0 + 400 + 500
     = 948
Since sum (948) is less than 1000, the condition sum >= 1000 is not satisfied.
Therefore, the code will print 0.
