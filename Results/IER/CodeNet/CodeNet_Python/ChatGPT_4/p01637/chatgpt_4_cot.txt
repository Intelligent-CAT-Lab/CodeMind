<<<Analysis>>>
The input provided `M r` is not valid for the given code. The code expects five integer inputs separated by spaces, but the provided input does not match this format and does not contain enough information to execute the code. The variables m, rd, rr, cd, and cr are supposed to be initialized with integer values from the input, but with the given input `M r`, this is not possible.

Since the input is invalid, the code cannot be executed properly, and therefore, there is no valid output to provide.

<<<Output>>>
