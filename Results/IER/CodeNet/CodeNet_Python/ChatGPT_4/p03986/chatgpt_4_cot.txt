<<<Analysis>>>
The variable X is initialized to the string "TSTTSS".
The variable ans is initialized to 0, but it is not used anywhere in the code.
The variable memo is initialized to 0, which will be used to keep track of the balance between 'T' and 'S' characters.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each character in the string X.
For each character i in the string:
- If the character is "T":
  - If memo is 0, it does nothing (pass).
  - Else, it decreases memo by 1.
- If the character is not "T" (which means it is "S"), it increases memo by 1.
After the loop, the code prints memo multiplied by 2.

Let's analyze the input "TSTTSS":
- T: memo is 0, so pass.
- S: memo becomes 1.
- T: memo decreases to 0.
- T: memo is 0, so pass.
- S: memo becomes 1.
- S: memo becomes 2.

Finally, memo is 2, and the code prints memo*2, which is 4.
