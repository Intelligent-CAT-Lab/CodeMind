The variable N is initialized to 2.
The variable nn is set to N + 10, which is 12.
The variable P is set to 998244353, which is a large prime number often used in modular arithmetic problems.

The code initializes two lists, fa and fainv, each with a length of nn+1 (13 in this case), filled with 1s. These lists will be used to store factorial values and their modular inverses.

The loop calculates the factorial of each number from 1 to nn (inclusive) modulo P and stores the results in the fa list.

The next line calculates the modular inverse of the last factorial (fa[-1]) using the pow function with exponent P-2, which is based on Fermat's little theorem for calculating modular inverses.

The following loop calculates the modular inverses of all other factorials and stores them in the fainv list.

The lambda function C is defined to calculate the binomial coefficient C(a, b) modulo P using the precomputed factorials and their inverses.

The variable ans is initialized to 3^N modulo P, which is 3^2 = 9 modulo 998244353, so ans starts at 9.

The loop iterates from N//2 + 1 to N, which in this case is just the single value 2, since N is 2.

Inside the loop, ans is updated by subtracting 2 times the binomial coefficient C(N, i) times 2^(N-i) modulo P from ans, and then taking the result modulo P again.

For i = 2, the binomial coefficient C(2, 2) is 1, and 2^(2-2) is 1, so the expression becomes 2 * 1 * 1 = 2.

Therefore, ans is updated to (9 - 2 * 2) % 998244353, which is (9 - 4) % 998244353, resulting in 5.

Finally, the code prints the value of ans, which is 5.
