<<<Analysis>>>
The input variables r, c, ar, ac, br, and bc are initialized to 4, 4, 0, 0, 3, and 3, respectively.
The variable maxans is set to 100000007, which will be used to take the modulo of the final answer.

The code calculates the minimum number of rows (dr) that need to be traversed to go from ar to br. Since ar is 0 and br is 3, and the total number of rows r is 4, the minimum is min(3, 4-3) which is min(3, 1), so dr is 1.

The code checks if 2 * dr equals r. Since 2 * 1 is not equal to 4, gainr is set to 1.

Similarly, the code calculates the minimum number of columns (dc) that need to be traversed to go from ac to bc. Since ac is 0 and bc is 3, and the total number of columns c is 4, the minimum is min(3, 4-3) which is min(3, 1), so dc is 1.

The code checks if 2 * dc equals c. Since 2 * 1 is not equal to 4, gainc is set to 1.

The code then calculates the number of ways to traverse from (ar, ac) to (br, bc) using the formula for combinations: factorial(dr + dc) // factorial(dr) // factorial(dc) * gainr * gainc. This is equivalent to factorial(1 + 1) // factorial(1) // factorial(1) * 1 * 1, which simplifies to factorial(2) // factorial(1) // factorial(1) * 1 * 1, which is 2 // 1 // 1 * 1 * 1, which equals 2.

Finally, the code prints ans % maxans, which is 2 % 100000007. Since 2 is less than 100000007, the modulo operation will just return 2.
