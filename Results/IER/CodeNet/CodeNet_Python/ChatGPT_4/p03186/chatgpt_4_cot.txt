<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a, b, and c are initialized to 3, 1, and 4, respectively.
The code checks if c is less than or equal to a + b + 1, which translates to 3 + 1 + 1 = 5.
Since c (which is 4) is less than or equal to 5, the condition is true.
Therefore, the code executes the first branch of the if statement and prints b + c, which is 1 + 4 = 5.
<<<Output>>>
5
