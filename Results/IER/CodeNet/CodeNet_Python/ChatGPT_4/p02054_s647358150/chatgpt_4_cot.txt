<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes the input and splits it into a list of integers. It then filters this list to include only the odd numbers (i % 2 == 1).
The input '1 1 10' is split into [1, 1, 10].
The filter then applies, and since 1 is odd (1 % 2 == 1), it is included in the new list, while 10 is even and is not included.
The resulting list of odd numbers is [1, 1].
The length of this list is checked to see if it is greater than or equal to 2.
Since there are two odd numbers in the list, the condition (len(list) >= 2) is True.
Therefore, the code prints 'Hom'.
<<<Output>>>
Hom
