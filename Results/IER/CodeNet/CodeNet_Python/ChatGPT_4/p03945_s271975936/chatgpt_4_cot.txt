<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function `solve()` which reads a string `S` from the standard input, strips the newline character, and initializes a variable `turn` to 0. It also sets the variable `current` to the first character of the string `S`.
The function then iterates over the string starting from the second character. If the current character is different from the previous one (`current`), it increments the `turn` counter and updates `current` to the new character.
The input string is `BBBWW`. The loop will iterate over the characters starting from the second one. The first three characters are the same (`B`), so `turn` remains 0. When it encounters the fourth character (`W`), it is different from the current character (`B`), so `turn` is incremented to 1 and `current` is updated to `W`. The fifth character is also `W`, so `turn` remains 1.
After the loop, the function prints the value of `turn`, which is 1.
