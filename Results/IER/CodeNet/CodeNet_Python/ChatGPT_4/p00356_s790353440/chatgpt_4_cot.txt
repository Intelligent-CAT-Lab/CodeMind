<<<Analysis>>>
The input values are 4 and 4.
The function `intersection` is called with these values.
The greatest common divisor (gcd) of 4 and 4 is calculated, which is 4.
Since the gcd is not 1, the function calls itself recursively with the values x//g and y//g, which are both 1 (4 divided by 4).
In the recursive call, the gcd of 1 and 1 is 1.
Since the gcd is 1, the function returns x + y, which is 1 + 1 = 2.
The return value of the recursive call is then used in the original call: 2 * 4 - (4 - 1) = 8 - 3 = 5.
The final result, 5, is printed.
