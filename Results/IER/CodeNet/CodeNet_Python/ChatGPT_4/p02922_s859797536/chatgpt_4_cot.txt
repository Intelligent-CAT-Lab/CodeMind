<<<Analysis>>>
The variables A and B are initialized to 4 and 10, respectively.
The code calculates the quotient and remainder of the division of B by (A-1), which is 10 divided by 3. This results in q = 3 and mod = 1.
The code checks if A is equal to 2, which it is not, so it skips the if block.
The code then checks if mod is greater than 1. Since mod is 1, this condition is false.
Since the previous condition is false, the code executes the else block and prints the value of q, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>
3
