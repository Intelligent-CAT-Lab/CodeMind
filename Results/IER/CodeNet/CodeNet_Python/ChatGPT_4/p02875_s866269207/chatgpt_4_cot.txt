The input is `2`, so `n` is set to 2.

The `calc` function is called with `n + 10` and `mod` as arguments, which calculates the factorial of numbers from 1 to `n + 10` modulo `mod` and their modular inverses. The `mod` is a prime number `998244353`.

The `calc` function initializes `f` to 1 and `fac` to [1]. It then enters a loop to calculate the factorial of each number from 1 to `n + 10` (which is 12 in this case) modulo `mod`. It also calculates the modular inverse of the factorial of `n + 10` and stores it in `inv`. Then it calculates the modular inverses of all factorials from `n + 10` down to 1.

The `cnk` function is defined to calculate the combination of `n` choose `k` modulo `mod` using the precomputed factorials and their inverses.

The variable `ans` is initialized to `3^n` modulo `mod`, which is `3^2` modulo `998244353`, resulting in `9`.

The list `p` is initialized to [1], and a loop is used to fill it with powers of 2 modulo `mod` up to `n // 2 + 10`. Since `n` is 2, the loop runs once, appending `2` to `p`.

Another loop runs from `n // 2 + 1` to `n + 1`, which in this case is from 2 to 3. It calculates a value `cur` using the `cnk` function to get the combination of `n` choose `k` and multiplies it by `p[n - k]` (which is a power of 2) and by 2. This `cur` value is then subtracted from `ans` and the result is taken modulo `mod`.

For `k = 2`, `cur` is `2 * cnk(2, 2, mod, f, inv) * p[0]`, which is `2 * 1 * 1`, resulting in `2`. This is subtracted from `ans`, so `ans` becomes `9 - 2 = 7`.

For `k = 3`, the loop does not execute because `k` is greater than `n`.

Finally, the code prints the value of `ans`, which is `7`.
