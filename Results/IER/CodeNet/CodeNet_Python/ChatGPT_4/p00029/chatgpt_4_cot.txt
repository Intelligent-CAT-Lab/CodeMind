<<<Analysis>>>
The input string "Thank you for your mail and your lectures" is split into a list of words: ['Thank', 'you', 'for', 'your', 'mail', 'and', 'your', 'lectures'].
The max function is called twice with different key functions:
1. The first max function call uses a.count as the key function, which will find the element that appears most frequently in the list. In this case, the word "your" appears twice, which is more than any other word, so "your" is the most frequent word.
2. The second max function call uses len as the key function, which will find the longest element in the list by length. The longest word in the list is "lectures", which has 8 characters.
The code then prints the results of these two max function calls, separated by a space.
<<<Output>>>
your lectures
