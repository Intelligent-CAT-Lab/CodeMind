<<<Analysis>>>
The variables h and w are initialized to 3 and 5, respectively.
The code first checks if either h or w is divisible by 3. Since h is 3, which is divisible by 3, the code prints 0 and exits.
The rest of the code is not executed because the condition is met and the program exits after printing 0.
<<<Output>>>
0
