<<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized with the string 'sippuu'.
The code checks if the third character (index 2) is the same as the fourth character (index 3), and if the fifth character (index 4) is the same as the sixth character (index 5).
In the given string 'sippuu', the third and fourth characters are 'p' and 'p', which are the same. The fifth and sixth characters are 'u' and 'u', which are also the same.
Since both conditions are true, the code will print "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
