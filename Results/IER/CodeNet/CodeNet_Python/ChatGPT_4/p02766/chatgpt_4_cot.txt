The variable n and variable k are initialized to 11 and 2, respectively.
The variable i is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of times n can be divided by k raised to the power of i.
The code enters a while loop that continues as long as n divided by k to the power of i is not equal to 0.
The loop increments i by 1 each iteration and checks the condition again with the new value of i.
The loop will run as follows:
- For i = 0: 11 // 2**0 = 11 // 1 = 11 (not equal to 0, continue)
- For i = 1: 11 // 2**1 = 11 // 2 = 5 (not equal to 0, continue)
- For i = 2: 11 // 2**2 = 11 // 4 = 2 (not equal to 0, continue)
- For i = 3: 11 // 2**3 = 11 // 8 = 1 (not equal to 0, continue)
- For i = 4: 11 // 2**4 = 11 // 16 = 0 (equal to 0, exit loop)
The loop exits when i is 4 because 11 divided by 2 to the power of 4 is 0.
The code then prints the final value of i, which is 4.
