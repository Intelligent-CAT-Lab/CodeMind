<<<Analysis>>>
The variable S is initialized with the string 'SENW' and then converted to a list of characters ['S', 'E', 'N', 'W'].
The list is then converted to a set to remove duplicates and converted back to a list, but since there are no duplicates in 'SENW', the list remains the same.
Variables n, w, s, e are initialized to 0. These variables represent the presence of 'N', 'W', 'S', 'E' in the input string, respectively.
The code enters a loop that iterates over the elements of S.
For each character in S, the corresponding variable (n, w, s, e) is set to 1 if the character is 'N', 'W', 'S', or 'E', respectively.
After the loop, the list judge is created with the values of n, w, s, e.
The code checks if the list judge matches any of the following patterns: [1,0,1,0], [0,1,0,1], or [1,1,1,1].
Since the input string 'SENW' contains all four directions, the list judge will be [1,1,1,1].
The condition judge == [1,1,1,1] is True, so the code will print 'Yes'.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
