<<<Analysis>>>
The input string is 'hcpc'.
The code initializes an empty dictionary `dic` to keep track of the count of each character in the input string.
The input string 'hcpc' is converted into a list and iterated over.
For each character in the list:
- If the character is not already a key in the dictionary, it is added with a value of 1.
- If the character is already a key in the dictionary, its value is incremented by 1.
After processing the string, the dictionary `dic` contains {'h': 1, 'c': 2, 'p': 1}.
The variable `ans` is initialized to 0.
The code then iterates over the keys of the dictionary and checks if the value associated with each key is odd (using bitwise AND with 1).
For each key with an odd value, `ans` is incremented by 1.
In this case, 'h' and 'p' have odd counts (1 each), so `ans` becomes 2.
Finally, the code prints the result of `ans` right-shifted by 1 (which is equivalent to integer division by 2).
The right shift of `ans` (which is 2) by 1 results in 1.
