<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a, b, and c are initialized to 4, 12, and 20, respectively.
The variable cnt is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of operations.
The variables fa, fb, and fc are set to the initial values of a, b, and c, respectively, to check for a return to the initial state.

The code enters an infinite loop with the following steps:
1. If cnt is not 0 and the current values of a, b, and c are equal to their initial values, the loop will print -1 and exit the program. This is to check if the process has returned to the initial state, which would mean an infinite loop.
2. The variables tmp1, tmp2, and tmp3 are set to half of a, b, and c, respectively.
3. The function isDouble checks if tmp1, tmp2, and tmp3 are integers. If any of them is not an integer, the loop breaks, and the current value of cnt is printed.
4. If the values are integers, cnt is incremented by 1.
5. The new values of a, b, and c are calculated as the sum of different pairs of tmp1, tmp2, and tmp3.
6. The function rem checks if the new values of a, b, and c are all even. If any of them is odd, the loop breaks, and the current value of cnt is printed.

For the given input `4 12 20`:
- In the first iteration, tmp1 = 2, tmp2 = 6, tmp3 = 10. These are all integers, so cnt becomes 1. The new values of a, b, and c are 16, 12, and 8, respectively. All are even, so the loop continues.
- In the second iteration, tmp1 = 8, tmp2 = 6, tmp3 = 4. These are all integers, so cnt becomes 2. The new values of a, b, and c are 10, 12, and 14, respectively. All are even, so the loop continues.
- In the third iteration, tmp1 = 5, tmp2 = 6, tmp3 = 7. Since tmp1 is not an integer, the loop breaks, and the current value of cnt, which is 2, is printed.
