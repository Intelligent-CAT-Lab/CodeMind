<<<Analysis>>>
The variables x1, y1, x2, and y2 are initialized to 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, and 1.0, respectively, as they are converted to float from the input string.
The code then calls the math.hypot function, which calculates the Euclidean distance between the point (x1, y1) and the point (x2, y2).
The math.hypot function calculates the square root of the sum of the squares of the differences in the x and y coordinates, which is the Pythagorean theorem.
In this case, it calculates the square root of ((1.0 - 0.0) ** 2 + (1.0 - 0.0) ** 2), which is the square root of (1 + 1), or the square root of 2.
The result of math.hypot(1.0, 1.0) is the square root of 2, which is approximately 1.4142135623730951.
The code then prints this result.
<<<Output>>>
1.4142135623730951
