<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 2.
The list ans is initialized to an empty list, which will be used to store tuples of coordinates.

The first loop runs from 0 to n-2 (which is 0 to 0 in this case, so it runs only once with i=0).
Since i is 0 and 0%2 is 0 (not odd), the if condition is not satisfied, and nothing is added to ans.

The second loop also runs from 0 to n-2 (which is 0 to 0 in this case, so it runs only once with i=0).
The first if condition checks if i%6==1, which is not true for i=0.
The second if condition checks if i%6==4, which is not true for i=0.
Therefore, nothing is added to ans in this loop either.

The third loop runs from 0 to n-1 (which is 0 to 1 in this case).
It checks if (n-1+j)%2 is odd, which is true for j=1 because (2-1+1)%2 is 1.
Therefore, the tuple (n-1, j) which is (1, 1) is added to ans.

Finally, the code prints the length of ans, which is 1, and then prints the content of ans, which is the tuple (1, 1).
