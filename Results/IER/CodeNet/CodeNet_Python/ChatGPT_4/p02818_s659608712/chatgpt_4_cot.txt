<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a, b, and c are initialized to 2, 3, and 3, respectively.
The code then checks if a is greater than c. Since a (2) is not greater than c (3), it does not execute the first print statement.
Next, it checks if a + b is less than c. Since a + b (2 + 3) equals 5, which is not less than c (3), it does not execute the second print statement either.
Finally, since neither of the first two conditions is met, the code executes the else block, which prints 0 and a + b - c. The calculation for the second value is 2 + 3 - 3, which equals 2.
<<<Output>>>
