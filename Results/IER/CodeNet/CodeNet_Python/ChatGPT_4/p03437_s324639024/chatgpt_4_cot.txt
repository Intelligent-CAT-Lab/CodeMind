<<<Analysis>>>
The variables X and Y are initialized to 8 and 6, respectively.
The code checks if X is divisible by Y without any remainder using the modulo operator (%).
Since 8 % 6 is 2, which is not equal to 0, the condition X % Y == 0 is False.
Therefore, the else block is executed, and the code prints the value of X.
<<<Output>>>
8
