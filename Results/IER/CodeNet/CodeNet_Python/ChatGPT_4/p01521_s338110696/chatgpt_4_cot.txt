<<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized with the string 'oxxoxoo'.
The code prints the last character of the string if the first character is not 'o', otherwise it prints 'o'.
Since the first character of the string s is 'o', the condition s[0]=='o' is True.
Therefore, the second element of the list ['o'] is selected by the indexing [s[0]=='o'] which is equivalent to [True] or [1].
The output will be 'o'.

o
