The variable K is initialized to 2.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of the greatest common divisor (gcd) of each combination of three numbers from 1 to K (inclusive).

The code then enters a nested loop structure that iterates over all possible combinations of a, b, and c where each variable ranges from 1 to K (inclusive). Since K is 2, the possible values for a, b, and c are 1 and 2.

The innermost loop calculates the gcd of a and b first, and then calculates the gcd of this result with c. The final gcd is added to ans.

The combinations and their gcd calculations are as follows:
- a=1, b=1, c=1: gcd(gcd(1, 1), 1) = gcd(1, 1) = 1
- a=1, b=1, c=2: gcd(gcd(1, 1), 2) = gcd(1, 2) = 1
- a=1, b=2, c=1: gcd(gcd(1, 2), 1) = gcd(1, 1) = 1
- a=1, b=2, c=2: gcd(gcd(1, 2), 2) = gcd(1, 2) = 1
- a=2, b=1, c=1: gcd(gcd(2, 1), 1) = gcd(1, 1) = 1
- a=2, b=1, c=2: gcd(gcd(2, 1), 2) = gcd(1, 2) = 1
- a=2, b=2, c=1: gcd(gcd(2, 2), 1) = gcd(2, 1) = 1
- a=2, b=2, c=2: gcd(gcd(2, 2), 2) = gcd(2, 2) = 2

Adding all these gcd values together, we get ans = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 9.

After the loops finish, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 9.
