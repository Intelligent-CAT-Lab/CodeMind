<<<Analysis>>>
The input string '3 8 1' is split into a list of strings ['3', '8', '1'].
The map function applies the int function to each element of the list, converting them to integers, resulting in the list [3, 8, 1].
The list is then sorted in ascending order, resulting in [1, 3, 8].
Finally, the first three elements of the sorted list are printed, which are 1, 3, and 8.
<<<Output>>>
1 3 8
