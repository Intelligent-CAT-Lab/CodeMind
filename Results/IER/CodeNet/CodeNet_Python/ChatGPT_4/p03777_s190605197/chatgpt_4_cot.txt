<<<Analysis>>>
The input string "H H" is split into a list of strings ['H', 'H'].
The variable 'a' is assigned the first element of the list, which is 'H'.
The variable 'b' is assigned the second element of the list, which is also 'H'.
The variable 'res' is initialized with the value 'H'.
The code then checks if 'a' is not equal to 'b'. Since 'a' is equal to 'b', the condition is false.
Because the condition is false, the 'else' block is executed, and 'res' remains 'H'.
Finally, the value of 'res' is printed, which is 'H'.
<<<Output>>>
H
