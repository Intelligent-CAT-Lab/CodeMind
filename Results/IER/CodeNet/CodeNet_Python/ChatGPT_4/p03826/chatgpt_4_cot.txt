<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a, b, c, and d are initialized to 3, 5, 2, and 7, respectively.
The variable s is calculated as the product of a and b, which is 3 * 5 = 15.
The variable t is calculated as the product of c and d, which is 2 * 7 = 14.
The code then checks if s is greater than t. Since 15 is greater than 14, the condition is true.
Therefore, the code will print the value of s.
<<<Output>>>
15
