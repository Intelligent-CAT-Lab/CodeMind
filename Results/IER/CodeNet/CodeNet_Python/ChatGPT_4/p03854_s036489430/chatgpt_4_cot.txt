<<<Analysis>>>
The input string "erasedream" is assigned to the variable St.
The list t contains four strings: "dream", "dreamer", "erase", "eraser".
The variable i is initialized to the length of St minus one, which is 9 in this case.
The variable cur is initialized to an empty string.
The code enters a while loop that runs as long as i is greater than or equal to 0.
Inside the loop, the current character from St is prepended to cur, and i is decremented by 1.
After each character is prepended, the code checks if cur is in the list t.
If cur matches any of the strings in t, cur is reset to an empty string.
This process continues until i is less than 0.
The loop processes the input string from the end to the beginning, checking for the strings "dream", "dreamer", "erase", "eraser" in reverse order.
For the input "erasedream", the loop will find "dream" first, then reset cur to "", then find "erase", and reset cur to "" again.
Since the entire string can be segmented into strings from the list t, cur will be empty at the end of the loop.
If cur is empty at the end of the loop, ans is set to "YES", otherwise it is set to "NO".
Since cur is empty, ans will be "YES".
The code then prints the value of ans.
<<<Output>>>
YES
