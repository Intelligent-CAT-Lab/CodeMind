<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a and b are initialized to 3 and 2, respectively, by splitting the input string and converting each part to an integer.
The divmod function is used to get the quotient (d) and remainder (r) of the division of a by b. For 3 divided by 2, the quotient is 1 and the remainder is 1.
The variable f is assigned the result of the division of a by b as a floating-point number, which is 1.5 for 3 divided by 2.
The print function formats the output to show the quotient, remainder, and the floating-point result of the division, with the floating-point result formatted to 5 decimal places.
The expected output will be "1 1 1.50000" because the quotient is 1, the remainder is 1, and the floating-point division result is 1.5 formatted to 5 decimal places.
<<<Output>>>
1 1 1.50000
