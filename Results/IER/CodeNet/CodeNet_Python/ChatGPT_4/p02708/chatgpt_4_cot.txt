<<<Analysis>>>
The variables n and k are initialized to 3 and 2, respectively.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of certain calculated values.

The code then enters a loop that iterates from k to n+1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider the values 2 and 3.

For each value of i in this range, the code performs the following calculations:
1. It calculates the maximum possible sum of i consecutive numbers from 1 to n, which is given by the formula ((2*n-i+1)*i)//2. For i=2, this is ((2*3-2+1)*2)//2 = (5*2)//2 = 10. For i=3, this is ((2*3-3+1)*3)//2 = (4*3)//2 = 6.
2. It calculates the minimum possible sum of i consecutive numbers from 1 to n, which is given by the formula (i*(i-1)//2). For i=2, this is (2*(2-1)//2) = 1. For i=3, this is (3*(3-1)//2) = 3.
3. It adds 1 to the difference between the maximum and minimum sums calculated in steps 1 and 2. For i=2, this is 10 - 1 + 1 = 10. For i=3, this is 6 - 3 + 1 = 4.

The code then adds these values to ans. So, ans = 0 + 10 + 4 = 14.

Finally, the code prints the value of ans modulo (10**9+7), which is 14 % (10**9+7).
