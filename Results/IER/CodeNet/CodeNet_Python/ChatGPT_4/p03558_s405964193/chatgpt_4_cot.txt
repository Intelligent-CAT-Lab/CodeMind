The input K is initialized to 6.
The function small_multiple is called with the argument 6.
Inside small_multiple, a graph is created with 6 nodes (0 to 5).
For each node k in the range 0 to 5, two edges are added to the graph:
- An edge from k to (k+1) % 6 with a cost of 1.
- An edge from k to (k*10) % 6 with a cost of 0, if (k*10) % 6 is not equal to k.

The graph will look like this:
0: [(1, 1), (0, 0)]
1: [(2, 1), (4, 0)]
2: [(3, 1), (2, 0)]
3: [(4, 1), (0, 0)]
4: [(5, 1), (4, 0)]
5: [(0, 1), (2, 0)]

The bfs01 function is then called with the source node 1, target node 0, the number of vertices K (6), and the graph.
The bfs01 function initializes a queue and a list l of distances with INF (infinity).
It sets the distance to the source node (1) to 0 and adds it to the queue.
The BFS loop runs until the queue is empty.
For each node u taken from the queue, it checks its neighbors v.
If the distance to u plus the cost c to reach v is less than the current distance to v, it updates the distance to v and adds v to the queue.
If the cost c is 0, v is added to the front of the queue; otherwise, it is added to the back.

The BFS will find the shortest path from node 1 to node 0 in terms of the number of edges with cost 1.
The path found is 1 -> 4 -> 5 -> 0 with a cost of 3 (three edges with cost 1).
The bfs01 function returns 3, and small_multiple adds 1 to this result, returning 4.

The main function prints the result, which is 4.
