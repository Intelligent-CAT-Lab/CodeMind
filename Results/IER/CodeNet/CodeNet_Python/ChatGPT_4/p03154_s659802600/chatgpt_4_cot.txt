The variables H, W, and K are initialized to 2, 1, and 2, respectively.
The variable P is set to 10**9+7, which is a large prime number often used for modulo operations in competitive programming to avoid integer overflow.
The variable N is calculated as H+W, which is 2+1=3.
The variable x is initialized with a complex mathematical expression involving K, H, W, and N.
Breaking down the expression:
- K*(K+3)//2 calculates the sum of the first K natural numbers, which is 2*(2+3)//2 = 5.
- (K**3-K)//3*H*W calculates (K^3-K)/3 multiplied by H and W, which is (2**3-2)//3*2*1 = 0.
- pow(N*N-N,P-2,P) calculates (N^2-N)^(P-2) mod P, which is (3*3-3)^(10**9+7-2) mod (10**9+7) = 6^(10**9+5) mod (10**9+7).
The expression for x becomes 5 + 0*6^(10**9+5) mod (10**9+7), which simplifies to 5.
Then, a loop runs from 0 to K-1 (inclusive), which means it will iterate twice (for i=0 and i=1).
In each iteration, x is multiplied by (N-i) and then taken modulo P.
For i=0: x = x*(N-0) % P = 5*3 % (10**9+7) = 15 % (10**9+7) = 15.
For i=1: x = x*(N-1) % P = 15*2 % (10**9+7) = 30 % (10**9+7) = 30.
Finally, the code prints the value of x, which is 30.
