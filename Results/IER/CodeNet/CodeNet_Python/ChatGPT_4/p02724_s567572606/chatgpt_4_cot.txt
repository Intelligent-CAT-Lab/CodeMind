The variable X is initialized to 1024.
The variable s is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of 500s that can be subtracted from X.
The variable p is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of 5s that can be subtracted from X after all possible 500s are subtracted.

The first while loop subtracts 500 from X until X is less than 500. Each time 500 is subtracted, s is incremented by 1.
- 1024 - 500 = 524 (s = 1)
- 524 - 500 = 24 (s = 2)

After the first loop, X is 24 and s is 2.

The second while loop subtracts 5 from X until X is less than 5. Each time 5 is subtracted, p is incremented by 1.
- 24 - 5 = 19 (p = 1)
- 19 - 5 = 14 (p = 2)
- 14 - 5 = 9 (p = 3)
- 9 - 5 = 4 (p = 4)

After the second loop, X is 4 and p is 4.

The final print statement calculates 1000*s + 5*p, which is 1000*2 + 5*4 = 2000 + 20 = 2020.
