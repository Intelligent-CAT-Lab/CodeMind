<<<Analysis>>>
The input string "5 8" is split into a list of strings ['5', '8'] and stored in variable s.
The code then converts the first element of the list to an integer (int(s[0]) which is 5) and the second element to an integer (int(s[1]) which is 8).
It then subtracts the second integer from the first one (5 - 8) and prints the result.
The output will be the result of this subtraction, which is -3.
<<<Output>>>
-3
