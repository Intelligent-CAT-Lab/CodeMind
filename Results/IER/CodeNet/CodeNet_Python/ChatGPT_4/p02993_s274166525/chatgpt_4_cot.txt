<<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized to the string "3776".
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to the length of s minus 2 (because the range goes up to len(s)-1, which is 3 in this case, and the loop stops one before the end).
The loop checks if the current character s[i] is the same as the next character s[i+1].
On the first iteration, i=0, s[i] is '3', and s[i+1] is '7', which are not equal, so the loop continues.
On the second iteration, i=1, s[i] is '7', and s[i+1] is '7', which are equal, so the code prints "Bad" and exits the loop and the program.
The code will not reach the print("Good") statement because the exit() function will terminate the program.
<<<Output>>>
Bad
