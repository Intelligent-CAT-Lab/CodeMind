<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 1.
The code checks if n is equal to 1, which it is.
Since the condition is true, the code prints 'Hello World' and then calls exit(), which terminates the program.
No further input is read, and no additional output is produced.
<<<Output>>>
Hello World
