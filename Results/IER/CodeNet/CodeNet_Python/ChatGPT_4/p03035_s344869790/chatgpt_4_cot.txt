<<<Analysis>>>
The variables A and B are initialized to 30 and 100, respectively.
The code first checks if A is less than or equal to 5. If it is, it prints 0. This condition is not met since A is 30.
Next, the code checks if A is between 6 and 12 (inclusive). If it is, it prints the floor division of B by 2. This condition is also not met since A is 30.
Since neither of the first two conditions is met, the code proceeds to the else block.
In the else block, the code prints the value of B, which is 100.
<<<Output>>>
100
