<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a, b, and c are initialized with the input values '5', '7', and '5', respectively.
The code then checks if a is equal to b, which is not the case ('5' is not equal to '7').
Next, the code checks if a is equal to c, which is true ('5' is equal to '5').
Since the condition a == c is true, the code executes the corresponding print statement and prints the value of b.
Therefore, the output will be the value of b, which is '7'.
<<<Output>>>
7
