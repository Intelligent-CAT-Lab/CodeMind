<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized to 25.
A 10x10 matrix 'num' is initialized with zeros.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 25.
For each number i in this range, it checks if the last digit (i % 10) is greater than 0. If it is, it increments the count in the matrix 'num' at the position corresponding to the first and last digits of i.
The first digit is obtained by converting i to a string and taking the first character (which is then converted back to an integer), and the last digit is obtained by i % 10.
After populating the matrix 'num', the code initializes a counter 'c' to 0.
It then enters a nested loop to iterate over the matrix 'num' from indices 1 to 9 (both inclusive) for both rows and columns.
For each pair of indices (i, j), it multiplies the value at 'num[i][j]' with the value at 'num[j][i]' and adds the result to the counter 'c'.
This effectively counts all pairs of numbers where the first digit of one is the last digit of the other and vice versa.
After the nested loop finishes, the code prints the final value of 'c'.
For the given input 25, the pairs that contribute to 'c' are (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4), and (1,10), (2,20), and their reverses (10,1), (20,2). The counts for these pairs are 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1 respectively. So the final count 'c' is 2*(1+1+1+1+1+1) = 12.
