<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a, b, and c are initialized to 2, 3, and 9, respectively.
The code then checks two conditions:
1. If c - a - b is greater than 0, which is 9 - 2 - 3 = 4, which is greater than 0.
2. If (c - a - b)^2 - 4 * a * b is greater than 0, which is (4)^2 - 4 * 2 * 3 = 16 - 24 = -8, which is not greater than 0.

Since the second condition is not met (the result is negative), the code will print 'No'.
<<<Output>>>
No
