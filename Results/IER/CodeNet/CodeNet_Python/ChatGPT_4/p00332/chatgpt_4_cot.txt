<<<Analysis>>>
The variables E and Y are initialized to 0 and 2015, respectively.
The code checks the value of E and since E is 0, it enters the first if block.
Within this block, it checks the year Y against different years to determine the era.
Since Y is 2015, it is not less than 1912, not less than 1926, and not less than 1989, so it goes to the last else statement.
The code prints "H" followed by the year Y minus 1988, which is 2015 - 1988 = 27.
