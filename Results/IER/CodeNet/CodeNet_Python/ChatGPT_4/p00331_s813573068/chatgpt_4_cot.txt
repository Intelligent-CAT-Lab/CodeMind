<<<Analysis>>>
The variables h and r are initialized to -3 and 3, respectively.
The code then checks if the sum of h and r equals 0. In this case, -3 + 3 equals 0, so the condition is true.
Since the first condition is met, the code will execute the corresponding print statement and print 0.
The elif and else blocks are ignored because the first condition was true.
<<<Output>>>
0
