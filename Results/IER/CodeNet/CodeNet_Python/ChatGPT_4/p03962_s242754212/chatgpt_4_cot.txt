<<<Analysis>>>
The input string "3 1 4" is split into a list of strings ['3', '1', '4'].
The set function is then used to convert the list into a set, which removes any duplicate elements. However, since all elements in the list are unique, the set will be {'3', '1', '4'}.
The len function is then used to determine the number of elements in the set, which is 3.
The code then prints the length of the set, which is the number of unique elements in the input string.
<<<Output>>>
3
