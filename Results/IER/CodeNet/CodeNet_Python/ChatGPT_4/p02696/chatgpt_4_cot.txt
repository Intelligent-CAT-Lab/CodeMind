<<<Analysis>>>
The variables A, B, and N are initialized to 5, 7, and 4, respectively.
The code calculates the minimum of B-1 and N, which is min(6, 4) = 4, since B-1 is 6 and N is 4.
It then calculates A multiplied by this minimum value, which is 5 * 4 = 20.
This product is then divided by B, which is 20 / 7.
The result of this division is not an integer, so the floor function is used to get the largest integer less than or equal to the result, which is floor(20/7) = 2.
The code prints this value, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
