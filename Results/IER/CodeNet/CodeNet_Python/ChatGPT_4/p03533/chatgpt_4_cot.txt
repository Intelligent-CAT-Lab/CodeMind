<<<Analysis>>>
The code imports the `re` module, which is used for regular expression operations in Python.
The variable `pattern` is initialized with the regular expression `r"^A?KIHA?BA?RA?$"`. This pattern matches strings that start with an optional 'A', followed by 'KIH', followed by an optional 'A', followed by 'B', followed by an optional 'A', and ending with an optional 'R' and an optional 'A'.
The variable `S` is initialized with the input string, which is `KIHBR`.
The `if` statement uses `re.match` to check if the input string `S` matches the pattern defined by `pattern`.
The input string `KIHBR` does match the pattern because it can be interpreted as follows:
- No leading 'A'
- 'KIH' is present
- No 'A' after 'KIH'
- 'B' is present
- No 'A' after 'B'
- 'R' is present at the end
- No trailing 'A'
Since the input string matches the pattern, the code will print "YES".
<<<Output>>>
YES
