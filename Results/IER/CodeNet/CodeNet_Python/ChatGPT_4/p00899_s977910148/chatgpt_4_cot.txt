<<<Analysis>>>
The provided code is incomplete and cannot be executed as is because it is missing the actual input data that should be provided after the initial `3`. The `3` indicates the number of strings that should follow, but those strings are not provided. The code is designed to read from `sys.stdin`, which is typically used for reading input from the console or from a file redirected into the program.

Without the subsequent strings, the code will hang waiting for input. Therefore, it is not possible to provide an output without the complete input data.

The code appears to be designed to process a list of strings, remove any strings that are contained within another string, and then find the maximum overlap between the remaining strings to construct the shortest string that contains all of them.

However, without the actual strings to process, we cannot determine the output of the code.

<<<Output>>>
The output cannot be determined without the complete input data.
