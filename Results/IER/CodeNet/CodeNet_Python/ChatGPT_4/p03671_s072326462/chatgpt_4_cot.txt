<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a line of input and splits it into a list of integers. The input provided is '700 600 780'.
The list 'a' is then sorted in ascending order, resulting in the list [600, 700, 780].
The code prints the sum of the first two elements of the sorted list, which are the two smallest numbers.
Therefore, the output will be the sum of 600 and 700, which is 1300.
<<<Output>>>
1300
