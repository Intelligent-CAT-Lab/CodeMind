<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 5.
The code checks if n is equal to 1, which it is not, so it proceeds to the else block.
The list ans is initialized with the elements [2, 1].
The code then enters a loop that iterates 4 times (since n-1 is 4).
In each iteration, it appends to ans the sum of the last two elements of ans.
Iteration 1: ans = [2, 1, 3] (3 is the sum of 2 and 1)
Iteration 2: ans = [2, 1, 3, 4] (4 is the sum of 1 and 3)
Iteration 3: ans = [2, 1, 3, 4, 7] (7 is the sum of 3 and 4)
Iteration 4: ans = [2, 1, 3, 4, 7, 11] (11 is the sum of 4 and 7)
After the loop finishes, the code prints the last element of ans, which is 11.
<<<Output>>>
11
