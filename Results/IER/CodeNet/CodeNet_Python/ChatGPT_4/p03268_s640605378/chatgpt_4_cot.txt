<<<Analysis>>>
The variables N and K are initialized to 3 and 2, respectively.
Variables ans1 and ans2 are initialized to 0. These will be used to count the occurrences of certain conditions.
Since K is even (2 % 2 == 0), the code enters the first branch of the if statement.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 3.
For each number i in this range, it checks two conditions:
- If i is divisible by K (i % K == 0), it increments ans1. This condition is met when i is 2.
- If i modulo K equals K divided by 2 (i % K == K//2), it increments ans2. This condition is met when i is 1.
After the loop, ans1 is 1 (because only 2 is divisible by 2) and ans2 is 1 (because only 1 gives a remainder of 1 when divided by 2).
The code prints the sum of ans1 cubed and ans2 cubed, which is 1^3 + 1^3 = 1 + 1 = 2.
