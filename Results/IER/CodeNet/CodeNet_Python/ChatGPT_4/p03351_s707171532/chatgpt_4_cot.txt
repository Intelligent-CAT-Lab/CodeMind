<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a, b, c, and x are initialized to 4, 7, 9, and 3, respectively.
The first condition checks if the absolute difference between a and c is less than or equal to x. In this case, abs(4-9) is 5, which is not less than or equal to 3, so the first condition is not met.
The code then checks the second condition, which is a two-part condition:
- The absolute difference between a and b must be less than or equal to x, which is true since abs(4-7) is 3, which is equal to x.
- The absolute difference between b and c must be less than or equal to x, which is also true since abs(7-9) is 2, which is less than x.
Since both parts of the second condition are met, the code will print "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
