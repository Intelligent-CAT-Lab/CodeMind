The variable `num_year` is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of years.
The variable `t_maney` is initialized to 100, which represents the initial amount of money.
The variable `x` is set to the input value, which is 103 in this case.
The code enters a while loop that will continue to execute as long as `t_maney` is less than `x`.
Inside the loop, `num_year` is incremented by 1 each time the loop runs, representing the passing of a year.
The value of `t_maney` is updated to be 1.01 times its previous value, rounded down to the nearest integer using `math.floor`.
The loop runs for the first time: `t_maney` becomes 101 (100 * 1.01, floored).
The loop runs for the second time: `t_maney` becomes 102 (101 * 1.01, floored).
The loop runs for the third time: `t_maney` becomes 103 (102 * 1.01, floored).
At this point, `t_maney` is equal to `x`, so the loop condition is no longer true and the loop exits.
The code prints the final value of `num_year`, which is 3.
