<<<Analysis>>>
The variables N and K are initialized to 3 and 2, respectively.
The code checks if K is even by using the condition K%2==0, which is true since 2 is even.
Since K is even, the code initializes two counters, cnt1 and cnt2, to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 3.
For each number a in this range, it checks if a is divisible by K (a%K==0). If it is, cnt1 is incremented. Since K is 2, this condition is true for a=2, so cnt1 becomes 1.
The code also checks if a is equal to K/2 when taken modulo K (a%K==K/2). Since K/2 is 1, this condition is true for a=1 and a=3, so cnt2 becomes 2.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the sum of the cubes of cnt1 and cnt2, which is 1^3 + 2^3 = 1 + 8 = 9.
