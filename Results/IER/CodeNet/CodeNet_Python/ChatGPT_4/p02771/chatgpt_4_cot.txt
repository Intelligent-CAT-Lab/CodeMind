<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a, b, and c are initialized to 5, 7, and 5, respectively.
The code checks if any two of the variables are equal and the third one is not equal to the other two.
The first condition checks if a equals b and b does not equal c. This is not true because a (5) is not equal to b (7).
The second condition checks if b equals c and a does not equal b. This is not true because b (7) is not equal to c (5).
The third condition checks if a equals c and a does not equal b. This is true because a (5) equals c (5) and a (5) does not equal b (7).
Since the third condition is true, the code will print "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
