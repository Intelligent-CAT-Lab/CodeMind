<<<Analysis>>>
The input string S is `0??`?`.

1. The length of S, N, is 5.
2. A list A is created with an initial value of 0 and then the cumulative sum of 1 or -1 for each character in S, where '1' adds 1 and '0' subtracts 1. The list A will be [0, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1].
3. The maximum value in A, ma, is 0.
4. The last value of A, cur, is -1.
5. A new list C is created starting with the value [ma - cur], which is [1].
6. The loop iterates over A in reverse, updating cur to the maximum of the current value and cur, and appending ma - cur to C. The list C becomes [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1].
7. Two variables d and e are initialized to 0.
8. Two new lists D and E are created as copies of A.
9. The code iterates over S and the reversed C (excluding the last element), incrementing d by 2 if the character is '?' and c is greater than or equal to d + 2, and incrementing e by 2 if the character is '?' and c is greater than or equal to e + 1. The loop also updates D[i] and E[i] by adding d and e, respectively.
10. After the loop, D becomes [0, -1, 1, 3, 5, 7] and E becomes [0, -1, 1, 3, 5, 7].
11. The code prints the minimum of the difference between the maximum and minimum of D and E. Since both D and E are the same, we only need to calculate it once. The difference between the maximum and minimum of D (or E) is 7 - (-1) = 8.
