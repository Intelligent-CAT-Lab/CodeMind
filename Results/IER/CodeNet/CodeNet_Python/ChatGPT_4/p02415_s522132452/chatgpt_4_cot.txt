<<<Analysis>>>
The variable `target` is initialized with the string `fAIR, LATER, OCCASIONALLY CLOUDY.`.
The `swapcase()` method is called on the `target` string, which converts all uppercase letters to lowercase and all lowercase letters to uppercase.
The result of this operation is stored in the variable `Ans`.
The code then prints the value of `Ans`, which is the modified string with the cases of the letters swapped.
<<<Output>>>
Fair, later, occasionally cloudy.
