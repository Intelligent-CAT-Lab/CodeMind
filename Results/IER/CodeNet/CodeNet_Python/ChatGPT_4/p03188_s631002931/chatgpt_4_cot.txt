<<<Analysis>>>
The variable k is initialized to 2.
The variable n is initialized to 500.
Since k (2) is less than or equal to n (500), the first condition is true.
The code prints the value of k, which is 2.
The list l is created by concatenating two lists, each containing numbers from 1 to k (inclusive). So l becomes [1, 2, 1, 2].
The code then enters a loop that iterates k (2) times.
In the first iteration (i=0), it takes the first k elements from l, which are [1, 2], converts them to strings, and prints them joined by a space.
In the second iteration (i=1), it takes the elements from l starting from index 1 to index 1+k, which are [2, 1], converts them to strings, and prints them joined by a space.
After the loop finishes, the code has printed two lines with the numbers 1 and 2 in alternating order.
