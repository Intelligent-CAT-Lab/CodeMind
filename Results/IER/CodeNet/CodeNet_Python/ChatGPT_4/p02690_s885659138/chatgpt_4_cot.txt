<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 33.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to int(pow(33,1/5))+100, which is approximately 2+100 because 33 to the power of 1/5 is slightly more than 2.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the value of a as i and the value of b as the negative of (n - a^5).
It then calculates the fifth root of the absolute value of b and assigns it to c. If b is negative, c is made negative.
The code checks if c to the power of 5 equals b. If it does, it prints a and c and exits the loop.
The condition is met when i is 2, because 2^5 is 32, and n - 32 is 1. The fifth root of 1 is 1, so a is 2 and c is 1.
After finding the correct a and c, the code prints them and exits.
