<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a dictionary `dic` with specific keys and their corresponding values. It then reads an integer input `n`.
The code checks if the input `n` is a key in the dictionary `dic`. If it is, it prints the value associated with that key.
In this case, the input is `2`. The code checks if `2` is a key in the dictionary, which it is, and the associated value is `1`.
Therefore, the code will print the value `1`.
