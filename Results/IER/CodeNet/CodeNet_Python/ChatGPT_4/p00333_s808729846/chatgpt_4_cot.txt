<<<Analysis>>>
The variables w, h, and c are initialized to 10, 20, and 5, respectively.
The code calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of w and h using math.gcd, which is the largest number that divides both w and h without leaving a remainder. In this case, gcd(10, 20) is 10.
The variable size is set to the gcd, which is 10.
The code then calculates the cost by dividing w by size, dividing h by size, and multiplying the result by c. This effectively calculates the number of gcd-sized squares in the rectangle and multiplies it by the cost per square.
w // size is 10 // 10, which is 1.
h // size is 20 // 10, which is 2.
Multiplying these together gives 1 * 2 * c, which is 2 * 5.
The final cost is therefore 10.
The code prints the value of cost.
<<<Output>>>
10
