<<<Analysis>>>
The variables H and W are initialized to 4 and 5, respectively.
The code checks if either H or W is equal to 1. If this is true, it prints 1. However, in this case, neither H nor W is 1, so it proceeds to the else block.
In the else block, the code calculates the value of ans as follows:
- It multiplies H (which is 4) by the integer division of W by 2 (which is 5//2, equal to 2), resulting in 4*2 = 8.
- It then adds the result of the integer division of H+1 by 2 (which is (4+1)//2, equal to 5//2, which is 2) multiplied by the remainder of the division of W by 2 (which is 5%2, equal to 1), resulting in 2*1 = 2.
- The final value of ans is the sum of the two previous results, which is 8 + 2 = 10.
The code then prints the value of ans, which is 10.
