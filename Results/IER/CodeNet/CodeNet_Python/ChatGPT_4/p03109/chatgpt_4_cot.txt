<<<Analysis>>>
The input string `2019/04/30` is split into three parts using the split("/") method, resulting in A being '2019', B being '04', and C being '30'.
The code then checks if the year (A) is less than or equal to 2018. Since A is '2019', this condition is false.
Next, the code checks if the year (A) is exactly 2019 and the month (B) is less than or equal to 4 and the day (C) is less than or equal to 30. Since A is '2019', B is '04', and C is '30', this condition is true.
Because the condition is true, the code prints "Heisei".
<<<Output>>>
Heisei
