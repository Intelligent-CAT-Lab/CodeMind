The variables N, X, and M are initialized to 6, 2, and 1001, respectively.
A list named List is created with the initial element X, which is 2.
The code then enters a loop that will iterate N-1 times, which is 5 times in this case.

In each iteration, X is updated to be X squared modulo M. The updated X is then checked if it is already in List.
If X is found in List, the loop breaks, and the index of the first occurrence of X in List is stored in the variable key. The current loop index plus 1 is stored in num.

The loop iterations are as follows:
1. X = 2^2 % 1001 = 4, List = [2, 4]
2. X = 4^2 % 1001 = 16, List = [2, 4, 16]
3. X = 16^2 % 1001 = 256, List = [2, 4, 16, 256]
4. X = 256^2 % 1001 = 65536 % 1001 = 361, List = [2, 4, 16, 256, 361]
5. X = 361^2 % 1001 = 130321 % 1001 = 961, List = [2, 4, 16, 256, 361, 961]

Since the loop completes without finding a duplicate X in List, the length of List is equal to N, and the else block is not executed.

The final answer is the sum of all elements in List, which is 2 + 4 + 16 + 256 + 361 + 961 = 1600.
