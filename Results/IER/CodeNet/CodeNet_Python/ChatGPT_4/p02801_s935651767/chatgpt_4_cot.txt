<<<Analysis>>>
The input is the character 'a'.
The `ord` function converts the character 'a' to its ASCII value, which is 97.
The result of `ord(input())` is then incremented by 1, resulting in 98.
The `chr` function converts the ASCII value 98 back to its corresponding character, which is 'b'.
The `print` function outputs the resulting character.
<<<Output>>>
b
