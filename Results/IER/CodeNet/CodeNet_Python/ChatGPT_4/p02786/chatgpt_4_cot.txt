<<<Analysis>>>
The variable H is initialized to 2.
The function `atack` is defined to take one argument `tairyoku`.
When `atack` is called with `tairyoku` equal to 2, it checks if `tairyoku` is 1. Since it is not, it proceeds to the else clause.
In the else clause, it calls itself recursively with `tairyoku` divided by 2, which is 1 in this case.
When `atack` is called with `tairyoku` equal to 1, it returns 1.
The return value of the recursive call is then used in the expression `1 + atack(int(tairyoku/2)) * 2`, which becomes `1 + 1 * 2`.
This evaluates to `1 + 2`, which is `3`.
The final result `ans` is set to 3, and this value is printed.
