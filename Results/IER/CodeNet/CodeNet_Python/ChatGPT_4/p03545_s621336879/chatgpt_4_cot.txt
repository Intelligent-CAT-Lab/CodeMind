<<<Analysis>>>
The variable S is initialized to the string "1222".
The code uses itertools.product to generate all possible combinations of "+" and "-" of length 3, which will be inserted between the digits of S.
The combinations generated by product will be: ('+', '+', '+'), ('+', '+', '-'), ('+', '-', '+'), ('+', '-', '-'), ('-', '+', '+'), ('-', '+', '-'), ('-', '-', '+'), ('-', '-', '-').
For each combination, it appends an empty string to the end to make it the same length as S when zipped together.
The code then zips the digits of S with the generated combination of "+" and "-" and concatenates them to form an expression.
The expression is evaluated using eval(). If the result of the evaluation is 7, the code prints the expression followed by "=7" and breaks out of the loop.
The first combination that results in 7 when evaluated is '1+2+2-2', which equals 7.
The loop breaks after finding this combination and prints the expression.
<<<Output>>>
1+2+2-2=7
