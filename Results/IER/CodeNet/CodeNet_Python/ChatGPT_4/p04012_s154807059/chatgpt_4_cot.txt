<<<Analysis>>>
The function `slove()` is defined and is the main function that will be executed.
The `input` function is overridden to read from `sys.stdin.readline` for faster input.
The input string 'abaccaba' is read, stripped of the newline character, and converted to a list of characters.
A `collections.Counter` object is created from the list of characters, which counts the occurrences of each character in the string.
The Counter object `w` will have the following counts: {'a': 4, 'b': 2, 'c': 2}.
The code then iterates over the items in the Counter object, checking if the count of each character is even.
If any character has an odd count, the code prints "No" and exits immediately.
Since all characters ('a', 'b', and 'c') have even counts, the loop completes without printing "No".
After the loop, the code prints "Yes" because no character had an odd count.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
