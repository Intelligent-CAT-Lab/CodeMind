<<<Analysis>>>
The variables A and B are initialized to 6 and 3, respectively, from the input.
The code checks if the sum of A and B is greater than or equal to 10.
Since 6 + 3 equals 9, which is not greater than or equal to 10, the condition is false.
Therefore, the code executes the else block and prints the sum of A and B, which is 9.
<<<Output>>>
9
