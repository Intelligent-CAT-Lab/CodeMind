<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string input, splits it by spaces, and assigns the result to the variable 'a'.
The input '5 8' is split into a list ['5', '8'].
The code then prints the result of the subtraction of the second element of the list from the first element, after converting both to integers.
The subtraction is 5 - 8, which equals -3.
<<<Output>>>
-3
