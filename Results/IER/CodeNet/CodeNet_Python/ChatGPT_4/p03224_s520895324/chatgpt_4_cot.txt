<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized to 3.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 1999.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the value of i*(i-1)//2 and checks if it equals N.
The expression i*(i-1)//2 is the formula for the sum of the first (i-1) natural numbers, which is also the number of edges in a complete graph with i nodes.
The loop finds that when i is 3, the expression i*(i-1)//2 equals 3 (since 3*(3-1)//2 = 3*(2)//2 = 6//2 = 3), which matches the input N.
Once the condition is met, the code initializes a variable c to 1 and creates a list of lists X with i empty lists (in this case, 3 empty lists).
The code then enters a nested loop to fill the lists in X with numbers from 1 to N (inclusive), simulating the edges of a complete graph.
The output will be "Yes" to indicate that it's possible to create such a graph, followed by the number of lists (which is the number of nodes in the graph), and then each list with its length and elements.
The lists represent the edges connected to each node in the graph.
For i = 3, the lists will be filled as follows:
- X[0] will contain [1, 2], representing edges from node 1 to nodes 2 and 3.
- X[1] will contain [1, 3], representing edges from node 2 to nodes 1 and 3.
- X[2] will contain [2, 3], representing edges from node 3 to nodes 1 and 2.
After printing the output, the loop breaks.
If no such i is found, the code would print "No", but in this case, it finds a match.
