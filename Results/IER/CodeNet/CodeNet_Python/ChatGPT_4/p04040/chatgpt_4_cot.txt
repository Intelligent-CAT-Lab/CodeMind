The input variables h, w, a, b are initialized to 2, 3, 1, 1, respectively.
A COMB_MOD object is created with a default max_n of 200,000 and mod of 10^9 + 7.
The COMB_MOD class precalculates factorials, inverse factorials, and inverses for numbers up to max_n, which is used to compute combinations modulo mod.

The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will accumulate the answer.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to h-a-1 (inclusive), which in this case is just 0 since h-a is 1.
In the loop, for i=0, the following calculation is performed:
- The first combination is C.comb(b-1+i, i), which is C.comb(1-1+0, 0) = C.comb(0, 0) = 1.
- The second combination is C.comb(h-1-i+w-1-b, h-1-i), which is C.comb(2-1-0+3-1-1, 2-1-0) = C.comb(2, 1) = 2.
- These two combinations are multiplied together and then taken modulo mod, which is (1 * 2) % mod = 2.
- The result is added to ans, which becomes (0 + 2) % mod = 2.

After the loop, the final value of ans is printed, which is 2.
