<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to the string '12'.
The variable _sum is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of digits of n.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the length of n, which is 2 in this case.
For each index i in this range (0 and 1), it adds the integer value of the digit at that index to _sum.
The sum of the digits of '12' is 1 + 2, which equals 3.
After the loop, the code checks if the integer value of n (which is 12) is divisible by _sum (which is 3).
Since 12 is divisible by 3, the condition int(n) % _sum == 0 is True.
Therefore, the code prints 'Yes'.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
