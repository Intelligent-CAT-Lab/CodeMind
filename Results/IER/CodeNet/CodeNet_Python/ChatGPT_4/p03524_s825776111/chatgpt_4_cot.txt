The variable S is initialized to the string "abac".
The variable a is initialized to the count of "a" in S, which is 2.
The variable b is initialized to the count of "b" in S, which is 1.
The variable c is initialized to the count of "c" in S, which is 1.
The code then checks if the difference between the maximum and minimum counts of 'a', 'b', and 'c' is at least 2.
In this case, max(a, b, c) is 2 and min(a, b, c) is 1, so their difference is 1, which is not greater than or equal to 2.
Therefore, the condition is not met, and the code prints "YES".
<<<Output>>>
YES
