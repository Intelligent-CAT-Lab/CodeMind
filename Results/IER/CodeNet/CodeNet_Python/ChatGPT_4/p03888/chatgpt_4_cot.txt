<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function `getinputdata()` which reads input from the user and stores it in a list of lists, where each inner list contains the space-separated elements of one line of input. The function continues to read input until an empty line is encountered, at which point it returns the collected data.

After defining the function, the code calls `getinputdata()` and stores the result in `arr_data`. It then extracts the first two elements of the first list within `arr_data` and converts them to integers, assigning them to `r1` and `r2`.

The code then prints the result of the expression `1/((r2+r1) /(r1*r2))`. Given the input `2 3`, `r1` is 2 and `r2` is 3. The expression simplifies as follows:

1/((3+2) /(2*3))
1/((5) /(6))
1/(5/6)
1*(6/5)
6/5

The output will be the result of 6/5, which is 1.2.
