<<<Analysis>>>
The variables A, B, and C are initialized to 50, 100, and 120, respectively, from the input.
The code then checks if the sum of A and B is greater than or equal to C.
In this case, A + B equals 150, which is indeed greater than or equal to C (120).
Since the condition A + B >= C is true, the code will print 'Yes'.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
