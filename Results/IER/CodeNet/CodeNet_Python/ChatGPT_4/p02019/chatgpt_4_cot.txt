<<<Analysis>>>
The variables n, a, b, and c are initialized to 6, 3, 2, and 1, respectively.
The code then prints the result of the expression n-(c+a-c+b-c).
Breaking down the expression inside the print statement:
- c+a-c+b-c simplifies to a+b-c because c and -c cancel each other out twice.
- a+b-c is 3+2-1 which equals 4.
- n-(c+a-c+b-c) is therefore 6-4.
The final result of the expression is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
