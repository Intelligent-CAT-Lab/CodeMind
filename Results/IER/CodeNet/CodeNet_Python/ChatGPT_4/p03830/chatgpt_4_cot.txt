<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines several functions for input handling and a function `factorization(n)` that performs prime factorization of a given number `n`. The `main()` function reads an integer `n` from the input, which is `3` in this case.

The `main()` function initializes a `defaultdict` of integers called `d` to keep track of the count of each prime factor across all numbers from 1 to `n`.

It then iterates over each number `i` from 1 to `n` (inclusive) and performs factorization on each number. The factorization of each number `i` returns a list of tuples where each tuple contains a prime factor and its count in the factorization of `i`.

For each prime factor and its count `(k, v)` returned from the factorization of `i`, the code increments the count of that prime factor in the dictionary `d`.

After processing all numbers from 1 to `n`, the code calculates the result `r` by multiplying the counts of each prime factor plus one, modulo `mod` (which is `10**9 + 7`).

For the input `3`, the factorization will be as follows:
- For `i = 1`, there are no prime factors.
- For `i = 2`, the prime factor is `2` with a count of `1`.
- For `i = 3`, the prime factor is `3` with a count of `1`.

The dictionary `d` will have the counts `{2: 1, 3: 1}`.

The result `r` is calculated by multiplying `(1+1)` for the count of `2` and `(1+1)` for the count of `3`, which is `2 * 2 = 4`. Since `4` is less than `mod`, the modulo operation has no effect.

The final result `r` is `4`, which is then returned and printed by the `main()` function.
