<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a and b are initialized to 3 and 7, respectively.
The code then enters a loop that starts at b - a + 1 (which is 7 - 3 + 1 = 5) and ends just before b + a (which is 7 + 3 = 10).
The loop will iterate over the numbers 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.
For each iteration, the current number i is printed followed by a space.
The end=" " in the print function ensures that the numbers are printed on the same line with a space between them.
After the loop finishes, the code will have printed the numbers 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 in sequence, separated by spaces.
<<<Output>>>
