<<<Analysis>>>
The function main() is defined and then called.
The variables n and m are initialized to 2 and 3, respectively, from the input.
The expression inside the print statement calculates the harmonic mean of n and m.
The harmonic mean is calculated as follows:
1 / (1/n + 1/m) = 1 / (1/2 + 1/3) = 1 / (3/6 + 2/6) = 1 / (5/6) = 6/5
The result of the calculation is 6/5, which is 1.2 in decimal form.
The code then prints the result, which is 1.2.
<<<Output>>>
1.2
