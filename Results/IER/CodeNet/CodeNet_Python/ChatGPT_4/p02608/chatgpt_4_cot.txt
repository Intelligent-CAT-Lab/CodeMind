<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 20.
An empty list cnt is created to store the values of the expression a = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + xy + yz + zx for each combination of x, y, and z in the range from 1 to 100 (inclusive).
The code then enters a triple nested loop, iterating over all possible combinations of x, y, and z in the specified range.
For each combination, it calculates the value of a and checks if it is less than or equal to n (20 in this case). If it is, the value of a is appended to the list cnt.
After all iterations, the Counter object from the collections module is used to count the occurrences of each value in the cnt list.
Finally, the code prints the count of each number from 1 to n (inclusive) that appears in the cnt list. If a number does not appear in the list, its count is 0.
The output will be the counts of numbers from 1 to 20 based on the calculated values of a.
