<<<Analysis>>>
The variables N and M are initialized to 2 and 1, respectively.
The variable count is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the total count.
The code checks if N is not equal to 0, which is true since N is 2. It then calculates N * (N - 1) // 2, which is 2 * (2 - 1) // 2 = 2 * 1 // 2 = 1, and adds this to count.
The code checks if M is not equal to 0, which is true since M is 1. It then calculates M * (M - 1) // 2, which is 1 * (1 - 1) // 2 = 1 * 0 // 2 = 0, and adds this to count.
The final value of count is 1 + 0 = 1.
The code prints the final value of count.
