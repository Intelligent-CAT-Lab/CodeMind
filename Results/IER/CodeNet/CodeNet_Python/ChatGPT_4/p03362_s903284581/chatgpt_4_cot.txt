<<<Analysis>>>
The input is `5`, which means we need to find the first 5 prime numbers that leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 5.

The function `main` starts by initializing `n` to 5 and creating a list `p` with the first prime number, 2.

The code then enters a loop to find prime numbers up to 55555. For each number `i` in the range from 2 to 55555, it checks if `i` is divisible by any of the previously found prime numbers in `p`. If `i` is divisible by any of these, it breaks out of the inner loop and moves to the next number. If `i` is not divisible by any of the primes in `p`, it is a prime number and is appended to `p`.

After finding all the prime numbers up to 55555, the code initializes an empty list `l` and enters another loop to filter out the prime numbers that leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 5. These numbers are appended to `l`.

The code then slices the first `n` (5 in this case) numbers from `l` and converts them to strings. These strings are joined with a space and printed.

The first few prime numbers that leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 5 are 11, 31, 41, 61, 71, so these should be the first 5 numbers in the list `l`.

The output will be these 5 numbers joined by a space.
