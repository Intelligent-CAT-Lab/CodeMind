<<<Analysis>>>
The variables N and K are initialized to 2 and 2, respectively.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, but it is not used in the code.
The code checks if N is equal to 1. Since N is 2, the condition is false.
The else block is executed, which prints the result of K multiplied by (K-1) raised to the power of (N-1).
Since K is 2, (K-1) is 1, and (N-1) is 1, the expression simplifies to 2 * (1)**1, which is 2.
The final output is therefore 2.
