<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function `egcd` which implements the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. This algorithm is used to find the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two numbers a and b, as well as the coefficients x and y (integers) such that ax + by = gcd(a, b).

The input provided is `4 12`. The function `egcd` is called with these values.

Inside the function, the initial values of x, y, u, and v are set to 0, 1, 1, and 0, respectively. These values are used to keep track of the coefficients.

The while loop continues as long as a is not zero. The loop calculates the quotient q and remainder r of the division of b by a. It also updates the values of m and n, which are the new coefficients for the next iteration. The values of b, a, x, y, u, and v are updated accordingly.

For the input `4 12`, the loop runs as follows:
- In the first iteration, a is 4 and b is 12. The quotient q is 3 and the remainder r is 0. The values of m and n are calculated as 0 - 1*3 = -3 and 1 - 0*3 = 1. The values are updated, and now a is 0, which ends the loop.

The gcd is found to be the last non-zero value of b, which is 4 in this case.

The function returns gcd, x, and y, which are 4, -3, and 1, respectively.

After the function call, the code checks if y * a + x * b equals gcd. If this is true, it swaps the values of x and y. However, in this case, the condition is not true because 1 * 4 + (-3) * 12 does not equal 4. Therefore, the values of x and y are not swapped.

Finally, the code prints the values of x and y, which are -3 and 1.
