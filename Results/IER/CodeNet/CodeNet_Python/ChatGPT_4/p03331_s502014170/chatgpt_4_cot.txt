<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized to 15.
The function Num_Each_Digit is defined to calculate the individual digits of a number N up to a certain limit.
The function checks if N is less than 10 raised to the power of the limit (which is 10 in this case). Since 15 is less than 10^10, the function proceeds.
The function initializes an empty numpy array called ans.
The function enters a loop that iterates from 1 to the limit (inclusive), which is 10 in this case.
For each iteration, the function checks if 10 raised to the power of (i-1) is greater than N. If it is, the loop breaks. This condition is not met for i=1 and i=2 since 10^0 and 10^1 are not greater than 15.
For i=1, the function appends the result of N%(10^i) to ans, which is 15%10 = 5.
For i=2, the function appends the result of (N%(10^i)-N%(10^(i-1)))/(10^(i-1)) to ans, which is (15%100-15%10)/10 = (15-5)/10 = 1.
The function returns the ans array, which now contains [5, 1].
The variable digit is assigned the value returned by Num_Each_Digit, which is the array [5, 1].
The code checks if N is equal to 10 raised to the power of (len(digit)-1). Since 15 is not equal to 10^(2-1), which is 10, this condition is not met, and the code does not print 10.
Instead, the code prints the sum of the digits in the digit array, which is 5 + 1 = 6.
