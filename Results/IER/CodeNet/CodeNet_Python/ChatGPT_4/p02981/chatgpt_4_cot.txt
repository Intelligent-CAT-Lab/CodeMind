<<<Analysis>>>
The variables n, a, and b are initialized to 4, 2, and 9, respectively.
The code then calculates the product of n and a, which is 4 * 2 = 8.
It compares this product with b to determine the value of ans.
Since 8 (the product of n and a) is not greater than b (which is 9), the condition n * a > b is False.
Therefore, the value of ans is set to n * a, which is 8.
Finally, the code prints the value of ans.
<<<Output>>>
8
