<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a and b are initialized to 4 and 3, respectively.
The code checks if a is less than or equal to b, which is not the case here (4 is not less than or equal to 3).
Since the condition is false, the code executes the else block.
In the else block, it prints the string representation of b (which is '3') repeated a times (which is 4 times).
Therefore, the output will be '3333'.
