<<<Analysis>>>
The variables A, B, C, and K are initialized to 2, 1, 1, and 3, respectively.
The variable sum is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the result based on the conditions.

First, the code checks if K is greater than or equal to A:
- Since K (3) is greater than A (2), sum is set to A (2), and K is decreased by A, resulting in K becoming 1.

Next, the code checks if K is greater than or equal to B and K is at least 1:
- Since K (1) is equal to B (1), K is decreased by B, resulting in K becoming 0.

Finally, the code checks if K is greater than or equal to C and K is at least 1:
- Since K (0) is not greater than or equal to C (1), the else block is executed, and sum is decreased by K, which is 0. Therefore, sum remains 2.

The code then prints the final value of sum, which is 2.
