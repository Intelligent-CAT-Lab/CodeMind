<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a, b, and c are initialized to 1, 3, and 2, respectively.
The code checks if c is greater than or equal to a and less than or equal to b.
Since c (which is 2) is indeed greater than or equal to a (which is 1) and less than or equal to b (which is 3), the condition is true.
Therefore, the code will execute the print statement under the if condition and print 'Yes'.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
