<<<Analysis>>>
The variables I, O, T, J, L, S, Z are initialized to 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, respectively.
The code checks if I, J, and L are all non-zero. Since J is 0, the condition is not met, so variable a is set to 0.
Variable b is calculated as follows: (I//2 + J//2 + L//2)*2 + O, which is (2//2 + 0//2 + 0//2)*2 + 1 = (1 + 0 + 0)*2 + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3.
The code then determines the maximum value between a and b, which is max(0, 3) = 3.
Finally, the code prints the value of ans, which is 3.
