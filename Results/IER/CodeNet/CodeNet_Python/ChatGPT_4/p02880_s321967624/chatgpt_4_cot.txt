<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 10.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 9 (inclusive).
For each number i in this range, it checks two conditions:
1. If n is divisible by i (n % i == 0).
2. If n divided by i is less than 10 (n / i < 10).

The loop starts with i=1:
- 10 % 1 == 0 (True) and 10 / 1 < 10 (False), so it does not print "Yes" and does not exit.

Next, i=2:
- 10 % 2 == 0 (True) and 10 / 2 < 10 (True), so it prints "Yes" and exits the loop.

Since the code exits after printing "Yes", it does not reach the final print statement "No".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
