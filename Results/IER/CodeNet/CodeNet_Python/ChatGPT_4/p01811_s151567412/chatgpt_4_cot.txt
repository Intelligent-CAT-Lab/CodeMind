<<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized to the string "ABC".
The variable p is initialized to the string "ABC".
The set used is initialized but not used in the code provided.

The while loop will check if s is not equal to p. Since s is "ABC" and p is also "ABC", the condition is false, and the loop will not execute.

Since the while loop does not execute, the program will skip to the last line and print "Yes".

<<<Output>>>
Yes
