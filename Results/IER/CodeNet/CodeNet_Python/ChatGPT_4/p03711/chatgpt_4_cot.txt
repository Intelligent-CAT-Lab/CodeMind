<<<Analysis>>>
The input values for x and y are 1 and 3, respectively.
The lists a and b represent months with 31 days and months with 30 days, respectively (excluding February which has 28 or 29 days).
The code checks if either x or y is 2 (February), which would immediately result in printing 'No' because February has a unique number of days. However, neither x nor y is 2.
Next, the code checks if both x and y are in list a (months with 31 days) or both are in list b (months with 30 days). If this is true, it prints 'Yes'.
Since both 1 and 3 are in list a, the condition is true.
Therefore, the code will print 'Yes'.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
