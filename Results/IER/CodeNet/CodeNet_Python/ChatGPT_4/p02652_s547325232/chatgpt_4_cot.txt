<<<Analysis>>>
The input string S is initialized to "0??".
The variables max0 and max1 are initialized to 0, which will be used to track the maximum number of consecutive '0's and '1's, respectively.
The lists amax0 and amax1 are initialized to empty, which will be used to store the indices of the characters in S that could potentially extend the maximum sequence of '0's and '1's, respectively.
The variables mi0 and mi1 are initialized to 0, which will be used to track the minimum height of '0's and '1's seen so far.
The variables h0 and h1 are initialized to 0, which will be used to track the current height of '0's and '1's.

The code then enters a loop that iterates over each character in S along with its index.
For the first character '0', h0 is incremented by 1, and since h0 - mi0 is now greater than max0, max0 is updated to 1 and amax0 is updated to [0].
For the second character '?', both h1 and h0 are decremented by 1. No updates are made to max0 or max1, or to amax0 or amax1.
For the third character '?', the same thing happens as with the second character.

After the loop, max0 is 1 and max1 is 0. Since max0 > max1, the code checks if all indices in amax0 have the same parity. Since amax0 contains only one index, 0, the set of indices modulo 2 has only one element, which means all indices have the same parity.
Therefore, the code prints max0, which is 1.
