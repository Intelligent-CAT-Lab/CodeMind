<<<Analysis>>>
The input is split into two variables, N and M, which are both set to 2.
The variable thres is set to 10^9 + 7, which is a common modulus used in programming contests to prevent integer overflow.

The code then checks the absolute difference between N and M.
Since N equals M, the code enters the elif block.

In this block, retVal is initialized to 2.
A loop is then started, which iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers 1 and 2.

For each iteration, retVal is multiplied by the square of the current loop index i.
In the first iteration, i is 1, so retVal becomes 2 * (1^2) = 2.
In the second iteration, i is 2, so retVal becomes 2 * (2^2) = 8.

After the loop, retVal is not greater than or equal to thres, so no modulus operation is performed.

The code then prints the final value of retVal, which is 8.
<<<Output>>>
8
