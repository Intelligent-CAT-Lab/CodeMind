<<<Analysis>>>
The variable S is initialized with the string 'CODEFESTIVAL'.
The print statement is slicing the string S into two parts:
- S[0:4] will extract the substring from index 0 to index 3, which is 'CODE'.
- S[4:12] will extract the substring from index 4 to index 11, which is 'FESTIVAL'.
The two substrings are then printed with a space in between.
<<<Output>>>
CODE FESTIVAL
