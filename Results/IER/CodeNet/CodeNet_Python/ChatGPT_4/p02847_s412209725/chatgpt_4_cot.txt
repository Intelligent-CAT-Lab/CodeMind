<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string input and finds the index of that string in a predefined list of strings representing the days of the week. The list is in the order: 'SUN', 'MON', 'TUE', 'WED', 'THU', 'FRI', 'SAT'.
The input given is 'SAT', which is the last element of the list, so its index is 6 (since indexing starts from 0).
The code then calculates 7 minus the index of the input day. In this case, it is 7 - 6.
The result of this calculation is 1, which is the output of the code.
