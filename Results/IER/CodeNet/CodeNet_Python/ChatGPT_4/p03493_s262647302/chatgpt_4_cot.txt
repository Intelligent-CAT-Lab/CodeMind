<<<Analysis>>>
The variable stdin is initialized with the string "101".
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the occurrences of the character "1".
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each character in the string "101".
For each character, it checks if the character is "1".
If the character is "1", it increments the variable ans by 1.
The character "1" appears twice in the string "101", so ans will be incremented twice.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
