<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a main function and a make_table function. The make_table function creates two dictionaries, tableA and tableB, which are used for encoding and decoding a message, respectively.

The main function first calls make_table to get the two dictionaries. Then it enters an infinite loop where it tries to read input using raw_input(). Since the code is provided in Python 2 syntax, raw_input() is used instead of input() which is the Python 3 equivalent.

The input string is then converted to a binary string using tableA. Each character in the input is replaced by its corresponding binary code as defined in tableA.

The binary string is then decoded using tableB. The code iterates over the binary string, accumulating characters in a temporary string (tmp). When tmp matches a key in tableB, the corresponding character is added to the answer string (ans), and tmp is reset to an empty string.

The loop continues until all characters in the binary string have been processed. The final decoded message is then printed.

Given the input `?D-C'KOPUA`?, the code will perform the following steps:

1. Convert each character to its binary representation using tableA.
2. Concatenate the binary codes to form a binary string.
3. Decode the binary string using tableB by matching substrings of the binary string to keys in tableB.
4. Print the decoded message.

Let's convert the input `?D-C'KOPUA`? to binary using tableA:
? -> 11111
D -> 00011
- -> 10010001
C -> 00010
' -> 11110
K -> 01010
O -> 01110
P -> 01111
U -> 10100
A -> 00000
? -> 11111

Concatenated binary string:
11111000111001000100001011110101001110101111010100000011111

Now, let's decode this binary string using tableB:
11111 -> ?
00001 -> D
10010001 -> -
00010 -> C
11110 -> '
01010 -> K
01110 -> O
01111 -> P
10100 -> U
00000 -> A
11111 -> ?

The decoded message is "?D-C'KOPUA?".

<<<Output>>>
?D-C'KOPUA?
