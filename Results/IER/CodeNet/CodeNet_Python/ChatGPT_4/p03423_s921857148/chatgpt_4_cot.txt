<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input, which is 8 in this case, and stores it in variable 'a'.
It then performs integer division of 'a' by 3 using the '//' operator.
Integer division means it will divide 8 by 3 and only keep the integer part of the result, discarding any remainder.
8 divided by 3 is 2 with a remainder of 2, but since we are only interested in the integer part, the result is 2.
The code then prints this result.
<<<Output>>>
2
