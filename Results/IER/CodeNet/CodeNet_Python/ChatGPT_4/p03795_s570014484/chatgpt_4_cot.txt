<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 20.
The variable x is calculated as n multiplied by 800, which is 20 * 800 = 16000.
The variable y is calculated as the integer division of n by 15, which is 20 // 15 = 1.
Then y is multiplied by 200, which gives y = 1 * 200 = 200.
The final print statement outputs the result of x - y, which is 16000 - 200 = 15800.
<<<Output>>>
15800
