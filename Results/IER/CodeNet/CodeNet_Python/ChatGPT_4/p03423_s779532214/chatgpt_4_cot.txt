<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function main() that reads an integer input N.
The input N is then divided by 3 using integer division (//), which means the result will be the quotient without the remainder.
The main() function is then called if the script is run as the main program.
Given the input `8`, the integer division of 8 by 3 is 2, since 8 divided by 3 is 2 with a remainder of 2, but the remainder is discarded in integer division.
Therefore, the output will be 2.
