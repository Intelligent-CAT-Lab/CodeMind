<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized to 2.
The function num2alpha is defined to convert a number to its corresponding Excel column name.
Since N is less than or equal to 26, the function returns the character corresponding to the number 2 in the alphabet, which is 'B'.
The result is then converted to lowercase using the lower() method.
The final output is the lowercase letter 'b'.
<<<Output>>>
b
