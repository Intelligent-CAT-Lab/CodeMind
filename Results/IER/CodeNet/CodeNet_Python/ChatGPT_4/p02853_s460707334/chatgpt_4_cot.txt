<<<Analysis>>>
The variables x and y are initialized to 1 and 1, respectively.
The variable result is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the prize money.
The code checks the value of x:
- Since x is 1, it enters the first if condition and adds 300000 to result.
The code then checks the value of y:
- Since y is 1, it enters the first if condition and adds another 300000 to result.
The code has a special condition if both x and y are 1:
- Since both are 1, it enters this condition and adds an additional 400000 to result.
The final value of result is the sum of 300000 (for x), 300000 (for y), and 400000 (for both being 1), which is 1000000.
The code prints the final value of result.

<<<Output>>>
1000000
