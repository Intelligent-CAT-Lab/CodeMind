<<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized to the string 'QWERTYASDFZXCV'.
The variables a_index and z_index are initialized to 0.
The first for loop iterates over the indices of the string s to find the first occurrence of the character 'A'. When it finds 'A', it sets a_index to the index of 'A' and breaks out of the loop. In this case, 'A' is found at index 6.
The second for loop iterates over the indices of the string s in reverse to find the first occurrence of the character 'Z'. When it finds 'Z', it sets z_index to the index of 'Z' and breaks out of the loop. In this case, 'Z' is found at index 11.
The code then prints the difference between z_index and a_index plus 1, which is (11 - 6 + 1) = 6.
<<<Output>>>
6
