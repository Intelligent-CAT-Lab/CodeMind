The variables a and b are initialized to 4 and 10, respectively.
The variable av is set to the value of a, which is 4.
The variable n is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of iterations.
The variable num is initialized to 1, which will be used to accumulate the value of av-1 in each iteration.
The while loop will continue to execute as long as num is less than b (10).
In each iteration of the loop, n is incremented by 1, and num is incremented by av-1 (which is 3).
The loop runs as follows:
1st iteration: n = 1, num = 1 + 3 = 4
2nd iteration: n = 2, num = 4 + 3 = 7
3rd iteration: n = 3, num = 7 + 3 = 10
At this point, num is equal to b, so the loop terminates.
The code then prints the value of n, which is 3.
