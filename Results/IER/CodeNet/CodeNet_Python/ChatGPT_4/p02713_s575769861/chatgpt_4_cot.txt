The variable k is initialized to 2.
The variable ans is calculated as (k+1)*k//2, which is (2+1)*2//2 = 3.
A 2D list tttt is created with dimensions (k+1) x (k+1), filled with zeros. Since k is 2, the list will have dimensions 3x3.

The code then enters two nested loops to iterate over the range 1 to k (inclusive) for both i and j. Since k is 2, it will consider the pairs (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), and (2,2). The loop skips the case where i equals j.

For each pair (i, j) where i is not equal to j, the code checks if tttt[i][j] is not zero. Since the list was initialized with zeros, this condition will not be met on the first pass, and the else block will execute.

In the else block, the greatest common divisor (gcd) of i and j is calculated using fr.gcd(i,j) and stored in g. The value of g is then stored in tttt[i][j] and tttt[j][i]. The variable ans is incremented by 3 times the value of g.

For i=1 and j=2, g will be fr.gcd(1,2) which is 1. So, ans will be incremented by 3*1, making ans = 3 + 3 = 6.

The code then enters another set of nested loops to iterate over the range 1 to k-1 for i, i+1 to k for j, and j+1 to k+1 for l. Since k is 2, the only valid combination for (i, j, l) is (1, 2, 3).

For this combination, temp is set to tttt[i][j], which is tttt[1][2] and equals 1. Then temp2 is set to tttt[temp][l], which is tttt[1][3]. Since tttt[1][3] has not been set before, it will be calculated as fr.gcd(1,3), which is 1. The variable ans is incremented by 6*temp2, which is 6*1, making ans = 6 + 6 = 12.

Finally, the code prints the value of ans, which is 12.
