<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 2 after converting the input string to an integer.
The code then calculates n + n^2 + n^3, which is 2 + 2^2 + 2^3.
This equals 2 + 4 + 8, which is 14.
The result is then converted to an integer (although it is already an integer) and printed.
<<<Output>>>
14
