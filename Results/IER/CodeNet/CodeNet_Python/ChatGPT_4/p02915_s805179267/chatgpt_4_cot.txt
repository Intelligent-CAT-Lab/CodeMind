<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a series of functions and constants, but only the II() function and the last line are relevant for the given input.
The II() function reads an integer from the input, which is `2` in this case.
The last line of the code takes the integer input from II(), which is `2`, and raises it to the power of 3.
Therefore, the output will be 2^3, which is 8.
<<<Output>>>
8
