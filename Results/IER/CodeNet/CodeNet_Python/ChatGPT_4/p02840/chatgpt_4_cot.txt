The variables N, X, and D are initialized to 3, 4, and 2, respectively.
Since D is not 0, the code does not enter the first if block.
D is also not less than 0, so the code does not enter the second if block either.

A defaultdict of lists named memo is created to store the ranges of possible values for each remainder when divided by D.

The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider k from 0 to 3.

For each k, it calculates the lower bound l and the upper bound r of the range of possible values for the sum of the arithmetic progression that starts with X and has a common difference of D.

These ranges are then stored in the memo dictionary, indexed by the remainder of l when divided by D.

After the loop, the variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the total number of distinct values.

The code then iterates over the values of the memo dictionary. For each list of ranges LR, it sorts the list and initializes a variable cur to -INF.

It then iterates over the sorted ranges in LR. For each range (l, r), it checks if the current value cur is less than l. If it is, it means that there is a new distinct range, and it adds the number of distinct values in this range to ans and updates cur to r.

If cur is less than r, it means that the current range extends beyond the current value of cur, and it adds the number of distinct values from cur to r to ans and updates cur to r.

After processing all ranges, the code prints the final value of ans.

Let's calculate the ranges for each k:
- For k = 0: l = r = 0
- For k = 1: l = r = 4
- For k = 2: l = 4 + 1 * 2 = 6, r = 4 + 4 * 2 = 12
- For k = 3: l = 4 + 3 * 2 = 10, r = 4 + 7 * 2 = 18

The memo dictionary will have the following entries:
- 0: [(0, 0), (4, 4), (6, 12), (10, 18)]

After sorting and merging the ranges, we get:
- 0: [(0, 0), (4, 4), (6, 18)]

Now we calculate the number of distinct values:
- For the range (0, 0): 1 value
- For the range (4, 4): 1 value
- For the range (6, 18): (18 - 6) / 2 + 1 = 7 values

Adding them up, we get 1 + 1 + 7 = 9 distinct values.

Therefore, the output of the code execution will be 9.
