<<<Analysis>>>
The variables n and m are initialized to 3 and 8, respectively.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 3.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the value of f as 2 * i + 4 * (n - i).
The code checks if f equals m. If it does, it prints 'Yes' and breaks out of the loop.
The loop will check the following values of i and corresponding f:
- For i = 0, f = 2*0 + 4*(3-0) = 12, which is not equal to m.
- For i = 1, f = 2*1 + 4*(3-1) = 2 + 8 = 10, which is not equal to m.
- For i = 2, f = 2*2 + 4*(3-2) = 4 + 4 = 8, which is equal to m.
Since f equals m when i = 2, the code prints 'Yes' and breaks out of the loop.
The loop does not need to check for i = 3 because the condition has already been met and the loop has been exited.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
