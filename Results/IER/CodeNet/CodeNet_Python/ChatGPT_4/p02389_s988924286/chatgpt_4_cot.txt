<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a and b are initialized to 3 and 5, respectively, from the input.
The code calculates the product of a and b, which is 3 * 5 = 15.
The code also calculates the perimeter of a rectangle with sides a and b, which is 2 * (a + b) = 2 * (3 + 5) = 2 * 8 = 16.
The code then prints the two calculated values on the same line separated by a space.
<<<Output>>>
15 16
