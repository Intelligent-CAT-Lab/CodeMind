<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized to 3.
Nlist is created as a list of triangular numbers up to the 999th triangular number (since range goes from 0 to 999).
The code checks if N (which is 3) is in Nlist. Since 3 is the second triangular number, it is in the list.
Since N is in Nlist, the code prints 'Yes'.
The code then finds the index of N in Nlist, which is 2 because the triangular numbers start from 0 (0, 1, 3, 6, ...), and 3 is the third element (0-indexed).
S is initialized as a list of lists, where each sublist has a length of i for i in range(k), where k is 2. So S will have one empty list and one list with a single 0 element.
S[0] is then set to be a list from 1 to k-1, which is just [1].
For the next part of the loop, since k is 2, it will only run once. It sets S[1] to be a list containing S[0][0] (which is 1) and then adds the next number in the sequence, which is 2.
The code prints the value of k, which is 2.
S is then converted to a list of strings for printing.
Finally, the code prints each sublist in S, prefixed with the value k-1 (which is 1) and joined by spaces.
