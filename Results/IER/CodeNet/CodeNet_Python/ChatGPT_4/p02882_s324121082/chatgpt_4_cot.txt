<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a, b, and x are initialized to 2, 2, and 4, respectively.
The variable c is calculated as x/a, which is 4/2 = 2.
The code checks if c is greater than (a*b)/2, which is (2*2)/2 = 2. Since c equals 2, the condition is not strictly greater, so the else block is executed.
In the else block, d is calculated as c*2 / b, which is 2*2 / 2 = 2.
Then, e is calculated as the arctangent of b/d, which is arctan(2/2) = arctan(1).
The value of arctan(1) is Ï€/4 radians, or 45 degrees.
Finally, the code prints the value of e in degrees, which is 45.
<<<Output>>>
45.0
