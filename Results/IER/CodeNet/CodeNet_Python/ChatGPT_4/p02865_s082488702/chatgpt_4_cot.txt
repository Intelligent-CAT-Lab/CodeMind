<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 4.
The code checks if n is even by using the modulo operator (n % 2 == 0). Since 4 is even, the condition is true.
The code then executes the print statement in the if block, which prints the result of the integer division of n by 2, minus 1. That is (4//2) - 1, which equals 2 - 1.
The output will be 1.
