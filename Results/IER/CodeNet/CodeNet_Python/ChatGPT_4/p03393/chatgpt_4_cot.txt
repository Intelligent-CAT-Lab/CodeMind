<<<Analysis>>>
The input string 'atcoder' is assigned to the variable s.
The code first checks if the length of s is less than 26. Since 'atcoder' has a length of 7, which is less than 26, the condition is true.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the range 0 to 25 (representing the alphabet).
For each iteration, it creates a temporary string 'tmp' containing the character corresponding to the current loop index plus the ASCII value of 'a'.
It checks if 'tmp' is not in s. If it is not, it prints the concatenation of s and 'tmp' and exits the program.
The first character not in 'atcoder' is 'b', so the program prints 'atcoderb' and exits.
<<<Output>>>
atcoderb
