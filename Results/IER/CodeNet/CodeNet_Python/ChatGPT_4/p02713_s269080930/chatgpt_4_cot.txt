The variable K is initialized to 2.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of the greatest common divisors (gcd).
A 2D list dp is created with dimensions 220x220, with all elements initialized to 1.

The code then enters a nested loop that iterates over all pairs of numbers (i, j) from 1 to K (inclusive), meaning it will consider pairs (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), and (2, 2).
For each pair (i, j), it calculates the gcd of i and j and stores it in dp[i][j].

After filling the dp table with gcd values for all pairs, the code enters another nested loop that iterates over all triplets of numbers (i, j, k) from 1 to K (inclusive).
For each triplet (i, j, k), it retrieves the previously calculated gcd of i and j, which is stored in a, and then adds the gcd of a and k to ans. The gcd values are retrieved from the dp table, which avoids recalculating gcd multiple times.

The triplets considered are (1, 1, 1), (1, 1, 2), (1, 2, 1), (1, 2, 2), (2, 1, 1), (2, 1, 2), (2, 2, 1), and (2, 2, 2).
The gcd values for these triplets are calculated as follows:
- gcd(1, gcd(1, 1)) = gcd(1, 1) = 1
- gcd(1, gcd(1, 2)) = gcd(1, 1) = 1
- gcd(1, gcd(2, 1)) = gcd(1, 1) = 1
- gcd(1, gcd(2, 2)) = gcd(1, 2) = 1
- gcd(2, gcd(1, 1)) = gcd(2, 1) = 1
- gcd(2, gcd(1, 2)) = gcd(2, 1) = 1
- gcd(2, gcd(2, 1)) = gcd(2, 1) = 1
- gcd(2, gcd(2, 2)) = gcd(2, 2) = 2

The sum of these gcd values is 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 9.

After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 9.
