<<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized to the string "RUDLUDR".
Two lists, odd and even, are defined with the characters "R", "U", "D" and "L", "U", "D" respectively.
The code enters the first loop, which iterates over the characters of s at even indices (0-based), meaning it will check characters at positions 1, 3, 5, etc. of the string.
For each character at an even index, it checks if the character is in the list odd. If it is not, it prints "No" and exits the program.
The characters at even indices are "R", "D", "D", and all of them are in the list odd, so the loop completes without printing "No".
The code then enters the second loop, which iterates over the characters of s at odd indices (0-based), meaning it will check characters at positions 2, 4, 6, etc. of the string.
For each character at an odd index, it checks if the character is in the list even. If it is not, it prints "No" and exits the program.
The characters at odd indices are "U", "L", "U", and all of them are in the list even, so the loop completes without printing "No".
Since neither loop resulted in printing "No" and exiting, the code finally prints "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
