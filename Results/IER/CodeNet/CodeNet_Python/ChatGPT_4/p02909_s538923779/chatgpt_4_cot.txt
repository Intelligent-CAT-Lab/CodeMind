<<<Analysis>>>
The variable S is initialized with the string 'Sunny'.
The code then checks the value of S against three conditions:
1. If S is 'Sunny', it will print 'Cloudy'.
2. If S is 'Cloudy', it will print 'Rainy'.
3. If S is 'Rainy', it will print 'Sunny'.
Since S is 'Sunny', the first condition is met, and the code will print 'Cloudy'.
<<<Output>>>
Cloudy
