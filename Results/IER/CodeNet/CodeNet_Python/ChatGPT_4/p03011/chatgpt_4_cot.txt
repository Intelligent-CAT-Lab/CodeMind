<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a, b, and c are initialized to 1, 3, and 4, respectively.
The code calculates the sum of a, b, and c, which is 1 + 3 + 4 = 8.
Then, it finds the maximum value among a, b, and c, which is 4.
The code then subtracts the maximum value (4) from the sum (8), resulting in 8 - 4 = 4.
Finally, the code prints the result of the subtraction, which is 4.
<<<Output>>>
4
