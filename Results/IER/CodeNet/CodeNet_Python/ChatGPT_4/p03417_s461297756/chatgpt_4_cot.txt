<<<Analysis>>>
The variables n and m are initialized to 2 and 2, respectively.
The code then checks if both n and m are greater than or equal to 2. Since both are exactly 2, the condition is true.
The code executes the first print statement, which calculates (n - 2) * (m - 2). Substituting the values of n and m, we get (2 - 2) * (2 - 2), which equals 0 * 0.
Therefore, the result is 0.
The code will print this result.
<<<Output>>>
0
