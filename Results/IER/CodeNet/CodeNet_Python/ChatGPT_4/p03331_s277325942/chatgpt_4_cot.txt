<<<Analysis>>>
The function DigitsSum calculates the sum of the digits of a given number n.
The variable N is initialized to 15.
The variable min_sum is initialized to a large number (100000) to ensure that any sum of digits found will be smaller.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 14.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of the digits of i and N-i, and stores it in the variable sum.
The code checks if this sum is less than min_sum. If it is, it updates min_sum with this new sum.
The loop will find the minimum sum of the digits of two numbers that add up to N.
For N = 15, the pairs of numbers and their digit sums are:
(1, 14): 1 + 1+4 = 6
(2, 13): 2 + 1+3 = 6
(3, 12): 3 + 1+2 = 6
(4, 11): 4 + 1+1 = 6
(5, 10): 5 + 1+0 = 6
(6, 9): 6 + 9 = 15
(7, 8): 7 + 8 = 15
The minimum sum of digits found is 6.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of min_sum, which is 6.
<<<Output>>>
6
