<<<Analysis>>>
The input `2 1 3 4` is read and converted into a list of integers [2, 1, 3, 4].
The list is then sorted to become [1, 2, 3, 4].
The code calculates the absolute difference between the sum of the first and last elements (1 + 4) and the sum of the second and third elements (2 + 3).
The sums are 5 and 5, respectively.
The absolute difference between 5 and 5 is 0.
The code then prints the result, which is 0.
<<<Output>>>
