<<<Analysis>>>
The input string '1 6 3' is split into a list of strings ['1', '6', '3'].
Each string in the list is converted to an integer, resulting in the list a = [1, 6, 3].
The list a is then sorted in ascending order, resulting in a = [1, 3, 6].
The expression a[1] - a[0] + a[2] - a[1] is then evaluated as follows:
- a[1] - a[0] is 3 - 1, which equals 2.
- a[2] - a[1] is 6 - 3, which equals 3.
- Adding these two results together gives 2 + 3, which equals 5.
The final result, 5, is printed to the output.
