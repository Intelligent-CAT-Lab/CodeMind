<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string input and splits it into a list using the `split()` method. The input string '5 8' is split into a list `['5', '8']`.
The `int()` function is used to convert the string elements of the list to integers.
The first element of the list `a[0]` is '5', which is converted to integer 5.
The second element of the list `a[1]` is '8', which is converted to integer 8.
The two integers are then multiplied together (5 * 8), resulting in 40.
Finally, the result of the multiplication is printed.
<<<Output>>>
40
