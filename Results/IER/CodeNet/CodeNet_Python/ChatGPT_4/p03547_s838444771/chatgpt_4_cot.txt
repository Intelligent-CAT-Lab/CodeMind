<<<Analysis>>>
The variables X and Y are initialized with the string values 'A' and 'B', respectively.
The code then checks if X is less than Y. Since 'A' comes before 'B' in the ASCII table, 'A' is indeed less than 'B'.
Therefore, the condition X < Y is True.
As a result, the code will execute the first print statement and print '<'.
The elif and else blocks are ignored since the first condition was met.
