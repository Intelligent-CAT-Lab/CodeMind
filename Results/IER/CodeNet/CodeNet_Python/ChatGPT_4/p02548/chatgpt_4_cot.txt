<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 3.
The variable cnt is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of pairs (a, b) such that a * b is less than n.

The code then enters a nested loop:
- The outer loop iterates over a from 1 to n-1 (1 and 2 in this case).
- The inner loop iterates over b from 1 to n-1 (1 and 2 in this case).

For each pair (a, b), the code calculates the product x = a * b.
- When a = 1, b will take values 1 and 2. The products are 1*1=1 and 1*2=2, both of which are less than n (3). So, cnt is incremented by 2.
- When a = 2, b starts at 1. The product is 2*1=2, which is less than n. So, cnt is incremented by 1. The next value of b would be 2, but 2*2=4 is not less than n, so the inner loop breaks.

The total count of pairs (a, b) where a * b is less than n is 3.

After the loops finish, the code prints the final value of cnt, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>
