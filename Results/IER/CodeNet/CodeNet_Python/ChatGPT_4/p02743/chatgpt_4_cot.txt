<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a, b, and c are initialized to 2, 3, and 9, respectively.
The code first checks if c - a - b is negative. In this case, 9 - 2 - 3 equals 4, which is not negative.
Since the condition is false, it proceeds to the else block.
In the else block, it checks if 4 * a * b is less than (c - a - b)^2.
Calculating 4 * a * b gives 4 * 2 * 3 = 24.
Calculating (c - a - b)^2 gives (9 - 2 - 3)^2 = 4^2 = 16.
The condition 24 < 16 is false.
Therefore, the code will print 'No'.
<<<Output>>>
No
