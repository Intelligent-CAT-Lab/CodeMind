The variable S is initialized with the string "AIZUNYANPEROPERO".
The variable A is initialized to False, which will be used as a flag to indicate whether an 'A' has been encountered in the string.
The variable c is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of 'AZ' patterns in the string.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each character s in the string S.
The first operation inside the loop sets A to True if the current character s is 'A'. This is done using the bitwise OR operator (|=), which in this context works as a logical OR because A is a boolean.
If the current character s is 'Z' and A is True (meaning an 'A' has been encountered before this 'Z'), the counter c is incremented by 1 and A is reset to False.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if c is greater than 0. If it is, it prints "AZ" repeated c times. If c is 0, it prints -1.
In the given string "AIZUNYANPEROPERO", the 'AZ' pattern occurs once (from the first 'A' to the first 'Z').
Therefore, c will be 1, and the output will be "AZ" repeated once.
