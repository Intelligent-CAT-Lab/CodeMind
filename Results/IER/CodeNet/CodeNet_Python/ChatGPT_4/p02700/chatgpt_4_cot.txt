<<<Analysis>>>
The variables A, B, C, and D are initialized to 10, 9, 10, and 10, respectively.
The code enters a while loop that continues as long as both A and C are greater than 0.
In the first iteration, C is reduced by B (C -= B), which means C becomes 10 - 9 = 1.
The code then checks if C is less than or equal to 0. Since C is 1, the condition is not met, and the loop continues.
Next, A is reduced by D (A -= D), which means A becomes 10 - 10 = 0.
The code checks if A is less than or equal to 0. Since A is 0, the condition is met, and "No" is printed.
The break statement is executed, and the loop terminates.
The output of the code is "No".
