The variable n is initialized to 4.
The variable nums is initialized to a list containing the numbers from 1 to n (inclusive), which is [1, 2, 3, 4].
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of series.

The code then enters a loop that iterates over each number in nums.
For each num in nums, it calculates the number of times num divides n using integer division (n//num), which is stored in cnt.
It then calculates the sum of an arithmetic series that starts with num, ends with num*cnt, and has cnt terms. The formula for the sum of an arithmetic series is used: cnt*(first_term + last_term)//2, where first_term is num and last_term is num*cnt. This is stored in curr_sum.
The value of curr_sum is added to ans for each iteration.

Let's calculate the values step by step:
- For num = 1: cnt = 4//1 = 4, curr_sum = 4*(2*1+(4-1)*1)//2 = 4*(2+3)//2 = 4*5//2 = 10
- For num = 2: cnt = 4//2 = 2, curr_sum = 2*(2*2+(2-1)*2)//2 = 2*(4+2)//2 = 2*6//2 = 6
- For num = 3: cnt = 4//3 = 1, curr_sum = 1*(2*3+(1-1)*3)//2 = 1*(6+0)//2 = 1*6//2 = 3
- For num = 4: cnt = 4//4 = 1, curr_sum = 1*(2*4+(1-1)*4)//2 = 1*(8+0)//2 = 1*8//2 = 4

The sum of all curr_sum values is 10 + 6 + 3 + 4 = 23.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 23.
<<<Output>>>
23
