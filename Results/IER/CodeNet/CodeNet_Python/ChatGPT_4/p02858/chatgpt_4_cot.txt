The variables H, W, and T are initialized to 2, 2, and 1, respectively.
The variable gh is assigned the greatest common divisor (gcd) of H and T, which is gcd(2, 1) = 1.
The variable gw is assigned the gcd of W and T, which is gcd(2, 1) = 1.
The variable h is assigned the result of H divided by gh, which is 2 // 1 = 2.
The variable w is assigned the result of W divided by gw, which is 2 // 1 = 2.
The variable MOD is set to 1000000007, which is a large prime number often used for modulo operations to avoid integer overflow.
The code then calculates the following expression:
pow(pow(2, h, MOD) + pow(2, w, MOD) + pow(2, gcd(h, w), MOD) - 3, gh * gw, MOD)
Breaking it down:
- pow(2, h, MOD) calculates 2^h mod MOD, which is 2^2 mod 1000000007 = 4.
- pow(2, w, MOD) calculates 2^w mod MOD, which is also 4.
- gcd(h, w) is the gcd of h and w, which is gcd(2, 2) = 2.
- pow(2, gcd(h, w), MOD) calculates 2^gcd(h, w) mod MOD, which is 2^2 mod 1000000007 = 4.
- The sum of these three values is 4 + 4 + 4 = 12.
- Subtracting 3 from this sum gives 12 - 3 = 9.
- Finally, pow(9, gh * gw, MOD) calculates 9^(gh * gw) mod MOD, which is 9^(1 * 1) mod 1000000007 = 9.
The code prints the result of this calculation, which is 9.
<<<Output>>>
9
