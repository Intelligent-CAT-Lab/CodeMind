<<<Analysis>>>
The variables n and m are initialized to 2 and 2, respectively.
The variable mod is set to 10^9 + 7, which is a large prime number often used for modulo operations in competitive programming to prevent integer overflow.

The code then checks if n is equal to m. Since n and m are both 2, the condition is true.
It calculates the factorial of n (which is 2) and m (which is also 2). The factorial of 2 is 2! = 2 * 1 = 2.
The result res is then calculated as 2 * 2! * 2! = 2 * 2 * 2 = 8.
Finally, the code prints res modulo mod, which is 8 % (10^9 + 7). Since 8 is much smaller than 10^9 + 7, the result is simply 8.

<<<Output>>>
8
