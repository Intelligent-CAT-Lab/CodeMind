<<<Analysis>>>
The variables n, a, and b are initialized to 10, 3, and 5, respectively.
The variable maximum is set to the minimum of a and b, which is min(3, 5), resulting in 3.
The variable minimum is set to the maximum of 0 and (a+b-n), which is max(0, 3+5-10), resulting in max(0, -2), which is 0 since -2 is less than 0.
The code then prints the values of maximum and minimum, which are 3 and 0, respectively.
<<<Output>>>
3 0
