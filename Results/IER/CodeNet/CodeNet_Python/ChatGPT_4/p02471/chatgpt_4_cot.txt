<<<Analysis>>>
The code is designed to solve the linear Diophantine equation `a * x + b * y = gcd(a, b)` for integers `x` and `y`, where `gcd(a, b)` is the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b`. The function `rec` is a recursive function that uses the Extended Euclidean algorithm to find `x`, `y`, and `gcd`.

Given the input `4 12`, the following steps are taken:

1. The input is read and assigned to variables `a` and `b`, so `a = 4` and `b = 12`.
2. Since `a < b`, the code swaps `a` and `b` and calls the `rec` function with `rec(12, 4)`.
3. Inside `rec`, `q` is the quotient and `r` is the remainder of the division of `a` by `b`. So `q = 3` and `r = 0`.
4. Since `r` is `0`, the function returns `(0, 1, b)` which is `(0, 1, 12)`.
5. The values are assigned to `y0, x0, gcd`, so `y0 = 0`, `x0 = 1`, and `gcd = 12`.
6. The code then calculates `dx` and `dy` which are the steps to move `x` and `y` to find the smallest non-negative solution. Since `dx = b // gcd` and `dy = -a // gcd`, we get `dx = 1` and `dy = -1/3`. However, since `dx` and `dy` must be integers, `dy` is actually `-0` (which is just `0`).
7. The code then enters a loop to find the smallest magnitude of `x` and `y` by adding `dx` and `dy` to `x0` and `y0`. However, since `dy` is `0`, `y` will not change, and `x` will only increase. This loop will break immediately because `mag1` will be greater than `mag` after the first iteration.
8. The code enters a second loop to find the smallest magnitude of `x` and `y` by subtracting `dx` and `dy` from `x0` and `y0`. Since `dx` is `1` and `dy` is `0`, `x` will decrease by `1` each time until `mag1` is greater than `mag`. This will happen when `x` becomes negative.
9. The final values of `x` and `y` are printed, which are the smallest non-negative integers that satisfy the equation `4 * x + 12 * y = 12`.

Since the smallest non-negative integer solution for `x` is `0` (as any positive value of `x` would make the sum `4 * x + 12 * y` greater than `12`), and `y` is `1` (as `12 * 1 = 12`), the output will be `0 1`.
