<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a and b are initialized to 2 and 1, respectively.
The variable cnt is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the count of combinations.
The commented-out code is ignored during execution.
The function cmb is defined to calculate combinations of n items taken r at a time, using a recursive approach and memoization to improve performance.
The code checks if a is greater than 1, which it is, so it calculates cmb(a, 2), which is cmb(2, 2). Since cmb(2, 2) is equal to 1 (as per the base case of the cmb function), cnt is incremented by 1.
The code then checks if b is greater than 1, which it is not, so the cmb function is not called for b, and cnt is not incremented.
Finally, the code prints the value of cnt, which is 1.
