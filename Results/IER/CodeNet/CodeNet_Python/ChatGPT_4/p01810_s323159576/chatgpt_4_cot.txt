<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized to 4, and variable k is initialized to 2.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the result of the calculation.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to N - 2 (inclusive), meaning it will consider 3 iterations since N - 1 is 3.
In each iteration, the following calculation is performed:
  ans = (ans * k + k - 1) // (k - 1)
Since k is 2, the calculation simplifies to:
  ans = (ans * 2 + 1) // 1
This is equivalent to doubling ans and adding 1 in each iteration.

Let's calculate it step by step:
1st iteration (i = 0): ans = (0 * 2 + 1) // 1 = 1
2nd iteration (i = 1): ans = (1 * 2 + 1) // 1 = 3
3rd iteration (i = 2): ans = (3 * 2 + 1) // 1 = 7

After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 7.
<<<Output>>>
7
