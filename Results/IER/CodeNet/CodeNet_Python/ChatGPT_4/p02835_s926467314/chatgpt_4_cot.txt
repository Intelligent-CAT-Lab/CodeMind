<<<Analysis>>>
The input is a list of three integers: 5, 7, and 9.
The code reads these integers and stores them in the list A.
It then calculates the sum of the elements in A, which is 5 + 7 + 9 = 21.
The code checks if the sum is greater than or equal to 22. Since 21 is not greater than or equal to 22, the condition is False.
Therefore, the code prints 'win' because the sum is less than 22.
<<<Output>>>
win
