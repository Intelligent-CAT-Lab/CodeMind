<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized to 432.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 50000.
For each number i in this range, it calculates i * 1.08 and checks if the result, when converted to an integer, equals N.
If a match is found, it prints the current value of i and exits the loop and the program with exit(0).
If no match is found by the end of the loop, it prints ':('.
In this case, we are looking for a number i such that int(i * 1.08) equals 432.
To find this number, we can reverse the operation: i = 432 / 1.08.
Calculating this gives us i = 400.
Since 400 is within the loop range, the code will find this match and print 400.
<<<Output>>>
400
