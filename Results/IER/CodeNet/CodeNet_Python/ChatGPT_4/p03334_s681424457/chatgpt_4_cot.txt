The input values are N=2, D1=1, and D2=2. The variable NN is set to 2 * N, which is 4.

The function `deg(x)` is defined to find the position of the least significant bit that is set to 1 in the binary representation of x.

`p1` is set to the output of `deg(D1)`, which is 0 because 1 in binary is '1', and the least significant bit is at position 0.
`p2` is set to the output of `deg(D2)`, which is 1 because 2 in binary is '10', and the least significant bit is at position 1.

The function `group(x, y, p)` is defined to group points (x, y) based on the value of p. If p is even, it groups based on the bit at position `hp` (half of p) of x XORed with the bit at position `hp` of y. If p is odd, it groups based on the bit at position `hp` of x.

The list `pts` is created using a list comprehension that includes all points (x, y) for x and y in the range [0, NN) (which is [0, 4) in this case) where both `group(x, y, p1)` and `group(x, y, p2)` return 0.

Since `p1` is 0 and `p2` is 1, `group(x, y, p1)` will always return 0 because `p1` is even and `hp` is 0, so the bit at position 0 of x XORed with the bit at position 0 of y is always 0 (since any bit XORed with itself is 0).

`group(x, y, p2)` will return 0 for points where the bit at position 0 (since `hp` is 0 when `p2` is 1) of x is 0.

Therefore, `pts` will include points where x is even (since the least significant bit of x must be 0).

The final loop prints the first N^2 points (4 points in this case) from `pts`.

The output will be the first 4 points (x, y) where x is even, and y can be any value from 0 to 3. These points are (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), and (0, 3).
