<<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized with the string 'oxxoxoo'.
The code checks if the first character and the last character of the string s are both 'x'.
In this case, the first character is 'o' and the last character is 'o'.
Since the condition s[0]=='x' and s[-1]=='x' is not met, the code will print 'o'.
<<<Output>>>
o
