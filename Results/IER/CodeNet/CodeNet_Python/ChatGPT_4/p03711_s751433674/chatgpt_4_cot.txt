<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a and b are initialized with the values 1 and 3, respectively, from the input.
A dictionary named mydict is created with keys ranging from 1 to 12, each associated with a string value of either "a", "b", or "c".
The code then checks if the values corresponding to the keys a and b in mydict are equal.
Looking up the values in mydict for keys 1 and 3, both have the value "a".
Since the values for both keys are the same, the condition in the if statement is true.
Therefore, the code will print "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
