The input is `5 3`, which means N is 5 and K is 3.
The ModTools class is initialized with MAX set to N+K+1 (which is 5+3+1=9) and MOD set to 10**9+7.
The factorial and inverse lists are created with size 9 and filled with 1s.
The factorial list is then populated with the factorial of each index modulo MOD.
The inverse list is populated with the modular inverse of the factorial of each index modulo MOD.
The nCr method is called with n=N-1 (which is 4) and r=K-1 (which is 2).
The nCr method calculates the combination of 4 choose 2 using the factorial and inverse lists.
The result of nCr is then printed modulo MOD.
The combination of 4 choose 2 is 6.
Therefore, the output will be 6 modulo 10**9+7, which is still 6 since 6 is less than 10**9+7.
