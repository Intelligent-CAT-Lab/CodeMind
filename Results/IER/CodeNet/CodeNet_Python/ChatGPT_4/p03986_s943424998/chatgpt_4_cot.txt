<<<Analysis>>>
The variable X is initialized to the string 'TSTTSS'.
A deque stack is initialized with the first character of X, which is 'T'.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the remaining characters of X.

1. The second character is 'S', so it is added to the left of the deque, making the deque ['S', 'T'].
2. The third character is 'T', so the code checks if the deque is not empty (it is not), pops the leftmost element ('S'), checks if it is 'T' (it is not), and then the deque becomes ['T'] and 'T' is added to the left, making the deque ['T', 'T'].
3. The fourth character is 'T', so the code repeats the previous step, popping 'T' and then adding 'T' twice, making the deque ['T', 'T', 'T'].
4. The fifth character is 'S', so it is added to the left of the deque, making the deque ['S', 'T', 'T', 'T'].
5. The sixth character is 'S', so it is added to the left of the deque again, making the deque ['S', 'S', 'T', 'T', 'T'].

After the loop finishes, the code prints the length of the deque, which is 5.
