<<<Analysis>>>
The variables s and w are initialized to 4 and 5, respectively.
The code then checks if w is greater than or equal to s.
Since w (5) is greater than s (4), the condition is true.
Therefore, the code will execute the print statement within the if block and print "unsafe".
<<<Output>>>
unsafe
