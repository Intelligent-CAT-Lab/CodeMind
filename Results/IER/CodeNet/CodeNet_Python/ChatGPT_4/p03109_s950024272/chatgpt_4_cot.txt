<<<Analysis>>>
The variable S is initialized with the string '2019/04/30'.
The variable year is assigned the value 2019, which is extracted from the string S by slicing the first four characters.
The variable month is assigned the value 4, which is extracted from the string S by slicing characters at index 5 and 6.
The code then checks if the year is less than 2019, which is not true in this case.
Next, it checks if the month is less than 5, which is true since the month is 4.
Since the month is less than 5, the code prints 'Heisei'.
<<<Output>>>
Heisei
