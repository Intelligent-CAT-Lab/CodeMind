<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a and b are initialized to -13 and 3, respectively, from the input.
The code calculates three expressions: a - b, a + b, and a * b, which are -13 - 3, -13 + 3, and -13 * 3, respectively.
The results of these expressions are -16, -10, and -39.
The code then uses the max() function to find the maximum value among these three results.
The maximum value is -10, which is the result of the expression a + b.
<<<Output>>>
-10
