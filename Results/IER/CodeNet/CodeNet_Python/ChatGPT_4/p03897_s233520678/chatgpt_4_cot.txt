The variable N is initialized to 2.
A 2x2 numpy array of int8 type, named grid, is initialized with zeros.

The following operations are performed on the grid:
- grid[::2,::2] = 1: This sets every second element starting from the first in both rows and columns to 1. However, since the grid is only 2x2, this only affects the top-left corner (0,0).
- grid[1::2,1::2] = 1: This sets every second element starting from the second in both rows and columns to 1. In a 2x2 grid, this affects the bottom-right corner (1,1).
- The next six lines of code attempt to modify the grid at intervals of 6, but since the grid is only 2x2, these lines have no effect.
- grid[0,:] = 1: This sets the first row to 1s.
- grid[-1,:] = 1: This sets the last row to 1s.
- grid[:,0] = 1: This sets the first column to 1s.
- grid[:,-1] = 1: This sets the last column to 1s.
- grid[::2,::2] = 0: This resets every second element starting from the first in both rows and columns to 0. This will reset the top-left corner (0,0) back to 0.
- grid[1::2,1::2] = 0: This resets every second element starting from the second in both rows and columns to 0. This will reset the bottom-right corner (1,1) back to 0.

After these operations, the grid will look like this:
1 1
1 1

The np.where(grid==1) function finds the indices of elements that are equal to 1. Since all elements are 1, it will return arrays representing the coordinates of all cells.

The length of x (which is the same as the length of y) is printed, which is the number of cells with a value of 1. In this case, it is 4.

Finally, the coordinates of each cell with a value of 1 are printed in the format "row column".
