<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a and b are initialized with the values 3 and 5, respectively, from the input.
The code then evaluates the condition a < b, which is true since 3 is less than 5.
Since the condition is true, the expression after the 'if' is evaluated, which is 0.
The print function then outputs the result of the expression, which is 0.
<<<Output>>>
