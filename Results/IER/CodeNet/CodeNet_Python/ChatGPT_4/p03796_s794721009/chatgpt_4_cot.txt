<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized to 3.
The variable power is initialized to 1, which will be used to calculate the factorial of N modulo 10^9 + 7.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to N-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider the range [0, 1, 2] for i.
For each iteration, it multiplies power by (i+1), effectively calculating the factorial of N.
After each multiplication, it takes the result modulo 10^9 + 7 to keep the number within the limits of a 32-bit integer.
The iterations will proceed as follows:
- First iteration (i=0): power = 1 * (0+1) % (10^9+7) = 1
- Second iteration (i=1): power = 1 * (1+1) % (10^9+7) = 2
- Third iteration (i=2): power = 2 * (2+1) % (10^9+7) = 6
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of power, which is 6.
