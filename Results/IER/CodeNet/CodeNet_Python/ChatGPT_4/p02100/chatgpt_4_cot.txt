The input string `S` is `x^2+3x+2`. The length `L` of the string is 9.

The function `expr()` is called, which processes the input string to fill the array `P` with the coefficients of the polynomial. The global variable `cur` is used to keep track of the current position in the string.

The `expr()` function calls `term()` function with the initial operator `op` as "+".

1. The first term is `x^2`. The `term()` function sets `k` to 1 (since there's no coefficient before `x`), and `d` to 2 (since `x` is followed by `^2`). The coefficient at index 2 of `P` is set to 1.

2. The next term is `+3x`. The `term()` function sets `k` to 3 and `d` to 1 (since `x` is not followed by a power, it defaults to 1). The coefficient at index 1 of `P` is set to 3.

3. The last term is `+2`. The `term()` function sets `k` to 2 and `d` to 0 (since there's no `x`, it's a constant term). The coefficient at index 0 of `P` is set to 2.

After `expr()` finishes, the array `P` is `[2, 3, 1, 0, 0, 0]`.

The function `f(P, x)` calculates the value of the polynomial for a given `x`.

The code then finds the degree `d` of the polynomial, which is the highest index in `P` with a non-zero coefficient. In this case, `d` is 2.

The code then iterates `x` from 2000 down to -2000 and checks if `f(P, x)` is 0, meaning it finds the roots of the polynomial. The roots of `x^2+3x+2` are `-1` and `-2`.

The output is constructed by joining the roots in the format `(x%+d)`, where `%+d` formats the negative roots as subtraction. The roots are appended to the list `R` in descending order, so the output will be in ascending order of the roots.
