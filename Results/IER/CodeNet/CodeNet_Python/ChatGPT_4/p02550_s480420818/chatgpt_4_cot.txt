<<<Analysis>>>
The variables N, X, and M are initialized to 6, 2, and 1001, respectively.
The variable H is calculated using the ceiling of the base-2 logarithm of N plus 1, which results in H = ceil(log2(6)) + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4.
Two matrices nxt and dp are initialized with dimensions H x M, which is 4 x 1001 in this case.
nxt[0] is filled with the values of r^2 % M for r ranging from 0 to M-1.
dp[0] is filled with the values from 0 to M-1 (the range of r).

The code then enters a nested loop to fill in the rest of the nxt and dp matrices.
For i from 1 to H-1 (1 to 3) and r from 0 to M-1 (0 to 1000):
- nxt[i][r] is assigned the value of nxt[i-1][nxt[i-1][r]], which is the value of r after 2^i squaring modulo M.
- dp[i][r] is assigned the sum of dp[i-1][r] and dp[i-1][nxt[i-1][r]], which is the sum of the sequence of length 2^i starting from r.

The variable ans is initialized to 0, and r is initialized to X % M, which is 2 % 1001 = 2.
The code then enters a loop to calculate the final answer.
For i from 0 to H-1 (0 to 3):
- If the i-th bit of N is set (N & (1 << i) is not 0), then:
  - ans is incremented by dp[i][r], which is the sum of the sequence of length 2^i starting from r.
  - r is updated to nxt[i][r], which is the value of r after 2^i squaring modulo M.

The binary representation of N (6) is 110, so the loop will run for i = 1 and i = 2 (since the 0th bit is not set).
For i = 1:
- ans += dp[1][2]
- r = nxt[1][2]

For i = 2:
- ans += dp[2][r] (where r is the updated value from the previous step)
- r = nxt[2][r] (where r is the updated value from the previous step)

Finally, the code prints the value of ans.

Let's calculate the values for dp and nxt for i = 1 and i = 2:
- nxt[1][2] = nxt[0][nxt[0][2]] = nxt[0][4] = 16 % 1001 = 16
- dp[1][2] = dp[0][2] + dp[0][nxt[0][2]] = dp[0][2] + dp[0][4] = 2 + 4 = 6
- nxt[2][16] = nxt[1][nxt[1][16]] = nxt[1][256 % 1001] = nxt[1][256] = 65536 % 1001 = 361
- dp[2][16] = dp[1][16] + dp[1][nxt[1][16]] = dp[1][16] + dp[1][256 % 1001] = dp[1][16] + dp[1][256] = 16 + 256 = 272

Now we can calculate the final answer:
- ans = 0 initially
- For i = 1: ans += dp[1][2] = 6, r = nxt[1][2] = 16
- For i = 2: ans += dp[2][16] = 272, r = nxt[2][16] = 361

So the final value of ans is 6 + 272 = 278.
