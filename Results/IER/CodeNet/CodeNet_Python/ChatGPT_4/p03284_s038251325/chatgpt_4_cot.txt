<<<Analysis>>>
The variables n and k are initialized to 7 and 3, respectively.
The code checks if n is divisible by k without any remainder using the modulo operator (%).
Since 7 is not divisible by 3 without a remainder (7 % 3 equals 1), the condition n%k == 0 is False.
Therefore, the code executes the else part of the conditional expression and prints 1.
