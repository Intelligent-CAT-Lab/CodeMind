<<<Analysis>>>
The variable t is initialized to the input value multiplied by 2. Since the input is `0`, t becomes 0 * 2 = 0.
The code then prints two values separated by a space:
- The first value is t divided by 60 using integer division (//), which is 0 // 60 = 0.
- The second value is the remainder of t divided by 60, which is 0 % 60 = 0.
Therefore, the output will be "0 0".
<<<Output>>>
0 0
