<<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized to the string "pdbq".
The variable x is set to the length of s, which is 4.
The variable ans is initialized to "Yes".
The code checks if x is odd by checking if x%2 equals 1. Since 4%2 is 0, ans remains "Yes".
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to x//2, which is 2 in this case (since x is 4).
For i=0, s[i] is "p" and s[x-i-1] is "q". The condition is satisfied, so ans remains "Yes".
For i=1, s[i] is "d" and s[x-i-1] is "b". The condition is satisfied, so ans remains "Yes".
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
