<<<Analysis>>>
The variables A, B, and C are initialized to 2, 11, and 4, respectively.
The code checks if the integer division of B by A is greater than or equal to C.
The integer division of B by A is 11 // 2, which equals 5.
Since 5 is greater than C (which is 4), the condition is true.
Therefore, the code will print the value of C.
<<<Output>>>
4
