<<<Analysis>>>
The variable S is initialized to 3.
X1 and Y1 are initialized to 0, which represent the coordinates of the first point (0,0).

The variable tmp is calculated as the square root of S, floored to the nearest integer. For S = 3, tmp is 1 because int(3**0.5) is 1.
The code then checks if tmp squared is greater than or equal to S. Since 1 squared is 1, which is not greater than or equal to 3, the code sets X2 and Y3 to tmp+1, which is 2.

The variable rest is calculated as X2 squared minus S, which is 2 squared (4) minus 3, resulting in 1.

Since rest is not 0, the code checks if rest is less than 10**9. Since 1 is less than 10**9, the code sets X3 to 1 and Y2 to rest, which is also 1.

The code does not enter the else block because the previous condition was met.

Finally, the code prints the values of X1, Y1, X2, Y2, X3, and Y3, which are 0, 0, 2, 1, 1, and 2, respectively.
