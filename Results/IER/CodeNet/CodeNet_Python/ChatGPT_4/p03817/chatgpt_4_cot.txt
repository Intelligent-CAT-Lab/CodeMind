<<<Analysis>>>
The variable x is initialized to 7.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the answer.
The code performs a division of x by 11, which results in q being 0 and r being 7, since 7 divided by 11 is 0 with a remainder of 7.
ans is increased by 2*q, which is 0 since q is 0.
The code then performs a division of the remainder r by 6, which results in q being 1 and r being 1, since 7 divided by 6 is 1 with a remainder of 1.
ans is increased by q, which is 1.
Since r is greater than 0, ans is further increased by 1.
The final value of ans is 2.
The code prints the final value of ans.
