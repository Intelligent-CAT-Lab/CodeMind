The input is the integer `4`. The function `solve` is called with this value.

1. The variable `n` is initialized to 0. The while loop runs until `2**n` is greater than `l`. Since `2**2` is 4, which is equal to `l`, the loop stops, and `n` is now 2.

2. An empty list `E` is created to store tuples representing edges in a graph.

3. A for loop runs with `i` starting from `n-1` (which is 1) down to 0 (inclusive).

4. In the first iteration, `i` is 1:
   - Since `i` is not equal to `n-1`, two tuples are appended to `E`: (1, 2, 0) and (1, 2, 2).
   - The condition `l - x >= 2**(n-1)` is checked. Since `l - 2` is 2 and `2**(n-1)` is 2, the condition is true. Therefore, another tuple is appended to `E`: (1, 1, 2). `l` is updated to `l - x`, which is now 2.

5. In the second iteration, `i` is 0:
   - Since `i` is not equal to `n-1`, two tuples are appended to `E`: (0, 1, 0) and (0, 1, 1).
   - The condition `l - x >= 2**(n-1)` is checked. Since `l - 1` is 1 and `2**(n-1)` is 2, the condition is false. No tuple is appended for this condition.

6. The function prints `n` which is 2, and the length of `E` which is 5.

7. The function then prints each tuple in `E`, with each element of the tuple incremented by 1 to match the problem's 1-based indexing.

The output will be the value of `n`, the number of edges, followed by the edges themselves, each on a new line.
