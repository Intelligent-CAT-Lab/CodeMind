The input string "3-2*3" is processed to separate the numbers and operators by spaces, resulting in the list `S = ['3', '-', '2', '*', '3']`.

The `parse` function is defined to evaluate the expression based on the precedence of the operators given by the `pri` dictionary. The `number` function is a helper that returns the next number in the expression or a sub-expression value if the next token is an opening parenthesis (which is not the case for this input).

The `expr` function recursively evaluates the expression based on the current precedence level. There are three levels of precedence (0, 1, 2) corresponding to the three operators (+, -, *). The function uses the `pri` dictionary to determine which operator to evaluate next.

The `ans` variable is initialized to negative infinity to store the maximum result of the expression based on different operator precedences.

The code iterates over all permutations of precedence levels for the three operators using `product(range(3), repeat=3)`. For each permutation, it sets the precedence in the `pri` dictionary and evaluates the expression by calling `parse(pri, 0)`.

The maximum result of all permutations is stored in `ans`, which is printed at the end.

For the given input "3-2*3", the possible permutations of precedence levels and their corresponding evaluations are as follows:

1. (+:0, -:1, *:2) => 3 - (2 * 3) = 3 - 6 = -3
2. (+:0, -:2, *:1) => (3 - 2) * 3 = 1 * 3 = 3
3. (+:1, -:0, *:2) => 3 - (2 * 3) = 3 - 6 = -3
4. (+:1, -:2, *:0) => (3 - 2) * 3 = 1 * 3 = 3
5. (+:2, -:0, *:1) => 3 - (2 * 3) = 3 - 6 = -3
6. (+:2, -:1, *:0) => (3 - 2) * 3 = 1 * 3 = 3

The maximum result from these evaluations is 3, which will be the final output.
