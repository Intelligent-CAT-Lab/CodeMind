<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized to 10.
The code then enters a nested loop, with the outer loop iterating over the range 1 to 9 (inclusive) and the inner loop doing the same.
For each pair of numbers (i, j) from the two loops, it checks if their product equals N.
If a pair is found such that their product equals N, the code prints 'Yes' and exits the loop and the program immediately.
Since 10 is not a product of any two numbers in the range 1 to 9, the condition i*j == N will never be true.
After the loops finish without finding any such pair, the code prints 'No'.
<<<Output>>>
No
