<<<Analysis>>>
The variables X and Y are initialized to 3 and 20, respectively.
The variable count is initialized to 1, which will be used to count the number of times X can be doubled without exceeding Y.
The code enters a while loop that will continue until X is greater than Y.
Inside the loop, X is doubled (X *= 2).
After doubling, if X is greater than Y, the loop breaks.
Otherwise, count is incremented by 1 and the loop continues.
The doubling happens as follows:
- First iteration: X = 3 * 2 = 6 (count = 2)
- Second iteration: X = 6 * 2 = 12 (count = 3)
- Third iteration: X = 12 * 2 = 24 (count = 4)
Since 24 is greater than 20, the loop breaks.
The final value of count, which is 4, is printed.
