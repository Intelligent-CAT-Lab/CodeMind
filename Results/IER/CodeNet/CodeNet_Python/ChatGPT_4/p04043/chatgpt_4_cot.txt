<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a, b, and c are initialized to 5, 5, and 7, respectively, from the input.
The code then creates a list of these values and sorts it, resulting in the list [5, 5, 7].
The sorted list is compared to the list [5, 5, 7].
Since the sorted list matches the list [5, 5, 7], the condition is true.
Therefore, the code prints "YES".
<<<Output>>>
YES
