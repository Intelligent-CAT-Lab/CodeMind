<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 12.
The variable list_N is created by converting the integer n to a string and then to a list of its characters, resulting in ['1', '2'].
The variable num is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of the digits of n.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each character in list_N.
For each character i in list_N, it converts i to an integer and adds it to num. The sum of the digits (1 + 2) is 3.
The variable ans is initialized to "No".
The code checks if n is divisible by num (12 % 3 == 0). Since it is, ans is set to "Yes".
Finally, the code prints the value of ans, which is "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
