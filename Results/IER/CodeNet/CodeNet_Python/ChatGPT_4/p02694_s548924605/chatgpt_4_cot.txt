<<<Analysis>>>
The variable k is initialized to 103.
The variable now is initialized to 100, which represents the current value.
The variable cnt is initialized to 0, which will count the number of years.

The code enters a while loop that will continue to execute as long as now is less than k.
Inside the loop, now is increased by 1% (multiplied by 1.01).
After the increase, now is converted to an integer, which effectively truncates the decimal part.
The cnt variable is incremented by 1 to count the iteration.

The loop will run as follows:
1st iteration: now = 100 * 1.01 = 101.0, now becomes 101, cnt becomes 1.
2nd iteration: now = 101 * 1.01 = 102.01, now becomes 102, cnt becomes 2.
3rd iteration: now = 102 * 1.01 = 103.02, now becomes 103, cnt becomes 3.

After the 3rd iteration, now is equal to k, so the loop stops.

The code then prints the final value of cnt, which is 3.

3
