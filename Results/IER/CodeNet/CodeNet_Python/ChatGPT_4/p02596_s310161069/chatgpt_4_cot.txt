The variable K is initialized to 101.
The variable A is initialized to 7%101, which is 7.
The variable Flag is initialized to False, which will be used to indicate if a condition is met within the loop.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to K (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 101.
For each iteration T, the code checks if A is equal to 0. If A is 0, Flag is set to True and the loop breaks.
If A is not 0, A is updated to (10*A+7)%K and the loop continues to the next iteration.
The loop will continue until A becomes 0 or until T reaches K.
If Flag is True at the end of the loop, the value of T is printed; otherwise, '-1' is printed.
In this case, the loop will find that A is 0 when T is 4, because the sequence of A will be 7, 77, 777, 7777, and 7777 % 101 is 0.
Therefore, Flag becomes True and the loop breaks.
The final output will be the value of T when A becomes 0, which is 4.
