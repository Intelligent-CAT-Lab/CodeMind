<<<Analysis>>>
The input string "AtCoder Beginner Contest" is split into three variables A, x, and C, which are assigned the values "AtCoder", "Beginner", and "Contest" respectively.
The print statement concatenates the string "A" with the first character of the string in variable x, which is "B", and then concatenates the string "C".
Therefore, the output will be the string "ABC".
<<<Output>>>
ABC
