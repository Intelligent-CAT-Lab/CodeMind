<<<Analysis>>>
The variables P, Q, and R are initialized to 1, 3, and 4, respectively.
A list named res is created with the sums of the pairs of these variables: P+Q, P+R, and Q+R, resulting in the list [4, 5, 7].
The list res is then sorted in ascending order, resulting in [4, 5, 7].
The first element of the sorted list, which is the smallest sum, is printed. In this case, it is 4.
<<<Output>>>
4
