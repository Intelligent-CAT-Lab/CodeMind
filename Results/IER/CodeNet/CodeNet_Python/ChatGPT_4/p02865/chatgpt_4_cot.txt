<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 4.
The code calculates the integer division of (n-1) by 2, which is (4-1)//2 = 3//2.
The result of 3//2 is 1, because // is the floor division operator, which divides and then rounds down to the nearest whole number.
The code then prints the result of this calculation.
<<<Output>>>
