<<<Analysis>>>
The variable x is initialized with the input, which is 'A'.
The code then checks the value of x against several conditions:
- If x is 'A', it prints 'T'.
- If x is 'T', it prints 'A'.
- If x is 'G', it prints 'C'.
- If x is none of the above, it prints 'G'.
Since x is 'A', the first condition is met, and the code prints 'T'.
<<<Output>>>
T
