<<<Analysis>>>
The variables A, B, and N are initialized to 5, 7, and 4, respectively.
The code checks if N is greater than or equal to B. Since N (4) is less than B (7), it does not enter the if block and goes to the else block.
In the else block, x is set to the value of N, which is 4.
The code then calculates the value of ans using the formula ((A * x) // B) - (A * (x // B)).
Substituting the values, we get ans = ((5 * 4) // 7) - (5 * (4 // 7)).
Since 4 // 7 is 0, the second term becomes (5 * 0) which is 0.
The first term (5 * 4) // 7 is 20 // 7, which is 2 because the // operator performs integer division.
So, ans = 2 - 0, which is 2.
The code then prints the value of ans.
<<<Output>>>
2
