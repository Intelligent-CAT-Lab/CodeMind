The variable n is initialized to 12.
The function factorize is defined to factorize a given number n.
Inside the function, variable b is initialized to 2, and an empty list fct is created to store the factors.
The function enters a while loop that runs as long as b * b is less than or equal to n.
Inside this loop, another while loop checks if n is divisible by b. If it is, n is divided by b, and b is appended to the list fct.
After the inner loop, b is incremented by 1.
Once the outer loop is complete, if n is greater than 1, it means n is a prime number and is appended to the list fct.
The function returns the list fct.
The function factorize is called with the input 12, and the result is stored in variable x.
The list x is converted to a list of strings L.
The list L is joined into a string with spaces between the elements.
The formatted string with the original number n and its factors separated by spaces is printed.
For the input 12, the factors are 2, 2, and 3. Therefore, the output will be "12: 2 2 3".
<<<Output>>>
12: 2 2 3
