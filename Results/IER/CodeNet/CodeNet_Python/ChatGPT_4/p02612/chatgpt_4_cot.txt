<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 1900.
The code calculates the remainder of n divided by 1000, which is 1900 % 1000 = 900.
Since 900 is not equal to 0, the condition n%1000!=0 is True.
Therefore, the code will print 1000 - 900, which is 100.
If the remainder had been 0, the code would have printed 0.
<<<Output>>>
100
