The input N is initialized to -9.
The function main() checks if N is 0, which it is not, so it proceeds.
A set l is created to store unique powers of 2 that will be used to represent N in base -2.
The while loop will run until N becomes 0.
Since N is negative, it enters the else block and calls the minus function.
The minus function starts with n = 1 and keeps adding powers of 2 to p until p is less than or equal to N. It returns the value of n when the condition is met.
For N = -9, the first call to minus returns n = 3 because -2^3 = -8 is the largest power of -2 that is less than or equal to -9.
N is then increased by 2^3, resulting in N = -9 + 8 = -1.
The set l now contains {3}.
Since N is still negative, the loop continues and calls minus again.
This time, minus returns n = 1 because -2^1 = -2 is the largest power of -2 that is less than or equal to -1.
N is then increased by 2^1, resulting in N = -1 + 2 = 1.
The set l now contains {1, 3}.
Now N is positive, so the loop enters the if block and calls the plus function.
The plus function starts with n = 0 and keeps adding powers of 2 to p until p is greater than or equal to N. It returns the value of n when the condition is met.
For N = 1, the first call to plus returns n = 0 because 2^0 = 1 is the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to 1.
N is then decreased by 2^0, resulting in N = 1 - 1 = 0.
The set l now contains {0, 1, 3}.
The while loop ends because N is now 0.
The list s is created with a length of max(l)+1, which is 4.
The list s is filled with 0s, and then 1s are placed at the indices present in set l, resulting in s = [1, 1, 0, 1].
The list s is reversed, resulting in s = [1, 0, 1, 1].
The list s is joined into a string and returned, resulting in '1011'.
The output of the main function is printed, which is '1011'.
