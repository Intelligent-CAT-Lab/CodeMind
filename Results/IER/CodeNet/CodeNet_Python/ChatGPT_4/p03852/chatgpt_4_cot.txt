<<<Analysis>>>
The variable x is initialized with the input, which is the string 'a'.
The if statement checks if x is equal to any of the vowel characters 'a', 'i', 'u', 'e', or 'o'.
Since x is 'a', it matches the first condition.
Therefore, the code will execute the print statement under the if condition and print "vowel".
<<<Output>>>
vowel
