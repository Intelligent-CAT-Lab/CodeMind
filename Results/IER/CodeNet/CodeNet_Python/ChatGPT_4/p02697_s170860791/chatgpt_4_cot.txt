<<<Analysis>>>
The variables N and M are initialized to 4 and 1, respectively.
The code checks if N is even, which it is (4 % 2 == 0).
Since N is even, the code enters the first for loop, which iterates from 1 to (M+1)//2+1. Since M is 1, (M+1)//2+1 evaluates to 2.
In the first iteration of this loop, i is 1, and it prints the pair (1, N-i+1), which is (1, 4).
There is no second iteration because the loop range is from 1 to 2, and the loop condition is already satisfied.
The second for loop is supposed to iterate from 1 to M-(M+1)//2, which evaluates to 1-1=0. Therefore, this loop does not execute at all.
The output is just the pair (1, 4) from the first loop.
