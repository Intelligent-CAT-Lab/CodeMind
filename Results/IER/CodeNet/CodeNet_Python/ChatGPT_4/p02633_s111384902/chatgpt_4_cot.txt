<<<Analysis>>>
The variable x is initialized to 90.
The variable n is initialized to 1, which will be used to find the smallest integer such that 360 * n is divisible by x.
The code enters a while loop that continues as long as the remainder of 360 * n divided by x is not 0.
Since 360 is divisible by 90, the condition 360 * n % x != 0 is false on the first iteration (when n = 1).
The loop ends without incrementing n.
The code then prints the result of n * 360 // x, which is 1 * 360 // 90.
This integer division results in 4.
