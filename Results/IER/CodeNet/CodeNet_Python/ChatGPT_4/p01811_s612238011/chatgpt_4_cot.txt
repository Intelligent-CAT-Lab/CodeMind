<<<Analysis>>>
The input string is "ABC".
The function `solve` is called with the input string.
Since the length of the string is 3, it enters the first if condition.
It checks if the first character is 'A', the second is 'B', and the third is 'C', which is true for the input string.
Since the condition is met, the function returns True.
The main part of the code checks the return value of the `solve` function and prints "Yes" if it's True, otherwise it would print "No".
In this case, since the function returned True, the output will be "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
