<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized to 615.
The code uses the divmod function to divide N by 100 and get the quotient and remainder. The quotient q is 6 and the remainder mod is 15.
The code then checks if mod is less than or equal to q multiplied by 5. In this case, q * 5 is 30.
Since 15 is less than 30, the condition is true.
Therefore, the code prints 1 because the condition is met.
