<<<Analysis>>>
The input '3 5' is read and split into a list of integers [3, 5].
The first element (n[0]) is 3 and the second element (n[1]) is 5.
The code calculates the product of the first and second elements (3 * 5) and prints it, which is 15.
Then it calculates the sum of the first and second elements (3 + 5) and multiplies it by 2, which is (8 * 2) and prints it, which is 16.
The output is the product followed by the perimeter, separated by a space.
<<<Output>>>
