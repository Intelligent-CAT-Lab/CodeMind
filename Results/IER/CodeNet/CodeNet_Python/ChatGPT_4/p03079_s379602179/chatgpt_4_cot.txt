<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a, b, and c are initialized to 2, 2, and 2, respectively, from the input.
The if condition checks if a, b, and c are all equal to each other.
Since all three variables are equal (2 == 2 == 2), the condition is True.
Therefore, the code will execute the print statement within the if block.
The output will be "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
