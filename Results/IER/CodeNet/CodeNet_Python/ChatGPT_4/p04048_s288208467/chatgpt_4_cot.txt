The variables N and X are initialized to 5 and 2, respectively.
The function F(x, y) is defined to calculate the distance to reach the diagonal in a parallelogram with sides x and y.
The function F is recursive and swaps x and y if x is greater than y to ensure x is always the smaller value.
It then uses divmod to divide y by x, getting the quotient q and the remainder r.
If r is 0, it means y is a multiple of x, and the distance is calculated as (2*q-1)*x.
If r is not 0, the function calls itself with x and y%x, adding 2*q*x to the result.
The answer is calculated by adding N to the result of F(X, N-X), which is F(2, 3) in this case.
The recursive calls proceed as follows:
F(2, 3) -> 2*1*2 + F(2, 3%2) -> 4 + F(2, 1)
F(2, 1) -> 2*0*1 + F(1, 2%1) -> 0 + F(1, 0)
F(1, 0) -> (2*0-1)*1 -> -1 (but since the function does not handle the case when y is 0, this step is not actually reached)
The recursion stops at F(2, 1) because the next call would be F(1, 0), which is not handled by the function. So, the result of F(2, 1) is 0.
Thus, F(2, 3) is 4 + 0 = 4.
The final answer is N + F(X, N-X) = 5 + 4 = 9.
