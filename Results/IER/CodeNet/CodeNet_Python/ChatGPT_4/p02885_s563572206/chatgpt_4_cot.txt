<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a and b are initialized with the values 12 and 4, respectively, from the input.
The variable c is calculated as b+b, which is 4+4=8.
The if condition checks if a-c is not equal to 0 and if a-c is greater than or equal to 0.
Since a-c is 12-8=4, which is not equal to 0 and is greater than 0, the condition is true.
Therefore, the code prints the value of a-c, which is 4.
<<<Output>>>
4
