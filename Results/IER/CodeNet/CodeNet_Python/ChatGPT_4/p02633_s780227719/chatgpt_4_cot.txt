<<<Analysis>>>
The variable X is initialized to 90.
The code imports the math module, which provides access to mathematical functions.
The code calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of 360 and X (which is 90) using math.gcd(360, X). The gcd of 360 and 90 is 90.
The code then calculates the quotient of 360 divided by the gcd of 360 and X, which is 360 // 90. This results in 4.
The variable ans is set to this quotient, which is 4.
Finally, the code prints the value of ans, which is 4.
<<<Output>>>
4
