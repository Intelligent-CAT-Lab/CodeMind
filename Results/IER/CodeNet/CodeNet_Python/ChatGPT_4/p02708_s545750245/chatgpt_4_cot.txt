<<<Analysis>>>
The variables n and k are initialized to 3 and 2, respectively.
The variable tot is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the total sum.

The code then enters a loop that iterates from k to n+1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider the numbers 2 and 3 in this case.

For each number i in this range, the code calculates a partial sum using the formula:
n+2-i+(i-1)*(n+1-i)
This formula calculates the number of ways to choose a contiguous subsequence of length i from an array of length n.

When i is 2, the partial sum is:
3+2-2+(2-1)*(3+1-2) = 3+1*(2) = 5

When i is 3, the partial sum is:
3+2-3+(3-1)*(3+1-3) = 2+2*(1) = 4

The total sum (tot) is the sum of these partial sums, which is 5 + 4 = 9.

Finally, the code prints the total sum modulo 1000000007, which is 9 % 1000000007 = 9.

<<<Output>>>
9
