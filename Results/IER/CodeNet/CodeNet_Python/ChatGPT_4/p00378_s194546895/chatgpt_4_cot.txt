The variables a, b, and x are initialized to 180, 100, and 2400, respectively.
The variable c is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the cost.

The code enters a while loop that continues as long as x is greater than 0.

In each iteration of the loop, the code checks if x is greater than 500.

If x is greater than 500, which is true for the first two iterations (since x starts at 2400 and is reduced by 1000 in each iteration), the code checks if a is less than 2*b. Since a (180) is not less than 2*b (200), it adds 2*b (200) to c and subtracts 1000 from x.

After two iterations, x is reduced to 400 (2400 - 1000 - 1000), and c is increased to 400 (0 + 200 + 200).

Now, since x is not greater than 500, the code checks if b is less than a. Since b (100) is less than a (180), it adds b (100) to c and subtracts 500 from x.

However, since x is now 400, it cannot be reduced by 500 without going negative, so the loop ends.

The final value of c, which is 500 (400 + 100), is printed.
