<<<Analysis>>>
The input N is initialized to 18.
The function make_divisors is called with N=18, which finds all divisors of 18 and returns them in sorted order. The divisors of 18 are [1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18].
The variable max_times is set to the length of the divisors list minus 1, which is 5.
The variable min_times is initialized to 0.
The variable result is initialized to an empty list.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the divisors list in reverse order, excluding the last element (18 in this case), so it considers [9, 6, 3, 2, 1].
For each divisor i in this reversed list:
- If i is already in the result list, it continues to the next iteration.
- Otherwise, it extends the result list with the divisors of i and increments min_times by 1.
The divisors of 9 are [1, 3, 9], so result becomes [1, 3, 9] and min_times becomes 1.
The divisors of 6 are [1, 2, 3, 6], but since 1 and 3 are already in the result list, only 2 and 6 are added, making result [1, 3, 9, 2, 6] and min_times becomes 2.
The divisors of 3 are [1, 3], but both are already in the result list, so nothing is added and min_times remains 2.
The divisors of 2 are [1, 2], but 1 is already in the result list, so only 2 is added, but 2 is already in the result list as well, so nothing is added and min_times remains 2.
The divisors of 1 are [1], but 1 is already in the result list, so nothing is added and min_times remains 2.
Finally, the code prints the values of min_times and max_times, which are 2 and 5, respectively.
