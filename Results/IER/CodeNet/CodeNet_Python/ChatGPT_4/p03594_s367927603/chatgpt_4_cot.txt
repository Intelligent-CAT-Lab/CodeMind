<<<Analysis>>>
The variables H, W, and d are initialized to 2, 2, and 1, respectively.
The code checks if d is odd by calculating d%2, which is 1 in this case, meaning d is odd.
Since d is odd, the code enters the first branch of the if statement.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the range of H, which is 2, meaning it will consider two rows.
For each row i, it prints a line where each character is determined by the parity of the sum of the row index i and the column index j.
If (i+j)%2 is 0, it prints "R", otherwise it prints "Y".
The pattern will alternate between "R" and "Y" for each cell, starting with "R" in the top-left corner because (0+0)%2 is 0.
The output will be two lines, each with an alternating pattern of "R" and "Y".
