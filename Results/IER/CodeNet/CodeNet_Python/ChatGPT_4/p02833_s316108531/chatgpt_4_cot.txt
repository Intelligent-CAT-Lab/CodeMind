<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 12.
The code first checks if n is odd by checking if n modulo 2 equals 1. Since 12 is even, it does not print 0 and proceeds to the else block.
In the else block, variable i is initialized to 1 and variable cnt is initialized to 0.
The code enters a while loop that continues as long as n1 is not equal to 0.
Inside the loop, n1 is reset to the value of n, which is 12.
Then, n1 is divided by 2*(5^i). In the first iteration, i is 1, so n1 is divided by 2*5, which is 10. The result is 12 // 10, which equals 1. cnt is incremented by 1.
i is incremented to 2, and the loop continues.
In the second iteration, n1 is divided by 2*(5^2), which is 50. The result is 12 // 50, which equals 0. cnt remains 1.
Since n1 is now 0, the loop ends.
The code prints the final value of cnt, which is 1.
