<<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized with the string 'apple'.
The code checks if the last character of s is 's' using s[-1]=='s'.
Since the last character of 'apple' is not 's', the condition is False.
Therefore, the code executes the else block and prints the string 'apple' concatenated with 's'.
<<<Output>>>
apples
