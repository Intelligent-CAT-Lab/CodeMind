<<<Analysis>>>
The variables N, M, A, and B are initialized to 3, 4, 4, and 2, respectively.
A 2D list `ans` is created with N rows and M columns, filled with '.' characters.

Since M is even (M % 2 == 0), the first if block is skipped.

Since N is odd (N % 2 == 1), the second if block is executed. It iterates over the last row of `ans` from the second-to-last column to the first column, stepping by -2. For each pair of columns, if A > 0, it decrements A by 1 and sets the characters at those positions to '<' and '>', respectively. This results in the last row of `ans` being updated to ['<', '>', '<', '>'] and A being decremented to 2.

The flag is set to False because the condition `2 * (A + B) == (N / 2) * (M / 2) * 4 and (N % 2) == (M % 2) == (A % 2) == 1` is not met.

The for loop iterates over the rows in reverse order, skipping the last row (since N is odd) and the columns in pairs. Since A is 2, the first elif block is executed, which decrements A by 2 and sets the characters in a 2x2 block to '<', '<', '>', '>'. This is done for the first two columns of the first row. A is now 0.

Since B is 2, the last elif block is executed, which decrements B by 2 and sets the characters in a 2x2 block to '^', 'v', '^', 'v'. This is done for the first two columns of the second row. B is now 0.

The flag is not True, so the if block for the flag is skipped.

Since A and B are both 0, the program does not print "NO" and does not exit.

The program prints "YES" and then prints the `ans` 2D list row by row, joining each row's characters into a string.

The final `ans` 2D list looks like this:
[['<', '<', '>', '>'],
 ['^', 'v', '^', 'v'],
 ['<', '>', '<', '>']]

The output will be the word "YES" followed by the strings representing each row of the `ans` 2D list.
