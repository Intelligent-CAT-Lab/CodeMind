The variable l is initialized to 4.
The variable d is determined by finding the maximum d for which 2^d is less than or equal to l. In this case, d is 2 because 2^2 = 4 and 2^3 = 8, which is greater than l.
The variable n is set to d + 1, which is 3.
The variable m is set to 2 * d, which is 4.
The list ans is initialized to store tuples representing edges in a graph.

The code enters a loop to add edges to the ans list. It adds two edges for each i from 1 to n-1. The edges are (i, i+1, 0) and (i, i+1, 2^(i-1)). For i=1 and i=2, the edges added are (1, 2, 0), (1, 2, 1), (2, 3, 0), and (2, 3, 2).

The code then enters a while loop that continues as long as l is greater than 2^d. Since l is equal to 2^d, the loop is not executed.

Finally, the code prints n and m, which are 3 and 4, respectively, and then prints each tuple in the ans list.
