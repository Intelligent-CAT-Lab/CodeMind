<<<Analysis>>>
The input `1` initializes the variable `n` to 1.
The points `p1` and `p2` are initialized to [0,0] and [100,0], respectively.
The function `f` is a recursive function that performs operations to calculate points that form a fractal pattern known as the Koch curve.

The first print statement prints the initial point `p1`, which is (0,0).
The function `f` is then called with `n`, `p1`, and `p2`.

Inside the function `f`, when `n` is 1 (the base case is when `n` is 0, so it continues):
- It calculates point `s` as the point 1/3 of the way from `p1` to `p2`.
- It calculates point `t` as the point 2/3 of the way from `p1` to `p2`.
- It calculates point `u` using the points `s` and `t` and applying a rotation to create the peak of the Koch curve.

The function then makes recursive calls to itself with decremented `n` (n-1), and the new points calculated, which will not print anything because the base case will be reached (n == 0).

After each recursive call, it prints the points `s`, `u`, and `t` in that order.

Finally, after the recursive calls and prints, the last print statement prints the final point `p2`, which is (100,0).

The output will be the coordinates of the points that form the first iteration of the Koch curve, starting from (0,0) to (100,0).
