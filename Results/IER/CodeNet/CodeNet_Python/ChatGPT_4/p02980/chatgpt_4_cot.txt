<<<Analysis>>>
The variables N and M are initialized to 1 and 2, respectively.
The variable mod is set to 998244353, which is a prime number often used for modulo operations in competitive programming.

Since N is not greater than M, the swapping of N and M does not occur.

Arrays fact, powm, and pown are initialized with M+1 zeros and their first element is set to 1.

The loop calculates the factorial of numbers from 1 to M, and also calculates (M+1)^i and (N+1)^i for i from 1 to M, all modulo mod.

The pow function is a custom implementation of the exponentiation by squaring algorithm, which calculates n^m modulo mod.

The inv_fact array is calculated by first finding the modular inverse of fact[M] using the pow function with exponent mod-2 (based on Fermat's little theorem), and then calculating the modular inverse of the factorials in reverse order.

The C function calculates the binomial coefficient C(n, r) modulo mod using the precomputed factorials and their inverses.

The variable ans is initialized to 0.

The loop calculates the sum of the series given by the problem statement, which involves alternating signs, binomial coefficients, factorials, and powers, all modulo mod.

The final answer is printed, which is the value of ans modulo mod after the loop.

Given the input `1 2`, the loop will run for i from 0 to 1 (inclusive). The calculations will be as follows:

For i = 0:
ans += (-1)^0 * C(1, 0) * C(2, 0) * fact[0] * powm[1 - 0] * pown[2 - 0]
ans += 1 * 1 * 1 * 1 * (2 + 1) * (1 + 1)
ans += 1 * 1 * 1 * 1 * 3 * 2
ans += 6

For i = 1:
ans += (-1)^1 * C(1, 1) * C(2, 1) * fact[1] * powm[1 - 1] * pown[2 - 1]
ans += -1 * 1 * 2 * 1 * 1 * (1 + 1)
ans += -1 * 1 * 2 * 1 * 1 * 2
ans += -4

ans = 6 - 4
ans = 2

The final answer is 2 modulo 998244353, which is still 2 since 2 is less than 998244353.
