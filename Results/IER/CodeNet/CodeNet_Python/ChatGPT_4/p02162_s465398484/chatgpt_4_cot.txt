<<<Analysis>>>
The variables T1, T2, R1, and R2 are initialized to 9, 8, 1000, and 999, respectively.
The code first checks if either R1 or R2 is -1. Since neither is -1, it skips the first if block.
Next, it compares R1 and R2. Since R1 (1000) is greater than R2 (999), the condition R1 > R2 is true.
As a result, the code prints "Alice" because Alice has a higher rating (R1) than Bob (R2).
<<<Output>>>
Alice
