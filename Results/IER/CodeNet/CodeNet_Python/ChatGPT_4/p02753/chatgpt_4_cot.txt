<<<Analysis>>>
The variable S is initialized to the string 'ABA'.
The code checks if S is equal to 'AAA' or 'BBB'. Since S is 'ABA', it does not match either 'AAA' or 'BBB'.
Therefore, the condition is False, and the code proceeds to the else block.
The else block contains a print statement that outputs 'Yes'.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
