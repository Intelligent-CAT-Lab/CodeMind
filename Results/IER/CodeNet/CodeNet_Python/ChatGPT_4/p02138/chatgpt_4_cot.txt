<<<Analysis>>>
The input is `20 10`, so N is initialized to 20 and M to 10.

The code defines two scenarios, each with a while loop, and calculates the number of iterations (ans1 and ans2) it takes to reach a break condition in each scenario. The final output is the minimum of ans1 and ans2.

In the first scenario:
- n2 and n1 are both set to N (20).
- m1 is set to M (10).
- mall is set to M * 2 (20).
- ans1 starts at 0.

The loop runs as follows:
1. mall is reduced by n1 (20), resulting in mall being 0.
2. m1 is recalculated as the ceiling of mall/2, which remains 0.
3. The loop breaks because mall is less than or equal to 0.
4. ans1 is still 0 at the end of the loop.

In the second scenario:
- n2 and n1 are both set to N (20).
- m1 and m2 are both set to M (10).
- mall is set to M * 2 (20).
- nall is set to N * 2 (40).
- ans2 starts at 0.

The loop runs as follows:
1. m2 (10) is reduced by n1 (20), resulting in m2 being 0 and m1 being recalculated to m1 + m2 - n1, which is 0.
2. The loop breaks because m1 is less than or equal to 0.
3. ans2 is still 0 at the end of the loop.

Both scenarios end with ans1 and ans2 being 0, so the final output is the minimum of ans1 and ans2, which is 0.
