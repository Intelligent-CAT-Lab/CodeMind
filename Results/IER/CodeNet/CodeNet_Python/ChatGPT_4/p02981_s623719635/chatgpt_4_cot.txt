<<<Analysis>>>
The variables N, A, and B are initialized to 4, 2, and 9, respectively.
The code then checks if the product of N and A is greater than B.
The product of N and A is 4 * 2, which equals 8.
Since 8 is not greater than 9, the condition (N * A > B) is False.
Therefore, the else block will execute, and the code will print N * A.
N * A is 8, so the output will be 8.
<<<Output>>>
8
