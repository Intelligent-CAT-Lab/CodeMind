<<<Analysis>>>
The variables x and y are initialized with the input values '3' and '2', respectively.
The variable N is then set to the integer value of x, which is 3.
The variable K is set to the integer value of y, which is 2.
The code checks if K is equal to 1. Since K is 2, the condition is false.
The else block is executed, printing the result of N-K, which is 3-2.
The output will be the result of this subtraction, which is 1.
