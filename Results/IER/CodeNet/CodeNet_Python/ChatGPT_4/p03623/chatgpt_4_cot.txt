<<<Analysis>>>
The variables x, a, and b are initialized to 5, 2, and 7, respectively.
The code then compares the absolute difference between x and a with the absolute difference between x and b.
The absolute difference between x and a is abs(5-2) which is 3.
The absolute difference between x and b is abs(5-7) which is 2.
Since the absolute difference between x and a (3) is greater than the absolute difference between x and b (2), the condition abs(x-a) < abs(x-b) is false.
Therefore, the code will print 'B' because the else part of the conditional statement is executed.
<<<Output>>>
B
