<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 4.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers.
The list lst is initialized as an empty list, which will store the sequence of numbers.

The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 4.
For each number i in this range, it adds i to ans and appends i to lst.
The loop breaks when ans is greater than or equal to n. In this case, the loop will break when i is 3 because ans will be 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, which is greater than n (4).

After the loop, the code calculates num as ans - n, which is 6 - 4 = 2.
Since num is not 0, the code removes the value of num (which is 2) from lst.

The final list lst contains [1, 3].
The code then prints each element in lst on a separate line.
