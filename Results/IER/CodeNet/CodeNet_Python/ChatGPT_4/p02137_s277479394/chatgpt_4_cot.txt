<<<Analysis>>>
The variable p is initialized to 5700.
The variable sum is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of certain denominations of money.

The code checks if p is greater than or equal to 10000. Since 5700 is not, it skips this block.

Next, the code checks if p is greater than or equal to 5000. Since 5700 is, it adds the largest multiple of 5000 to sum, which is 5000, and then subtracts this value from p. So sum becomes 5000 and p becomes 700.

The code then checks if p is greater than or equal to 1000. Since 700 is not, it skips this block.

Finally, the code checks if p is greater than or equal to 500. Since 700 is, it adds the largest multiple of 500 to sum, which is 500, and then subtracts this value from p. So sum becomes 5000 + 500 = 5500 and p becomes 700 - 500 = 200.

The code prints the final value of sum, which is 5500.

<<<Output>>>
5500
