The function `solve()` is called.
The variable L is initialized with the string "KUPCkupcKUPC".
The `data` list is created and will store the counts of the characters "K", "U", "P", and "C" in the string L.
`L.count("K")` will count the number of "K" characters in L, which is 3.
`L.count("U")` will count the number of "U" characters in L, which is 3.
`L.count("P")` will count the number of "P" characters in L, which is 3.
`L.count("C")` will count the number of "C" characters in L, which is 3.
The `data` list now contains [3, 3, 3, 3].
The `min(data)` function is called to find the minimum value in the `data` list, which is 3.
The program prints the minimum value found, which is 3.
