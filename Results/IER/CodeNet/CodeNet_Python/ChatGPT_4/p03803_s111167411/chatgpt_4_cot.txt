<<<Analysis>>>
The variables A and B are initialized to 8 and 6, respectively.
The code checks if A is equal to 1, which it is not, so A remains 8.
The code checks if B is equal to 1, which it is not, so B remains 6.
The code then compares A and B. Since A (8) is greater than B (6), the code will execute the first condition and print 'Alice'.
<<<Output>>>
Alice
