<<<Analysis>>>
The variables A, B, C, D, E, and F are initialized to the integers 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15, respectively. However, these variables are not used in the comparison that follows.

The input is taken as two strings, N and M, which are 'A' and 'B' in this case.

The if-elif-else statement compares the strings 'A' and 'B'. Since 'A' comes before 'B' in lexicographical order, the condition N > M is False.

The next condition N == M is also False because 'A' is not equal to 'B'.

The else condition is executed because both the if and elif conditions were False.

Therefore, the output will be "<" since 'A' is lexicographically less than 'B'.
