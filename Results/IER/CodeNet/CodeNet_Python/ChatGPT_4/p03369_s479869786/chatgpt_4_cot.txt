<<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized to the string 'oxo'.
The variable ans is initialized to 700, which is the base value.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each character in the string 'oxo'.
For each character, it checks if the character is 'o'.
If the character is 'o', it adds 100 to ans. In the string 'oxo', there are two 'o's, so 200 will be added to the base value of 700.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 900.
<<<Output>>>
900
