<<<Analysis>>>
The variables K and N are initialized to 2 and 900, respectively.
The code then checks if 500 times K is greater than or equal to N.
In this case, 500 * 2 equals 1000, which is indeed greater than 900.
Since the condition is true, the code will execute the print statement within the if block.
Therefore, the output will be "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
