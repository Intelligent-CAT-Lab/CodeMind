<<<Analysis>>>
The input string 'ABA' is converted into a list and stored in the variable s.
The list s contains the elements ['A', 'B', 'A'].
The if condition checks if the first, second, and third elements of the list s are all the same.
In this case, the first and third elements are 'A', but the second element is 'B', so the condition is not met.
Since the if condition is not met, the else block is executed.
The code prints "Yes" because not all elements in the list are the same.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
