<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a, b, and c are initialized to 5, 7, and 9, respectively, from the input.
The code then checks if the sum of a, b, and c is less than 22.
The sum of a, b, and c is 5 + 7 + 9 = 21, which is less than 22.
Since the condition a+b+c<22 is true, the code will print 'win'.
<<<Output>>>
win
