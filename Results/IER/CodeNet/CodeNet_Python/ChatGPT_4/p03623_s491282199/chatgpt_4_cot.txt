<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a, b, and c are initialized to 5, 2, and 7, respectively.
The code then checks if the absolute difference between a and b is less than the absolute difference between c and a.
The absolute difference between a and b is |5 - 2| = 3.
The absolute difference between c and a is |7 - 5| = 2.
Since 3 is not less than 2, the condition is false.
Therefore, the code will execute the else block and print 'B'.
<<<Output>>>
B
