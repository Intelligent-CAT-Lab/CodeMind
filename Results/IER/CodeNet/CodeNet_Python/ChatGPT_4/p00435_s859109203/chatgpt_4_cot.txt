<<<Analysis>>>
The variable S is initialized to the string 'MRL'.
An empty list A is created.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the length of S, which is 3 in this case.
For each character in S, it calculates a new character by:
- Subtracting 65 from the ASCII value of the character to get a 0-based alphabet index.
- Subtracting 3 from this index to perform a Caesar cipher shift.
- Taking the result modulo 26 to ensure it wraps around the alphabet if necessary.
- Adding 65 to the result to get the ASCII value of the shifted character.
- Appending the new character to the list A.
The characters 'M', 'R', and 'L' have ASCII values of 77, 82, and 76, respectively.
After applying the transformation:
- 'M' (77) becomes 'J' (74): (77 - 65 - 3) % 26 + 65 = 74
- 'R' (82) becomes 'O' (79): (82 - 65 - 3) % 26 + 65 = 79
- 'L' (76) becomes 'I' (73): (76 - 65 - 3) % 26 + 65 = 73
The list A now contains ['J', 'O', 'I'].
The code then prints the characters in A without spaces, resulting in the string 'JOI'.
<<<Output>>>
JOI
