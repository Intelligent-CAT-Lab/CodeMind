<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 1900.
The code checks if n is divisible by 1000. In this case, 1900 is not divisible by 1000 because it leaves a remainder of 900.
Since n is not divisible by 1000, the code executes the else block.
The else block calculates 1000 minus the remainder of n divided by 1000, which is 1000 - 900.
The result of this calculation is 100, which is then printed.
<<<Output>>>
100
