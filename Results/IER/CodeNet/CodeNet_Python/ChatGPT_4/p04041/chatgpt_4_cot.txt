The variables N, X, Y, and Z are initialized to 3, 5, 7, and 5, respectively.
The variable m is calculated as 2^(X+Y+Z) which is 2^(5+7+5) = 2^17.
An array S of size m is initialized with all elements set to 0. S will be used to store the number of sequences that do not contain the pattern XYZ.

The variable L is set to the maximum of X, Y, and Z, which is 7.

Three sets of bits, Z0, Y0, and X0, are created to represent the positions where Z, Y, and X start, respectively.

A set ss is created to store the sequences where XYZ pattern is found.

The MASK is calculated as 2^(X+Y+Z)-1 which is used to keep the sequence within the range of m bits.

The MOD is set to 10^9 + 7 for modulo operations.

The first element of S is set to 1, representing the empty sequence.

A loop starts that will iterate N times, representing the length of the sequence being built.

Inside this loop, a temporary array T is created to store the new counts of sequences after adding another digit.

For each possible sequence s, if s is in ss (contains the XYZ pattern), it is skipped.

Otherwise, the code tries to add a new digit to the sequence by shifting s left by 1 and adding 1 (representing adding a '1' to the sequence).

For each possible length of the new digit (from 1 to L), the code calculates the new sequence t and updates T[t] with the count from S[s].

For lengths greater than L and up to 10, the code updates T[0] with the count from S[s].

After the loop, S is updated with the values from T.

After building all sequences of length N, the code calculates the final answer by summing the counts of all sequences that do not contain the XYZ pattern.

Finally, the code calculates the total number of sequences of length N (10^N) and subtracts the count of sequences containing the XYZ pattern to get the answer.

The answer is then printed after taking the modulo with MOD.

Given the input `3 5 7 5`, the code will calculate the number of sequences of length 3 that do not contain the pattern '11111', '1111111', and '11111' consecutively.

The output will be the result of these calculations.
