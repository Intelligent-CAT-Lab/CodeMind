<<<Analysis>>>
The input string 'atcoderregularcontest' is converted into a list of characters and stored in variable s.
An empty list s2 is created to store characters from s.
The code loops through each character in s and appends it to s2.
A new list s3 is created from the set of s2, which removes any duplicate characters and then sorted alphabetically.
A list s4 is created containing all lowercase letters of the English alphabet.
The code checks if s3 is equal to s4. If they are equal, it means all letters are present, and it prints 'None'.
Since s3 is not equal to s4, the code enters another loop to find the first missing letter from s3 when compared to s4.
The loop iterates through s3 and compares each character with the corresponding character in s4.
When it finds a character in s4 that is not in the same position in s3, it prints that character and breaks the loop.
If it reaches the end of s3 without finding a mismatch, it prints the next character in s4.
In this case, the missing letter is 'b', which is the first letter that does not match between s3 and s4.
<<<Output>>>
b
