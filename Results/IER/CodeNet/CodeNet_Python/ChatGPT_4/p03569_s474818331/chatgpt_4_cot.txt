The input string is 'xabxa'.
The string is converted into a list of characters and its length is stored in n, which is 5.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of operations needed to make the string a palindrome by inserting 'x'.
Two pointers, l and r, are initialized to the start and end of the string, respectively (0 and 4).

The while loop will run as long as l < r, meaning it will check the characters from both ends moving towards the center.

1. In the first iteration, s[l] is 'x' and s[r] is 'a'. Since s[l] is 'x', l is incremented by 1 and ans is incremented by 1.
2. In the second iteration, s[l] is now 'a' and s[r] is 'b'. Since they are not equal and neither is 'x', the function prints -1 and exits.

The loop does not continue after this because the condition for a palindrome is not met and the function exits with -1.

<<<Output>>>
-1
