The input x is initialized to 30.
The function contains3 checks if the number n contains the digit 3 at any place.
The variable out is initialized to an empty string, which will be used to accumulate the output string.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to x-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 30.
For each number i in this range, it increments i by 1 to get the actual number n.
It then checks if n is divisible by 3 or if it contains the digit 3 by calling the contains3 function.
If either condition is true, it appends the number n to the string out with a leading space.
The numbers that meet the condition are: 3, 6, 9, 12, 13, 15, 18, 21, 23, 24, 27, and 30.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of out, which is a string of numbers separated by spaces.
<<<Output>>>
 3 6 9 12 13 15 18 21 23 24 27 30
