<<<Analysis>>>
The input string 'abac' is converted into a list of characters ['a', 'b', 'a', 'c'].
A Counter object is created from the list, which counts the occurrences of each character in the list.
The Counter object 'c' will look like Counter({'a': 2, 'b': 1, 'c': 1}).
A new list 'c' is created containing the counts of 'a', 'b', and 'c' from the Counter object, which will be [2, 1, 1].
The code then checks if the difference between the maximum and minimum counts in the list 'c' is less than 2.
In this case, max(c) is 2 and min(c) is 1, so max(c) - min(c) is 1, which is less than 2.
Since the condition is true, the code prints "YES".
<<<Output>>>
YES
