<<<Analysis>>>
The variable K is initialized to 101.
The code checks if K is divisible by 7, which it is not (101 % 7 is not 0), so it sets L to 9 * K, which is 909.
The variable ans is initialized to -1, which will be used to store the answer.
The variable n is initialized to 10, which will be used in the loop to find the remainder when divided by L.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to L-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 908.
For each iteration i, it calculates the remainder of n divided by L (surplus).
If surplus is equal to 1, it sets ans to the current iteration number i and breaks out of the loop.
The loop starts with n = 10, and in each iteration, n is updated to 10 * surplus.
The loop will continue until it finds an i such that 10^i % L == 1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans.
The loop will find that when i is 4, 10^4 % 909 == 1, so ans will be set to 4 and the loop will break.
