<<<Analysis>>>
The input string S is initialized to 'abac'.
A dictionary s_frq_dict is created to keep track of the frequency of 'a', 'b', and 'c' in the string.
The code iterates over each character in the string 'abac' and increments the corresponding value in the dictionary.
After the loop, the dictionary s_frq_dict will have the following values: {'a': 2, 'b': 1, 'c': 1}.
The frequencies of 'a', 'b', and 'c' are then stored in a list frqs, which will be [2, 1, 1].
The maximum frequency is 2 and the minimum frequency is 1, so max(frqs) - min(frqs) is 1.
Since 1 is less than or equal to 1, the condition is satisfied and the code will print 'YES'.
<<<Output>>>
YES
