<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 2.
The expression `(n+1) &- (n+1)` is evaluated as follows:
1. `n+1` is calculated, which is `2+1` resulting in `3`.
2. The bitwise AND operation is performed between `3` and the negation of `3` (`-3`).
3. In binary, `3` is `0b11` and `-3` is the two's complement of `3`, which is `0b...11111101` (infinite series of 1s followed by 01 in binary).
4. The bitwise AND operation of `0b11` and `0b...11111101` results in `0b01`, which is `1` in decimal.
5. Therefore, the output of the code is `1`.
