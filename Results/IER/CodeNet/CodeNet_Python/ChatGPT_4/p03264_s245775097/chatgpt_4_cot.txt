<<<Analysis>>>
The variable K is initialized to 3.
The expression (K // 2 + K % 2) calculates the integer division of K by 2 and adds the remainder of the division of K by 2. For K = 3, this results in (3 // 2 + 3 % 2) which is (1 + 1) = 2.
The expression (K // 2) calculates the integer division of K by 2. For K = 3, this results in (3 // 2) which is 1.
The two expressions are then multiplied: 2 * 1, which equals 2.
The code prints the result of this multiplication.
<<<Output>>>
2
