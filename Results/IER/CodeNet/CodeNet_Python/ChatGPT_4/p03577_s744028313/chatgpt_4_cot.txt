<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string and prints it after removing the last 8 characters. The input function reads the string `CODEFESTIVAL`. The slicing operation `[:-8]` removes the last 8 characters from the string. Therefore, the output will be the first part of the string `CODEFESTIVAL` without the last 8 characters, which is `CODE`.
