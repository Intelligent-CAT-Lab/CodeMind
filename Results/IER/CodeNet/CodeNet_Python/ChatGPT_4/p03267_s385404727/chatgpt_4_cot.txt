The input L is read from stdin and is set to 4.

The main function is defined and then called if the script is run as the main program.

Inside the main function:
- The variable n is calculated as the floor of log2(L) + 1, which is floor(log2(4)) + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3.
- The variable m is calculated as 2 * (n - 1), which is 2 * (3 - 1) = 4.
- An empty list called edges is created to store the edges of the graph.

A loop is run for i from 1 to n-1 (i.e., 1 to 2):
- Two edges are added to the edges list for each i: (i, i+1, 0) and (i, i+1, 2**(i-1)).
  For i = 1, the edges (1, 2, 0) and (1, 2, 1) are added.
  For i = 2, the edges (2, 3, 0) and (2, 3, 2) are added.

The variable cur is set to 2 ** (n - 1), which is 2 ** (3 - 1) = 4.

The variable q is set to L - cur, which is 4 - 4 = 0.

A loop is run for i from 1 to n (i.e., 1 to 3):
- q is divided by 2 using divmod, which gives the quotient and remainder.
- Since q is 0 from the start, the remainder r will always be 0, and the loop will continue without adding any additional edges.

The function yields a tuple (n, m), which is (3, 4).

The function then yields each edge in the edges list.

The output is printed by iterating over the generator returned by main() and printing each item separated by spaces.

The expected output will be:
3 4
1 2 0
1 2 1
2 3 0
2 3 2
