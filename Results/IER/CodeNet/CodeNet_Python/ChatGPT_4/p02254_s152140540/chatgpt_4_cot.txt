<<<Analysis>>>
The input string `S` is "abca".
The `HuffmanCoding` class is initialized with the string "abca".
The `Counter` class is used to count the occurrences of each character in the string, resulting in a dictionary with counts: {'a': 2, 'b': 1, 'c': 1}.
The `build_tree` method creates a Huffman tree for the characters based on their frequencies:
- A min-heap is created with nodes for each character and its count.
- The two nodes with the smallest counts are repeatedly popped from the heap, combined into a new node with their counts summed, and pushed back into the heap until only one node remains, which is the root of the Huffman tree.

The Huffman tree built from "abca" would look something like this:
```
    *
   / \
  a   *
     / \
    b   c
```
The `gen_encode_table` method generates a table for encoding each character based on the Huffman tree:
- It traverses the tree and assigns a binary string to each character, where going left adds a "1" and going right adds a "0" to the string.
- Since 'a' is the most frequent character, it will have the shortest code. In this case, 'a' could be "0", 'b' could be "10", and 'c' could be "11".

The `get_encode_size` method calculates the total length of the encoded string:
- It iterates over each character in the original string and sums the lengths of their encoded binary strings.
- For "abca", the encoded size would be the sum of the lengths of the codes for 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'a' again.

Assuming the encoding is as follows:
- 'a' -> "0"
- 'b' -> "10"
- 'c' -> "11"

The encoded string would be "01011", and the size would be 5.
