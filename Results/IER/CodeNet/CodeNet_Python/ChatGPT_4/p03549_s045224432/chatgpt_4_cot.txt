<<<Analysis>>>
The variables N and M are initialized to 1 and 1, respectively.
The code calculates the expression ((N-M)*100+M*1900)*2**M.
Since N and M are both 1, the expression simplifies to:
((1-1)*100+1*1900)*2**1
Which further simplifies to:
(0*100+1900)*2
And then to:
1900*2
Finally, the result is:
3800
The code then prints this result.
<<<Output>>>
3800
