<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized to 3.
The code checks if N is even, which it is not, so it proceeds to the else block.
In the else block, it initializes an empty list called edge.
It then enters a nested loop where s ranges from 1 to N (inclusive) and t ranges from 1 to N (inclusive).
For each pair (s, t), it calculates ng as N - s.
It then checks if s is greater than or equal to t or if t is equal to ng. If either condition is true, it continues to the next iteration without doing anything.
If neither condition is true, it appends the tuple (s, t) to the edge list.
For N = 3, the pairs (s, t) that will be appended to edge are (1, 3) and (2, 1), because for other pairs either s >= t or t == ng.
After the loops finish, the code prints the length of the edge list, which is 2, and then prints each pair in the edge list on a new line.
