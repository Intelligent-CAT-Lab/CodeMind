<<<Analysis>>>
The variable S is initialized to the string "+-++".
The code then counts the number of occurrences of "+" in S, which is 3.
It also counts the number of occurrences of "-" in S, which is 1.
The code calculates the expression 1*S.count("+") - 1*S.count("-"), which is equivalent to 3 - 1.
The result of the expression is 2.
The code prints the result, which is 2.
