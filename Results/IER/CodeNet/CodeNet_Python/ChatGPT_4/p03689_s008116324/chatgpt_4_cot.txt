<<<Analysis>>>
The variables H, W, h, and w are initialized to 3, 3, 2, and 2, respectively.
The code first checks if H is divisible by h and W is divisible by w. Since both 3%2 and 3%2 are not 0, the condition is false.
Therefore, the code does not print 'No' and does not exit.
Instead, it prints 'Yes'.
The variable n is set to 1000.
Since W%w is not 0 (3%2 is 1), the code enters the first if block.
The variable m is calculated as -((w-1)*n + 1), which is -((2-1)*1000 + 1) = -1001.
The row is constructed using a list comprehension. Since W is 3, the row will have 3 elements. The elements will be n (1000) if the index i%w is not w-1, otherwise, it will be m (-1001). This results in the row being [1000, -1001, 1000].
The code then prints this row H times (3 times in this case), resulting in the same row being printed three times.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
1000 -1001 1000
1000 -1001 1000
1000 -1001 1000
