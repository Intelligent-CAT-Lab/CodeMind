The variables A and B are initialized to 1.0 and 2.0, respectively, after converting the input strings to floats.
The code calculates the volume of a sphere using the formula 4/3 * pi * r^3, where r is the radius of the sphere. Here, B is used as the radius, which is 2.0.
The value of pi is imported from the math module.
The calculated volume is 4/3 * pi * 2^3 = 4/3 * pi * 8.
The result is then formatted to 10 decimal places and printed.
The actual calculation is 4/3 * 3.141592653589793 * 8 = 33.510321638291124.
When formatted to 10 decimal places, the output will be 33.5103216383.
<<<Output>>>
