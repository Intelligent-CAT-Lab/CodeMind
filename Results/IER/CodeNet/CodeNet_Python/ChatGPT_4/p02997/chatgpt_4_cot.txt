<<<Analysis>>>
The code is designed to read two integers N and K from the standard input, which are provided as 5 and 3 respectively.

The first conditional checks if K is greater than the maximum number of edges that can be removed from a complete graph without disconnecting it, which is calculated as ((N-1)*(N-2))//2. In this case, ((5-1)*(5-2))//2 equals 6, and since K (3) is not greater than 6, the code does not print -1 and does not exit.

Next, the code prints the number of edges that will be in the resulting graph after K edges are removed. This is calculated as N-1 (the number of edges in a spanning tree) plus the maximum number of edges that can be removed minus K. For the input 5 and 3, this calculation is 5-1+(6-3), which equals 7.

The code then enters a loop to print out the edges of the spanning tree. It prints an edge between vertex 1 and every other vertex from 2 to N (5 in this case). This results in the edges (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), and (1,5) being printed.

After that, the code initializes a variable 'a' to 0 and enters a nested loop to print additional edges between the remaining vertices until 'a' is less than the maximum number of edges that can be removed minus K. In this case, it will print edges until 'a' is less than 6-3, which is 3. The edges printed will be between vertices (2,3), (2,4), and (2,5), after which 'a' will be equal to 3 and the loop will terminate.

The total number of edges printed will be 7, as calculated earlier.
