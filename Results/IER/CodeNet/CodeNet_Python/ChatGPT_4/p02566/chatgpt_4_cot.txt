The input string `S` is "abcbcba".

1. The `suffix_array` function is called with `S` as the argument. This function converts the string into a list of ASCII values and then calls the `sa_is` function to generate the suffix array.

2. The `sa_is` function is a complex function that generates the suffix array using the induced sorting algorithm. It handles different cases based on the length of the string and uses multiple helper functions. The suffix array for "abcbcba" is generated as `sa = [6, 5, 0, 3, 1, 4, 2]`.

3. The `lcp_array` function is called with `S` and `sa` as arguments. This function computes the longest common prefix (LCP) array, which contains the lengths of the longest common prefixes between all pairs of consecutive suffixes in the sorted suffix array. The LCP array for "abcbcba" is `lcp = [0, 1, 3, 0, 0, 2]`.

4. The variable `res` is initialized with the sum of the lengths of all substrings of `S`, which is calculated as `len(S) * (len(S) + 1) // 2`. For "abcbcba", this is `7 * (7 + 1) // 2 = 28`.

5. The code then iterates over the LCP array and subtracts each value from `res`. This effectively removes the count of repeated substrings that are accounted for in the LCP array. The subtraction is as follows:
   - `res -= 0` (no change)
   - `res -= 1` (res becomes 27)
   - `res -= 3` (res becomes 24)
   - `res -= 0` (no change)
   - `res -= 0` (no change)
   - `res -= 2` (res becomes 22)

6. Finally, the code prints the value of `res`, which is the total number of distinct substrings in `S`.

The output of the code execution will be the final value of `res` after all the subtractions, which is 22.
