<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 1900.
The code checks if n is divisible by 1000. Since 1900 is not divisible by 1000 (1900 % 1000 equals 900), the condition is false.
The else block is executed, and ans is calculated as 1000 - (1900 % 1000), which is 1000 - 900.
Therefore, ans is set to 100.
The code prints the value of ans, which is 100.
<<<Output>>>
100
