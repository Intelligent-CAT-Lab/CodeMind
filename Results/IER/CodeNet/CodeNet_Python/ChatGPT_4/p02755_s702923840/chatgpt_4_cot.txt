<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a and b are initialized to 2 and 2, respectively.
An array x of size 10 is created, with all elements initialized to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 9, and for each iteration, it calculates b*10 + i and stores it in x[i]. Since b is 2, this will result in the numbers 20, 21, 22, ..., 29 being stored in the array x.
The code then enters another loop that iterates over the elements of x.
For each element x[i], it checks if 8% of x[i] (x[i]*0.08) is equal to a (which is 2). If it finds an element that satisfies this condition, it prints that element and breaks out of the loop.
If the loop completes without finding such an element, the code executes the else block and prints -1.
In this case, we are looking for a number in the range 20 to 29 whose 8% is equal to 2. The number that satisfies this condition is 25 (since 25*0.08 = 2).
Therefore, the code will print 25 and break out of the loop.
<<<Output>>>
25
