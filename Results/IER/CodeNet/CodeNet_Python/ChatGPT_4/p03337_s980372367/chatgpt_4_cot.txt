<<<Analysis>>>
The variables A and B are initialized to 3 and 1, respectively.
The code calculates three different expressions:
a1 = A + B, which is 3 + 1 = 4
a2 = A - B, which is 3 - 1 = 2
a3 = A * B, which is 3 * 1 = 3

The code then checks which of the three calculated values is the greatest and prints it.
It first checks if a1 is greater than or equal to both a2 and a3. Since a1 is 4, a2 is 2, and a3 is 3, a1 is indeed the greatest.
Therefore, the code prints the value of a1, which is 4.
<<<Output>>>
4
