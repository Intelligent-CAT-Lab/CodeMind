<<<Analysis>>>
The variables r, D, and x are initialized to 2, 10, and 20, respectively.
The code enters a loop that will iterate 10 times.
In each iteration, it updates the value of x by multiplying the current x by r (which is 2) and then subtracting D (which is 10).
The new value of x is printed in each iteration.
The sequence of operations is as follows:
1. x = 2 * 20 - 10 = 40 - 10 = 30
2. x = 2 * 30 - 10 = 60 - 10 = 50
3. x = 2 * 50 - 10 = 100 - 10 = 90
4. x = 2 * 90 - 10 = 180 - 10 = 170
5. x = 2 * 170 - 10 = 340 - 10 = 330
6. x = 2 * 330 - 10 = 660 - 10 = 650
7. x = 2 * 650 - 10 = 1300 - 10 = 1290
8. x = 2 * 1290 - 10 = 2580 - 10 = 2570
9. x = 2 * 2570 - 10 = 5140 - 10 = 5130
10. x = 2 * 5130 - 10 = 10260 - 10 = 10250

After the loop finishes, the code would have printed the value of x in each iteration, resulting in a sequence of 10 numbers.
