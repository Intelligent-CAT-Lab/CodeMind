<<<Analysis>>>
The input string '3 4' is taken and the spaces are replaced with an asterisk '*', resulting in '3*4'.
The eval function then evaluates the string '3*4' as a Python expression, which calculates the product of 3 and 4, resulting in 12.
The result, 12, is then checked if it is odd or even by taking the modulo with 2. Since 12 % 2 equals 0, the condition is False.
Because the condition is False, the ternary operator returns 'Even'.
The code then prints 'Even'.
<<<Output>>>
Even
