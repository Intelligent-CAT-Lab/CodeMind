<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 111.
The variable x is initialized to 111.
The code enters a loop that will iterate up to 9 times.
In the first iteration, it checks if x (which is 111) is greater than or equal to n (which is also 111).
Since x is equal to n, the condition is true.
The code then prints the current value of x, which is 111, and breaks out of the loop.
No further iterations occur since the break statement is executed.
<<<Output>>>
111
