<<<Analysis>>>
The variables n and m are initialized to 3 and 3, respectively, as they are the two numbers provided in the input.
The code then checks if n is equal to m.
Since n and m are both 3, the condition n == m is True.
Therefore, the code will execute the print statement within the if block.
The output will be "Yes" because n is equal to m.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
