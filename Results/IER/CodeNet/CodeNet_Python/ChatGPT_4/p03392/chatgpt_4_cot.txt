<<<Analysis>>>
The input string 'abc' is passed to the main function.
The length of the string 'abc' is 3, which is less than 6, so the code enters the first if block.
A set `s` is created and the input string 'abc' is added to it.
A queue `q` is initialized with the input string 'abc'.
The code enters a while loop that will continue until the queue `q` is empty.
Inside the while loop, the code pops the last element from the queue `q` and assigns it to `a`.
For each pair of adjacent characters in `a`, if they are different, the code calculates a new character `t` that is different from both and creates a new string `na` by replacing the pair of characters with two `t` characters.
If `na` is not already in the set `s`, it is added to both the set `s` and the queue `q`.
This process continues until the queue `q` is empty.
After the while loop, the code prints the length of the set `s`, which represents the number of unique strings that can be formed by the given process.
The unique strings that can be formed from 'abc' are: 'abc', 'aaa', 'ccc', 'bbb'.
Therefore, the length of the set `s` is 4.
<<<Output>>>
4
