<<<Analysis>>>
The variables n and m are initialized to 2 and 2, respectively.
The variable mod is set to 10^9 + 7, which is a large prime number often used for modulo operations in competitive programming to prevent integer overflow.
The code first checks if the absolute difference between n and m is greater than 1. Since n and m are both 2, their difference is 0, so the condition is false and the code does not print 0.
Next, the code checks if the sum of n and m is even. Since 2 + 2 equals 4, which is even, the condition is true.
The code then calculates the factorial of n (which is 2) and the factorial of m (which is also 2), multiplies them together, and multiplies by 2, then takes the result modulo mod.
The factorial of 2 is 2, so the calculation is (2 * 2 * 2) % (10^9 + 7), which equals 8 % (10^9 + 7).
Since 8 is less than 10^9 + 7, the modulo operation has no effect, and the result is simply 8.
The code then prints the result, which is 8.
<<<Output>>>
8
