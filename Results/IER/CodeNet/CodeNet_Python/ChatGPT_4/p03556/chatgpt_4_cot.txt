<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `n`. In this case, `n` is set to 10.
The `numpy` library's `sqrt` function is used to calculate the square root of `n`. The square root of 10 is approximately 3.1622776601683795.
The result of the square root is then converted to an integer, which truncates the decimal part, resulting in `a` being 3.
The code then calculates the square of `a`, which is 3*3 = 9.
Finally, the code prints the result as a string, which is "9".
<<<Output>>>
9
