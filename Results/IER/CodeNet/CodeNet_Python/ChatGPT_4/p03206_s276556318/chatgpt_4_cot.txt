<<<Analysis>>>
The variable D is initialized to the input value, which is 25.
The code then checks the value of D against several conditions:
- If D is 25, it prints "Christmas".
- If D is 24, it prints "Christmas Eve".
- If D is 23, it prints "Christmas Eve Eve".
- For any other value, it prints "Christmas Eve Eve Eve".
Since the input value is 25, the first condition is met, and the code will print "Christmas".
<<<Output>>>
Christmas
