<<<Analysis>>>
The variables h, w, a, and b are initialized to 3, 3, 1, and 1, respectively.
The string r1 is created by concatenating '0' a times and '1' (w - a) times, resulting in "011".
The string r2 is created by concatenating '1' a times and '0' (w - a) times, resulting in "100".
The code then enters a loop that runs b times (1 time in this case) and prints r1 each time, so "011" is printed once.
Next, the code enters another loop that runs (h - b) times (2 times in this case) and prints r2 each time, so "100" is printed twice.
The final output will be the string "011" followed by the string "100" printed twice, each on a new line.
