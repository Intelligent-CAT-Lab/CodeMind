<<<Analysis>>>
The variables m and n are initialized to 2 and 3, respectively.
The variable mod is set to 10^9 + 7, which is a large prime number often used for modulo operations in programming contests to avoid integer overflow.
The code uses the built-in pow function to calculate m raised to the power of n, modulo mod. This is equivalent to calculating (2^3) % (10^9 + 7).
2^3 is 8, and 8 modulo 10^9 + 7 is still 8, since 8 is much smaller than 10^9 + 7.
Therefore, the output will be 8.
