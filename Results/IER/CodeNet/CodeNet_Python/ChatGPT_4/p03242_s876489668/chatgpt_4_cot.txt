<<<Analysis>>>
The variable S is initialized with the string '119'.
A new empty string new_S is created to store the transformed characters.
The code enters a loop that iterates over each character in S.
For each character s in S:
- If s is '9', it appends '1' to new_S.
- If s is '1', it appends '9' to new_S.
- Otherwise, it appends the character s as it is to new_S.
The loop processes the characters in '119' as follows:
- The first character '1' is replaced with '9'.
- The second character '1' is also replaced with '9'.
- The third character '9' is replaced with '1'.
The final value of new_S after the loop is '991'.
The code prints the value of new_S.
<<<Output>>>
991
