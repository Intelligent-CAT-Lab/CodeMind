<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 100.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the total number of coins.

The code then enters a loop that iterates over a tuple containing the values (25, 10, 5, 1), which represent coin denominations.

For each denomination x in the tuple:
1. The code calculates how many coins of denomination x can fit into n using integer division (n // x) and adds this number to ans.
2. The code then calculates the remainder of n after subtracting the value of the coins of denomination x (n %= x).

For the input 100, the loop will execute as follows:
- For x = 25, 100 // 25 equals 4, so ans becomes 4, and n becomes 100 % 25 which is 0.
- For x = 10, since n is now 0, 0 // 10 equals 0, so ans remains 4, and n remains 0.
- For x = 5, since n is still 0, 0 // 5 equals 0, so ans remains 4, and n remains 0.
- For x = 1, since n is still 0, 0 // 1 equals 0, so ans remains 4, and n remains 0.

After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 4.

<<<Output>>>
4
