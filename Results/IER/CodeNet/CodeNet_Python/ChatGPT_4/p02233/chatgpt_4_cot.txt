<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 3.
Variables a and b are both initialized to 1. These will be used to generate a sequence where each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers, which is similar to the Fibonacci sequence.
The variable i is initialized to 0, which will be used as a counter for the while loop.
The while loop will run as long as i is less than n (3 in this case).
In the first iteration (i=0), a becomes 1 (the current value of b) and b becomes 2 (the sum of a and b before the update). i is incremented to 1.
In the second iteration (i=1), a becomes 2 (the current value of b) and b becomes 3 (the sum of a and b before the update). i is incremented to 2.
In the third iteration (i=2), a becomes 3 (the current value of b) and b becomes 5 (the sum of a and b before the update). i is incremented to 3.
The loop stops because i is now equal to n (3).
The final value of a, which is 3, is printed.
