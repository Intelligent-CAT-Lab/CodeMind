<<<Analysis>>>
The variables n and m are initialized to 2 and 2, respectively.
The first if condition checks if both n and m are equal to 1, which is not the case, so it moves on to the elif condition.
The elif condition checks if the minimum of n and m is 1, which is also not the case since both are 2.
The code then moves to the else block, which calculates the product of (n-2) and (m-2).
Since both n and m are 2, the calculation is (2-2)*(2-2) which equals 0*0.
Therefore, the output of the code will be 0.
