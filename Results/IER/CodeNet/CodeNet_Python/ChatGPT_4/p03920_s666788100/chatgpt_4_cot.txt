<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 4.
The variables m and tmp are initialized to 0.
The while loop continues to execute as long as m is less than n.
In each iteration of the while loop, tmp is incremented by 1 and m is increased by the new value of tmp.
The loop runs as follows:
- First iteration: tmp becomes 1, m becomes 1 (m = 0 + 1)
- Second iteration: tmp becomes 2, m becomes 3 (m = 1 + 2)
- Third iteration: tmp becomes 3, m becomes 6 (m = 3 + 3)
The loop stops because m is no longer less than n (6 is not less than 4).
The for loop then iterates from 1 to tmp (inclusive), which means from 1 to 3.
In each iteration, it checks if m-n is not equal to i.
m-n is 6-4, which equals 2.
The loop prints i only if it is not equal to 2.
The numbers 1 and 3 meet this condition and are printed.
