<<<Analysis>>>
The variable S is initialized with the input string 'bac' after stripping any leading or trailing whitespace.
The code then checks if the sorted list of characters in S is equal to the list ['a', 'b', 'c'].
The sorted list of characters in 'bac' is ['a', 'b', 'c'], which is equal to the list ['a', 'b', 'c'].
Since the condition is met, the code will print 'Yes'.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
