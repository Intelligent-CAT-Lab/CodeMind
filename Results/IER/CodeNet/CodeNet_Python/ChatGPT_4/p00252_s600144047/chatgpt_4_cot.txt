<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a, b, and c are initialized to 0, 0, and 1, respectively, based on the input provided.
The code then checks if the tuple (a, b, c) is equal to (1, 1, 0). Since it is not, it moves to the next condition.
The next condition checks if (a, b, c) is equal to (0, 0, 1). Since this condition is true, the code enters this branch.
The code then prints 'Open' because the condition (a, b, c) == (0, 0, 1) is satisfied.
<<<Output>>>
Open
