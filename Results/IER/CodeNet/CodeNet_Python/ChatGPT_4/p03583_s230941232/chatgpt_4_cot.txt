The variable n is initialized to 2.
The code consists of two nested loops, iterating over i and j, where i ranges from 1 to 3500 and j ranges from the current value of i to 3500.
For each pair (i, j), the code checks if the expression (4*i*j-n*(i+j)) is greater than 0 and if n*i*j is divisible by (4*i*j-n*(i+j)).
If both conditions are met, it calculates k as n*i*j divided by (4*i*j-n*(i+j)) using integer division.
Once a valid (i, j, k) triplet is found that satisfies the conditions, both loops are broken out of, and the values of i, j, and k are printed.
The first triplet that satisfies the conditions is found when i=1 and j=2. The expression (4*i*j-n*(i+j)) becomes (4*1*2-2*(1+2)) = 8-6 = 2, which is greater than 0.
The second condition checks if 2*1*2 is divisible by 2, which is true since 4 is divisible by 2.
Therefore, k is calculated as 2*1*2 // 2 = 4 // 2 = 2.
The output will be the values of i, j, and k, which are 1, 2, and 2, respectively.
