<<<Analysis>>>
The variables r, g, and b are initialized to 4, 3, and 2, respectively.
The code then checks if the number formed by the last two digits (g and b) is divisible by 4.
The last two digits form the number 32 (from g=3 and b=2).
32 is divisible by 4, so the condition (g * 10 + b) % 4 == 0 is true.
Since the condition is true, the code will print "YES".
<<<Output>>>
YES
