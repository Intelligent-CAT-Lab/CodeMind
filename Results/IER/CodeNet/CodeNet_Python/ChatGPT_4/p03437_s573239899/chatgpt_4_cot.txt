<<<Analysis>>>
The variables x and y are initialized with the values 8 and 6, respectively, from the input.
The code checks if x is divisible by y using the modulo operator (%). If x is divisible by y, it will print -1.
In this case, 8 is not divisible by 6 (8 % 6 equals 2, which is not 0), so the condition is false.
Since the condition is false, the code will execute the else block and print the value of x, which is 8.
<<<Output>>>
8
