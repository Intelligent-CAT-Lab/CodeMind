The variable N is initialized to 6 after converting the input string to an integer.
The function make_divisors is defined to find all divisors of a given number n.
First, the divisors of N-1 (which is 5) are found using make_divisors(N-1). The divisors of 5 are [1, 5] because 5 is a prime number.
Next, the divisors of N (which is 6) are found using make_divisors(N). The divisors of 6 are [1, 2, 3, 6].
The code then iterates over each divisor d in the list of divisors of N.
For each divisor d, the code enters a while loop where it repeatedly divides N by d until the remainder is not 0.
If d is 1, it breaks out of the loop immediately because 1 is not a valid divisor to consider for this problem.
If the remainder of N divided by d is 1, d is added to the list Nod and the loop breaks.
If the remainder of N divided by d is 0, N is divided by d and the loop continues.
If the remainder of N divided by d is neither 0 nor 1, the loop breaks without adding d to Nod.
After the loop, the length of Nod is printed, subtracting 1 to exclude the divisor 1.
For N = 6, the divisors of N-1 are [1, 5] and the divisors of N are [1, 2, 3, 6].
The while loop will add 2 and 3 to Nod because 6 % 2 == 0 and 6 % 3 == 0, and after dividing 6 by 2 and 3 respectively, the remainder becomes 1.
The final list Nod will be [1, 5, 2, 3].
The length of Nod is 4, so the output will be 4 - 1 = 3.
