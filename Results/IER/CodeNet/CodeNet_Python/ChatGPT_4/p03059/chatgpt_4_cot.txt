<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a, b, and t are initialized to 3, 5, and 7, respectively.
The expression (t // a) calculates the integer division of t by a, which is the number of times a fits into t without exceeding it. In this case, 7 // 3 equals 2, because 3 fits into 7 two times with a remainder of 1.
The result of this division (2) is then multiplied by b, which is 5. So, 2 * 5 equals 10.
The code prints the result of this multiplication, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
