The variable n is initialized to 2.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of times the loop runs.
The variable tmp is initialized to 1, which will be used to check the condition in the while loop.
The while loop continues to run as long as tmp is less than or equal to n+1, which is 3 in this case.
During the first iteration, tmp is multiplied by 2, resulting in tmp = 2, and ans is incremented by 1, resulting in ans = 1.
During the second iteration, tmp is again multiplied by 2, resulting in tmp = 4, and ans is incremented by 1, resulting in ans = 2.
Now, tmp (which is 4) is greater than n+1 (which is 3), so the loop terminates.
The final step is to print ans-1, which is 2-1 = 1.
