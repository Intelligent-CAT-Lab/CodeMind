<<<Analysis>>>
The input string '4 2 1 1' is split into a list of strings ['4', '2', '1', '1'].
The map function applies the int function to each element of the list, converting them to integers, resulting in the list [4, 2, 1, 1].
The sum function then calculates the sum of the integers in the list, which is 4 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 8.
The print function outputs the result of the sum, which is 8.
<<<Output>>>
8
