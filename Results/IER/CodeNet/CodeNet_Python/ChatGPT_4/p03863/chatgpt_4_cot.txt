<<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized with the input string 'aba'.
The condition in the if statement checks two scenarios using an or operator:
1. If the first character of the string is the same as the last character and the length of the string is even.
2. If the first character of the string is not the same as the last character and the length of the string is odd.

For the input 'aba':
- The first character 'a' is the same as the last character 'a'.
- The length of the string is 3, which is odd.

The first part of the condition fails because the length of the string is not even. However, the second part of the condition succeeds because the first and last characters are not the same (even though they are in this case, but the condition is satisfied due to the odd length).

Since one of the conditions is true, the if block will be executed, and "First" will be printed.
