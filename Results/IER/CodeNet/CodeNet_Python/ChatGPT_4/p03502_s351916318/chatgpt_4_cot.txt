<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized to the string '12'.
The code calculates the sum of the digits of N by converting each character of the string to an integer and summing them up. The sum of the digits of '12' is 1 + 2, which equals 3.
The code then checks if the integer value of N (which is 12) is divisible by the sum of its digits (which is 3).
Since 12 is divisible by 3, the condition int(N) % sum_Ndig == 0 is True.
Therefore, the code will print 'Yes'.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
