<<<Analysis>>>
The variables n, a, and b are initialized to 7, 17, and 120, respectively.
The code then checks if the product of n and a is greater than b.
The product of n and a is 7 * 17 = 119.
Since 119 is not greater than 120, the condition is false.
Therefore, the code will print the product of n and a, which is 119.
<<<Output>>>
119
