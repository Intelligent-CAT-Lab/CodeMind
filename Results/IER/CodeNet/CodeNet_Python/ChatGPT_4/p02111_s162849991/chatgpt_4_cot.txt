<<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized to 0.
The code then prints the result of two operations:
1. s // 30: This is the integer division of s by 30. Since s is 0, the result of this operation is 0.
2. 2 * (s % 30): This is two times the remainder of the division of s by 30. Since s is 0, the remainder is also 0, and multiplying it by 2 still gives 0.

The output will be two numbers separated by a space. The first number is the result of the integer division (0), and the second number is the result of the multiplication (0).
<<<Output>>>
