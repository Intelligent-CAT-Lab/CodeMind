<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a, b, c, and d are initialized to 0, 75, 25, and 100, respectively.
The code calculates the maximum of two values: the difference between the minimum of b and d (which is 75) and the maximum of a and c (which is 25), and 0.
The difference calculated is min(b, d) - max(a, c) = 75 - 25 = 50.
Since 50 is greater than 0, the max function will return 50.
The code then prints the result, which is 50.
<<<Output>>>
50
