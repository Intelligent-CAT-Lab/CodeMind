<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a and b are initialized to 10 and 5, respectively.
The code performs integer division of a by b, which is 10 // 5, resulting in 2.
The code also calculates the remainder of a divided by b, which is 10 % 5, resulting in 0.
The code then adds these two results together, which is 2 + 0, resulting in 2.
Finally, the code prints the result, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
