The variables n and y are initialized to 9 and 45000, respectively.
The code is trying to find a combination of three non-negative integer values (i, j, k) such that:
- i + j + k = n (which is 9 in this case)
- 10000i + 5000j + 1000k = y (which is 45000 in this case)

The code uses two nested loops to iterate over possible values of i and j, where i ranges from 0 to n (inclusive) and j ranges from 0 to n-i (inclusive). The value of k is not directly iterated but is calculated as k = n - i - j.

For each combination of i and j, the code checks if the total amount y can be formed by the combination of 10000 yen bills (i), 5000 yen bills (j), and 1000 yen bills (k). This is done by the following calculation:
(y - (i * 10000 + j * 5000)) / 1000 == k

If a valid combination is found, the code prints the values of i, j, and k, and then exits the loop using the exit() function.

If no valid combination is found after all iterations, the code prints '-1 -1 -1'.

Let's analyze the input 9 45000:
- The first valid combination that satisfies both conditions (i + j + k = 9 and 10000i + 5000j + 1000k = 45000) is when i = 4, j = 0, and k = 5. This is because:
  - i + j + k = 4 + 0 + 5 = 9
  - 10000i + 5000j + 1000k = 10000*4 + 5000*0 + 1000*5 = 40000 + 0 + 5000 = 45000

Since this is the first valid combination found, the code will print '4 0 5' and then exit without checking for other possible combinations.

<<<Output>>>
4 0 5
