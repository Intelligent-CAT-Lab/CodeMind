<<<Analysis>>>
The variable i is initialized with the input, which is "SAT".
The code then checks the value of i against various conditions to determine the day of the week.
Since i is "SAT", it does not match any of the conditions until the last else statement.
The else statement is executed because none of the previous conditions were met.
The code prints "1" because the else statement corresponds to Saturday.
<<<Output>>>
