<<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized to the string "oxo".
The code then calculates the number of occurrences of the character "o" in the string s using the count method. In this case, there are 2 occurrences of "o".
The expression 700 + 100 * s.count("o") is then evaluated. Since s.count("o") is 2, the expression becomes 700 + 100 * 2, which equals 700 + 200.
The final result of the expression is 900.
The code prints the result, which is 900.
<<<Output>>>
900
