<<<Analysis>>>
The input string 'atcoder' is converted into a list of characters.
Each character in the list is then converted to its corresponding alphabetical index (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', etc.) using the ord function and subtracting 97.
An array 'alpha' of length 26 is created to keep track of which letters are present in the input string. It is initialized with zeros.
The code iterates over the list of alphabetical indices and sets the corresponding index in 'alpha' to 1, indicating the presence of that letter.
Since the length of the input string 'atcoder' is not 26, the code enters the first if condition.
The code then looks for the first zero in 'alpha', which indicates a missing letter, and appends its index to the list 'S'.
The list 'S' is then converted back to characters by adding 97 to each index and using the chr function.
The resulting list of characters is joined into a string and printed.
In this case, the first missing letter after 'atcoder' is 'b', which corresponds to index 1 (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', etc.).
The code prints 'atcode' + 'b' and exits.
<<<Output>>>
atcodeb
