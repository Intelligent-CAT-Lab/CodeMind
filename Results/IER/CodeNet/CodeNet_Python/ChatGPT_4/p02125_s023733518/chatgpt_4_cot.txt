<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 2.
The variable cnt is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of times the loop executes.
The code increments n by 1, so n becomes 3.
The code enters an infinite loop (while 1:).
Inside the loop, n is divided by 2 using integer division and assigned back to n, so n becomes 1 (3 // 2).
The variable cnt is incremented by 1, so cnt becomes 1.
The code checks if n is equal to 1, which it is, so the loop breaks.
The code prints the final value of cnt, which is 1.
<<<Output>>>
