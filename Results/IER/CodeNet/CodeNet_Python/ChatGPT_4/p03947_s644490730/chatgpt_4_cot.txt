<<<Analysis>>>
The variable `s` is initialized with the string 'BBBWW'.
The variable `now` is initialized with the first character of `s`, which is 'B'.
The variable `ans` is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of times the character changes in the string.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from the second character to the last character of the string `s`.
For each character `s[i]` in this range, it checks if it is different from the character stored in `now`. If it is, it increments `ans` by 1 and updates `now` to the current character `s[i]`.
The condition is met twice: when the string changes from 'B' to 'W'. Therefore, `ans` is incremented twice.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of `ans`, which is 1.
