<<<Analysis>>>
The variable k is initialized to 3.
The code uses the math.ceil function to calculate the ceiling of k/2, which is the smallest integer greater than or equal to k/2. Since k is 3, k/2 is 1.5, and the ceiling of 1.5 is 2.
The code also calculates k//2, which is the floor division of k by 2, resulting in the largest integer less than or equal to k/2. For k equal to 3, k//2 is 1.
The code then multiplies these two results: math.ceil(k/2) which is 2, and k//2 which is 1, resulting in 2 * 1 = 2.
Finally, the code prints the result of this multiplication.
<<<Output>>>
