<<<Analysis>>>
The variables n and m are initialized to 3 and 100, respectively.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 2.
For each iteration i, the code performs the following actions:
- If i is not 0, it prints a space without a newline.
- If i is less than or equal to n/2 (which is 1.5 in this case), it prints "0" without a newline.
- Otherwise, it prints the value of m (which is "100") without a newline.
The condition i <= n/2 is met when i is 0 and 1, so "0" is printed for these iterations.
For i equal to 2, the condition is not met, so "100" is printed.
After the loop finishes, the code prints an empty string with a newline character.
The expected output is "0 0 100" followed by a newline.
