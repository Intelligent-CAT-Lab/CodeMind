<<<Analysis>>>
The input `2 2` initializes N to 2 and K to 2.
The variable `mod` is set to 10^9 + 7, which is a large prime number used for modulo operations to avoid integer overflow.
The list `lis` is initialized with 3300 zeros, and the first element is set to 1.

The outer loop iterates from N down to 1 (from 2 down to 1 in this case).
For each iteration, a new list `nlis` is created with 3300 zeros.

The nested loops iterate over all possible values of `j` from 0 to K (inclusive) and `last` from 0 to 3299 (the length of `lis`).
The condition `if i < j:` checks if the current number `i` is less than the number of operations `j`. If true, it simply copies the value from `lis` to `nlis` at the same index `last`.
Otherwise, it calculates the new index as `last + (last + j) // i` and adds the value from `lis` at index `last` to `nlis` at the new index, modulo `mod`.

After the inner loops, `lis` is updated to be `nlis`.

The variable `ans` is initialized with a formula that calculates the total number of ways to choose stones before subtracting the invalid ways.
The loop subtracts the product of `lis[i]` and `i` from `ans` for each `i` in the range of 3300, again modulo `mod`.

Finally, the code prints the value of `ans`.

Let's calculate the output step by step for the input `2 2`:
- Initialize `lis` with `lis[0] = 1` and all other elements 0.
- First iteration of the outer loop with `i = 2`:
  - `j = 0`: `nlis[0]` becomes `1` (since `i >= j` and `(last + j) // i` is 0).
  - `j = 1`: `nlis[0]` becomes `1` (since `i >= j` and `(last + j) // i` is 0).
  - `j = 2`: `nlis[1]` becomes `1` (since `i >= j` and `(last + j) // i` is 1).
- Update `lis` to be `nlis`.
- Second iteration of the outer loop with `i = 1`:
  - `j = 0`: `nlis[0]` becomes `1` and `nlis[1]` becomes `1`.
  - `j = 1`: `nlis[1]` becomes `2` and `nlis[2]` becomes `1`.
  - `j = 2`: `nlis[2]` becomes `3` and `nlis[3]` becomes `1`.
- Update `lis` to be `nlis`.
- Calculate `ans` using the formula: `ans = 2 * (2 + 1) // 2 * pow(2 + 1, 2 - 1, mod) * 2 = 3 * 3 * 2 = 18`.
- Subtract `lis[i] * i` from `ans` for each `i`:
  - `ans -= lis[0] * 0` (no change to `ans`).
  - `ans -= lis[1] * 1` (ans becomes `18 - 2 = 16`).
  - `ans -= lis[2] * 2` (ans becomes `16 - 6 = 10`).
  - `ans -= lis[3] * 3` (ans becomes `10 - 3 = 7`).
- The final value of `ans` is `7`.
