The main function is defined and then called at the end of the script.
The variables N and M are initialized to 1 each, as per the input provided.
The variable t is calculated as 1900*M + 100*(N-M). With M being 1 and N being 1, the calculation is 1900*1 + 100*(1-1), which simplifies to 1900 + 0, resulting in 1900.
The variable p is calculated as 2**M. With M being 1, this is 2**1, which is 2.
The final print statement outputs the product of t and p, which is 1900 * 2, resulting in 3800.
<<<Output>>>
3800
