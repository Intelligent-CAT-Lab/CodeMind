<<<Analysis>>>
The code imports several modules and sets the recursion limit to 10^7, initializes inf to 10^20, and mod to 10^9 + 7, but these are not used in the main function.
The main function is defined, which takes no arguments.
Inside the main function, the variables n and m are set to the values obtained from the input by calling the LI() function, which reads a line of input, splits it into a list of strings, converts each to an integer, and returns the list.
The input `2 0` means n is set to 2 and m is set to 0.
The main function returns the result of the expression n-m-1, which is 2-0-1 = 1.
The print statement outside of the main function calls the main function and prints its return value.
