<<<Analysis>>>
The variables n and d are initialized to 4 and 3, respectively.
The code checks if d is equal to 1, which it is not in this case, so it skips the first print statement.
The code then proceeds to the else statement and calculates the expression:
(n-1) + (n-d-1)*n - ((n-d-1)*(n+d-2)//2)
Substituting the values of n and d, we get:
(4-1) + (4-3-1)*4 - ((4-3-1)*(4+3-2)//2)
This simplifies to:
3 + (0)*4 - ((0)*(5)//2)
Which further simplifies to:
3 + 0 - 0
The final result is 3.
