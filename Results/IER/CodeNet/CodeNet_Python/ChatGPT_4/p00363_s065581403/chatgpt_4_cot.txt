<<<Analysis>>>
The variables W and H are initialized to 3, and the variable c is initialized to 'B'.
The code then enters a nested loop, with the outer loop iterating over the height (H) and the inner loop iterating over the width (W).
The code checks for the following conditions for each cell (i, j) in the grid:
- If the cell is a corner cell (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right), it prints a '+' without a newline (end='').
- If the cell is on the top or bottom edge (but not a corner), it prints a '-' without a newline.
- If the cell is on the left or right edge (but not a corner), it prints a '|' without a newline.
- If the cell is at the center of the grid (when both W and H are odd), it prints the character 'B' without a newline.
- For all other cells, it prints a '.' without a newline.
After each inner loop iteration, it prints a newline to move to the next row.
Since W and H are both 3, the grid is 3x3 and the center cell is at position (1, 1).
The expected output is a 3x3 grid with '+' at the corners, '-' on the top and bottom edges, '|' on the left and right edges, 'B' at the center, and '.' in all other cells.
