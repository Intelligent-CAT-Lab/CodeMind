<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 54.
The variable ret is initialized to 1, and i is initialized to 0.
The code enters a while loop that continues as long as ret is less than or equal to n.
Inside the loop, ret is updated to 2 raised to the power of i, and i is incremented by 1 after each iteration.
The loop runs as follows:
- i = 0, ret = 2^0 = 1 (ret <= n, continue)
- i = 1, ret = 2^1 = 2 (ret <= n, continue)
- i = 2, ret = 2^2 = 4 (ret <= n, continue)
- i = 3, ret = 2^3 = 8 (ret <= n, continue)
- i = 4, ret = 2^4 = 16 (ret <= n, continue)
- i = 5, ret = 2^5 = 32 (ret <= n, continue)
- i = 6, ret = 2^6 = 64 (ret > n, exit loop)

Since ret is now greater than n, the loop exits.
The final output is ret divided by 2, which is 64//2 = 32.
