<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a large number of imports and utility functions for various purposes, but only a small part of the code is actually used for the given input.

The variables a, b, and c are initialized with the values from the input, which are 3, 4, and 5, respectively.

The print statement calculates the expression `int(a*b/2)`. Since a and b are 3 and 4, the expression becomes `int(3*4/2)`, which simplifies to `int(12/2)` and then to `int(6)`. The `int` function is redundant here because the division of two integers is already an integer.

Therefore, the output will be the result of the expression, which is 6.

6
