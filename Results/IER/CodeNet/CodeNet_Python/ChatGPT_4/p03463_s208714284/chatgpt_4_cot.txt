<<<Analysis>>>
The variables N, A, and B are initialized to 5, 2, and 4, respectively.
The code checks if the difference between B and A is even by using the modulo operator `% 2`.
If the result of `(B-A)%2` is 0, it means the difference is even, and the code will print 'Alice'.
If the result is not 0, it means the difference is odd, and the code will print 'Borys'.
In this case, the difference between B (4) and A (2) is 2, which is even.
Therefore, the condition `(B-A)%2` evaluates to 0, and the code will print 'Alice'.
<<<Output>>>
Alice
