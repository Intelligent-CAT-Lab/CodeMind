The variables A and B are initialized to 2.
The variable f is initialized to False, which will be used as a flag to indicate if a valid answer is found.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will store the answer if found.
The variable n is calculated as A * 100 // 8, which is 2 * 100 // 8 = 200 // 8 = 25.
The variable m is calculated as (A + 1) * 100 // 8, which is (2 + 1) * 100 // 8 = 300 // 8 = 37.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from n to m (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 25 to 37.
For each number i in this range, it checks two conditions:
1. If i * 8 // 100 equals A (2 in this case).
2. If i // 10 equals B (2 in this case).
If both conditions are met, the flag f is set to True, ans is set to the current number i, and the loop breaks.
The loop finds that when i is 25, both conditions are met because:
25 * 8 // 100 = 200 // 100 = 2 (which equals A)
25 // 10 = 2 (which equals B)
Since the conditions are met, f is set to True, ans is set to 25, and the loop breaks.
After the loop, the code prints the value of ans if f is True, otherwise it prints -1.
Since f is True, the code prints the value of ans, which is 25.
