<<<Analysis>>>
The input is the number 3.

The main function starts by reading this number and assigning it to N.

The code then enters a loop to find a K such that K * (K-1) / 2 equals N. This is a formula for the sum of the first K-1 natural numbers. For N=3, the loop finds that K=3 satisfies the condition (3 * (3-1) / 2 = 3).

Since K is found, the code does not print "No" and does not exit.

An empty list of lists S is created with K sublists.

The code then enters a while loop to fill the sublists in S with numbers from 1 to N (inclusive). The first loop fills the first element of each sublist, and the second loop fills the remaining elements.

The first while loop runs with i starting from 1 and increments i each time it adds a number to a sublist. It also keeps track of how many numbers have been added to the current sublist with cnt. When cnt equals K - (k+1), it moves to the next sublist.

The second while loop runs with j starting from 1 and increments j each time it adds a number to a sublist. It also increments k to move to the next sublist after each addition. When cnt equals K - (col+1), it resets cnt to 0, increments col, and sets k to col + 1 to start filling the next column.

After filling the sublists, the code prints "Yes" to indicate that it's possible to create the sets, prints the value of K, and then prints the sublists in S, each preceded by the number of elements in the sublist (which is K - 1).

For N=3, the output will be "Yes", followed by K=3, and then the sublists, which will be three pairs of numbers where each number from 1 to 3 appears exactly twice and no pair is repeated.

The expected sublists for N=3 are:
1 2
1 3
2 3

Each sublist has K - 1 = 2 elements.

<<<Output>>>
Yes
3
2 1 2
2 1 3
2 2 3
