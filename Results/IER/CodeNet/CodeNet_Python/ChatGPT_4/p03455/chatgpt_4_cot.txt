<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a and b are initialized to 3 and 4, respectively, from the input.
The variable c is calculated as the product of a and b, which is 3 * 4 = 12.
The code then checks if c is odd by taking c modulo 2. If the remainder is 1, it means c is odd.
Since 12 % 2 equals 0, c is not odd, so the condition is false.
Therefore, the code will execute the else block and print 'Even'.
<<<Output>>>
Even
