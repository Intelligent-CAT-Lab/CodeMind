<<<Analysis>>>
The variables n and r are initialized to 2 and 2919, respectively.
The code checks if n is less than 10, which it is in this case.
Since n is less than 10, the code executes the first print statement, which adds r to 100 times (10 - n).
The calculation is as follows: 2919 + (100 * (10 - 2)) = 2919 + (100 * 8) = 2919 + 800 = 3719.
The code prints the result of this calculation.
<<<Output>>>
3719
