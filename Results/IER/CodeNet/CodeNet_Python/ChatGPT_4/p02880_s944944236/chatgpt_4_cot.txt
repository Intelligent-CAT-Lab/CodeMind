<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 10.
The variable yes is initialized to True.
The list primesand10 contains prime numbers and the number 10.
The code checks if n is less than or equal to 10, which it is, so the variable yes remains True.
Since n is not greater than 10, the code does not proceed to the elif block or the else block.
Finally, the code checks the value of yes, which is True, and prints "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
