<<<Analysis>>>
The variable K is initialized to 6.
A deque q is created and initialized with a tuple (1, 1), where the first element is a number n and the second element is the step count s.
A dictionary m is created to keep track of the numbers that have been seen and their associated step counts.
The code enters a while loop that continues as long as there are elements in the deque q.
Inside the loop, it pops an element from the left of the deque, which initially is (1, 1).
It checks if n (which is 1 at the beginning) is already in the dictionary m. If it is, it continues to the next iteration of the loop without executing the following lines. Since m is empty at the start, it proceeds.
It then adds n to the dictionary m with the value of s (which is 1 at the beginning).
Next, it appends to the left of the deque a new tuple (n * 10 % K, s), which is (10 % 6, 1) = (4, 1).
Then, it appends to the right of the deque a new tuple ((n + 1) % K, s + 1), which is (2 % 6, 2) = (2, 2).
The loop continues, and the process repeats for the new elements in the deque.
The goal is to find when n becomes 0 modulo K, and at that point, the loop will break and the associated step count s will be printed.
The sequence of operations will be as follows:
- Start with (1, 1)
- Add (4, 1) to the left, add (2, 2) to the right
- Pop (4, 1), add (4, 1) to the left, add (5, 2) to the right
- Pop (4, 1) again, but since 4 is already in m, continue
- Pop (2, 2), add (2, 2) to the left, add (3, 3) to the right
- Pop (2, 2) again, but since 2 is already in m, continue
- Pop (5, 2), add (5, 2) to the left, add (0, 3) to the right
- Pop (5, 2) again, but since 5 is already in m, continue
- Pop (3, 3), add (3, 3) to the left, add (4, 4) to the right
- Pop (3, 3) again, but since 3 is already in m, continue
- Pop (0, 3), since 0 is not in m, add it to m with the step count 3
The loop ends when 0 is added to m, and the associated step count is 3.
The code prints the value of m[0], which is 3.
