<<<Analysis>>>
The input is `6`, which is assigned to the variable `n`.
The code checks if `n` is equal to 2 and prints `-1` if it is, but since `n` is 6, it skips this condition.
Next, the code checks if `n` is equal to 3, which it is not, so it skips the block that assigns `a3` to `ans`.
Since `n` is 6, which is an even number, the code enters the `elif n%2 == 0` block.
Inside this block, the code creates a 6x6 matrix `ans` filled with `"."`.
Then, it fills this matrix with patterns from `a21` and `a22` in a specific manner to ensure that no two adjacent cells have the same character, except for the `"."` cells.
The pattern from `a21` is placed starting from the top left corner and moving diagonally down to the right, filling the first half of the matrix.
The pattern from `a22` is placed starting from the third row and first column, moving diagonally down to the right, filling the second half of the matrix.
After filling the matrix, the code prints the matrix row by row without spaces between the characters.
The expected output is a 6x6 matrix with the specified patterns from `a21` and `a22`.
