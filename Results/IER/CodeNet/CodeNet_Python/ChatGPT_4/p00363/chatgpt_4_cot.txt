<<<Analysis>>>
The input is split into three variables: w, h, and c, which are assigned the values '3', '3', and 'B', respectively.
w and h are converted to integers, so w = 3 and h = 3.
The first line of output is generated by printing a '+' character, followed by w-2 '-' characters, and another '+' character. Since w is 3, this results in "+-+".
The code then enters a loop to print the middle part of the box, which will iterate h-2 times (in this case, 1 time because h is 3).
Inside the loop, it checks if the current index i multiplied by 2 is equal to h-3. Since h is 3, h-3 is 0. On the first iteration, i is 0, so i*2 is also 0, which means the condition is true.
Because the condition is true, it prints a line with '|' characters at the start and end, and in the middle, it prints (w-3)//2 '.' characters, the character c, and another (w-3)//2 '.' characters. Since w is 3, (w-3)//2 is 0, so no '.' characters are printed on either side of c. The line printed is "|B|".
The last line of output is the same as the first line, "+-+".
