<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized to the string '1118'.
The code checks if the first three characters of N are the same or if the last three characters of N are the same.
In this case, N[0], N[1], and N[2] are all '1', which means the condition N[0]==N[1]==N[2] is true.
Since the condition is met, the code will print 'Yes'.
The second condition N[1]==N[2]==N[3] is not checked because the first condition is already true and the conditions are connected with an 'or' operator.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
