<<<Analysis>>>
The variables N and D are initialized to 6 and 2, respectively.
The code checks if N is divisible by (2 * D + 1) without any remainder.
Here, (2 * D + 1) is (2 * 2 + 1) which equals 5.
Since 6 is not divisible by 5 without a remainder, the condition N % (2 * D + 1) == 0 is False.
Therefore, the code executes the else block.
In the else block, it calculates N // (2 * D + 1) which is 6 // 5, resulting in 1.
Since the division has a remainder, it adds 1 to the result.
The final output is 1 + 1 which is 2.
