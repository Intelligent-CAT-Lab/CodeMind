<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized to 3.
The code checks if N is a power of 2 by using the bitwise AND operation N & (N - 1). If the result is 0, N is a power of 2. Since 3 & (3 - 1) is not equal to 0, the code prints "Yes".
Since N is odd (3 % 2 == 1), the code sets k to N // 2, which is 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to k (inclusive), which in this case is just 1.
In the loop, the code prints pairs of numbers according to the specified pattern. Since k is 1, it will print the following pairs:
2*1, 2*1+1 -> 2, 3
2*1+1, 1 -> 3, 1
1, 2*1+N -> 1, 5
2*1+N, 2*1+1+N -> 5, 6
After the loop, the code prints one additional pair:
1+N, 2 -> 4, 2
Since N is odd, the code does not execute the else block, and the output is complete.
<<<Output>>>

2 3
3 1
1 5
