The input provided is `2 2`, which means n = 2 and k = 2.

The `solve` function is called with these values. Since neither n nor k is 1, the function proceeds to calculate the result.

The value of m is calculated as n * k, which is 2 * 2 = 4.

The `comb` list is generated by calling `fac_gen` with arguments (k - 2, m - 1), which translates to (0, 3). This will generate factorials of numbers from 0 to 2 (since the last value is not included in the range). The factorials are 1, 1, and 2, respectively, because factorial of 0 and 1 is 1, and factorial of 2 is 2.

The `build_comb_list` function is called with `comb`, m - 2, and k - 2, which translates to ([1, 1, 2], 2, 0). This function modifies the `comb` list in place. Since K is 0, the loop inside `build_comb_list` does not execute, and `comb` remains unchanged.

The `solve_dp` function is called with n, k, and the `comb` list. Inside `solve_dp`, a list `dp` is initialized with n + 1 ones. The function then iterates from 2 to n (inclusive), which in this case is just the number 2.

For i = 2, the value of ci is calculated as (i - 1) * (k - 1), which is 1 * 1 = 1. The inner loop iterates over the range from 0 to i (exclusive), which is 0 and 1, and updates the `dp` list using values from `comb` starting from index ci. The `dp` list is updated to [1, 1, 2].

Finally, `solve_dp` returns dp[n] * fac(n) % MOD, which is dp[2] * fac(2) % MOD. This is 2 * 2 % 1000000007, which equals 4.

Therefore, the output of the code execution is 4.
