<<<Analysis>>>
The input string "AtCoder Beginner Contest" is split into a list of words ['AtCoder', 'Beginner', 'Contest'].
A list comprehension is used to create a new list 's' that contains the first character of each word in the original list.
The list comprehension iterates over the range of indices for the split list (0 to 2) and takes the first character of each word using s[i][0].
The new list 's' now contains the characters ['A', 'B', 'C'].
The join method is used to concatenate the elements of the list 's' into a single string.
The output is the string "ABC" which is the concatenation of the first letters of each word in the input.
<<<Output>>>
ABC
