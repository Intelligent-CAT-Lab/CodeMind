<<<Analysis>>>
The input is `0`.
The `int(input())` part converts the input string to an integer, which is 0 in this case.
The integer 0 is then multiplied by 2, resulting in 0.
The `divmod` function is called with arguments 0 and 60. This function returns a tuple of two numbers: the quotient and the remainder of the division of the first argument by the second.
Since 0 divided by 60 is 0 with a remainder of 0, the `divmod` function will return (0, 0).
The `print` function with the unpacking operator `*` is used to print the elements of the tuple returned by `divmod` without the tuple parentheses.
Therefore, the output will be the two numbers 0 and 0, separated by a space.
