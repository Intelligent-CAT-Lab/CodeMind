The variable K is initialized to 6.
The code creates a list of lists called 'edge', which will store tuples representing the edges of a graph. Each tuple contains a node and the cost to reach that node.

For each number i from 1 to K-1 (i.e., 1 to 5), two edges are added to the list corresponding to node i:
- An edge to node (i+1)%K with a cost of 1.
- An edge to node (i*10)%K with a cost of 0.

The dijkstra function is defined to find the shortest path from node 'fro' to node 'to' in a graph with 'v' vertices. It uses a priority queue to always select the node with the smallest distance that hasn't been checked yet.

The function initializes a list of distances 'dist' with a large number (MAX), and a list 'check' to keep track of which nodes have been checked.

The distance from 'fro' to itself is set to 0, and the node is added to the priority queue.

The function then enters a loop that will iterate 'v' times. In each iteration, it selects the unchecked node with the smallest distance ('nowNode') and marks it as checked.

For each edge from 'nowNode', it updates the distance to the connected node ('nextNode') if the new distance ('nextDist') is smaller than the current distance in 'dist'.

After updating all reachable nodes from 'nowNode', the loop continues until all nodes have been checked.

Finally, the function returns the distance from 'fro' to 'to'.

The code calls dijkstra with parameters (1, 0, K) to find the shortest path from node 1 to node 0 in a graph with K nodes, and then adds 1 to the result before printing it.

Let's simulate the dijkstra function with the input K=6:
- The edges for each node are as follows:
  - edge[1] = [(2, 1), (4, 0)]
  - edge[2] = [(3, 1), (2, 0)]
  - edge[3] = [(4, 1), (0, 0)]
  - edge[4] = [(5, 1), (4, 0)]
  - edge[5] = [(0, 1), (2, 0)]

- The priority queue starts with (0, 1).
- The first node to be checked is node 1. Its edges are to nodes 2 and 4 with costs 1 and 0, respectively.
- The distances are updated: dist[2] = 1, dist[4] = 0. The queue now contains (1, 2) and (0, 4).
- The next node to be checked is node 4 (since it has a distance of 0). Its edges are to nodes 5 and 4 with costs 1 and 0, respectively.
- The distances are updated: dist[5] = 1 (since 0+1 < MAX). The queue now contains (1, 2), (1, 5).
- The next node to be checked is node 2. Its edges are to nodes 3 and 2 with costs 1 and 0, respectively.
- The distances are updated: dist[3] = 2 (since 1+1 < MAX). The queue now contains (1, 5), (2, 3).
- The next node to be checked is node 5. Its edges are to nodes 0 and 2 with costs 1 and 0, respectively.
- The distances are updated: dist[0] = 2 (since 1+1 < MAX), dist[2] = 1 (since 1+0 < 1, but this does not change the distance as it is already 1). The queue now contains (2, 3), (2, 0).
- The next node to be checked is node 3. Its edges are to nodes 4 and 0 with costs 1 and 0, respectively.
- The distances are updated: dist[4] = 3 (since 2+1 < 0, but this does not change the distance as it is already 0), dist[0] = 2 (since 2+0 < 2, but this does not change the distance as it is already 2). The queue now contains (2, 0).
- The next node to be checked is node 0, but since all distances are already updated, the loop ends.

The shortest distance from node 1 to node 0 is 2. Adding 1 to this result gives us 3.
