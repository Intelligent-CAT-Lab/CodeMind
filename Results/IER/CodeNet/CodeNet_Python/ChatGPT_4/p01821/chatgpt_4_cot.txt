The variable N is initialized to 3.
The gcd function is defined to calculate the greatest common divisor of two numbers.
The lcm function is defined to calculate the least common multiple of two numbers using the gcd function.
The carmichael function is defined to calculate the Carmichael function of a number x, which is the smallest positive integer m such that a^m ≡ 1 (mod x) for every integer a that is coprime to x.
The solve function is defined to find the smallest exponent k such that N^k ≡ 1 (mod c), where c is the Carmichael function of N.

The carmichael function is called with N = 3 and returns the value of r.
- Since 3 is an odd prime, the while loop for even numbers is skipped.
- The while loop for odd numbers y starts with y = 3, which is equal to x, so the loop is skipped.
- Since x > 1, r is updated to lcm(r, x-1), which is lcm(1, 2) = 2.

The solve function is called with N = 3 and c = 2.
- Since c is 2, the first if condition is false.
- x is updated to x % c, which is 3 % 2 = 1.
- sq is calculated as int(2 ** .5) + 1 = 2.
- The first for loop initializes mp with y values and corresponding i values. Since y becomes 1 after the first iteration, the loop returns i+1, which is 1.

The if condition checks if k is -1 or if 3^k is not congruent to 1 modulo c. Since k is 1 and 3^1 % 2 is 1, the condition is false.

The final output is the value of k, which is 1.
