<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a and b are initialized with the values 1 and 2, respectively, from the input.
The code then checks if a is greater than b. Since 1 is not greater than 2, it does not print "a > b".
Next, it checks if a is less than b. Since 1 is less than 2, it satisfies this condition.
Therefore, the code prints "a < b".
<<<Output>>>
a < b
