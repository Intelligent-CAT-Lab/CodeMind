<<<Analysis>>>
The variables A, B, and C are initialized to 6, 4, and 3, respectively.
The variable ans is calculated as C - (A - B), which is 3 - (6 - 4), resulting in 3 - 2, which equals 1.
The code then checks if ans is greater than or equal to 0. Since ans is 1, which is greater than 0, the condition is true.
Therefore, the code prints the value of ans, which is 1.
<<<Output>>>
