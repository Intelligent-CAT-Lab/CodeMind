<<<Analysis>>>
The variables N and M are initialized to 3 and 3, respectively, as they are the two numbers provided in the input.
The code then checks if N is equal to M.
Since N and M are both 3, the condition N == M is True.
Therefore, the code will execute the first branch of the if statement and print 'Yes'.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
