<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to the string "12".
The variable sn is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of the digits of n.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the length of n, which is 2 in this case.
For each index i in this range (0 and 1), it adds the integer value of the digit at that index to sn. The digits of "12" are '1' and '2', so sn becomes 1 + 2 = 3.
After the loop, the code checks if the integer value of n (which is 12) is divisible by sn (which is 3).
Since 12 is divisible by 3, the condition (int(n) % sn == 0) is True.
Therefore, the code prints "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
