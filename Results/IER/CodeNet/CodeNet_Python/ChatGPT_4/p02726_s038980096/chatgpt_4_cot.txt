The variable N, X, and Y are initialized to 5, 2, and 4, respectively.
A matrix S of size N x N is created with a specific pattern. Each row i starts with a reversed list of numbers from 1 to i, followed by a sequence of zeros of length N-i.

The elements at positions (X-1, Y-1) and (Y-1, X-1) in the matrix S are set to 1, which corresponds to the positions (2-1, 4-1) and (4-1, 2-1), i.e., (1, 3) and (3, 1) in the matrix, considering 0-based indexing.

The code then updates the matrix S by finding the minimum distance between all pairs of cells, using the previously set positions as intermediaries.

The 'dist' list is initialized to store the count of distances between all pairs of different cells in the matrix S.

The code iterates over all combinations of two different cells in the matrix S and increments the count of the distance between each pair in the 'dist' list.

Finally, the code prints the counts of distances from 1 to N-1 (since the distance of 0 is not relevant for different cells).

Let's manually calculate the matrix S after the initial setup and before the distance update loop:
S = [
    [5, 4, 3, 2, 1],
    [4, 3, 2, 1, 0],
    [3, 2, 1, 0, 0],
    [2, 1, 1, 0, 0],
    [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
]

After updating the distances using the positions (X-1, Y-1) and (Y-1, X-1) as intermediaries, the matrix S should look like this:
S = [
    [2, 1, 2, 1, 2],
    [1, 1, 1, 1, 2],
    [2, 1, 2, 1, 2],
    [1, 1, 1, 1, 2],
    [2, 2, 2, 2, 3]
]

Now, we count the distances for each pair of cells:
- Distance 1: 8 times (since there are 8 pairs of adjacent cells with distance 1)
- Distance 2: 6 times (since there are 6 pairs of cells with distance 2)
- Distance 3: 1 time (since there is only 1 pair of cells with distance 3)

The output will be the counts of distances from 1 to N-1, which are 8, 6, and 1, respectively.
