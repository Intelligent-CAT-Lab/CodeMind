<<<Analysis>>>
The input string S is initialized to '125'.
The variable I_MAX is set to the length of S, which is 3.
An empty list called values is created to store the results of the recursive function calc.

The calc function is a recursive function that takes three arguments: val, add, and i.
- val is the current value being calculated.
- add is the value to be added to val.
- i is the current index in the string S.

The base case of the recursion is when i equals I_MAX (3 in this case). When this happens, the function adds add to val and appends the result to the values list.

The recursive case has two calls to calc:
1. The first call adds add to val and uses the next character in S as the new add, incrementing i by 1.
2. The second call does not change val but multiplies add by 10 and adds the next character in S to it, also incrementing i by 1.

The solve function initializes the recursion by calling calc with the first character of S as an integer and i set to 1.

The recursion will generate all possible sums of the numbers formed by splitting the input string '125' in all possible ways. The possible splits are:
- 1+2+5
- 1+25
- 12+5
- 125

The values list will contain the results of these sums: [8, 26, 17, 125].

Finally, the solve function prints the sum of all values in the values list.

The sum of the values list is 8 + 26 + 17 + 125 = 176.
