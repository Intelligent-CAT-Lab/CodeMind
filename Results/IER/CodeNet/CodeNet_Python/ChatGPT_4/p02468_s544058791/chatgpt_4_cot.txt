<<<Analysis>>>
The variables m and n are initialized to 2 and 3, respectively, from the input.
The variable mod is set to 10^9 + 7, which is a large prime number often used for modulo operations in programming contests to avoid integer overflow.
The variable ans is calculated as m raised to the power of n, modulo mod. This is done using the built-in pow function with three arguments: base (m), exponent (n), and modulus (mod).
The pow function calculates 2^3 which is 8, and then takes the result modulo 10^9 + 7. Since 8 is less than 10^9 + 7, the modulo operation does not change the value.
Finally, the code prints the value of ans, which is 8.
<<<Output>>>
8
