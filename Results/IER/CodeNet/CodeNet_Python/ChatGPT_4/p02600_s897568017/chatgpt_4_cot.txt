<<<Analysis>>>
The variable x is initialized to 725.
The code then checks which range x falls into using a series of if-elif statements.
Since 725 is between 600 and 799, the condition of the second elif statement is met.
Therefore, the code will print the number associated with that range, which is 7.
<<<Output>>>
7
