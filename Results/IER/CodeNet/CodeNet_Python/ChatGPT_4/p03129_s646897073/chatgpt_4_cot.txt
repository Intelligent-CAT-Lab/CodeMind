<<<Analysis>>>
The input is split into a list of integers, so `a` becomes [3, 2].
The variables N and K are assigned the values of a[0]-1 and a[1]-1, respectively. Therefore, N becomes 2 and K becomes 1.
The condition checks if N/2 is greater than or equal to K. In this case, N/2 is 1, which is equal to K.
Since the condition N/2 >= K is true, the code will print "YES".
<<<Output>>>
YES
