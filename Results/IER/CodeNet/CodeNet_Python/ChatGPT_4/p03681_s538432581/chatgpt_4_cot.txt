The variables n and m are initialized to 2 and 2, respectively.
The variables ans1 and ans2 are initialized to 1, which will be used to calculate the factorial of n and m.
The variable mod is set to 10**9 + 7, which is a large prime number often used for modulo operations in competitive programming to avoid integer overflow.

The code first checks if the absolute difference between n and m is greater than or equal to 2. If it is, the code prints 0 and exits. Since n and m are both 2, this condition is not met, and the code continues.

The code then calculates the factorial of n (which is 2) in a loop and stores the result in ans1, performing modulo operation with mod after each multiplication to keep the result within the bounds of a 32-bit integer. The factorial of 2 is 2 * 1 = 2, so ans1 becomes 2.

Similarly, the code calculates the factorial of m (which is also 2) in a loop and stores the result in ans2, also performing modulo operation with mod after each multiplication. The factorial of 2 is again 2 * 1 = 2, so ans2 becomes 2.

Since the absolute difference between m and n is 0 (they are equal), the code executes the else block, which prints the result of 2 * ans1 * ans2 % mod. This is 2 * 2 * 2 % (10**9 + 7), which equals 8 % (10**9 + 7), which is simply 8.

Therefore, the output of the code will be 8.
