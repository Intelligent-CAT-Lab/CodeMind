<<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized to a list of characters from the input string 'pdbq'.
The variable sr is initialized to a list of characters from s but reversed.
The variable t is calculated as the integer division of the length of s by 2, which is 2//2 = 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to t+1, which means it will iterate from 0 to 2 (inclusive).
For each index i in this range, the code checks if the character at index i in s and the character at index i in sr do not form a mirror pair ('b' with 'd', 'd' with 'b', 'p' with 'q', 'q' with 'p').
If any pair of characters does not meet this condition, the code prints "No" and breaks out of the loop.
In this case, the pairs are ('p', 'q'), ('d', 'b'), and since they are mirror pairs, the loop completes without printing "No".
Since the loop completes without breaking, the else clause is executed, and "Yes" is printed.
