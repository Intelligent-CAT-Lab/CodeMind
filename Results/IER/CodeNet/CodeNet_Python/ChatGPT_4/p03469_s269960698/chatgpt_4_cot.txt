<<<Analysis>>>
The variable S is initialized with the string "2017/01/07".
The code prints a new string that is a concatenation of:
- The first three characters of S, which are "201".
- The string "8".
- The substring of S starting from the 5th character to the end, which is "/01/07".
The resulting string is "2018/01/07".
<<<Output>>>
2018/01/07
