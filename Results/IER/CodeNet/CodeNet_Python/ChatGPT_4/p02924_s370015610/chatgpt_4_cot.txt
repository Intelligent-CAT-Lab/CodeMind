The variable N is initialized to 2.
The Decimal class is used to perform the calculation with high precision. The expression (N-1)/2 is calculated as (2-1)/2 which equals 0.5.
This value is then multiplied by N, which is 2, resulting in 1.0.
The result is then converted to an integer using the int() function, which truncates the decimal part and results in 1.
The code prints the final integer value, which is 1.
