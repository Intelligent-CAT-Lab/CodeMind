<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 2.
The code calculates the value of n*(n-1)//2, which is the formula for the sum of the first n-1 natural numbers, also known as the number of pairs that can be formed from n items.
For n=2, the calculation is 2*(2-1)//2, which simplifies to 2*1//2, and further simplifies to 2//2.
The integer division of 2 by 2 is 1.
The code then prints the result of this calculation.
