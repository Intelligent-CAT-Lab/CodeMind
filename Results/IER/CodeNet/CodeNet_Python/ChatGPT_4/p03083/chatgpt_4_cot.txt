<<<Analysis>>>
The input `2 1` initializes B to 2 and W to 1.
The mod variable is set to 1e9 + 7, which is a prime number often used for modulo operations in competitive programming to avoid integer overflow.

The code defines two functions, doubling and inved, which are used to calculate powers and modular inverses, respectively.

The code then initializes two lists, fact and invf, with a size of B+W+1 (which is 4 in this case) and sets all elements to 1. These lists will store factorial values and their modular inverses.

The loop populates the fact list with factorial values modulo mod. The invf list is then populated with the modular inverses of these factorial values, starting from the last element.

Similarly, bina and invb lists are initialized and populated with powers of 2 and their modular inverses.

The code then checks if B equals W. If so, it prints the second element of invf (which is the modular inverse of 2) B+W times. Since B is not equal to W, this block is skipped.

Since B is greater than W, the code enters the elif block for B > W.

For the first W iterations (which is 1 in this case), it prints the second element of invf.

Then, it calculates a series of values F using the factorial values, their inverses, and the inverses of powers of 2, and prints them. This is done for the range from W+1 to B+W+1.

The output will be the printed values from these calculations.
