<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a main function that reads three integers A, B, and C from the input.
It then checks if the product of each pair of these integers is even (i.e., divisible by 2).
The condition `(A * B) % 2 == 0 and (B * C) % 2 == 0 and (C * A) % 2 == 0` checks if all three products A*B, B*C, and C*A are even.
If all products are even, it prints 'Tem', otherwise it prints 'Hom'.
Given the input `1 1 10`, the products are:
- A * B = 1 * 1 = 1 (odd)
- B * C = 1 * 10 = 10 (even)
- C * A = 10 * 1 = 10 (even)
Since not all products are even (A * B is odd), the condition is not satisfied.
Therefore, the output will be 'Hom'.
