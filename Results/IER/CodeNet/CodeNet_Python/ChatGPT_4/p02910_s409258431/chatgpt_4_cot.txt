The variable S is initialized to the string 'RUDLUDR'.
The variable a is initialized to 0, which will be used to count occurrences of 'L' at even indices and 'R' at odd indices.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the indices of the string S.
For each index i, the code checks if i is even (i%2==0). If it is even and the character at that index is 'L', it increments a by 1.
If the index i is odd (i%2==1), and the character at that index is 'R', it increments a by 1.
The loop processes the string 'RUDLUDR' as follows:
- Index 0: 'R' (even index, no increment)
- Index 1: 'U' (odd index, no increment)
- Index 2: 'D' (even index, no increment)
- Index 3: 'L' (odd index, no increment)
- Index 4: 'U' (even index, no increment)
- Index 5: 'D' (odd index, no increment)
- Index 6: 'R' (even index, no increment)
Since there are no 'L' characters at even indices and no 'R' characters at odd indices, a remains 0.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if a is 0. Since a is 0, it prints 'Yes'.
