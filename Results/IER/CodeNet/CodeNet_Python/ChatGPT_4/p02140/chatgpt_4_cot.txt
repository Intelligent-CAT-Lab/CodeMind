<<<Analysis>>>
The variables R, C, ay, ax, by, and bx are initialized to 2, 2, 0, 0, 1, 1, respectively.
This means we have a 2x2 grid, and we want to find the shortest distance and the number of shortest paths from the top-left corner (0,0) to the bottom-right corner (1,1).

The variable `dists` is initialized as a 2x2 grid with all values set to INF (a very large number, 10^9+7).
The variable `ptns` is initialized as a 2x2 grid with all values set to 0.
The starting point (0,0) in `dists` is set to 0, and in `ptns` is set to 1, indicating the distance to the start is 0 and there is 1 way to reach the start.

A deque `q` is initialized with the starting point's distance, x, and y coordinates.
The variables `dxs` and `dys` are initialized to represent the four possible directions of movement (right, down, left, up).

The variable `ans_d` is initialized as None, which will later store the shortest distance to the destination.

The while loop will run until the deque `q` is empty.
Inside the loop, it pops the first element from `q` and checks if the current distance is greater than the shortest distance found so far (`ans_d`). If it is, the loop breaks.

If the current position is the destination (1,1), `ans_d` is updated to the current distance `d`.

The loop then checks if the current distance `d` is greater than the distance recorded in `dists` for the current position. If it is, the loop continues to the next iteration.

For each of the four directions, the loop calculates the new position (nx, ny) and checks if it's within the grid bounds. If the new position is valid and the distance to it is not greater than the distance already recorded in `dists`, the loop updates `dists` and `ptns` for the new position.

Additionally, the loop considers teleporting to the opposite edge of the grid (wrapping around) and updates `dists` and `ptns` accordingly.

Finally, the loop prints the shortest distance `ans_d` and the number of shortest paths to the destination `ptns[by][bx]` modulo MOD.

Given the input `2 2 0 0 1 1`, the shortest distance from (0,0) to (1,1) is 2, and there are two shortest paths: right-down or down-right.
