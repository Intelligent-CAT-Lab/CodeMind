<<<Analysis>>>
The input string "1 2 +" is split into a list ['1', '2', '+'] and stored in the variable N.
An instance of the class stack is created with an empty list as its initial value and assigned to the variable Output.
The code then iterates over each element in the list N.
For the first element '1', since it is a digit, it is pushed onto the stack.
For the second element '2', since it is also a digit, it is pushed onto the stack.
For the third element '+', since it is not a digit, the code performs the following operations:
- It pops the top element of the stack, which is '2', and stores it in temp1 as an integer.
- It pops the next top element of the stack, which is '1', and stores it in temp2 as an integer.
- Since the element is '+', it adds temp2 and temp1 (1 + 2) and pushes the result (3) back onto the stack.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value on the stack, which is 3.
