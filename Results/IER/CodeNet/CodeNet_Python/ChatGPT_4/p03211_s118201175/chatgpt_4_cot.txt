The variable s is initialized to the string '1234567876'.
The variable a is set to the length of s, which is 10.
The variable c is initialized to 10000, which will be used to find the minimum difference.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to a-3 (inclusive), meaning it will consider indices from 0 to 7.
For each index i in this range, it extracts a substring of length 3 starting at index i (s[i:i+3]) and converts it to an integer.
It then calculates the absolute difference between this integer and 753.
The code updates c to be the minimum of its current value and the newly calculated difference.
The differences calculated for each substring are as follows:
- |753 - 123| = 630
- |753 - 234| = 519
- |753 - 345| = 408
- |753 - 456| = 297
- |753 - 567| = 186
- |753 - 678| = 75
- |753 - 787| = 34
- |753 - 876| = 123
The minimum difference found is 34.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of c, which is 34.

34
