The variable N is initialized to 10000.
The function 'function' is defined to return the maximum length of the string representations of two numbers a and b.
The variable 'mini' is initialized to the length of the string representation of N, which is 5.
The variable 'lim' is initialized to the length of the string representation of the square root of N, converted to an integer, which is 2 (since the square root of 10000 is 100).
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to the integer part of the square root of N (inclusive), which is from 2 to 100.
The loop has a condition to break if 'mini' is equal to 'lim'. Since 'mini' starts at 5 and 'lim' is 2, the loop will not break on this condition initially.
Inside the loop, the code checks if N is divisible by i (i.e., if i is a factor of N).
If N is divisible by i, the code checks if 'mini' is greater than the result of the function called with i and N//i (the other factor of N corresponding to i).
If 'mini' is greater, 'mini' is updated to the result of the function.
The function will return the length of the larger of the two factors in terms of the number of digits.
The smallest 'mini' can be is the length of the larger factor when N is a perfect square, which is 2 in this case (since 100 is the square root of 10000 and has 2 digits).
Since 10000 is a perfect square (100 * 100), the loop will find this factorization and set 'mini' to 2.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of 'mini', which is 2.
