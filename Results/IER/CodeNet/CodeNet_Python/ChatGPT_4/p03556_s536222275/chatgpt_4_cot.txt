<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 10.
The code calculates the square root of n using math.sqrt(n), which is math.sqrt(10).
The result of math.sqrt(10) is then converted to an integer by assigning it to variable x, which truncates the decimal part. The square root of 10 is approximately 3.162, so when converted to an integer, x becomes 3.
The code then calculates x squared, which is 3**2, resulting in 9.
Finally, the code prints the value of x squared, which is 9.
<<<Output>>>
9
