<<<Analysis>>>
The code is designed to create a weighted graph represented as an adjacency matrix, with the weights determined by a specific sequence of numbers. Here's a step-by-step analysis:

1. The variable N is initialized to 3, which represents the number of nodes in the graph.

2. A list A is initialized with the values [1, 2, 4].

3. A loop runs 12 times to extend the list A with new values. In each iteration:
   - sum_2 is a set of the sums of all pairs of elements in A.
   - avoid is a set of differences between each element in sum_2 and each element in A.
   - x is the minimum number from the set of natural numbers up to 999 that is not in avoid, sum_2, or A.
   - The new x is appended to A.

4. After the loop, A contains a sequence of numbers that are chosen such that no two numbers in A, and no number plus another number in A, are the same.

5. A list of lists L is created, which will store the weights of the edges in the graph. It is initialized with N lists, each with decreasing length starting from N-1 to 0.

6. The variable x is initialized to 1.

7. Another loop runs for N iterations to fill the list L with weights:
   - Each list in L is filled with the product of x and the first N-1-n elements of A.
   - If n is less than N-2, x is updated to be the sum of the last two elements of the current list in L.

8. A list of lists graph is created to represent the adjacency matrix of the graph. It is initialized with N lists, each containing N zeros.

9. Two nested loops fill the graph with the weights from L:
   - The upper triangle of the adjacency matrix is filled with the weights from L.
   - The lower triangle is filled to mirror the upper triangle since the graph is undirected.

10. Finally, the adjacency matrix is printed row by row.

Given the input `3`, the code will create a graph with 3 nodes and calculate the weights for the edges based on the sequence generated in A. The output will be the adjacency matrix of this graph.
