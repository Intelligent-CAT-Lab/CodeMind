<<<Analysis>>>
The input string s is initialized to "BBW".
The variable n is set to the length of s, which is 3.
The variable cnt is initialized to 0, which will count the number of 'B's encountered.
The variable total is initialized to 0, which will accumulate the total number of moves required.

The code then enters a loop that iterates over the characters of the string s.
For the first character 'B', cnt is incremented to 1, and total remains 0 because the character is 'B'.
For the second character 'B', cnt is incremented to 2, and total remains 0 because the character is still 'B'.
For the third character 'W', total is increased by cnt, which is 2. So, total becomes 2.

After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of total, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
