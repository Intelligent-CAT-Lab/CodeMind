The variable n is initialized to 25.
The variable lr_cnt is initialized to a 10x10 matrix of zeros. This matrix will be used to count occurrences of numbers with specific first and last digits.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 25.
For each number i in this range, it converts the number to a string to easily access the first and last digits.
The first digit is obtained by taking the first character of the string representation of i, and the last digit is obtained by taking the last character.
These digits are converted back to integers and used to index into the lr_cnt matrix, incrementing the count at the position corresponding to the first and last digits.
After populating the lr_cnt matrix, the code initializes ans to 0.
The code then enters a nested loop to iterate over all pairs of digits (i, j) from 0 to 9.
For each pair (i, j), it multiplies the count of numbers starting with i and ending with j (lr_cnt[i][j]) by the count of numbers starting with j and ending with i (lr_cnt[j][i]) and adds the result to ans.
This effectively counts all pairs of numbers where the first digit of one is the last digit of the other and vice versa.
After the nested loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans.

Let's calculate the lr_cnt matrix for the given input:
- Numbers from 1 to 9 have the same start and end digit, so lr_cnt[1][1], lr_cnt[2][2], ..., lr_cnt[9][9] will each be incremented by 1.
- Number 10 has start digit 1 and end digit 0, so lr_cnt[1][0] will be incremented by 1.
- Numbers 11 to 19 have start digit 1 and end digits 1 to 9, so lr_cnt[1][1] to lr_cnt[1][9] will each be incremented by 1.
- Number 20 has start digit 2 and end digit 0, so lr_cnt[2][0] will be incremented by 1.
- Numbers 21 to 25 have start digit 2 and end digits 1 to 5, so lr_cnt[2][1] to lr_cnt[2][5] will each be incremented by 1.

The lr_cnt matrix will look like this:
```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
...
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```
Now, we calculate ans by multiplying the counts:
- For i = 1 and j = 0, ans += lr_cnt[1][0] * lr_cnt[0][1] = 1 * 0 = 0
- For i = 1 and j = 1, ans += lr_cnt[1][1] * lr_cnt[1][1] = 2 * 2 = 4
- For i = 1 and j = 2, ans += lr_cnt[1][2] * lr_cnt[2][1] = 1 * 1 = 1
- For i = 1 and j = 3, ans += lr_cnt[1][3] * lr_cnt[3][1] = 1 * 0 = 0
- ...
- For i = 2 and j = 1, ans += lr_cnt[2][1] * lr_cnt[1][2] = 1 * 1 = 1
- For i = 2 and j = 2, ans += lr_cnt[2][2] * lr_cnt[2][2] = 1 * 1 = 1
- ...
- The rest of the pairs will contribute 0 to ans because either lr_cnt[i][j] or lr_cnt[j][i] (or both) will be 0.

Adding up all the contributions, we get ans = 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 7.
