<<<Analysis>>>
The variable d is initialized to 1.000, which is a float value.
The code calculates two values: int(d) + 1 and d * 2**0.5.
For the first value, int(d) converts the float 1.000 to the integer 1, and then adds 1, resulting in 2.
For the second value, d * 2**0.5 calculates the square root of 2 (approximately 1.41421356237) and multiplies it by d (which is 1.000), resulting in approximately 1.41421356237.
The code then prints the maximum of these two values, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
