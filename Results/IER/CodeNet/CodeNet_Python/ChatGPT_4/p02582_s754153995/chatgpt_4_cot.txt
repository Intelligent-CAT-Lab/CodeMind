<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a main function that reads a string input and checks for the presence of consecutive 'R' characters.
The input string 'RRS' is read and stored in variable s.
The code then checks for specific patterns in the string s:
- If the string is exactly "RRR", it will print 3.
- If the string contains "RR" (which means there are at least two consecutive 'R's), it will print 2.
- If the string contains at least one 'R', it will print 1.
- If none of the above conditions are met, it will print 0.
Since the input string 'RRS' contains "RR", the second condition is met, and the code will print 2.
<<<Output>>>
