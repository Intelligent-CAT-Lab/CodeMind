The function `resolve()` is defined and then called at the end of the script.
The variables N and L are initialized to 5 and 2, respectively, from the input.
An empty list `Ts` is created to store the taste values of the apples.
The variable `offset` is calculated as L - 1, which is 1 in this case.
Variables `absmin` and `mini` are initialized to infinity to find the minimum absolute taste value and the corresponding taste value.
A loop runs from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 5.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the taste value by adding `offset` to i and appends it to the list `Ts`.
It also checks if the absolute value of the current taste value is less than `absmin`. If it is, it updates `absmin` and `mini` with the new minimum values.
After the loop, the function prints the sum of all taste values in `Ts` minus the `mini`, which is the taste value with the minimum absolute value.
The taste values calculated will be 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
The minimum absolute taste value is 2, and the corresponding taste value is also 2.
The sum of all taste values is 20.
The final output is the sum of all taste values minus the taste value with the minimum absolute value, which is 20 - 2 = 18.
<<<Output>>>
