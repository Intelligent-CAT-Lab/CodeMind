<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized to 3.
The expression (N % 2 + 1) calculates the remainder of N divided by 2 and then adds 1 to it. Since 3 is odd, 3 % 2 is 1, and adding 1 gives us 2.
The code then prints the product of N and the result of the previous expression, which is 3 * 2.
The final result is 6.
<<<Output>>>
6
