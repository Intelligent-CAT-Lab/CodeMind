The variable L is initialized to 4.
The variable s is assigned the binary representation of L without the '0b' prefix, which is '100'.
The variable l is assigned the length of s minus 1, which is 2.
The variable ans is initialized to an empty list, which will store the operations.

The first for loop iterates over the range of l (which is 2), so it will iterate twice with i taking values 0 and 1.
In each iteration, two operations are appended to ans:
- The first operation appends [i+1, i+2, 2**(l-i-1)], which will be [1, 2, 2] for i=0 and [2, 3, 1] for i=1.
- The second operation appends [i+1, i+2, 0], which will be [1, 2, 0] for i=0 and [2, 3, 0] for i=1.

The variable u is initialized to 2**l, which is 4.

The second for loop iterates over the range of 1 to l+1 (which is 3), so it will iterate twice with k taking values 1 and 2.
It checks if the k-th character of s is not '0'. Since s is '100', only the first character is not '0'.
For k=1, it appends [1, k+1, u] to ans, which is [1, 2, 4].
Then it updates u to u + 2**(l-k), which becomes 4 + 2**(2-1) = 6.

The code prints l+1 and the length of ans, which is 3 and 6, respectively.
Finally, it prints each operation in ans.
