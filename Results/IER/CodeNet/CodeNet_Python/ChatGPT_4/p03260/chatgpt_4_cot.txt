<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a and b are initialized to 3 and 1, respectively.
The code checks if both a and b are odd numbers by checking if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0.
Since 3 % 2 is 1 and 1 % 2 is 1, both conditions are true, indicating that both a and b are odd.
Because both conditions are met, the code will print "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
