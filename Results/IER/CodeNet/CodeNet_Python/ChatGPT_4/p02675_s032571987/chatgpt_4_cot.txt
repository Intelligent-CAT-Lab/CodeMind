<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized to 16.
The variable i is assigned the string representation of the last digit of N, which is '6'.
The strings hon, pon, and bon are initialized with specific digits.
The code checks if the last digit of N (i) is in the string hon, pon, or bon.
Since '6' is in the string pon, the condition i in pon is True.
Therefore, the code will print "pon".
<<<Output>>>
pon
