The variable N is initialized to 2.
Variables n, h, and w are initialized to 0, which will be used to store the solution.
The code then enters a nested loop, iterating over i from 1 to 3500 and j from 1 to 3500.
For each pair (i, j), it calculates tmp1 as N * i * j and tmp2 as (4 * i * j) - (N * j) - (N * i).
It checks if tmp2 is not equal to 0 to avoid division by zero.
If tmp2 is not zero, it calculates the division of tmp1 by tmp2 using divmod, which returns the quotient s and the remainder m.
If the remainder m is 0 and the quotient s is greater than or equal to 0, it means that the division is exact and a solution is found.
The variables n, h, and w are then set to i, j, and s respectively, and the solution is printed.
The code then exits, so it will only print the first solution it finds.
The first solution found for N=2 is when i=1 and j=4, which gives tmp1 = 2 * 1 * 4 = 8 and tmp2 = (4 * 1 * 4) - (2 * 4) - (2 * 1) = 16 - 8 - 2 = 6.
The division of tmp1 by tmp2 gives s = 8 // 6 = 1 and m = 8 % 6 = 2, which is not a valid solution since m is not 0.
The next solution is when i=1 and j=5, which gives tmp1 = 2 * 1 * 5 = 10 and tmp2 = (4 * 1 * 5) - (2 * 5) - (2 * 1) = 20 - 10 - 2 = 8.
The division of tmp1 by tmp2 gives s = 10 // 8 = 1 and m = 10 % 8 = 2, which is not a valid solution since m is not 0.
The next solution is when i=1 and j=6, which gives tmp1 = 2 * 1 * 6 = 12 and tmp2 = (4 * 1 * 6) - (2 * 6) - (2 * 1) = 24 - 12 - 2 = 10.
The division of tmp1 by tmp2 gives s = 12 // 10 = 1 and m = 12 % 10 = 2, which is not a valid solution since m is not 0.
The next solution is when i=1 and j=7, which gives tmp1 = 2 * 1 * 7 = 14 and tmp2 = (4 * 1 * 7) - (2 * 7) - (2 * 1) = 28 - 14 - 2 = 12.
The division of tmp1 by tmp2 gives s = 14 // 12 = 1 and m = 14 % 12 = 2, which is not a valid solution since m is not 0.
The next solution is when i=1 and j=8, which gives tmp1 = 2 * 1 * 8 = 16 and tmp2 = (4 * 1 * 8) - (2 * 8) - (2 * 1) = 32 - 16 - 2 = 14.
The division of tmp1 by tmp2 gives s = 16 // 14 = 1 and m = 16 % 14 = 2, which is not a valid solution since m is not 0.
The next solution is when i=1 and j=9, which gives tmp1 = 2 * 1 * 9 = 18 and tmp2 = (4 * 1 * 9) - (2 * 9) - (2 * 1) = 36 - 18 - 2 = 16.
The division of tmp1 by tmp2 gives s = 18 // 16 = 1 and m = 18 % 16 = 2, which is not a valid solution since m is not 0.
The next solution is when i=1 and j=10, which gives tmp1 = 2 * 1 * 10 = 20 and tmp2 = (4 * 1 * 10) - (2 * 10) - (2 * 1) = 40 - 20 - 2 = 18.
The division of tmp1 by tmp2 gives s = 20 // 18 = 1 and m
