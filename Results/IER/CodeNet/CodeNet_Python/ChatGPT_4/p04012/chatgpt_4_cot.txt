<<<Analysis>>>
The variable Alfa is initialized with the lowercase English alphabet.
The variable w is initialized with the input string "abaccaba".
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each character in Alfa.
For each character i in Alfa, the code checks if the count of i in w is odd by using the modulo operator.
If any character has an odd count, the code prints "No" and exits the loop (and the program).
The input string "abaccaba" has the following counts for each character: a=4, b=2, c=2. All other letters have a count of 0.
Since all characters in the string that appear have even counts, the loop completes without printing "No".
After the loop finishes without exiting, the code prints "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
