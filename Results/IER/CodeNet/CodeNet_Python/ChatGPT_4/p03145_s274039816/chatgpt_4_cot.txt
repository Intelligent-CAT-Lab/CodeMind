<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a, b, and c are initialized to 3, 4, and 5, respectively, from the input.
The code then calculates the product of a and b, which is 3 * 4 = 12.
It then divides this product by 2 using integer division (//), which results in 12 // 2 = 6.
The result of this calculation is printed, which is 6.
<<<Output>>>
6
