<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 3.
The variable s is assigned the value of the factorial of n, which is math.factorial(3) or 3! (3 factorial), which equals 3 * 2 * 1 = 6.
The variable ans is then calculated as the remainder of s divided by (10**9 + 7), which is a large prime number often used for modulo operations in programming contests to prevent integer overflow.
Since 6 is less than 10**9 + 7, the modulo operation will just return 6.
The code then prints the value of ans, which is 6.
<<<Output>>>
6
