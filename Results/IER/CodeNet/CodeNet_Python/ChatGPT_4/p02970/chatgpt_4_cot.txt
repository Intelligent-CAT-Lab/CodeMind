The function `solve()` is defined and then called in the `if __name__ == '__main__':` block.
The input `6 2` is read and split into two integers `n` and `d`, which are assigned the values 6 and 2, respectively.
The expression `-(-n // (2*d + 1))` is evaluated as follows:
- `2*d + 1` is calculated to be `2*2 + 1`, which equals 5.
- `n // (2*d + 1)` is `6 // 5`, which equals 1 because `//` is the floor division operator.
- `-(-n // (2*d + 1))` is then `-(-1)`, which equals 1 because the double negative cancels out.
The result of the expression is printed, which is 1.
