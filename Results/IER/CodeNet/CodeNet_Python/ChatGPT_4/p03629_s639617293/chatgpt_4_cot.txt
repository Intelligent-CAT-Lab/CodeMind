The input string is `atcoderregularcontest` and its length N is 21.
The variable `a` is initialized to the ASCII value of the character 'a'.
A 2D list `edge` is created with dimensions (N+1) x 26, initialized with values N+1. This list will be used to store the next position of each character in the alphabet for each index in the input string.

The code then fills the `edge` list in reverse order, starting from the end of the input string. For each character in the input string, it updates the corresponding entry in `edge` to point to the index of the character plus one.

A list `recon` of length N+2 is created to store the previous vertex and character for the shortest path reconstruction.

A deque `q` is initialized with the starting vertex 0.

The code enters a while loop that continues until the deque is empty or until it reaches the vertex N+1. Inside the loop, it pops the leftmost element of the deque and checks all 26 possible next characters. If the next vertex for a character has not been visited (i.e., `recon` at that index is None), it updates `recon` with the current vertex and character, and appends the next vertex to the deque.

After the loop, the code reconstructs the shortest path by starting from vertex N+1 and moving backwards through the `recon` list, collecting characters along the way.

Finally, it prints the collected characters in reverse order, which represents the shortest string that contains all substrings of the input string that start with each letter of the alphabet exactly once.

The output will be the shortest string that contains all substrings of the input string that start with each letter of the alphabet exactly once. Since the input string contains all letters of the alphabet, the output will be the alphabet itself.
