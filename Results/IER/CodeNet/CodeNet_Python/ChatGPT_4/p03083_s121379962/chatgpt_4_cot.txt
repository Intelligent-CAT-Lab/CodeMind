<<<Analysis>>>
The code is designed to calculate and print a series of values based on the input B and W, which are 2 and 1 respectively in this case. The calculations involve modular arithmetic with a modulus of 10^9+7.

First, the code initializes several lists: fact, fact_inv, two, and two_inv, each of size U+1, where U is 2*10^5. These lists will store factorial values, factorial inverses, powers of 2, and inverses of powers of 2, respectively.

The loop from 1 to U+1 populates the fact and two lists with factorial values and powers of 2 modulo MOD. Then, the code calculates the inverse of the last factorial and power of 2 using the pow function with exponent MOD-2, which is based on Fermat's little theorem for calculating modular inverses.

The second loop from U down to 1 populates the fact_inv and two_inv lists with the modular inverses of the factorial values and powers of 2.

The comb function is a helper function that calculates the binomial coefficient (n choose k) modulo MOD using the precomputed factorial and factorial inverse values.

The code then initializes p and q to 0. These variables will accumulate certain values during the loop from 1 to B+W+1.

Inside the loop, the code calculates a value ans, which is initially set to 1 - p + q, then multiplied by the inverse of 2 (two_inv[1]), and taken modulo MOD. This value ans is printed on each iteration.

The variables p and q are updated on each iteration by adding the value of the binomial coefficient (i-1 choose B-1 or W-1) multiplied by the inverse of 2^i (two_inv[i]), and taken modulo MOD.

Given the input `2 1`, the loop will run for i from 1 to 3 (B+W+1). The output will be the value of ans for each iteration.

Let's calculate the output step by step:
- For i = 1, ans = (1 - 0 + 0) * two_inv[1] % MOD = 1 * 500000004 % MOD = 500000004
- p is updated with comb(0, 1) * two_inv[1] % MOD = 0 (since comb(0, 1) is 0)
- q is updated with comb(0, 0) * two_inv[1] % MOD = 1 * 500000004 % MOD = 500000004

- For i = 2, ans = (1 - 0 + 500000004) * two_inv[1] % MOD = 500000005 * 500000004 % MOD = 500000009
- p is updated with comb(1, 1) * two_inv[2] % MOD = 1 * 250000002 % MOD = 250000002
- q is updated with comb(1, 0) * two_inv[2] % MOD = 1 * 250000002 % MOD = 250000002

- For i = 3, ans = (1 - 250000002 + 250000002) * two_inv[1] % MOD = 1 * 500000004 % MOD = 500000004
- p is updated with comb(2, 1) * two_inv[3] % MOD = 2 * 166666668 % MOD = 333333336
- q is updated with comb(2, 0) * two_inv[3] % MOD = 1 * 166666668 % MOD = 166666668

The output will be the value of ans for each iteration, which is 500000004, 500000009, and 500000004.
