<<<Analysis>>>
The variable x is initialized to 103.
The variable y is initialized to 100, and ans is initialized to 0.
The code enters a while loop that will continue as long as y is less than x.
Inside the loop, ans is incremented by 1 each time.
y is updated to be the floor of itself multiplied by 1.01. This simulates a 1% increase of y, rounded down to the nearest integer.
The loop runs as follows:
1. y = 100, y < x (100 < 103) is true, ans becomes 1, y becomes floor(100 * 1.01) = 101.
2. y = 101, y < x (101 < 103) is true, ans becomes 2, y becomes floor(101 * 1.01) = 102.
3. y = 102, y < x (102 < 103) is true, ans becomes 3, y becomes floor(102 * 1.01) = 103.
4. y = 103, y < x (103 < 103) is false, the loop ends.
The code prints the final value of ans, which is 3.
