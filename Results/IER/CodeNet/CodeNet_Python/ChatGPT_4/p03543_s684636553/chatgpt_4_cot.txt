<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with the string '1118'.
The code checks if the first three characters of n are the same or if the second, third, and fourth characters are the same.
In this case, n[0], n[1], and n[2] are all '1', which means the condition n[0]==n[1]==n[2] is True.
Since the first condition is True, the code does not need to check the second condition.
The code then proceeds to print "Yes" because the condition for printing "Yes" has been met.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
