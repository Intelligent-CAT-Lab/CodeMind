<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a and b are initialized to 4 and 10, respectively.
The variable total is initialized to 1, and ans is initialized to 0.
The code enters a while loop that will continue as long as total is less than b (10 in this case).
Inside the loop, ans is incremented by 1 each time.
The total is increased by a-1 (which is 4-1=3) each time the loop runs.
The loop runs as follows:
- First iteration: total = 1 + 3 = 4, ans = 1
- Second iteration: total = 4 + 3 = 7, ans = 2
- Third iteration: total = 7 + 3 = 10, ans = 3
The loop stops because total is now equal to b.
The code prints the final value of ans, which is 3.
