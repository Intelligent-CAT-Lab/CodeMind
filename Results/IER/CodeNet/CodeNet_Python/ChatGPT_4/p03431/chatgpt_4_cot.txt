The variables n and k are initialized to 2 and 4, respectively.
The variable p is set to 998244353, which is a large prime number often used in modular arithmetic problems.
The variable f is initialized as a list containing a single element 1. This list will be used to store factorial values modulo p.
The code then enters a loop to populate the list f with factorial values up to k (not including k). The expression `-~i` is equivalent to `i + 1`, so the loop calculates the factorial of each number up to k-1 modulo p and appends it to the list f.
After the loop, f contains the values [1, 1, 2, 6], which are the factorials of 0, 1, 2, and 3 modulo p.
The code then prints the sum of a series of terms, each term being the product of f[-2] (which is the second-to-last element of f, i.e., 6) and the modular inverse of the product f[i]*f[-2-i] modulo p, for i in the range from n-1 to k (not including k). Since n is 2, the range is from 1 to 4.
The modular inverse is calculated using the pow function with the third argument p, which computes the inverse modulo p.
The sum is taken over the range, but since n is 2, the range only includes the single value i=1. Therefore, the sum consists of only one term.
The term is calculated as follows: f[-2] * pow(f[1]*f[-2-1], -1, p) = 6 * pow(1*2, -1, p) = 6 * pow(2, -1, p).
The modular inverse of 2 modulo p is 499122177, so the term becomes 6 * 499122177.
The product is then taken modulo p, which results in 2994733062 modulo 998244353, which simplifies to 4.
The sum consists of this single term, so the final result printed is 4.
