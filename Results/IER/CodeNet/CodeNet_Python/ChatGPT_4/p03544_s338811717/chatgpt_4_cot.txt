<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 5.
The list a is initialized with the elements [2, 1].
The code then enters a loop that iterates 4 times (since n-1 is 4).
In each iteration, it appends to the list a new element which is the sum of the last two elements of the list.
Iteration 1: a = [2, 1, 3] (2 + 1)
Iteration 2: a = [2, 1, 3, 4] (1 + 3)
Iteration 3: a = [2, 1, 3, 4, 7] (3 + 4)
Iteration 4: a = [2, 1, 3, 4, 7, 11] (4 + 7)
After the loop finishes, the code prints the last element of the list a, which is 11.
<<<Output>>>
11
