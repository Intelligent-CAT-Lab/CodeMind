<<<Analysis>>>
The variable X is initialized to 1024.
The code calculates how many times 500 fits into X using integer division (//), which is 2 times for 1024.
This result is then multiplied by 1000, giving 2000.
Next, the code calculates the remainder of X divided by 500 using the modulus operator (%), which is 24 for 1024.
It then calculates how many times 5 fits into the remainder using integer division, which is 4 times for 24.
This result is multiplied by 5, giving 20.
Finally, the code adds the two results together, which is 2000 + 20, giving 2020.
<<<Output>>>
2020
