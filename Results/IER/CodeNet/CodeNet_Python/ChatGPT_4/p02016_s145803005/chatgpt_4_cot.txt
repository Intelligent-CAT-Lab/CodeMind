<<<Analysis>>>
The variable a is initialized with the input string 'ani'.
The code then checks if the value of a is equal to the string 'ani'.
Since the input is 'ani', the condition a == 'ani' is True.
Therefore, the code executes the first branch of the if statement and prints 'square1001'.
<<<Output>>>
square1001
