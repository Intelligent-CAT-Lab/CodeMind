The variable n is initialized to 105.
The function cnt_divisor(n) is defined to count the number of divisors of a given number n.
The variable cnt is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the count of numbers with exactly 8 divisors.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 105.
For each number j in this range, the code first checks if j is even (j % 2 == 0). If it is, the loop continues to the next iteration without executing further code for that j (due to the continue statement).
If j is odd, the code calls cnt_divisor(j) to get the number of divisors of j.
If the number of divisors is exactly 8, cnt is incremented by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of cnt, which is the count of odd numbers between 1 and 105 that have exactly 8 divisors.
We need to manually check the odd numbers between 1 and 105 to see which have exactly 8 divisors. The numbers with exactly 8 divisors are 15, 21, 35, 55, 77, and 105.
Therefore, the output will be the count of these numbers, which is 6.
