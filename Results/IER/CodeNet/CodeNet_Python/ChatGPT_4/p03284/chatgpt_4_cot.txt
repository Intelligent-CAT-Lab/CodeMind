<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function `main()` which is then called at the end of the script if the script is run as the main program.
The function reads two integers from the input, `n` and `k`, which are 7 and 3 in this case.
It then checks if `n` is divisible by `k` without any remainder using the modulo operator `%`.
If `n` is divisible by `k` (`n % k == 0`), it prints `0`.
If `n` is not divisible by `k` (`n % k != 0`), it prints `1`.
Since 7 is not divisible by 3 (7 % 3 is 1, not 0), the condition `n % k == 0` is false.
Therefore, the else part of the condition will execute, and the code will print `1`.
