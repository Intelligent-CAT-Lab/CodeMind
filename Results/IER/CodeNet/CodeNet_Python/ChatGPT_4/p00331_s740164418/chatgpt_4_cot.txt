<<<Analysis>>>
The variables H and R are initialized to -3 and 3, respectively.
The code then evaluates the expression `0 if H+R==0 else(1 if 0<=H+R else -1)`.
Since H+R equals 0 (-3 + 3 = 0), the condition `H+R==0` is true.
Therefore, the code will print 0, as specified by the first part of the conditional expression.
<<<Output>>>
0
