<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized to 0.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of times N can be divided by 2.
The code enters a while loop that continues as long as N is not zero.
Since N is already 0, the while loop condition is not satisfied, and the loop is not executed.
The code then prints the final value of ans, which is 0.
<<<Output>>>
0
