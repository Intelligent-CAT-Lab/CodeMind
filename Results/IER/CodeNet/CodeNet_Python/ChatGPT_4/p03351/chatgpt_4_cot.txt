<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a, b, c, and d are initialized to 4, 7, 9, and 3, respectively.
The code checks two conditions using the logical 'or' operator:
1. If the absolute difference between a and c is less than or equal to d, which is abs(4-9) <= 3, which evaluates to False because 5 is not less than or equal to 3.
2. If the absolute difference between a and b is less than or equal to d AND the absolute difference between b and c is less than or equal to d, which is abs(4-7) <= 3 and abs(7-9) <= 3, which evaluates to True because both 3 and 2 are less than or equal to 3.

Since the second part of the condition is True, the entire condition inside the not operator evaluates to True. The not operator then negates this to False.

The string "YNeos" is sliced with a step of 2, resulting in "Yes" if the condition is False and "No" if the condition is True.

Since the condition is False, the slice will start from index 0, resulting in "Yes".

Yes
