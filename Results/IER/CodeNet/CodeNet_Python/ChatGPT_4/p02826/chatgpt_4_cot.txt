<<<Analysis>>>
The code is designed to perform a complex mathematical computation involving modular arithmetic, fast Fourier transforms (FFT), and polynomial operations. However, without the actual input from `sys.stdin.buffer`, which is expected to be provided during the runtime of the script, it is impossible to execute the code and determine the output.

The code defines several functions for mathematical operations such as `cumprod`, `make_fact`, `fft_convolve`, and `fps_exp`. These functions are used to compute factorials, inverses, and perform polynomial exponentiation under a given modulus.

The input `2 998244353` sets `N` to 2 and `MOD` to 998244353. The code then initializes several arrays and performs operations on them using the functions defined earlier. The final result is stored in the variable `answer`, which is the sum of the first `N` elements of the array `g` modulo `MOD`.

Since the code relies on NumPy for array operations and FFT, and the input is read from the standard input buffer, which is not provided in this context, we cannot execute the code step by step to determine the output.

<<<Output>>>
Unable to determine the output without executing the code with the provided input.
