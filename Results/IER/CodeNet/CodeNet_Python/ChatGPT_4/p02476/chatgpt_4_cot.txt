<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a and b are initialized with the values 5 and 8, respectively, from the input.
The code then calculates the remainder of the division of a by b, which is 5 % 8.
Since 5 is less than 8, the remainder of the division is 5 itself.
The code then prints the result of the remainder operation.
<<<Output>>>
5
