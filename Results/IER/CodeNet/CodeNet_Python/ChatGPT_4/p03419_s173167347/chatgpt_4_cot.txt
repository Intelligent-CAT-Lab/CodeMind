<<<Analysis>>>
The variables n and m are initialized to 2 and 2, respectively.
The first if condition checks if both n and m are equal to 1, which is not the case here.
The elif condition checks if either n or m is equal to 1, which is also not the case here.
Since neither of the first two conditions are met, the code executes the else block.
The else block calculates the expression (n-2)*(m-2), which is (2-2)*(2-2) = 0*0 = 0.
The code then prints the result of this calculation, which is 0.
<<<Output>>>
0
