<<<Analysis>>>
The input provided is '4 2', which means N is 4 and k is 2.
The main function is called with these values.

The variables p and p2 are initialized to 0.
The variable memo is initialized but not used in the function.
The function enters a loop that will iterate N-1 times, which is 3 times in this case.

In the first iteration (i=0):
- p is set to the current value of p2, which is 0.
- p2 is calculated as k*(p2+1)//(k-1) - 2, which is 2*(0+1)//(1) - 2 = 2 - 2 = 0.
- The while loop checks if p2-1-p2//k != p, which is 0-1-0//2 != 0, which is False. So, the while loop is not executed.

In the second iteration (i=1):
- p is set to the current value of p2, which is 0.
- p2 is calculated as 2*(0+1)//(1) - 2 = 2 - 2 = 0 again.
- The while loop checks if 0-1-0//2 != 0, which is False. So, the while loop is not executed.

In the third iteration (i=2):
- p is set to the current value of p2, which is 0.
- p2 is calculated as 2*(0+1)//(1) - 2 = 2 - 2 = 0 again.
- The while loop checks if 0-1-0//2 != 0, which is False. So, the while loop is not executed.

After the loop, the function returns p2, which is 0.

The main function prints the returned value, which is 0.
