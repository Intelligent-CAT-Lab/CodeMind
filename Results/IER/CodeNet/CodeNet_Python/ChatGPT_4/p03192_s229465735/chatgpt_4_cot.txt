<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with the string "1222".
The code then calls the count method on the string n with the argument "2", which counts the number of occurrences of the character "2" in the string.
In the string "1222", the character "2" appears three times.
Therefore, the output of the code will be the number 3.
