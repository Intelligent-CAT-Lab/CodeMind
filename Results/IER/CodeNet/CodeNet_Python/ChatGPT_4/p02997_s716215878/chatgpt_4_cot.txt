<<<Analysis>>>
The variables N and K are initialized to 5 and 3, respectively.
The variable x is calculated as (N-1)*(N-2)//2, which is (5-1)*(5-2)//2 = 4*3//2 = 6.
The code checks if x < K, which is not the case here (6 is not less than 3), so it does not print -1 and does not exit.

The variable edge is initialized with pairs (1, n) for n in the range from 2 to N+1, which results in the pairs (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), and (1, 5).
Then, itertools.combinations is used to generate all possible combinations of the numbers from 2 to N+1 taken 2 at a time. The combinations are: (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5), and (4, 5).
The code takes the first x-K combinations from this list, which is 6-3=3 combinations: (2, 3), (2, 4), and (2, 5).

The final edge list is the initial pairs plus the 3 combinations: (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 3), (2, 4), and (2, 5).
The length of the edge list is printed, which is 7.
Then, each pair in the edge list is printed on a separate line.
