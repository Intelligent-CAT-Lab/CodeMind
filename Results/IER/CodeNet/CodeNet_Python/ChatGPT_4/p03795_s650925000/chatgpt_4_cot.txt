The variable n is initialized to 20.
The variable N is calculated as the integer division of n by 15, which is 20 // 15, resulting in 1.
The print statement calculates the value 800*n - 200*N, which is 800*20 - 200*1, resulting in 16000 - 200.
The final result of the calculation is 15800.
<<<Output>>>
