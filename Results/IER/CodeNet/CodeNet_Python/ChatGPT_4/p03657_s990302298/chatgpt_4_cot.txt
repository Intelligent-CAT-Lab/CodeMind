<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a and b are initialized to 4 and 5, respectively.
The code checks if either a or b is divisible by 3, or if their sum (a+b) is divisible by 3.
Since neither 4 nor 5 is divisible by 3, the first two conditions are false.
However, the sum of a and b is 9 (4+5), which is divisible by 3.
Therefore, the condition (a+b)%3==0 is true.
Since one of the conditions for printing "Possible" is met, the code will print "Possible".
<<<Output>>>
Possible
