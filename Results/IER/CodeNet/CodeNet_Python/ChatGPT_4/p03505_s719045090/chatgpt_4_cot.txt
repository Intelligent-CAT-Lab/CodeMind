The variables K, A, and B are initialized to 4000, 2000, and 500, respectively.
The ceil function is defined as a lambda function that takes two arguments a and b and returns the ceiling of the division of a by b.

First, the code checks if A is greater than or equal to K. Since A (2000) is not greater than or equal to K (4000), it does not print 1 and does not exit.

Next, it calculates p as A - B, which is 2000 - 500 = 1500. Since p is greater than 0, it does not print -1 and does not exit.

The variable ans is initialized to 1.

The code then calculates ceil(K - A, A - B) which is ceil(4000 - 2000, 2000 - 500) = ceil(2000, 1500). The ceil function will return the smallest integer greater than or equal to 2000/1500, which is 2 because -(-2000 // 1500) = -(-2) = 2.

The value of ans is then updated to 1 + 2 * 2, which is 1 + 4 = 5.

Finally, the code prints the value of ans, which is 5.
