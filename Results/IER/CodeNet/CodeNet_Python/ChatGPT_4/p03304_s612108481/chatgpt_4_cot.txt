<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a number of imports and utility functions, but only a few of them are relevant for the given input and the rest of the code.

The variables n, m, and d are initialized to 2, 3, and 1, respectively, by the MAP() function which reads the input and maps it to integers.

The code then checks if d is not equal to 0. Since d is 1, the condition is true.

It then calculates the expression 2*(n-d)*(m-1)/n**2 which simplifies to 2*(2-1)*(3-1)/2**2. This further simplifies to 2*1*2/4, which equals 1.

The result of the calculation is printed out.

If d were 0, the else block would execute, printing (m-1)/n, but this is not the case for the given input.

<<<Output>>>
