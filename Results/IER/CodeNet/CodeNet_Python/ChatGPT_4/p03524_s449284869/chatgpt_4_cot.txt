The variable s is initialized to the string 'abac'.
The variable a is initialized to the count of 'a' in s, which is 2.
The variable b is initialized to the count of 'b' in s, which is 1.
The variable c is initialized to the count of 'c' in s, which is 1.
The code then checks if the absolute difference between the counts of 'a' and 'b', 'b' and 'c', and 'c' and 'a' are all less than or equal to 1.
The absolute difference between a and b is |2-1| = 1.
The absolute difference between b and c is |1-1| = 0.
The absolute difference between c and a is |1-2| = 1.
Since all absolute differences are less than or equal to 1, the condition is satisfied.
Therefore, the code prints 'YES'.
<<<Output>>>
YES
