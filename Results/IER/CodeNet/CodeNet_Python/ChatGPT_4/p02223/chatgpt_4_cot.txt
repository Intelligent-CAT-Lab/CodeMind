<<<Analysis>>>
The input is a string '2', which is assigned to the variable n.
The code checks if n is equal to 1, which it is not, so it skips the first if block.
Then it checks if n is equal to 2, which it is, so it executes the code within the elif block.
The code within this block prints "2" followed by a newline, then "0" on a new line, and finally "11" on a new line.
The else block is not executed because the elif condition was met.
<<<Output>>>
2
0
11
