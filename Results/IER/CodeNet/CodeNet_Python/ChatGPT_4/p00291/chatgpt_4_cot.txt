<<<Analysis>>>
The variables c1, c5, c10, c50, c100, and c500 are initialized to 3, 1, 4, 0, 4, and 1, respectively.
The variable sum is calculated as the weighted sum of the coins, where each coin's value is multiplied by its count:
- c1 is worth 1 each, so 3 * 1 = 3
- c5 is worth 5 each, so 1 * 5 = 5
- c10 is worth 10 each, so 4 * 10 = 40
- c50 is worth 50 each, so 0 * 50 = 0
- c100 is worth 100 each, so 4 * 100 = 400
- c500 is worth 500 each, so 1 * 500 = 500
The sum of these values is 3 + 5 + 40 + 0 + 400 + 500 = 948.
The code then checks if the sum is greater than or equal to 1000. Since 948 is less than 1000, the condition is false.
Therefore, the code prints 0.
