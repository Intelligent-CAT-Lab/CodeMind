<<<Analysis>>>
The code will result in an error. The reason for the error is that the input function returns a string, and the range function requires integer arguments. The variable `n` is not converted to an integer before being used in the range function, which will cause a TypeError when the code attempts to execute the range(1, n+1) expression.

Additionally, there is a syntax error in the print statement. In Python 3, print is a function and should be used with parentheses, like print(a), not print a.
