The variable S is initialized to the string '125'.
The variable Sum is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of all possible combinations of numbers formed by splitting the string S at different positions.

The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 2**(len(S)-1) - 1, which is 1 to 2**(3-1) - 1 or 1 to 3 in this case. This loop will generate all possible binary representations of numbers from 1 to 3, which correspond to the different ways to split the string '125'.

For each iteration, a temporary list temp_list is created to store the parts of the string that are split according to the binary representation of the current number ii.

The variable temp_s is a copy of S, and itr is initialized to 1, which will be used to keep track of the current split position in the string.

The inner loop iterates over the length of the string S minus 1, which is 2 in this case. It checks each bit of the binary representation of ii to decide whether to split the string at the current position (bit is 1) or not (bit is 0).

If the bit is 1, the substring from the beginning of temp_s up to the current value of itr is converted to an integer and added to temp_list. temp_s is then updated to be the remainder of the string after the split, and itr is reset to 1.

If the bit is 0, itr is incremented, which means the split is postponed to the next position.

After the inner loop, the sum of integers in temp_list is added to Sum, and the remaining part of temp_s is also converted to an integer and added to Sum.

Finally, after the outer loop, the integer value of the original string S is added to Sum.

The code prints the final value of Sum, which is the sum of all possible combinations of numbers formed by splitting the string '125' at different positions.

Let's calculate the possible combinations:
- Splitting '125' into '1' and '25' gives us 1 + 25 = 26.
- Splitting '125' into '12' and '5' gives us 12 + 5 = 17.
- Splitting '125' into '1', '2', and '5' gives us 1 + 2 + 5 = 8.

Adding all these combinations together with the original '125' gives us 26 + 17 + 8 + 125 = 176.
