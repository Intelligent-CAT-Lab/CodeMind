<<<Analysis>>>
The variables N and K are initialized to 2 and 3, respectively.
The code uses the built-in pow function to calculate K raised to the power of N, which is 3^2, and then takes the result modulo 10^9+7.
The calculation is as follows: 3^2 = 9.
Since 9 is less than 10^9+7, the modulo operation does not change the result.
Therefore, the code will output the result of 3^2, which is 9.
<<<Output>>>
9
