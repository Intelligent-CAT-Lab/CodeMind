<<<Analysis>>>
The input string '1222' is stored in variable n.
The code extracts each character from the string and converts them to integers, storing them in variables a, b, c, and d, respectively. Thus, a=1, b=2, c=2, and d=2.
The code then checks various combinations of these numbers with addition and subtraction to see if they equal 7.
The first condition (a+b+c+d) == 7 is not true because 1+2+2+2 is 7.
The second condition (a+b+c-d) == 7 is not true because 1+2+2-2 is 3.
The third condition (a+b-c+d) == 7 is not true because 1+2-2+2 is 3.
The fourth condition (a+b-c-d) == 7 is not true because 1+2-2-2 is -1.
The fifth condition (a-b+c+d) == 7 is not true because 1-2+2+2 is 3.
The sixth condition (a-b+c-d) == 7 is not true because 1-2+2-2 is -1.
The seventh condition (a-b-c+d) == 7 is true because 1-2-2+2 is -1+2 which is 1, which is not equal to 7.
The eighth condition (a-b-c-d) == 7 is not true because 1-2-2-2 is -5.
None of the conditions are met, so there is no output for the given input '1222'.
