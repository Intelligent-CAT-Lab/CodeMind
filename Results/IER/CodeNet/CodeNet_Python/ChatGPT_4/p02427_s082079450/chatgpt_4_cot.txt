<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 4.
An empty list s is created to store strings that will be joined and printed later.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to (1 << n) - 1, which is 0 to 15 for n = 4. This is because 1 << n is the same as 2^n, which is 16 for n = 4.
For each iteration i, the code appends a string containing the current value of i followed by a colon to the list s.
Then, it enters another loop that iterates from 0 to n - 1 (0 to 3 for n = 4).
Inside this inner loop, it checks if the bit at position j is set in the binary representation of i (i & 1 << j). If it is, it appends a string containing the space character followed by the value of j to the list s.
After the inner loop, it appends a newline character to the list s.
Once all iterations are complete, the code prints the joined strings in the list s without an additional newline at the end, because end='' is specified in the print function.
The output will be a list of lines, each line starting with an integer i (from 0 to 15), followed by the indices of the set bits in the binary representation of i, separated by spaces.
