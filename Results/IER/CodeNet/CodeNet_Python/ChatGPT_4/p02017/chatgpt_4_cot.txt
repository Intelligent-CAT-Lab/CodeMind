<<<Analysis>>>
The variables H, W, X, and Y are initialized to 3, 5, 1, and 4, respectively.
The code then calculates the product of H and W, which is 3 * 5 = 15.
It then adds X and Y, which is 1 + 4 = 5.
The product of the two results is then calculated: 15 * 5 = 75.
The code checks if this product is odd by taking the modulo of 75 with 2, which is 1 (since 75 is an odd number).
Since the modulo is not 0, the condition is true, and the code prints 'No'.
<<<Output>>>
No
