The code imports the math module, which provides access to mathematical functions.
The variable r is initialized with the input value converted to a float. In this case, the input is '2', so r becomes 2.0.
The variable menseki is calculated as the area of a circle with radius r, using the formula πr^2. With r being 2.0, menseki becomes 4 * π.
The variable shuu is calculated as the circumference of a circle with radius r, using the formula 2πr. With r being 2.0, shuu becomes 4 * π.
The code prints the values of menseki and shuu formatted to six decimal places. Since π is approximately 3.141593, the calculations will be:
menseki = 4 * π ≈ 4 * 3.141593 ≈ 12.566372
shuu = 4 * π ≈ 4 * 3.141593 ≈ 12.566372
The output will be these two values formatted to six decimal places.
