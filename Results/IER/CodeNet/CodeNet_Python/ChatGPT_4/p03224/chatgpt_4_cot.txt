The variable N is initialized to 3.
The variable can_be_ans is initialized to False, which will be used to determine if there is a solution.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over k from 1 to 10^5.
For each k, it checks if 2 * N equals k * (k - 1). If it does, can_be_ans is set to True and the loop breaks.
If 2 * N is less than k * (k - 1), the loop also breaks because the values will only get larger and never equal 2 * N.
For N = 3, the loop will find that when k = 3, 2 * N is equal to k * (k - 1) (2 * 3 = 3 * (3 - 1) = 6).
Since can_be_ans is True, the code prints "Yes" and the value of k, which is 3.
Next, the code initializes a 2D list s_grid with k rows and k - 1 columns, filled with zeros.
The code then enters a nested loop to fill the s_grid with values according to the given formula.
After filling the s_grid, the code prints each row of the grid, starting with the number of elements in the row (k - 1) followed by the elements of the row separated by spaces.
The final output will be the word "Yes", the value of k, and the s_grid printed row by row.
