<<<Analysis>>>
The variables H, W, x, and y are initialized to 3, 5, 1, and 4, respectively.
The code checks if the product of H and W is odd (H*W%2==1) and if the sum of x and y is odd ((x+y)%2==1).
The product of H and W is 15 (3*5), which is odd, so the first condition (H*W%2==1) is true.
The sum of x and y is 5 (1+4), which is odd, so the second condition ((x+y)%2==1) is also true.
Since both conditions are true, the code prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
