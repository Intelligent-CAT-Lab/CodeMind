<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a main function that reads two integers as input, representing the values of cards A and B in a card game. The values are read by the li_input function, which splits the input string and converts each part to an integer.

The main function then checks if A or B is equal to 1. If either is 1, it is converted to 14. This is because, in some card games, an Ace (which is usually represented as 1) can be considered higher than a King (which is usually represented as 13). However, in this case, the input is `8 6`, so neither A nor B is equal to 1, and no conversion takes place.

Next, the function compares A and B. If A is greater than B, it prints "Alice". If A is less than B, it prints "Bob". If A and B are equal, it prints "Draw".

Given the input `8 6`, A is greater than B, so the expected output is "Alice".
