<<<Analysis>>>
The variables h, w, x, and y are initialized to 4, 5, 2, and 3, respectively.
The code then evaluates the expression `h*w%2==1 and (x+y)%2==1`.
First, it calculates the product of h and w, which is 4*5=20.
Then it checks if 20%2 is equal to 1, which is not true because 20 is an even number, so 20%2 equals 0.
Since the first part of the and condition is False, the second part `(x+y)%2==1` is not evaluated because the and operator short-circuits (if the first condition is False, the result of the and operation is False regardless of the second condition).
The code uses a list indexing trick to select "Yes" or "No". Since the condition is False, it will select the second element of the list, which is "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
