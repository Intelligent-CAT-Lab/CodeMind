<<<Analysis>>>
The variables x and y are initialized to 10 and 20, respectively.
The code then checks the value of y:
- Since y is not 0, it skips the first if block.
- Since y is greater than 0, it enters the elif block for y > 0.
- Within this block, it checks the value of x relative to y:
  - Since x is not less than or equal to -y, it skips the first if block.
  - Since x is not between -y and 0, it skips the second elif block.
  - Since x is between 0 and y (inclusive), it enters the third elif block and calculates ans as y - x, which is 20 - 10 = 10.
- The code does not enter the else block because the condition for y > 0 has already been met.

Finally, the code prints the value of ans, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
