<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a and b are initialized to 2 and 1, respectively, from the input.
The code then checks the condition `abs(a-b)>1`. In this case, `abs(2-1)` is equal to 1.
Since 1 is not greater than 1, the condition is False.
Therefore, the code will print 'Brown' because the else part of the conditional expression will be executed.
<<<Output>>>
Brown
