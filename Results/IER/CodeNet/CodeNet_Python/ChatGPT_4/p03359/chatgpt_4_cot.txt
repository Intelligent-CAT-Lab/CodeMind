<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a and b are initialized to 5 and 5, respectively, after splitting the input string and converting each part to an integer.
The code then checks if a is greater than b. Since a is not greater than b (both are equal), the condition is false.
Therefore, the else block is executed, and the code prints the value of a, which is 5.
<<<Output>>>
5
