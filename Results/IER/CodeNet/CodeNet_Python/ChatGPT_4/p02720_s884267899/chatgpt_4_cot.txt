The variable `a` is initialized to 15.
`list1` is initialized as a deque containing the numbers 1 through 9.
The variable `i` is initialized to 1, which will be used to track the number of iterations.

The code enters a while loop that will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `a`.

The loop has the following logic:
- If `i` is not equal to `a`, it pops the leftmost element from `list1` and assigns it to `k`.
- `k` is converted to a string to access its last digit.
- If the last digit of `k` is 0, it appends two new numbers to `list1`: one with an additional '0' and one with an additional '1'.
- If the last digit of `k` is 9, it appends two new numbers to `list1`: one with an additional '8' and one with an additional '9'.
- If the last digit of `k` is neither 0 nor 9, it appends three new numbers to `list1`: one with an additional digit one less than the last digit of `k`, one with the same last digit, and one with an additional digit one more than the last digit of `k`.
- After appending the new numbers, `i` is incremented by 1.

The loop continues until `i` is equal to `a`. When `i` equals `a`, the loop prints the leftmost element of `list1` and breaks.

Let's simulate the loop for the first few iterations:
- i=1: list1 starts as [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9], pops 1, appends 10, 11, 12. list1 is now [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12].
- i=2: pops 2, appends 21, 22, 23. list1 is now [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,21,22,23].
- i=3: pops 3, appends 32, 33, 34. list1 is now [4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,21,22,23,32,33,34].
- i=4: pops 4, appends 43, 44, 45. list1 is now [5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,21,22,23,32,33,34,43,44,45].
- i=5: pops 5, appends 54, 55, 56. list1 is now [6,7,8,9,10,11,12,21,22,23,32,33,34,43,44,45,54,55,56].
- i=6: pops 6, appends 65, 66, 67. list1 is now [7,8,9,10,11,12,21,22,23,32,33,34,43,44,45,54,55,56,65,66,67].
- i=7: pops 7, appends 76, 77, 78. list1 is now [8,9,10,11,12,21,22,23,32,33,34,43,44,45,54,55,56,65,66,67,76,77,78].
- i=8: pops 8, appends 87, 88, 89. list1 is now [9,10,11,12,21,22,23,32,33,34,43,44,45,54,55,56,65,66,67,76,77,78,87,88,89].
- i=9: pops 9, appends 98, 99. list1 is now [10,11,12,21,22,23,32,33,34,43,44,45,54,55,56,65,66,67,76,77,78,87,88,89,98,99].
- i=10: pops 10, appends 101. list1 is now [11,12,21,22,23,32,33,34,43,44,45,54,55,56,65,66,67,76,77,78,87,88,89,98,99,101].
- i=11: pops
