<<<Analysis>>>
The variable x_list is initialized with the list of integers from the input, which is [0, 2, 3, 4, 5].
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 4 (inclusive), which corresponds to the indices of the x_list.
For each index i, the code checks if the element at that index in x_list is 0.
If it finds an element that is 0, it prints the index plus 1 (since the problem seems to be 1-indexed).
In the given input, the first element is 0, so the condition is met at the first iteration when i is 0.
Therefore, the code prints 0+1, which is 1.
After printing, the loop continues to check the rest of the elements, but since there are no more zeros, nothing else is printed.
