The variables n and x are initialized to 4 and 4, respectively.
The code first checks if x is equal to 1 or 2 * n - 1 (which would be 7 in this case). Since x is 4, the condition is not met, and the code does not print "No" and exit.
Next, the code checks if n is equal to 2. Since n is 4, the condition is not met, and the code does not print "Yes" and the sequence 1, 2, 3, and exit.
Since x is not equal to 2, the code initializes the list y to [x - 1, x, x + 1, x - 2], which becomes [3, 4, 5, 2].
The list ANS is initialized as an empty list, and the variable i is initialized to 1.
The code enters a while loop that will run until i is less than 2 * n (which is 8 in this case).
The loop checks if the length of ANS is equal to 2 * n - 1 (which would be 7). Since ANS is empty, the condition is not met.
The loop then checks if i is in y. Since i starts at 1, it is not in y, so the loop does not increment i by 4.
The loop checks if the length of ANS is n - 3 (which would be 1). Since ANS is empty, the condition is not met.
The loop appends i (which is 1) to ANS and increments i by 1.
The loop continues, skipping the numbers in y (which are 2, 3, 4, 5) and appending other numbers to ANS.
When the length of ANS reaches n - 3 (which is 1), the list y is appended to ANS.
The loop continues appending the remaining numbers until ANS has a length of 2 * n - 1 (which is 7).
Finally, the code prints "Yes" and each number in ANS on a separate line.
The final ANS list will be [1, 6, 7, 3, 4, 5, 2] after the loop finishes.
