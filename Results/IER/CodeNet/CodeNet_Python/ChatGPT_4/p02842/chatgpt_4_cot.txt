The variable n is initialized to 432.
A dictionary named dic is created to store pairs of p and i, where p is the result of the integer part of i multiplied by 1.08.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 50000 (inclusive).
For each number i in this range, it calculates p as the integer part of i multiplied by 1.08 and stores the pair (p: i) in the dictionary dic.
After populating the dictionary, the code checks if the input number n (432) is a key in the dictionary.
If n is found in the dictionary, it prints the value associated with that key, which is the original number before the 1.08 multiplication.
If n is not found, it prints ":(".
In this case, we need to find the value of i such that int(i * 1.08) equals 432.
To find this, we can reverse the operation: i = 432 / 1.08.
i = 400
Since 400 is within the range of the loop (1 to 50000), and when i is 400, p will be int(400 * 1.08) = 432, the dictionary will contain the key 432 with the value 400.
Therefore, the output will be the value associated with the key 432 in the dictionary, which is 400.
<<<Output>>>
400
