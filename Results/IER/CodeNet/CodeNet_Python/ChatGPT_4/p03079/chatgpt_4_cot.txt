<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a, b, and c are initialized to 2, 2, and 2, respectively, after reading the input and splitting it by spaces.
The if condition checks if a is equal to b and b is equal to c. Since all three variables are equal to 2, the condition is true.
Because the condition is true, "Yes" is printed.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
