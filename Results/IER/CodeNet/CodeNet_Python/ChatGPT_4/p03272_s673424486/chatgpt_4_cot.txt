<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines several functions for reading input and then defines a main function that calculates and prints the result of a simple arithmetic operation.

The main function reads two integers, n and i, using the nm() function, which reads a line from standard input, splits it into parts, and maps each part to an integer. In this case, the input is '4 2', so n is assigned the value 4 and i is assigned the value 2.

The main function then calculates the result of the expression (n - i + 1), which is (4 - 2 + 1) = 3.

Finally, the main function prints the result, which is 3.

The if __name__ == '__main__': block checks if the script is being run directly (not imported as a module), and if so, it calls the main function.

Given the input '4 2', the output will be 3.
