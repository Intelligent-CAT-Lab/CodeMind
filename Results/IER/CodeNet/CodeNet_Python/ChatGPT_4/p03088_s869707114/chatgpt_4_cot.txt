<<<Analysis>>>
The code is designed to count the number of DNA sequences of length `n` that do not contain the "AGC" sequence in any order. The input `n` is set to 3.

The variables A, C, G, T, M, and R are initialized to represent the indices for Adenine, Cytosine, Guanine, Thymine, the modulo value (10^9 + 7), and a range object for iterating over the four nucleotides, respectively.

A 4-dimensional dynamic programming (DP) table `dp` is initialized with dimensions (n+1) x 4 x 4 x 4, and all values are set to 0. The base case `dp[0][T][T][T]` is set to 1, representing an empty sequence.

The code then enters a nested loop structure to fill the DP table. The outermost loop iterates over the sequence positions from 1 to `n`. The next three nested loops iterate over the possible nucleotides at the current position (`j`), the previous position (`k`), and the position before the previous one (`l`).

For each possible combination of nucleotides, the innermost loop (`m`) iterates over the nucleotides that can be placed at the current position. The code checks if the current combination of three nucleotides (`k`, `l`, `m`) or any combination of the last three nucleotides including the one from the previous iteration (`j`, `k`, `m` or `j`, `l`, `m`) forms the forbidden "AGC" sequence in any order. If not, the current DP state is updated by adding the value from the previous state and taking the modulo M.

After filling the DP table, the code calculates the sum of all values in the last layer of the DP table (which corresponds to sequences of length `n`) and prints the sum modulo M.

For the input `3`, the code will count all valid sequences of length 3 that do not contain the "AGC" sequence in any order. There are 61 such sequences because we have 4 options for the first nucleotide, 4 for the second, and 4 for the third, making 64 in total, but we must exclude the 3 sequences that contain "AGC" in any order: "AGC", "ACG", and "GAC".
