<<<Analysis>>>
The variables ab and bc are initialized to 81 and 58, respectively, from the input.
The variable fare is calculated as the integer part of the sum of ab and half of bc. This is done by adding ab (81) to half of bc (58/2 = 29), which results in 81 + 29 = 110.
The int function is used to ensure that the result is an integer, but since the division by 2 results in an integer and the sum of two integers is also an integer, the use of int is redundant in this case.
Finally, the code prints the value of fare, which is 110.
<<<Output>>>
110
