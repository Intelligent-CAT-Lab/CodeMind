<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized to 10000.
The variable i is initialized to the integer part of the square root of N, which is the integer part of the square root of 10000, which is 100.
The code enters a while loop that will continue as long as i is greater than 0.
The loop checks if N is divisible by i without a remainder. If it is, it prints the length of the string representation of the quotient N // i and breaks out of the loop.
If N is not divisible by i, it decrements i by 1 and continues the loop.
For the input 10000, the first divisor checked is 100, which is a perfect divisor of 10000 (10000 % 100 == 0).
The quotient of 10000 // 100 is 100.
The length of the string representation of 100 is 3.
The loop breaks after finding this first divisor and prints the length, which is 3.
