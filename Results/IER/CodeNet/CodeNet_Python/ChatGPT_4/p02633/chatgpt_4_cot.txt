<<<Analysis>>>
The variable x is initialized to 90.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 99999 (10**5 - 1).
For each number i in this range, it calculates the product of 360 and i, and then checks if this product is divisible by x without any remainder.
The condition `360 * i % x == 0` is checking for the smallest i such that 360*i is a multiple of x.
Since x is 90, the smallest i that satisfies the condition is 1 because 360 is already a multiple of 90.
The code then prints the result of the integer division `360 * i // x`, which is `360 * 1 // 90`, resulting in 4.
After printing, the code breaks out of the loop and finishes execution.
