<<<Analysis>>>
The variables n, a, and b are initialized to 4, 4, and 6, respectively.
The first if condition checks if n is greater than or equal to 2, which is true.
The nested if condition checks if b is greater than or equal to a, which is also true.
Since both conditions are true, the code executes the print statement inside the nested if block.
The expression (n-2)*(b-a)+1 calculates as follows: (4-2)*(6-4)+1 = 2*2+1 = 5.
Therefore, the code will print the number 5.
<<<Output>>>
5
