The input string S is "0.(3)".
The variables all, sub, and p are initialized to an empty string, an empty string, and -1, respectively.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each character in the input string.

1. When the character is '.', it sets the variable o to the current index, which is 1.
2. When the character is '(', it sets the variable p to the current index, which is 2, and assigns the value of all to sub. At this point, all is "0" and sub is "0".
3. When the character is not ')', it appends the character to all. After the loop, all is "03".

The variable d is calculated as the length of S minus o minus 1, which is 5 - 1 - 1 = 3.
The variable l is calculated as p minus o minus 1, which is 2 - 1 - 1 = 0.

Since p is not -1, the code executes the else block:
- It decreases d by 2, so d becomes 3 - 2 = 1.
- It calculates the value of all minus sub, which is 3 - 0 = 3.
- It calculates 10 to the power of d minus 10 to the power of l, which is 10^1 - 10^0 = 10 - 1 = 9.

The function printV is called with the values 3 and 9.
The function gcd is called to find the greatest common divisor of 3 and 9, which is 3.
The function printV then prints the fraction 3/9 reduced to its simplest form, which is 1/3.

<<<Output>>>
1/3
