<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by importing necessary modules and defining several functions and constants. The input function is redefined to read from standard input and strip the newline character. Several list creation functions are defined, as well as a ceil function, input parsing functions, and simple functions to print 'Yes' or 'No'. The recursion limit is set to a high value, and INF and MOD constants are defined.

The code then reads two integers N and X from the input, which are set to 5 and 2, respectively.

The gcd function is used to calculate the greatest common divisor of N and X. Since the code checks the version of Python being used, it will import the gcd function from the appropriate module. In this case, we assume that the Python version is 3.5 or higher, so it uses the gcd function from the math module.

The greatest common divisor of 5 and 2 is 1.

The code then calculates (N - gcd(N, X)) * 3, which is (5 - 1) * 3 = 4 * 3 = 12.

Finally, the code prints the result of this calculation, which is 12.
