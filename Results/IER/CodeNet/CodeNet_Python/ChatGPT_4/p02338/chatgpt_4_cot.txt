<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function main() that reads two integers N and K from the input.
It then prints 1 if N is less than or equal to K, otherwise it prints 0.
The if __name__ == "__main__": main() line checks if the script is being run directly (not imported as a module) and if so, it calls the main() function.
Given the input '5 10', N is set to 5 and K is set to 10.
Since N (5) is less than or equal to K (10), the condition N <= K is True.
Therefore, the code will print 1.
