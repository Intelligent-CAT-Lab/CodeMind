<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a, b, and c are initialized to 1000, 3000, and 3000, respectively.
The code then checks if c is less than or equal to a. In this case, c (3000) is not less than or equal to a (1000), so it does not print "0".
Next, the code checks if c is less than or equal to a+b. Since a+b equals 4000, and c is 3000, c is indeed less than or equal to a+b.
Because the second condition is met, the code prints c-a, which is 3000-1000, resulting in 2000.
The code does not reach the else clause because one of the previous conditions has been met.
<<<Output>>>
2000
