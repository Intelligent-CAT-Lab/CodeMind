<<<Analysis>>>
The variable x is initialized to 7.
The variable ans is calculated by integer division of x by 11, then multiplied by 2. Since 7 // 11 is 0, ans is initially set to 0.
The variable sub is calculated by the remainder of x divided by 11, which is 7 % 11, resulting in 7.
The code then checks if sub is greater than or equal to 7. Since sub is 7, it satisfies this condition.
Therefore, ans is increased by 2, resulting in ans being 2.
The code then prints the final value of ans, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
