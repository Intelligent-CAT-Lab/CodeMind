<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes several variables and arrays with precomputed values for factorials (f), modular inverses (h), and factorial inverses (g) modulo m (998244353). The range for precomputation is up to M (1000001).

The input A and B are read and set to 1 each. The code ensures A is not less than B by swapping if necessary, but in this case, it's not needed as A equals B.

The variable b is initialized to 1, and ans is initialized to 0. The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to B (inclusive), which is just 1 in this case.

Inside the loop, the code performs a series of multiplications and additions involving the precomputed factorial, modular inverse, and factorial inverse values, as well as the variable b, which is doubled each iteration modulo m.

Since B is 1, the loop runs only once, and the values used in the computation are:
- f[A+B-j] = f[1] = 1
- g[B-j] = g[0] = 1
- g[A] = g[1] = 1
- f[A] = f[1] = 1
- f[B] = f[1] = 1
- g[A+B] = g[2] = 1 (from the precomputed values)

The computation inside the loop is:
ans += b * f[A+B-j] * g[B-j] * g[A] % m
ans += 1 * 1 * 1 * 1 % 998244353
ans += 1

After the loop, the final computation is:
ans = ans * f[A] * f[B] * g[A+B] + A
ans = 1 * 1 * 1 * 1 + 1
ans = 2

Finally, the code prints ans % m, which is 2 % 998244353, resulting in 2.
