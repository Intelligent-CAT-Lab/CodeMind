<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a and b are initialized to 0 and 5, respectively, from the input.
The code checks if b is equal to 100, which it is not in this case, so the if condition is not executed.
The code then prints the result of b multiplied by 100 raised to the power of a, which is 5 * 100^0.
Since any number raised to the power of 0 is 1, the expression simplifies to 5 * 1.
Therefore, the output will be 5.
<<<Output>>>
5
