The variables w, h, ax, ay, bx, by are initialized to 4, 4, 0, 0, 3, 3, respectively.
The variable dx is calculated as the minimum of w-abs(ax-bx) and abs(ax-bx), which is min(4-abs(0-3), abs(0-3)) = min(4-3, 3) = min(1, 3) = 1.
The variable dy is calculated as the minimum of h-abs(ay-by) and abs(ay-by), which is min(4-abs(0-3), abs(0-3)) = min(4-3, 3) = min(1, 3) = 1.
The variable ans is initialized to 1.
The code checks if dx*2 equals w. Since dx is 1 and w is 4, the condition is not met, so ans remains 1.
The code checks if dy*2 equals h. Since dy is 1 and h is 4, the condition is not met, so ans remains 1.
The code calculates the combination of dx+dy over dx using the comb function, which is comb(1+1, 1) = comb(2, 1) = 2.
The value of ans is multiplied by the result of the combination, so ans becomes 1 * 2 = 2.
Finally, the code prints ans modulo 100000007, which is 2 % 100000007 = 2.
