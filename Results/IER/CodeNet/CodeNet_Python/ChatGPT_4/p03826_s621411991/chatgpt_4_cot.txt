<<<Analysis>>>
The input string '3 5 2 7' is split into a list of strings ['3', '5', '2', '7'] and stored in the variable n.
The first two elements of the list ('3' and '5') are converted to integers and multiplied together to get a1, which is 15.
The last two elements of the list ('2' and '7') are converted to integers and multiplied together to get a2, which is 14.
The max function is used to determine the larger of the two products, which is a1 (15).
The code then prints the larger product, which is 15.
<<<Output>>>
15
