<<<Analysis>>>
The input is the integer 20, which is assigned to the variable 'a'.
The function 'check' is defined to determine if a given number is prime. It returns True if the number is prime, and False otherwise.
The code then enters a loop starting from 'a' (20) and goes up to 100499.
For each number 'i' in this range, the 'check' function is called to determine if 'i' is a prime number.
The loop stops and prints the first prime number it finds that is greater than or equal to 'a'.
The first prime number greater than 20 is 23.
Once 23 is found to be prime, it is printed, and the loop breaks.
<<<Output>>>
23
