<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a and b are initialized to 1 and 3, respectively, from the input.
The code calculates the average of a and b, which is (1+3)/2 = 2.0.
The math.ceil function is then used to take the ceiling of the average, which means it rounds up to the nearest whole number.
Since the average is 2.0, the ceiling of 2.0 is 2.
The code then prints the result of the math.ceil function.
<<<Output>>>
