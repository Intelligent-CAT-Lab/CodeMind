<<<Analysis>>>
The input `6 6 1` initializes S to 6, N to 6, and K to 1.

The code first checks if S is 0, which it is not, so it continues.
Next, it checks if N is 1, which it is not, so it continues.

The variable M is set to N*K, which is 6*1 = 6.

The dp list is initialized with zeros and a 1 at the start. It represents the number of ways to reach a sum using numbers from 1 to N with at most K occurrences.

The code then populates the dp list with the number of ways to reach each sum from 0 to M (inclusive) using numbers from 1 to N, each at most K times. Since K is 1, it's just the number of ways to reach each sum using numbers from 1 to N once.

The variable s is set to the sum of all elements in dp, which represents the total number of ways to reach any sum from 0 to M.

The matrix mat is initialized and filled based on the dp list and the total number of ways s. This matrix is used to calculate the probabilities of reaching each state after an infinite number of moves.

The code then normalizes the matrix mat to make it a proper stochastic matrix, where each row sums up to 1.

The list C is created from the last column of the normalized matrix mat, which represents the probabilities of being in each state from M to 0 after an infinite number of moves.

The code checks if S is less than or equal to M. Since S is 6 and M is 6, this condition is true.

The code then writes the probability of being in state M-S after an infinite number of moves, which is the value at C[M-S]. Since M-S is 0, it writes the value at C[6], which is the probability of being at state 0 after an infinite number of moves.

The output is the value at C[6] formatted to 16 decimal places.
