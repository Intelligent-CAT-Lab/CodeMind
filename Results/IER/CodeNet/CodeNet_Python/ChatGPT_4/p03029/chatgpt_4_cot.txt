<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a and p are initialized to 1 and 3, respectively, from the input.
The expression (3*a+p) calculates to (3*1+3) which equals 6.
The result of the expression is then divided by 2 using integer division (//), which results in 3.
The code then prints the result of this calculation.
<<<Output>>>
3
