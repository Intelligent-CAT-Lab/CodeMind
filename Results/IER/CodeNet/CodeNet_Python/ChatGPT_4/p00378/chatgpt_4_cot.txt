<<<Analysis>>>
The variables A, B, and X are initialized to 180, 100, and 2400, respectively.
The variable k is calculated as the integer division of X by 1000, which is 2400 // 1000 = 2.
The variable ans is initialized to k multiplied by the minimum of A and 2*B, which is 2 * min(180, 200) = 2 * 180 = 360.
The variable r is calculated as the remainder of X after subtracting 1000*k, which is 2400 - 1000*2 = 400.
Since 0 < r <= 500, the condition is true, and ans is incremented by the minimum of A and B, which is min(180, 100) = 100.
Therefore, ans is updated to 360 + 100 = 460.
After the conditional checks, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 460.
<<<Output>>>
460
