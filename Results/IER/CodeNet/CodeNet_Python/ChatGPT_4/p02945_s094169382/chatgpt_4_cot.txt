<<<Analysis>>>
The variables A and B are initialized to -13 and 3, respectively.
The code calculates three different expressions: A+B, A-B, and A*B, which are -13+3, -13-3, and -13*3, respectively.
The results of these expressions are -10, -16, and -39.
The code then uses the max() function to find the maximum value among these three results.
The maximum value is -10, which is the result of the expression A+B.
<<<Output>>>
-10
