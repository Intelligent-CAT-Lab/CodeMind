<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 5.
The variable k is initialized to 1, which will be used to calculate the factorial of n.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 5.
For each number j in this range, k is multiplied by j. This is the process of calculating the factorial of n.
The sequence of multiplications will be: k = 1 * 1, then k = 1 * 2, then k = 2 * 3, then k = 6 * 4, and finally k = 24 * 5.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of k, which is the factorial of 5 (5!).
The factorial of 5 is 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120.
<<<Output>>>
120
