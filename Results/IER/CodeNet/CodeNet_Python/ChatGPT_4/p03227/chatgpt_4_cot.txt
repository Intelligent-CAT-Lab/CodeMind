<<<Analysis>>>
The variable l is initialized with the string 'abc'.
The code checks the length of the string l with len(l). Since the length of 'abc' is 3, the condition len(l)==2 is False.
The else block is executed, which prints the string l in reverse order using slicing with a step of -1, which is l[::-1].
The output will be 'cba', which is the string 'abc' reversed.
<<<Output>>>
cba
