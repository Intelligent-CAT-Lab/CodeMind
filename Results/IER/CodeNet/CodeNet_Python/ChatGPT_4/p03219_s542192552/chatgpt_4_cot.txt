<<<Analysis>>>
The variables X and Y are initialized to 81 and 58, respectively.
The expression inside the print function calculates X + Y/2, which is 81 + 58/2.
The division has higher precedence than addition, so Y/2 is calculated first, resulting in 29 (since 58 divided by 2 is 29).
Then, 81 + 29 is calculated, resulting in 110.
The result is then converted to an integer (although it is already an integer) and printed.
<<<Output>>>
110
