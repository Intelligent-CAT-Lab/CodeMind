<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a, b, c, and k are initialized to 1, 2, 3, and 1, respectively.
The code checks if k is even by using the modulo operator (k % 2 == 0).
Since k is 1, k % 2 is not equal to 0, so the condition is False.
The else block is executed, which prints the result of b - a.
The calculation is 2 - 1, which equals 1.
