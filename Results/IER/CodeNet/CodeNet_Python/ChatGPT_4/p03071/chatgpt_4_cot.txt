<<<Analysis>>>
The variables A and B are initialized to 5 and 3, respectively.
A list named 'list' is created with three expressions based on A and B:
1. A+B which is 5+3 = 8
2. 2*A-1 which is 2*5-1 = 9
3. 2*B-1 which is 2*3-1 = 5
The max() function is then called with the list as its argument to find the maximum value in the list.
The maximum value in the list is 9.
The code then prints the maximum value which is 9.
<<<Output>>>
9
