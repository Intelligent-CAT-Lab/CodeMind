<<<Analysis>>>
The input character 'B' is passed to the ord() function, which returns the ASCII value of 'B'. The ASCII value of 'B' is 66.
The if condition checks if x (which is 66) is greater than or equal to 97. Since 66 is not greater than or equal to 97, the condition is False.
Therefore, the else block is executed, and 'A' is printed.
<<<Output>>>
A
