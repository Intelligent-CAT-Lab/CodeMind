<<<Analysis>>>
The input string '1 + 2' is split into three parts: '1', '+', and '2'.
The variables a and b are initialized with the integer values 1 and 2, respectively.
The variable op is initialized with the string '+'.
The if statement checks if op is equal to '+', which it is.
Since the condition is true, the code executes the print(a+b) statement.
The sum of a and b is 3.
The code prints the result of the addition, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>
3
