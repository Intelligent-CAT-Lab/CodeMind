<<<Analysis>>>
The variables H, W, h, and w are initialized to 3, 3, 2, and 2, respectively.
The code first checks if H is divisible by h and W is divisible by w. Since both 3%2 and 3%2 are not equal to 0, the condition is false.
The code then checks if W is not divisible by w, which is true since 3%2 is not equal to 0.
The code enters the first elif block and prints "Yes".
The code then enters two nested loops to iterate over a grid of size HxW (3x3).
For each cell (y, x) in the grid, it prints a space if x is not 0 (to separate the numbers).
If the current column x is not the last column in a subgrid of width w (i.e., (x%w) is not equal to w-1), it prints 100000.
If the current column x is the last column in a subgrid of width w, it prints -100000*(w-1)-1, which is -100000*(2-1)-1 = -100001.
The output will be a 3x3 grid where each cell contains either 100000 or -100001, depending on its position relative to the subgrid size w.
The output will be formatted as specified by the print statements in the code.

<<<Output>>>
Yes
100000 100000 -100001
100000 100000 -100001
100000 100000 -100001
