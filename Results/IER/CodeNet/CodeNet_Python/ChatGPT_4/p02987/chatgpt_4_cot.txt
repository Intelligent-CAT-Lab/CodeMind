<<<Analysis>>>
The input string is 'ASSA'.
The variables a, b, c, d are assigned to 'A', 'S', 'S', 'A' respectively.
The code checks for different conditions to set the flag to 1 or 0.
First, it checks if a==b and c==d, which is not true since 'A' is not equal to 'S'.
Second, it checks if a==c and b==d, which is true since 'A' is equal to 'A' and 'S' is equal to 'S'.
Since the second condition is true, flag is set to 1.
Then, it checks if all four characters are the same, which is not the case, so the flag remains 1.
Finally, it checks if flag is equal to 1, which it is, so it prints "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
