<<<Analysis>>>
The input '80' is converted into a list of characters ['8', '0'] and then reversed to ['0', '8'].
The variables lb and ub are initialized to 0 and the length of the list n, which is 2.
The function check(x) is defined to determine if a given x can be reduced to 0 by repeatedly subtracting the remainder of (x + g - int(i)) % 10 from x, where g is initially 0 and i is each digit in the reversed list n. After each subtraction, g is updated to (x + g) // 10.
A binary search is performed between lb and ub to find the smallest number of 9's (9 * mid) that can be reduced to 0 using the check function.
The while loop continues as long as ub - lb is greater than 1. It calculates mid as the integer division of (lb + ub) // 2.
If check(9 * mid) returns True, meaning 9 * mid can be reduced to 0, ub is updated to mid. Otherwise, lb is updated to mid.
The loop will test mid values of 1, 0, and then stop because ub - lb will no longer be greater than 1.
The final value of ub, which is 1, is printed as the output.
