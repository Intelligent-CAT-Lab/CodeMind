<<<Analysis>>>
The code is a complex numerical computation using NumPy and modular arithmetic. The input `1 1 1` initializes N, M, and K to 1.

1. The MOD constant is set to 10^9 + 7, which is a large prime number often used for modular arithmetic in competitive programming to prevent integer overflow.

2. Several functions are defined to compute cumulative products, factorials, factorial inverses, and powers of numbers under modular arithmetic.

3. Precomputed arrays for powers of 2 and 3, and their modular inverses, as well as factorials and factorial inverses, are created using the defined functions. These arrays are computed up to 10^6, which is the maximum value of U.

4. An array `x` is initialized with zeros of length N+M, which is 2 in this case.

5. The array `x` is then filled with values computed using powers of 2 and 3, their inverses, and factorials, all under modular arithmetic. The first element of `x` is computed separately.

6. A cumulative sum is performed on the array `x`, and then it is multiplied by powers of 3 and the inverse of powers of 2.

7. A coefficient array `coef` is computed using factorials, factorial inverses, and powers of 3.

8. The final answer is computed by multiplying the `coef` array with a slice of the `x` array and summing the result under modular arithmetic.

9. The answer is printed out.

Given the input `1 1 1`, the code will perform these computations with the specific values of N, M, and K set to 1. The output will be the result of these computations modulo 10^9 + 7.
