<<<Analysis>>>
The input is split into three variables: w, h, and c, which are initialized to 3, 3, and 'B', respectively. The width (w) and height (h) are converted to integers.
The variable 'end' is initialized to a string that will be the top and bottom of the rectangle, which is "+-+" since w is 3.
The variable 'center' is initialized to a string that will be the center of the rectangle. Since w is 3, the calculation for the number of dots on each side of 'c' is ((w - 3) // 2), which is 0. Therefore, 'center' is "|B|".
The variable 'common' is initialized to a string that will be the common line for all non-border and non-center lines. Since w is 3, 'common' is "|.|".
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to h-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider rows from 0 to 2.
For each row i, the code checks:
- If i is 0 or h-1 (the first or last row), it prints 'end'.
- If i is h // 2 (the middle row), it prints 'center'.
- Otherwise, it prints 'common'.
Since h is 3, the middle row is also row 1 (integer division of 3 // 2).
The expected output is a 3x3 rectangle with 'B' in the center.
