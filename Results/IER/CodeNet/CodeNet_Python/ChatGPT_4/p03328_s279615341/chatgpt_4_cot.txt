<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a and b are initialized to 8 and 13, respectively.
A list named lis of length 1000 is created, initialized with zeros.
The code then enters a loop that iterates 1000 times.
For each iteration i (starting from 0), the code calculates the i-th triangular number, which is the sum of the integers from 1 to i+1. This is done using the formula (i+2)*(i+1)//2 and stored in lis[i].
After calculating the triangular number for the current i, the code checks if i is at least 1 to ensure there's a previous element in the list to compare with.
The code then checks if the difference between b and a is equal to the difference between the current and the previous triangular numbers (lis[i] - lis[i-1]).
If the condition is met, the code prints the result of lis[i] - b and breaks out of the loop.
For the input 8 and 13, the difference is 5.
The loop will find that when i is 4, the triangular numbers are 10 and 15 for lis[i-1] and lis[i], respectively. The difference between these two numbers is 5, which matches the difference between a and b.
Therefore, the code will print the result of 15 - 13, which is 2, and then break out of the loop.
