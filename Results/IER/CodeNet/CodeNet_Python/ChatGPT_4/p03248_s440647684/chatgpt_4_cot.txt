<<<Analysis>>>
The input string `s` is "1111".
The length of the string `n` is 4.
The code first checks if the first character is "0" or the last character is "1". Neither condition is met, so it continues.
The code then enters a loop to check if the string is a palindrome with the middle two characters removed. Since "11" is a palindrome of "11", the loop continues without printing -1 and exiting.
The loop also populates the `possible` list with indices of "1" characters, except for the first character. The `possible` list becomes [2].
The length of the `possible` list `l` is 1.
The code then initializes an empty list `edges` to store pairs of connected nodes.
The variable `cnt` is initialized to 0.
The code enters a loop to create edges between nodes. Since `l` is 1, the loop will only run once.
The inner loop does not run because `cnt + 1` is equal to `possible[i]`.
The `else` part of the condition adds an edge from the last element of `possible` to the next node, which is [2, 3].
The `cnt` is updated to the value of the last element in `possible`, which is 2.
The final loop adds edges from node 3 to all remaining nodes, which are nodes 4 and 5 (since the loop starts from `cnt + 2` to `n + 1`).
The `edges` list now contains [[2, 3], [3, 4], [3, 5]].
The code prints each pair of connected nodes in the `edges` list.
