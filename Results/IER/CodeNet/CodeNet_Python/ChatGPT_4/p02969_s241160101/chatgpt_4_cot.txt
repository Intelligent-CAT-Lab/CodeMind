<<<Analysis>>>
The code imports several modules and sets some constants and utility functions. However, most of these are not used in the actual code that follows.

The variable `n` is initialized with the value returned by the `inp()` function, which reads an integer from standard input. Since I am acting as the code executor, I will consider the input provided, which is `4`.

The code then calculates `3 * n * n`. With `n` being `4`, this results in `3 * 4 * 4`, which equals `48`.

Finally, the code prints the result of the calculation, which is `48`.

<<<Output>>>
48
