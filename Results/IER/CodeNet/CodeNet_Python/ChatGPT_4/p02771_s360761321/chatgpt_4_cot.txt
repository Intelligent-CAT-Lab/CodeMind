<<<Analysis>>>
The input is a string "5 7 5" which is split into a list of strings ['5', '7', '5'].
The map function converts each string in the list to an integer, resulting in the list [5, 7, 5].
This list is then converted to a set, which removes duplicate elements, resulting in the set {5, 7}.
The length of this set is checked to see if it is equal to 2.
Since the set contains two elements (5 and 7), the length is indeed 2.
Therefore, the condition len(set(list(map(int, input().split())))) == 2 is True.
As a result, the code prints 'Yes'.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
