<<<Analysis>>>
The code is designed to determine if a certain distance `d` can be covered within a time `t` at a speed `s`. The input values are read and assigned to the variables `d`, `t`, and `s` respectively.

The input provided is `1000 15 80`, which means:
- `d` (distance to be covered) is 1000 units,
- `t` (time available) is 15 units,
- `s` (speed) is 80 units per time unit.

The code then checks if the product of `s` and `t` is less than `d`. If it is, it prints 'No', meaning the distance cannot be covered in the available time at the given speed. Otherwise, it prints 'Yes'.

In this case, `s * t` equals `80 * 15`, which is `1200`. Since `1200` is greater than `1000`, the condition `s*t < d` is false.

Therefore, the output will be 'Yes', indicating that the distance can be covered within the given time at the specified speed.
