<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a and b are initialized with the values 3 and 1, respectively, from the input.
The code then checks if both a and b are either 1 or 3.
Since a is 3 and b is 1, the condition (a in (1,3) and b in (1,3)) is True.
Therefore, the code will execute the first branch of the if-else statement and print 'Yes'.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
