<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized to 4.
The expression -(-N//2) performs integer division of N by 2, which results in 2, and then negates it twice, which does not change the value, so the result is still 2.
This result is then divided by N (which is 4), resulting in 0.5.
The code prints this result.
<<<Output>>>
0.5
