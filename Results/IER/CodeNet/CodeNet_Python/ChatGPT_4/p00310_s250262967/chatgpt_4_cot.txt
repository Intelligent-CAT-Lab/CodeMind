<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a single line of input and splits it into three integers, assigning them to variables p, m, and c respectively.
The input `10 10 20` assigns 10 to p, 10 to m, and 20 to c.
The code then prints the sum of these three variables.
The sum of 10, 10, and 20 is 40.
<<<Output>>>
40
