<<<Analysis>>>
The input is `5 3`, which means N is 5 and K is 3.
The function `cmb` is a combination function that calculates the number of ways to choose b elements from a elements without repetition.

The `cmb` function first checks if `a` is equal to `b` or if `b` is 0, in which case it returns 1, as there is only one way to choose all elements or no elements.
Since `a` is not equal to `b` and `b` is not 0, it proceeds to calculate the combination.
It checks if `b` is greater than `a - b` and if so, it calls itself with `a` and `a - b` to take advantage of the symmetry property of combinations (C(a, b) = C(a, a-b)).
In this case, `b` is not greater than `a - b` (3 is not greater than 2), so it proceeds to calculate the combination directly.

The function then calculates the product of numbers from `a` down to `a - b + 1` (from 5 down to 4) and divides it by the factorial of `b` (factorial of 3).
The product is 5 * 4 = 20.
The factorial of `b` (3) is 6.
So the combination is 20 // 6, which is 3.

The `resolve` function then prints the result of `cmb(N-1, N-K)` modulo `10**9 + 7`.
N-1 is 4, and N-K is 2.
So it calculates `cmb(4, 2)`.
The combination of 4 choose 2 is 6.
The result modulo `10**9 + 7` is still 6, as 6 is much less than `10**9 + 7`.

Therefore, the output will be 6.
