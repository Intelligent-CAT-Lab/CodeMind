<<<Analysis>>>
The input '4 3 2' is split into a list of strings ['4', '3', '2'] and stored in the variable rgb.
The list is then joined without any separator to form the string '432'.
The string '432' is converted to an integer 432.
The code checks if 432 is divisible by 4.
Since 432 is indeed divisible by 4 (as 432 / 4 = 108 with no remainder), the condition is true.
Therefore, 'YES' is printed.
<<<Output>>>
YES
