The variable n is initialized to 2.
The variables ans, sub, and sub2 are initialized to 1.

The code enters a loop that iterates n times, which is 2 times in this case.

In the first iteration (i=0):
- ans is multiplied by 10, so ans becomes 10.
- ans is then taken modulo 10^9+7, but since 10 is less than 10^9+7, ans remains 10.
- sub is multiplied by 9, so sub becomes 9.
- sub is then taken modulo 10^9+7, and since 9 is less than 10^9+7, sub remains 9.
- sub2 is multiplied by 8, so sub2 becomes 8.
- sub2 is then taken modulo 10^9+7, and since 8 is less than 10^9+7, sub2 remains 8.

In the second iteration (i=1):
- ans is multiplied by 10 again, so ans becomes 100.
- ans is then taken modulo 10^9+7, and since 100 is less than 10^9+7, ans remains 100.
- sub is multiplied by 9 again, so sub becomes 81.
- sub is then taken modulo 10^9+7, and since 81 is less than 10^9+7, sub remains 81.
- sub2 is multiplied by 8 again, so sub2 becomes 64.
- sub2 is then taken modulo 10^9+7, and since 64 is less than 10^9+7, sub2 remains 64.

After the loop, the following calculation is performed:
ans -= 2*sub - sub2
ans = 100 - 2*81 + 64
ans = 100 - 162 + 64
ans = 2

Finally, ans is taken modulo 10^9+7, but since 2 is less than 10^9+7, ans remains 2.

The code prints the final value of ans, which is 2.
