<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a and b are initialized with the values 1000 and 3000, respectively, from the input.
The code calculates the average of a and b using integer division by adding a and b and then dividing by 2.
The calculation is (1000 + 3000) // 2, which equals 4000 // 2.
The result of the integer division is 2000.
The code then prints the result, which is 2000.
<<<Output>>>
2000
