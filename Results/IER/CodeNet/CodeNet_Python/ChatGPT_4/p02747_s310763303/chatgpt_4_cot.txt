<<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized with the input string 'hihi'.
The code checks if the string s is equal to 'hi', 'hihi', 'hihihi', 'hihihihi', or 'hihihihihi'.
Since s is equal to 'hihi', the condition is true.
As a result, the code will execute the print statement under the if condition and print 'Yes'.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
