<<<Analysis>>>
The variables N and K are initialized to 3 and 2, respectively.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the answer.

The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 3.

For each number a in this range, the code first checks if 2 * a is divisible by K. If it is not, the loop continues to the next iteration without executing the following code.

For a = 1, 2 * a is 2, which is not divisible by K (2), so the loop continues to the next iteration.
For a = 2, 2 * a is 4, which is divisible by K (2), so the loop proceeds with the calculation.
For a = 3, 2 * a is 6, which is divisible by K (2), so the loop proceeds with the calculation.

When a = 2:
- floor((N + a) / K) = floor((3 + 2) / 2) = floor(5 / 2) = 2
- ceil((a + 1) / K) = ceil((2 + 1) / 2) = ceil(3 / 2) = 2
- The calculation becomes (2 - 2 + 1) ** 2 = 1 ** 2 = 1
- ans += 1

When a = 3:
- floor((N + a) / K) = floor((3 + 3) / 2) = floor(6 / 2) = 3
- ceil((a + 1) / K) = ceil((3 + 1) / 2) = ceil(4 / 2) = 2
- The calculation becomes (3 - 2 + 1) ** 2 = 2 ** 2 = 4
- ans += 4

The final value of ans is 1 + 4 = 5.

After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans.
