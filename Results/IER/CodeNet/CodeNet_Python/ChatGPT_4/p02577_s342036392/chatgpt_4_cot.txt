<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines several lambda functions for different input types but only uses ini() to read an integer from the standard input.
The variable n is initialized to the integer value of the input, which is 123456789.
The code then prints "No" if n is not divisible by 9, otherwise it prints "Yes".
Since 123456789 is divisible by 9 (the sum of its digits is 45, which is a multiple of 9), the condition n % 9 evaluates to False.
Therefore, the code will print "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
