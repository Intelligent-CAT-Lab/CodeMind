<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized to 4.
The code first checks if N is 1 or 2, which it is not, so it skips the first print statement.
Next, the code checks if N is even by using the modulo operator (N % 2 == 0). Since 4 is even, this condition is true.
The code then executes the print statement in the corresponding if block, which prints N//2-1. Since 4//2 is 2, subtracting 1 gives us 1.
Therefore, the output will be 1.
