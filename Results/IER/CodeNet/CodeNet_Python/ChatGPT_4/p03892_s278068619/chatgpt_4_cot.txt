The variables a, b, c, and d are initialized with the values 1, 1, 3, and 4, respectively.
The code calculates the absolute difference between c and a, and between d and b, which results in c=2 and d=3.
The greatest common divisor (gcd) of the maximum and minimum of c and d is calculated, which is gcd(3, 2). Since 3 and 2 are coprime, their gcd is 1.
The variables j and k are set to c/g and d/g, respectively, which results in j=2 and k=3 because g is 1.
The code then calculates (j+k-1)*g, which is (2+3-1)*1 = 4*1 = 4.
The output is the result of this calculation, which is 4.
