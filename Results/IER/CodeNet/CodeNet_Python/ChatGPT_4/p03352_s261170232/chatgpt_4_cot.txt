The variable X is initialized to 10.
The variable answer is initialized to 0, which will be used to store the maximum power found.
The code then enters a nested loop. The outer loop iterates over i, which ranges from 1 to the ceiling of the square root of X (which is math.ceil(10**0.5) + 1, so it iterates from 1 to 4).
The inner loop iterates over j, which ranges from 2 to 10.
For each combination of i and j, the code checks if i raised to the power of j is less than or equal to X.
If it is, the code updates answer to be the maximum of i**j and the current value of answer.
The combinations that will be checked are (i=1, j=2 to 10), (i=2, j=2 to 10), (i=3, j=2 to 10), and (i=4, j=2 to 10).
However, since X is 10, the only powers that are less than or equal to X are 1**2, 1**3, ..., 1**10, 2**2, 2**3, and 3**2.
The maximum of these values is 2**3, which is 8.
After the loops finish, the code prints the final value of answer, which is 8.
<<<Output>>>
8
