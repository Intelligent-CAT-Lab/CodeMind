<<<Analysis>>>
The input is '4 12', which means a[0] is 4 and a[1] is 12.
The code checks if a[1] is divisible by a[0], which it is because 12 % 4 equals 0.
Since the condition is true, it calculates b as the sum of a[0] and a[1], which is 4 + 12, resulting in 16.
The second if condition is not executed because the first condition was already true.
Finally, the code prints the value of b, which is 16.
<<<Output>>>
16
