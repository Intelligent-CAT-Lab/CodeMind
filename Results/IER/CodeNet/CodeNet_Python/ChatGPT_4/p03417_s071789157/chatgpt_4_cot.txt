<<<Analysis>>>
The variables n and m are initialized to 2 and 2, respectively.
The first if condition checks if both n and m are equal to 1, which is not the case here.
The elif condition checks if the minimum of n and m is 1, which is also not the case since both are 2.
Since neither the if nor the elif conditions are met, the code executes the else block.
The else block calculates the product of (n-2) and (m-2), which is (2-2) * (2-2) = 0 * 0 = 0.
Therefore, the code will print 0.
<<<Output>>>
