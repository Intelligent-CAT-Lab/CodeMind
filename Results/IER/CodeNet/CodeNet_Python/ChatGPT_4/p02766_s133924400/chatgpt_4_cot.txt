<<<Analysis>>>
The variables n and k are initialized to 11 and 2, respectively.
The variable res is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of times n can be divided by k until n becomes 0.
The code enters a while loop that continues as long as n is greater than 0.
In each iteration of the loop, res is incremented by 1, and n is divided by k using floor division (//), which means n is updated to n divided by k, discarding any fractional part.
The loop runs as follows:
- First iteration: n = 11, n //= 2, n becomes 5, res becomes 1
- Second iteration: n = 5, n //= 2, n becomes 2, res becomes 2
- Third iteration: n = 2, n //= 2, n becomes 1, res becomes 3
- Fourth iteration: n = 1, n //= 2, n becomes 0, res becomes 4
The loop stops because n is now 0.
The final value of res, which is 4, is printed.
