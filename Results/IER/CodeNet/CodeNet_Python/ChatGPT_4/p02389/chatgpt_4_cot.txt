<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a and b are initialized to 3 and 5, respectively, by splitting the input string and converting each part to an integer.
The code then prints two values separated by a space:
1. The product of a and b, which is 3 * 5 = 15.
2. The perimeter of a rectangle with sides a and b, which is calculated as (a + b) * 2. For a = 3 and b = 5, this is (3 + 5) * 2 = 8 * 2 = 16.
<<<Output>>>
15 16
