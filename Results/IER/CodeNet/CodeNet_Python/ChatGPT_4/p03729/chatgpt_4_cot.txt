<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a, b, and c are initialized to the strings 'rng', 'gorilla', and 'apple', respectively.
The code checks two conditions:
1. If the last character of string a ('rng') is the same as the first character of string b ('gorilla'), which is 'g' in both cases.
2. If the last character of string b ('gorilla') is the same as the first character of string c ('apple'), which is 'a' in both cases.

Since both conditions are true ('g' is the last character of 'rng' and the first character of 'gorilla', and 'a' is the last character of 'gorilla' and the first character of 'apple'), the code will print 'YES'.
<<<Output>>>
YES
