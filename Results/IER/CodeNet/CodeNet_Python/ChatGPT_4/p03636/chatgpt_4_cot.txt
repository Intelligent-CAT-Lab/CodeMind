<<<Analysis>>>
The input string 'internationalization' is unpacked into variables a, b, and c using the syntax a,*b,c. 
Variable 'a' will capture the first character of the string, which is 'i'.
Variable 'b' will capture all the middle characters as a list, due to the asterisk prefix, which means it will contain ['n', 't', 'e', 'r', 'n', 'a', 't', 'i', 'o', 'n', 'a', 'l', 'i', 'z', 'a', 't', 'i', 'o'].
Variable 'c' will capture the last character of the string, which is 'n'.
The length of list 'b' is then calculated, which is 18, since there are 18 characters in the list.
The code then prints the concatenation of 'a', the string representation of the length of 'b' (which is '18'), and 'c'.
