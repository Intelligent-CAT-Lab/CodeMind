The input string is `?&?|?&?|?&?`?`.

1. The input string is converted into a list of characters, with spaces removed (though there are no spaces in the input).
2. An empty string is appended to the list of tokens to signify the end of the input.
3. The `parse_formula` function is called, which in turn calls `parse_or`.
4. The `parse_or` function calls `parse_and` for the first segment `?&?`.
5. The `parse_and` function calls `parse_term` for the first `?`, which returns [1, 1] and increments `cur` to 1.
6. Since the next token is `&`, `parse_and` continues and calls `parse_term` for the next `?`, which also returns [1, 1] and increments `cur` to 3.
7. The `parse_and` function now combines the results of the two terms: zero = min(1, 1 + 1) = 1, one = 1 + 1 = 2, and returns [1, 2].
8. Back in `parse_or`, since the next token is `|`, it continues and calls `parse_or` for the next segment `?&?`.
9. Steps 5-7 repeat for the next segment `?&?`, which also returns [1, 2].
10. The `parse_or` function now combines the results of the two segments: zero = 1 + 1 = 2, one = min(2, 1 + 2) = 2, and returns [2, 2].
11. Back in `parse_or`, since the next token is `|`, it continues and calls `parse_or` for the next segment `?&?`.
12. Steps 5-7 repeat for the next segment `?&?`, which also returns [1, 2].
13. The `parse_or` function now combines the results of the two segments: zero = 2 + 1 = 3, one = min(2, 2 + 2) = 2, and returns [3, 2].
14. Back in `parse_or`, since the next token is `|`, it continues and calls `parse_or` for the last `?`.
15. The `parse_term` function is called for the last `?`, which returns [1, 1] and increments `cur` to the end of the tokens.
16. The `parse_or` function now combines the results of the two segments: zero = 3 + 1 = 4, one = min(2, 3 + 1) = 2, and returns [4, 2].
17. The `ans` variable is set to [4, 2], and the output is printed as "4 2".
