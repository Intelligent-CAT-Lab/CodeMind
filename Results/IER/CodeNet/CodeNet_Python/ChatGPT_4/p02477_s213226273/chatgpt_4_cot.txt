<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines several functions and sets some configurations, but only a few parts are relevant to the output based on the given input.

1. The `m()` function is called, which reads input and returns a map object containing two integers.
2. The input `5 8` is provided to the `m()` function, which means `n` is assigned the value 5 and `m` is assigned the value 8.
3. The last line of the code multiplies `n` and `m`, which results in 5 * 8.
4. The result of the multiplication is printed out.

Therefore, the output will be the product of 5 and 8, which is 40.
