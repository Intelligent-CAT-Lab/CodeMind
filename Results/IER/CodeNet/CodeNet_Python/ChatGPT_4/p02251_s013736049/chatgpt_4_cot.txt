<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 100.
The list coin contains the values [25, 10, 5, 1], representing coin denominations.
variable sum_s is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the total number of coins.
The code enters a loop that iterates over the coin denominations.
For the first iteration with i = 25, sent is calculated as 100 // 25, which is 4. n is updated to 100 % 25, which is 0. sum_s is updated to 4.
Since n is now 0, the remaining iterations of the loop will not change the value of n, and sent will be 0 for each.
The final value of sum_s, which is the total number of coins, is 4.
<<<Output>>>
4
