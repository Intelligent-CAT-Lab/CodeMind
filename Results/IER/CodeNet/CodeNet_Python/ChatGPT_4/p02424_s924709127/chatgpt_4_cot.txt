<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a and b are initialized to 8 and 10, respectively.
The MASK variable is not used in the code provided, so it has no effect on the output.

The code then prints the binary representation of the bitwise AND, OR, and XOR operations between a and b, each padded to 32 bits.

For the bitwise AND operation:
8 in binary is 1000.
10 in binary is 1010.
The bitwise AND of 1000 and 1010 is 1000, which is 8 in decimal.

For the bitwise OR operation:
The bitwise OR of 1000 and 1010 is 1010, which is 10 in decimal.

For the bitwise XOR operation:
The bitwise XOR of 1000 and 1010 is 0010, which is 2 in decimal.

The binary representations of these numbers, padded to 32 bits, will be printed.
