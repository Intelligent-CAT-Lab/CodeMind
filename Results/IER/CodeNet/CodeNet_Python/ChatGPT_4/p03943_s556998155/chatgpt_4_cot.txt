<<<Analysis>>>
The variable candy is initialized with the list of integers obtained from the input, which are 10, 30, and 20.
The list is then sorted, resulting in the list [10, 20, 30].
The code checks if the sum of the first two elements (10 + 20) is equal to the third element (30).
Since 10 + 20 is indeed equal to 30, the condition is true.
Therefore, the code prints 'Yes'.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
