The variable `n` is initialized to 3.
The constant `MOD` is set to 10^9 + 7.
A list `factorial` of size `n+1` (which is 4 in this case) is created and initialized with zeros. The first element is then set to 1.
A loop calculates the factorial of `n` by multiplying the previous factorial value by the current index `i`. The factorial of 3 is calculated as 1 * 1 * 2 * 3 = 6.
The variable `n` is then updated to be the factorial of 3, which is 6.
An empty list `prime_factors` is created to store the prime factors of `n` and their exponents.
A loop starts with `i` equal to 2 and continues as long as `i` squared is less than or equal to `n`. Since `n` is 6, the loop will consider `i` values of 2 and 3.
For each `i`, another loop checks if `n` is divisible by `i`. If it is, the exponent `ext` is incremented, and `n` is divided by `i`.
For `i` equal to 2, `n` is divisible once, so `ext` becomes 1 and `n` becomes 3.
The pair (2, 1) is added to `prime_factors`.
The outer loop increments `i` to 3, and since 3 is a prime factor of `n` (which is now 3), `ext` is incremented to 1, and `n` becomes 1.
The pair (3, 1) is added to `prime_factors`.
Since `n` is now 1, the loop ends.
The variable `ans` is initialized to 1.
A loop iterates over the `prime_factors` list, which contains (2, 1) and (3, 1).
For each prime factor and its exponent, `ans` is updated to be the product of `ans` and `num + 1`, modulo `MOD`.
For the pair (2, 1), `ans` becomes (1 * (1 + 1)) % MOD = 2.
For the pair (3, 1), `ans` becomes (2 * (1 + 1)) % MOD = 4.
The final value of `ans` is printed, which is 4.
