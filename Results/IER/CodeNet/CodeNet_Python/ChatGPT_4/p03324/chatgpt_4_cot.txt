<<<Analysis>>>
The variables D and N are initialized to 0 and 5, respectively.
The code calculates 100 raised to the power of D, which is 100^0. Since any number raised to the power of 0 is 1, 100^0 is 1.
It then multiplies this result by N, which is 5 in this case. So, 1 * 5 equals 5.
There is a conditional expression that checks if N is equal to 100. If N were 100, it would add 1 to N before multiplying. However, since N is 5, this condition is not met, and the code simply prints the result of 100^D * N.
Therefore, the output will be 5.
