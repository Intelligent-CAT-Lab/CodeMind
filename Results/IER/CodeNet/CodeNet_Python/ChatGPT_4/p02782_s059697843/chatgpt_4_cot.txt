The variables r1, c1, r2, c2 are initialized to 1, 1, 2, 2, respectively.
The variable L is set to 10 ** 9 + 7, which is a large prime number often used for modulo operations in combinatorial problems to avoid overflow.

The function get_euclidian is defined to calculate the multiplicative inverse of B modulo A using the extended Euclidean algorithm. It is used later to calculate the modular inverse of the factorial product in the combination formula.

The list F is initialized with the value 1, and then a loop is used to calculate the factorial of each number from 1 to r2 + c2 + 2 (which is 6 in this case) modulo L. The factorial values are stored in F.

The function get_combi is defined to calculate the combination of n choose r using the factorial values precomputed in F and the multiplicative inverse calculated by get_euclidian.

The variables combi1, combi2, combi3, and combi4 are calculated using the get_combi function with the following parameters:
- combi1: (r2 + c2 + 2, r2 + 1) which is (6, 3)
- combi2: (r2 + c1 + 1, c1) which is (4, 1)
- combi3: (r1 + c2 + 1, r1) which is (4, 1)
- combi4: (r1 + c1, r1) which is (2, 1)

The final result is calculated by subtracting combi2 and combi3 from combi1 and then adding combi4. Since we are working with modulo arithmetic, we add L before taking the modulo to ensure the result is non-negative.

The output is the final result modulo L.
