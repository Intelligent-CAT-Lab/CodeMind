<<<Analysis>>>
The variable a is initialized to 1.
The code checks the remainder of a when divided by 7 using the modulo operator (%).
Since 1 % 7 equals 1, the first condition (a % 7 == 1) is true.
Therefore, the code prints "fri".
No other conditions are checked because there are no elif or else statements, and the remainder of 1 divided by 7 cannot be equal to any other number besides 1.
<<<Output>>>
fri
