<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a, b, and c are initialized to 4, 3, and 90, respectively.
The code calculates the area of a triangle using the formula 0.5 * base * height * sin(angle), where angle is in radians. Since c is 90 degrees, math.sin(math.radians(90)) will be 1. Therefore, the area is 0.5 * 4 * 3 * 1 = 6.0.
The code then calculates the length of the hypotenuse of the triangle using the Pythagorean theorem, which is modified to include the cosine of the angle between the two sides a and b. Since c is 90 degrees, math.cos(math.radians(90)) will be 0. The length of the hypotenuse is then a + b + sqrt(a^2 + b^2 - 2ab * cos(c)), which simplifies to 4 + 3 + sqrt(4^2 + 3^2) = 7 + 5 = 12.0.
Finally, the code calculates the height of the triangle when a is the base and c is the angle. Since c is 90 degrees, math.sin(math.radians(90)) will be 1. Therefore, the height is b * sin(c) = 3 * 1 = 3.0.
