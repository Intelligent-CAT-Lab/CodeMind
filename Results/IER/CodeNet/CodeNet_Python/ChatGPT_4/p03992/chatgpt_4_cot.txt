<<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized with the string 'CODEFESTIVAL'.
The code then prints a new string that is a concatenation of the first four characters of s, a space, and the rest of the characters starting from the fifth character.
The first four characters of 'CODEFESTIVAL' are 'CODE'.
The rest of the characters starting from the fifth character are 'FESTIVAL'.
The output will be 'CODE FESTIVAL'.
