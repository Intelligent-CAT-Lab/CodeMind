<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 105.
The code first checks if n is less than 105. If it is, it prints 0. Since n is exactly 105, it does not print 0 and proceeds.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the count of numbers meeting a certain condition.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 105 to n (inclusive), with a step of 2, meaning it will consider only odd numbers starting from 105.
For each number i in this range, it initializes a counter cnt to 0.
Another loop is then entered, which iterates over all odd numbers from 1 to i (inclusive), checking if i is divisible by j. If it is, cnt is incremented.
After the inner loop, the code checks if cnt is equal to 8. If it is, it means that the number i has exactly 8 divisors, and ans is incremented by 1.
Since the range starts at 105 and ends at 105, and 105 has only 4 divisors (1, 3, 5, 35, 21, 7, 15, 105), cnt will not be equal to 8, so ans will remain 0.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 0.
