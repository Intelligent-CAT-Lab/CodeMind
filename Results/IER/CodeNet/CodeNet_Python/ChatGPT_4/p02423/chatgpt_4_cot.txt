<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 8.
The variable mask is set to (1<<32)-1, which is a 32-bit mask with all bits set to 1. This is used to ensure that when bitwise operations are performed, the result is limited to 32 bits.

The first print statement prints the binary representation of n, which is 8, in a 32-bit format with leading zeros. The binary representation of 8 is '1000', so with leading zeros it is '00000000000000000000000000001000'.

The second print statement prints the binary representation of the bitwise NOT of n, ANDed with the mask. The bitwise NOT of 8 is '...11111111111111111111111111110111' (infinite 1s followed by '0111'). When ANDed with the mask, which has only 32 bits of 1s, it results in '11111111111111111111111111110111'.

The third print statement prints the binary representation of n left-shifted by 1 bit, ANDed with the mask. Left-shifting 8 by 1 bit results in 16, which is '10000' in binary. With leading zeros and limited to 32 bits, it is '00000000000000000000000000010000'.

The fourth print statement prints the binary representation of n right-shifted by 1 bit, ANDed with the mask. Right-shifting 8 by 1 bit results in 4, which is '100' in binary. With leading zeros and limited to 32 bits, it is '00000000000000000000000000000100'.
