<<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized to the string 'aba'.
The code checks if the first character of the string is the same as the last character. In this case, 'a' is equal to 'a', so the condition is true.
Next, the code checks if the length of the string is odd. Since the length of 'aba' is 3, which is odd, the condition is true.
Because the first condition (s[0] == s[-1]) is true and the length of the string is odd, the variable ans is set to 'Second'.
Finally, the code prints the value of ans, which is 'Second'.
<<<Output>>>
Second
