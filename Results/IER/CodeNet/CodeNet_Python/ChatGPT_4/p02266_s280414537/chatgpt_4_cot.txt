<<<Analysis>>>
The input string is `\\//`.
The variable xmax is set to the length of the input, which is 4.
The input string is converted to a list and then reversed, resulting in the list `['/', '/', '\\', '\\']`.
The reversed list is then processed to replace slashes with their opposite, resulting in the list `['\\', '\\', '/', '/']`, which is joined to form the string `\\\\//`.

The function partialSqu calculates the area under the "mountain" for each character in the input string. It also updates the height h based on the character.

The first for loop processes the original data string `\\//`. It calculates the total area under the "mountains" and stores the area in the dictionary x_squ_dict with the x position as the key when the height returns to 0.

The second for loop processes the reversed and modified data string `\\\\//`. It performs the same calculations as the first loop but stores the results in the dictionary x_squ_dict with the corrected x position (considering the reversal).

After both loops, the keys of x_squ_dict are sorted, and the areas under the "mountains" are summed up and printed as an integer. Then, the number of "mountains" and their respective areas are printed as a space-separated string.

Let's go through the input step by step:
- The first loop encounters `\\`, which starts a "mountain". The total area after processing these characters is 1.0 (0.5 for each '\').
- The loop then encounters `//`, which ends the "mountain". The total area remains 1.0, and since the height returns to 0, the area is stored in x_squ_dict with the key 4 (the position of the last character).

The second loop processes `\\\\//`:
- It encounters `\\\\`, which starts a "mountain" from the reversed string. The total area after processing these characters is 2.0 (0.5 for each '\').
- The loop then encounters `//`, which ends the "mountain". The total area remains 2.0, and since the height returns to 0, the area is stored in x_squ_dict with the key 1 (the position of the last character from the original string).

The keys of x_squ_dict are [1, 4], and the areas are [2.0, 1.0]. The sum of the areas is 3.0, which is printed as an integer 3. The number of "mountains" is 2, and their respective areas are printed as "2 2 1".
