<<<Analysis>>>
The variables n and m are initialized to 1 and 1, respectively.
The variable submit is calculated as m*1900 + (n-m)*100. Since m and n are both 1, the calculation becomes 1*1900 + (1-1)*100, which simplifies to 1900 + 0, resulting in 1900.
The final print statement prints the value of submit multiplied by 2 raised to the power of m. Since m is 1, this is 1900 * 2^1, which equals 1900 * 2.
The output will be 3800.
