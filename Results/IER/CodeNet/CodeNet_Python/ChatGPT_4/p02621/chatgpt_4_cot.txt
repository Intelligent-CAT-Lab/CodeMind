<<<Analysis>>>
The variable a is initialized to the integer value of the input, which is 2.
The code then calculates the expression a + a ** 2 + a ** 3.
This is equivalent to 2 + 2 ** 2 + 2 ** 3.
2 ** 2 is 4, and 2 ** 3 is 8.
So the expression becomes 2 + 4 + 8, which equals 14.
The code then prints the result of the expression, which is 14.
<<<Output>>>
14
