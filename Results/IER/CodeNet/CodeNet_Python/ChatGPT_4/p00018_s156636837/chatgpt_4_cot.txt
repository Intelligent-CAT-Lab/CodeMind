<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string input, splits it by spaces, and converts each split string into an integer. The input '3 6 9 7 5' is thus converted into a list of integers [3, 6, 9, 7, 5].
The list is then sorted in reverse order, resulting in [9, 7, 6, 5, 3].
The code then iterates over this sorted list and prints each element followed by a space. The print statement in Python 2.x does not automatically add a newline, so the numbers will be printed on the same line.
<<<Output>>>
9 7 6 5 3
