The variable MAX is initialized to 10^9 + 7.
The variables N and M are initialized to 2 and 2, respectively, from the input.
The variable diff is calculated as N - M, which is 0 in this case.
The code then checks if the absolute value of diff is greater than 1, which it is not, so it skips the first if block.
Next, it checks if diff is equal to 0, which it is, so it enters the elif block.
Inside the elif block, it calculates the factorial of N (which is 2) and the factorial of M (which is also 2), multiplies them together, and then multiplies by 2.
The factorial of 2 is 2, so the calculation is 2 * 2 * 2, which equals 8.
Finally, it takes this result modulo MAX, which is 8 % (10^9 + 7), and since 8 is much smaller than 10^9 + 7, the result is just 8.
The code prints this result.
<<<Output>>>
8
