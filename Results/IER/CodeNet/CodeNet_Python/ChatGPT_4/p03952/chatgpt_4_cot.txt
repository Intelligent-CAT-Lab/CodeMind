The variable N is initialized to 4, and variable x is initialized to 4.
The code first checks if x is equal to 1 or 2*N-1 (which is 7 in this case). Since x is 4, the condition is not met, and the code continues.
The variable smaller is initialized to True. Since x is not greater than N, the value of smaller remains True.
The code then creates a list called ans. The list is created by concatenating two ranges:
- The first range goes from 2*N-1 (which is 7) to N+x-1 (which is 7) in steps of -1, which results in a list containing just [7].
- The second range goes from 1 to N+x (which is 8), resulting in a list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8].
The concatenation of these two lists results in ans = [7, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8].
Since smaller is True, the list ans is not modified by the subsequent if statement.
The code then prints 'Yes' and each element of the ans list on a new line.
