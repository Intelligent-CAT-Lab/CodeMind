<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized to 8.
An empty list called factors is created to store the factors of N.
The variable d is calculated as the floor of the square root of N, which is the floor of sqrt(8) â‰ˆ 2.82, so d is 2.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to d (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 2.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is a factor of N by checking if N % i == 0.
If i is a factor, it appends i to the factors list and also appends the corresponding complementary factor N//i.
After the loop, the factors list contains [1, 8, 2, 4].
The code then initializes ans to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of certain factors.
It enters another loop to iterate over each factor f in factors.
If f is 1, it continues to the next iteration without doing anything.
For each other factor, it calculates s and t by dividing N by f-1 and taking the remainder, respectively.
If s equals t, it adds f-1 to ans.
For factor 8, s = 8 // (8-1) = 1 and t = 8 % (8-1) = 1, so 8-1 = 7 is added to ans.
For factor 2, s = 8 // (2-1) = 8 and t = 8 % (2-1) = 0, so it does not satisfy the condition.
For factor 4, s = 8 // (4-1) = 2 and t = 8 % (4-1) = 2, so 4-1 = 3 is added to ans.
The final value of ans is 7 + 3 = 10.
The code prints the final value of ans.
