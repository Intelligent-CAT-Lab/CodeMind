The variable x is initialized to 2.
The variable j is initialized to 2.
The code then enters a loop that iterates x times, which is 2 times in this case.
In the first iteration (i=0):
- j is multiplied by 2, so j becomes 2 * 2 = 4.
- Then 2 is added to j, so j becomes 4 + 2 = 6.
In the second iteration (i=1):
- j is multiplied by 2 again, so j becomes 6 * 2 = 12.
- Then 2 is added to j, so j becomes 12 + 2 = 14.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of j, which is 14.
<<<Output>>>
14
