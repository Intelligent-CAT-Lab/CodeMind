<<<Analysis>>>
The variables x and y are initialized to 8 and 6, respectively.
The code then prints the value of x if x is not divisible by y, otherwise it prints -1.
Since 8 is not divisible by 6 (8 % 6 equals 2, which is not 0), the condition x % y is true.
Therefore, the code will print the value of x, which is 8.
<<<Output>>>
8
