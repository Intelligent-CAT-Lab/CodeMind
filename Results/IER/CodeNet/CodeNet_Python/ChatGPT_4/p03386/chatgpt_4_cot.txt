<<<Analysis>>>
The variables A, B, and K are initialized to 3, 8, and 2, respectively.
The list comprehension creates a list X of numbers starting from A (3) and ending at A+K (5), but only if they are less than or equal to B (8). Therefore, X will be [3, 4, 5].
Another list comprehension creates a list Y of numbers starting from B-K+1 (7) and ending at B+1 (9), but only if they are greater than or equal to A (3). Since 9 is not less than or equal to B (8), it will not be included. Therefore, Y will be [7, 8].
The code then combines the two lists X and Y and converts them into a set to remove duplicates, resulting in the set {3, 4, 5, 7, 8}.
The set is converted back to a list and sorted, resulting in the list [3, 4, 5, 7, 8].
Finally, the code prints each element in the sorted list on a separate line.
