The input "125" is passed to the main function and a Formula object is created with "125" as its input.
The length of the input is 3, so the input_split_pos is set to 2.
The mask is calculated as 2**2 - 1, which is 3 (binary 11).

The calc_sum method will be called with different split_pos values, which are determined by the bits variable iterating from 0 to the mask value (3). The split_pos values will be the binary representation of bits, masked by the mask value.

For each iteration, the binary representation of bits is used to determine where to split the input string "125" into integers, which are then summed and added to the object's sum attribute.

The iterations will be as follows:
1. bits = 0 (binary 00), no split, sum = 125
2. bits = 1 (binary 01), split between "1" and "25", sum = 125 + 1 + 25 = 151
3. bits = 2 (binary 10), split between "12" and "5", sum = 151 + 12 + 5 = 168
4. bits = 3 (binary 11), split between "1", "2", and "5", sum = 168 + 1 + 2 + 5 = 176

After the loop finishes, the final sum is printed, which is 176.
