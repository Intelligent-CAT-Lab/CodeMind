<<<Analysis>>>
The main function is defined, which takes an input and assigns it to variable 'a'.
The input 'B' is a single character string.
The if condition checks whether 'a' is an uppercase letter using the isupper() method.
Since 'B' is indeed an uppercase letter, the condition is true.
Therefore, the program will print 'A'.
<<<Output>>>
A
