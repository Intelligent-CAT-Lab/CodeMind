The variables n and m are initialized to 2 and 2, respectively, from the input.
The variable mod is set to 1,000,000,007 (10^9 + 7), which is a large prime number often used for modulo operations in competitive programming to avoid integer overflow.

The code checks if n is greater than m and if so, swaps their values. Since n and m are equal, no swap is needed.

The function p(n) is defined to calculate the factorial of n modulo mod. It initializes a variable ret to 1 and then iterates from 1 to n, multiplying ret by i and taking the modulo mod at each step. This is to calculate n! % mod.

The function solve(n, m) is defined to calculate the result based on the values of n and m. If n equals m, it returns the product of p(n), p(m), and 2, all modulo mod. If n does not equal m, it simply returns the product of p(n) and p(m) modulo mod.

Since n equals m in the input, the code will execute the if branch inside the solve function.

The factorial of 2 modulo mod is calculated as follows:
p(2) = 1 * 1 % mod = 1
p(2) = 1 * 2 % mod = 2

Therefore, p(2) is equal to 2.

The solve function will return (p(2) * p(2) * 2) % mod, which is (2 * 2 * 2) % mod = 8 % mod.

Since 8 is less than mod, the modulo operation has no effect, and the result is simply 8.

The final output is the result of the solve function, which is 8.
