<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a, b, c, and d are initialized to 4, 7, 9, and 3, respectively.
The code first checks if the absolute difference between a and c is less than or equal to d. In this case, abs(4 - 9) is 5, which is not less than or equal to 3, so the first condition is not met.
Next, the code checks if both the absolute difference between a and b is less than or equal to d, and the absolute difference between b and c is less than or equal to d. In this case, abs(4 - 7) is 3, which is equal to d, and abs(7 - 9) is 2, which is less than d. Therefore, both conditions are met.
Since the second condition is met, the code will print 'Yes'.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
