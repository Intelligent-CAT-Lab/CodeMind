<<<Analysis>>>
The input N is initialized to 20.
An array d of size N is initialized with all elements set to 0.
The variable r is set to 100, which is the upper limit for the range in the first for loop.
The variable ii is initialized to 0, which will be used to calculate a value c in the nested loops.

The first for loop iterates from 1 to 99 (since range(1, r) goes up to r-1).
In each iteration of the first loop, ii is updated to be ii + 2*i - 1.
The second for loop iterates from 1 to i (inclusive).
In each iteration of the second loop, s is set to i + j, and c is set to ii + s * j.
The variable l is set to 6, but if i == j, l is set to 3.
If c + 1 + s is greater than N (20 in this case), the loop breaks.
The third for loop iterates from 1 to j (inclusive).
In each iteration of the third loop, c is updated to be c + 2*k - 1 + s.
If c is less than or equal to N, the value of l is added to d[c - 1].
If j == k, l is set to 3, and if i == k, l is set to 1.
If c is greater than N, the loop breaks.

After all loops finish, the program prints the elements of the array d, each on a new line.

The output will be the values in the array d after all the updates from the nested loops.
