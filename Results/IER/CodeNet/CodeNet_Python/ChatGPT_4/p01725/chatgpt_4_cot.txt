The input string "3-2*3" is appended with a "$" to mark the end of the string.

The `parse` function is defined to evaluate the expression based on the precedence of the operators given by the `pri` tuple. The `code` string "+-*" represents the operators.

The `number` function is defined to parse a number from the current position `cur` in the string `S`. If the current character is '(', it recursively calls `expr` to evaluate the expression inside the parentheses.

The `expr` function is defined to evaluate an expression at a given precedence level. It uses the `number` function to get the values and applies the operators based on the precedence level.

The `ans` variable is initialized to a very small number to ensure that any result from the expression will be larger.

The `for` loop iterates over all possible permutations of precedence levels for the three operators. There are 3^3 = 27 such permutations.

For each permutation of precedence levels, the `parse` function is called, and the maximum result is updated in `ans`.

The final result is printed, which is the maximum value obtained from evaluating the expression with all possible operator precedences.

For the given input "3-2*3", the possible evaluations based on different precedences are:
- If '*' has the highest precedence (executed first), the expression is evaluated as 3-(2*3) = 3-6 = -3.
- If '-' has the highest precedence, the expression is evaluated as (3-2)*3 = 1*3 = 3.
- If '+' has the highest precedence, it doesn't affect the result because there is no '+' in the expression.

The maximum value from these evaluations is 3, so the output will be 3.
