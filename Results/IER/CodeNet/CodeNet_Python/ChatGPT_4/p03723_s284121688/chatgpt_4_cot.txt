The variables a, b, and c are initialized to 4, 12, and 20, respectively.
The variable d is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of operations performed.
The code enters a while loop that continues as long as a, b, and c are all even numbers.
Inside the loop, the code first checks if a, b, and c are all equal. If they are, it prints -1 and breaks out of the loop. This would mean that the operation can be performed indefinitely without changing the parity of the numbers.
Since a, b, and c are not all equal initially, the loop continues.
The code then performs an operation where each of a, b, and c is replaced by the sum of half of the other two numbers:
- a becomes hb + hc, which is 6 + 10 = 16
- b becomes ha + hc, which is 2 + 10 = 12
- c becomes ha + hb, which is 2 + 6 = 8
The variable d is incremented by 1.
The loop checks again if a, b, and c are all even, which they are, so it continues.
The loop checks if a, b, and c are all equal, which they are not, so it continues.
The operation is performed again:
- a becomes 6 + 4 = 10
- b becomes 8 + 4 = 12
- c becomes 8 + 6 = 14
The variable d is incremented by 1.
The loop checks again if a, b, and c are all even, which they are not (c is now odd), so the loop ends.
The code prints the value of d, which is 2, representing the number of operations performed before one of the numbers became odd.
