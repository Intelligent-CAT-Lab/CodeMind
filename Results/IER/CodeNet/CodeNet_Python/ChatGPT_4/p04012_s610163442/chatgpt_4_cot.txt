<<<Analysis>>>
The input string 'abaccaba' is stored in variable w.
A defaultdict of type int is created, which will store characters as keys and their counts as values.
The code iterates over each character in the string 'abaccaba' and increments its count in the defaultdict d.
After the loop, the defaultdict d will have the following key-value pairs: {'a': 4, 'b': 2, 'c': 2}.
The code then iterates over the values of the defaultdict, which are the counts of each character.
It checks if any count is odd by using the modulo operator value % 2 != 0.
If an odd count is found, it prints 'No' and exits the program immediately.
Since all counts are even (4 for 'a', 2 for 'b', and 2 for 'c'), the loop completes without printing 'No'.
After the loop, the code prints 'Yes' because no odd count was found.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
