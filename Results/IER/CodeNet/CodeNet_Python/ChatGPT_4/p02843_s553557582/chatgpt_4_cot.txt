The variable n is initialized to 615.
An array f of size n+1 (616 elements) is created, initialized with zeros.
f[0] is set to 1.
The code then enters a nested loop:
- The outer loop iterates over x from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 615.
- The inner loop iterates over i from 100 to 105 (inclusive), because the range function in Python is exclusive at the end.
For each combination of x and i, the code checks if x-i is non-negative and if f[x-i] is 1.
If both conditions are met, it sets f[x] to 1.
This logic essentially checks if it's possible to reach the number x by adding any of the numbers from 100 to 105 to a previous number that has already been determined to be reachable (marked with a 1 in the array f).
The final print statement outputs the value of f[n], which is f[615].
To determine f[615], we need to check if there is any x in the range from 615-100 to 615-105 that has f[x] set to 1.
Since 615 is a multiple of 105 (615 = 105 * 5 + 100 * 0), it is guaranteed that we can reach 615 by adding 105 five times to 0 (which is marked as reachable at the start).
Therefore, f[615] will be set to 1, indicating that 615 is reachable by the given rules.
