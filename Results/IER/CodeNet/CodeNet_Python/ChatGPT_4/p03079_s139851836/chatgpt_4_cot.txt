<<<Analysis>>>
The variables A, B, and C are initialized to 2, 2, and 2, respectively, after converting the input string to integers and splitting it by spaces.
The code then checks if A, B, and C are all equal. Since all three variables are equal to 2, the condition A == B and B == C is True.
As a result, the code will execute the first branch of the if statement and print "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
