<<<Analysis>>>
The variable S is initialized to the string "AIZU".
The variable alpha contains the uppercase English alphabet.
The variable Now is initialized to 0, which represents the current position in the alphabet.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of times the next character in S is not in alphabetical order compared to the current character.

The code then enters a loop that iterates over each character in the string S.
For each character s in S, it finds the index of s in the alphabet string alpha and stores it in Next.

The code checks if the current position Now is less than the next position Next. If it is not, it means the characters are not in alphabetical order, and it increments ans by 1.

The variable Now is then updated to the value of Next for the next iteration.

The loop processes the characters in "AIZU" as follows:
- For 'A', Next is 0. Now (0) is not less than Next (0), so ans remains 0.
- For 'I', Next is 8. Now (0) is less than Next (8), so ans remains 0.
- For 'Z', Next is 25. Now (8) is less than Next (25), so ans remains 0.
- For 'U', Next is 20. Now (25) is not less than Next (20), so ans is incremented by 1.

After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 1.
