The code defines a factorial list `fact` with precomputed factorials from 0! to 100!.
The function `C(a, b)` computes the binomial coefficient C(a, b), which is the number of ways to choose b elements from a set of a elements.
The function `sC(a, b)` computes the sum of products of binomial coefficients C(b, i) and C(a - b, i) for i from 0 to min(b, a-b).
The function `calc(n, k)` is a recursive function that constructs a list of strings representing a sequence of integers starting with `k` that satisfies certain combinatorial properties related to the input `n`.

Given the input `7`, the following steps occur:
1. The `calc` function is called with `n=7` and `k=1`.
2. The while loop finds the largest `i` such that `(1<<(i+1)) - 1 <= n`. In this case, `i` becomes `2` because `(1<<(2+1)) - 1 = 7` which is equal to `n`.
3. A list `ret` is created with `i+1` (which is `3`) copies of the string `'1'`.
4. The remaining value `rem` is calculated as `n - ((1<<i) - 1)`, which is `7 - (4 - 1) = 4`.
5. The variable `kk` is set to `k + 1`, which is `2`.
6. The variable `j` is set to `i // 2`, which is `1`.
7. The inner while loop checks if `sC(i, j)` is less than or equal to `rem`. Since `sC(3, 1)` is `3`, which is less than `rem`, it inserts `'2'` at index `j` in `ret`, appends `'2'` to `ret`, increments `kk` to `3`, and decreases `rem` by `3` (now `rem` is `1`).
8. The value of `j` is decremented to `0`, and the inner while loop ends because `sC(3, 0)` is `1`, which is not less than `rem`.
9. The function calls itself recursively with the new `rem` (which is `1`) and `kk` (which is `3`), and the result of this call is an empty list because `n <= 0` is `True`.
10. The final list `X` is `['1', '1', '2', '1', '2']`.
11. The length of `X` is `5`, and the elements of `X` are joined with spaces to form the output string.
