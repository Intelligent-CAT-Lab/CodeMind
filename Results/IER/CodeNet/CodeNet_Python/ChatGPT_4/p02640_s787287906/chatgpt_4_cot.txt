<<<Analysis>>>
The variables X and Y are initialized to 3 and 8, respectively.
The code checks if Y is at least twice X and at most four times X, and also if Y is an even number.
The condition 2*X <= Y <= 4*X translates to 2*3 <= 8 <= 4*3, which simplifies to 6 <= 8 <= 12. This condition is true.
The second condition Y % 2 == 0 checks if Y is even. Since 8 % 2 equals 0, this condition is also true.
Since both conditions are met, the code will print "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
