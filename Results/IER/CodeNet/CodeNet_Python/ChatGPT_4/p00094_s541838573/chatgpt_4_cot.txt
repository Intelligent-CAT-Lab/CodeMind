<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a and b are initialized to 15 and 25, respectively, from the input.
The code calculates the value of x by multiplying a and b, and then dividing by 3.305785, which is a conversion factor from square feet to square meters.
The calculation is as follows: x = 15 * 25 / 3.305785, which equals 113.376414.
The code then prints the value of x formatted to 6 decimal places.
<<<Output>>>
113.376414
