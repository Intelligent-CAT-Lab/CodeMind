<<<Analysis>>>
The variables x1 and x2 are initialized with the values 20 and 30, respectively, from the input.
The code then checks if x2 is greater than x1, which is true in this case (30 > 20).
Since the condition is true, the code prints the result of x2 - x1, which is 30 - 20.
The result of the subtraction is 10, which is then printed as an integer.
<<<Output>>>
10
