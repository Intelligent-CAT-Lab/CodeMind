The variables n, a, b, and k are initialized to 4, 1, 2, and 5, respectively.
The variable m is calculated as n // 2 + 1, which is 4 // 2 + 1 = 3.
The variable mod is set to 998244353, which is a large prime number often used in modular arithmetic problems.
A list named comb is created with m elements, all initialized to 1. This list will store the binomial coefficients modulo mod.
The loop calculates the binomial coefficients using the formula comb[i] = comb[i - 1] * (n + 1 - i) * pow(i, mod - 2, mod) and stores them in the comb list. The pow function is used to calculate the modular multiplicative inverse.
After the loop, comb will be [1, 4, 6] because:
comb[1] = comb[0] * (4 + 1 - 1) * pow(1, 998244353 - 2, 998244353) % 998244353 = 1 * 4 * 1 % 998244353 = 4
comb[2] = comb[1] * (4 + 1 - 2) * pow(2, 998244353 - 2, 998244353) % 998244353 = 4 * 3 * pow(2, 998244351, 998244353) % 998244353 = 12 * 499122177 % 998244353 = 6
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the answer.
The loop iterates over the range from 0 to n (inclusive), which is 0 to 4 in this case.
For each i, it checks if a * i is greater than k. If it is, the loop breaks.
If not, it calculates j as k - a * i and checks if j is divisible by b.
If j is divisible by b, it divides j by b and checks if j is between 0 and n (inclusive).
If j is within the range, it calculates the minimum of i and n - i, and the minimum of j and n - j, and multiplies the corresponding binomial coefficients from the comb list, adding the result to ans.
The answer is taken modulo mod.
After the loop, the final value of ans is printed.
The loop will iterate with i values 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. The condition a * i > k will never be true, so the loop will not break early.
For i = 0, j = 5, which is not divisible by b (2), so it continues to the next iteration.
For i = 1, j = 4, which is divisible by b, so j becomes 2. Both i and j are within the range, so it calculates ans += comb[1] * comb[2] % mod = 4 * 6 % 998244353 = 24.
For i = 2, j = 3, which is not divisible by b, so it continues to the next iteration.
For i = 3, j = 2, which is divisible by b, so j becomes 1. Both i and j are within the range, so it calculates ans += comb[1] * comb[1] % mod = 4 * 4 % 998244353 = 16. Now ans = (24 + 16) % 998244353 = 40.
For i = 4, j = 1, which is not divisible by b, so it continues to the next iteration.
The loop ends, and the final value of ans is 40.
