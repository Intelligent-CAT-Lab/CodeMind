<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two strings from the standard input, which are '1' and '21'.
These strings are concatenated to form the string '121', which is then converted to an integer n with the value 121.
The square root of n is calculated, which is 11.0 for 121, and then converted to an integer sqrtn with the value 11.
A loop is initiated that iterates from 1 to sqrtn (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 11.
For each number i in this range, the code checks if the square of i is equal to n.
When i is 11, the condition 11 * 11 == 121 is true.
Since the condition is met, the code prints 'Yes' and breaks out of the loop.
The output of the code will be 'Yes' because 121 is a perfect square (11 * 11).
<<<Output>>>
Yes
