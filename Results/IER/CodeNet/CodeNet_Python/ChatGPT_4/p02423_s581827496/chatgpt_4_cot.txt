<<<Analysis>>>
The variable x is initialized to 8.
The code prints the binary representation of x with 32 bits, which is '00000000000000000000000000001000'.
The code then uses the translate method to swap '0's with '1's and vice versa, resulting in '11111111111111111111111111110111'.
Next, the code performs a left bit shift on x (x << 1), which results in '00000000000000000000000000010000', and prints the last 32 bits of it.
Finally, the code performs a right bit shift on x (x >> 1), which results in '00000000000000000000000000000100', and prints it.
