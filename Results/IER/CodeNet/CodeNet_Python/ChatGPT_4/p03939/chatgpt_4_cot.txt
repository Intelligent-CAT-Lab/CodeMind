<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function `main` that takes three parameters: `N`, `d`, and `x`. It then initializes a variable `ret` to 0. The function enters a while loop that continues as long as `N` is not zero.

The input provided is `1 3 3`, so `N` is initialized to 1, `d` to 3, and `x` to 3.

The while loop will execute only once because `N` starts at 1 and is decremented by 1 at the end of the loop.

Inside the loop, the following calculations are performed:
1. `ret` is incremented by `d + (N-0.5) * x`, which is `3 + (1-0.5) * 3` = `3 + 0.5 * 3` = `3 + 1.5` = `4.5`.
2. `d` is updated to `d + (d/N) + (5*x)/(2*N)`, which is `3 + (3/1) + (5*3)/(2*1)` = `3 + 3 + 7.5` = `13.5`.
3. `x` is updated to `x + 2*x/N`, which is `3 + 2*3/1` = `3 + 6` = `9`.
4. `N` is decremented by 1, so `N` becomes `0`.

The loop ends because `N` is now 0. The function returns the value of `ret`, which is `4.5`.

The `print` statement outside the function prints the returned value.
