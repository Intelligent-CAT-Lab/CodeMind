<<<Analysis>>>
The input '3 3' is split into a list of strings ['3', '3'] and then each string is converted to an integer, resulting in the list a = [3, 3].
The if statement checks if the first element of the list a (a[0]) is equal to the second element of the list a (a[1]).
Since both elements are equal (3 == 3), the condition is True.
Therefore, the code prints 'Yes'.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
