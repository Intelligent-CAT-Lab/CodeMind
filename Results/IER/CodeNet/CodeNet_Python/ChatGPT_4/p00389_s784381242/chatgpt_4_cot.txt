<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N and variable K are initialized to 4 and 2, respectively.
The variable ans is initialized to 1, which will be used to count the number of steps.
The variable s is initialized to 1, which represents the current step size.
N is decremented by 1, so N becomes 3.

The code enters a while loop that will continue indefinitely until a break statement is encountered.
In the first iteration:
- m is calculated as (s+K-1) // K, which is (1+2-1) // 2 = 1.
- Since N (3) is not less than m (1), the loop continues.
- s is incremented by m, so s becomes 2.
- N is decremented by m, so N becomes 2.
- ans is incremented by 1, so ans becomes 2.

In the second iteration:
- m is calculated as (s+K-1) // K, which is (2+2-1) // 2 = 1.
- Since N (2) is not less than m (1), the loop continues.
- s is incremented by m, so s becomes 3.
- N is decremented by m, so N becomes 1.
- ans is incremented by 1, so ans becomes 3.

In the third iteration:
- m is calculated as (s+K-1) // K, which is (3+2-1) // 2 = 2.
- Since N (1) is less than m (2), the loop breaks.

The code prints the final value of ans, which is 3.
