<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes two variables, ans and length, to 0. The variable ans will hold the maximum length of a substring that consists only of the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'. The variable length will keep track of the current length of such a substring as the code iterates through the input string.

The input string is 'ATCODER'.

The code then iterates through each character in the input string:
- 'A' is in the set ['A', 'C', 'G', 'T'], so length becomes 1 and ans is updated to 1.
- 'T' is in the set, so length becomes 2 and ans is updated to 2.
- 'C' is not in the set, so length is reset to 0.
- 'O' is not in the set, so length remains 0.
- 'D' is not in the set, so length remains 0.
- 'E' is not in the set, so length remains 0.
- 'R' is not in the set, so length remains 0.

The maximum length of a substring that consists only of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' is 2, which was found at the beginning of the string "AT".

Finally, the code prints the value of ans, which is 2.

<<<Output>>>
2
