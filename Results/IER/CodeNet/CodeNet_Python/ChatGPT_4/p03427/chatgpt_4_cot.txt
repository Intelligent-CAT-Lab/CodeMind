<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to the string '100'.
The code then calculates two values and prints the maximum of the two.
The first value is calculated as follows:
- int(n[0])-1: This takes the first digit of n, converts it to an integer, and subtracts 1. For '100', this is 1-1 = 0.
- 9*(len(n)-1): This multiplies 9 by the length of n minus 1. For '100', the length is 3, so this is 9*(3-1) = 9*2 = 18.
- The sum of the above two values is 0 + 18 = 18.

The second value is the sum of the digits of n, which is calculated using a list comprehension and the sum function. For '100', the digits are 1, 0, and 0, so the sum is 1+0+0 = 1.

The code then prints the maximum of the two calculated values, which is max(18, 1).

<<<Output>>>
18
