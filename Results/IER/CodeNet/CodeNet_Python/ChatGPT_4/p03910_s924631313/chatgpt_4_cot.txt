<<<Analysis>>>
The variable SIZE is initialized to 4500, but it is not used in the code.
The main function is defined and then called at the end of the script.
The variable N is initialized to 4, which is the input provided.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to SIZE+1, but the loop breaks early based on a condition.
The condition in the loop is checking for the smallest integer n such that n*(n+1)/2 is just greater than or equal to N. For N=4, this happens when n=2 because 2*(2+1)/2 = 3 and (2+1)*(2+2)/2 = 6, so 3 < 2*N <= 6.
The variable n is then incremented by 1, so n becomes 3.
The variable d is calculated as n*(n+1)//2 - N, which is 3*(3+1)//2 - 4 = 6 - 4 = 2.
The code then enters another loop that iterates from 1 to n+1 (which is 4 in this case).
In this loop, it prints the value of i unless i is equal to d (which is 2). So it will not print 2, but it will print 1, 3, and 4.
The output will be the numbers 1, 3, and 4 printed on separate lines.
