<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a, b, and c are initialized to 2, 4, and 6, respectively.
The code then checks if the difference between b and a is equal to the difference between c and b.
In this case, b - a is 4 - 2, which equals 2, and c - b is 6 - 4, which also equals 2.
Since both differences are equal, the condition b - a == c - b is True.
Therefore, the code prints "YES".
<<<Output>>>
YES
