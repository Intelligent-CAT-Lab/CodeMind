<<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized with the string "CODEFESTIVAL".
The variable ss is initialized with an empty string, but it is not used anywhere in the code.
The variable p is initialized to 0, which will be used to track the presence of the sequence "C" followed by "F".
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each character in the string s.
The first if condition checks if p is 0 and the current character is "C". If so, p is set to 1.
The second elif condition checks if p is 1 and the current character is "F". If so, p is set to 2.
The loop continues until all characters in the string have been checked.
The string "CODEFESTIVAL" contains "C" followed by "F" (the "C" at index 0 and the "F" at index 5), so p will eventually be set to 2.
After the loop finishes, the code prints "Yes" if p is equal to 2, otherwise it prints "No".
Since p is 2, the output will be "Yes".
