<<<Analysis>>>
The input string '1 7 9 4' is split into a list of strings ['1', '7', '9', '4'].
Each string in the list is converted to an integer, resulting in the list [1, 7, 9, 4].
This list is then sorted, which does not change the order because the list is already in ascending order, so the sorted list is also [1, 7, 9, 4].
The sorted list is compared to the list [1, 4, 7, 9].
Since the two lists are not equal, the variable ans is set to 'NO'.
The code prints the value of ans, which is 'NO'.
<<<Output>>>
NO
