<<<Analysis>>>
The variable S is initialized to the string "QWERTYASDFZXCV".
The function AtoZ(s) is defined to find the distance between the first occurrence of "A" and the last occurrence of "Z" in the string s.
The function starts by iterating over the characters of the string from the beginning to find the first occurrence of "A". The variable front will be the index of the first "A" found.
In the given string, "A" is found at index 6 (0-based indexing).
Next, the function iterates over the characters of the string from the end to find the last occurrence of "Z". The variable back will be the index of the last "Z" found.
In the given string, "Z" is found at index 11 (0-based indexing).
The function then calculates the distance between the first "A" and the last "Z" by subtracting the index of the first "A" from the index of the last "Z" and adding 1 to account for the inclusive range.
The distance is calculated as 11 - 6 + 1 = 6.
The function returns this distance, which is stored in the variable ans.
The code then prints the value of ans, which is 6.
<<<Output>>>
6
