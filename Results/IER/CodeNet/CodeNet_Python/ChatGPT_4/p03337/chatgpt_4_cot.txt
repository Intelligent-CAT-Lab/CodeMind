<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a and b are initialized with the values 3 and 1, respectively, from the input.
The code calculates three different expressions: a+b, a-b, and a*b, which are 3+1=4, 3-1=2, and 3*1=3, respectively.
The max function is then used to determine the maximum value among these three results.
The maximum value among 4, 2, and 3 is 4.
The code then prints this maximum value.
<<<Output>>>
4
