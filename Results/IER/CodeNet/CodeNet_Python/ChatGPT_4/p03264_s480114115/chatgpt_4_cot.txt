<<<Analysis>>>
The variable k is initialized to 3.
The variable k1 is calculated as k//2, which is the integer division of k by 2. For k=3, k1 will be 1 because integer division truncates the decimal part.
The variable k2 is calculated as k-k1, which is 3-1 in this case, resulting in k2 being 2.
The code then prints the product of k1 and k2, which is 1*2.
The output will be 2.
