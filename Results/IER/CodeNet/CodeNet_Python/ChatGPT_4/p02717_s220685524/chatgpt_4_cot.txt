<<<Analysis>>>
The input string "1 2 3" is split into three parts by the `split()` function, and each part is converted to an integer using `map(int, input().strip().split())`. The variables a, b, and c are then assigned the values 1, 2, and 3, respectively.
The `print` function is then called with the arguments c, a, and b, which means it will print the values of c, a, and b in that order, separated by spaces.
Therefore, the output will be "3 1 2".
<<<Output>>>
3 1 2
