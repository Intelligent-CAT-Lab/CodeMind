<<<Analysis>>>
The variable num is initialized to the integer value of the input, which is 67.
The code then checks if num is within the range of ASCII values for uppercase letters (65 to 90).
Since 67 falls within this range, the condition 65<=num<=90 is True.
Therefore, the code prints 1 and does not check the other conditions.
