<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with the list of strings split by spaces from the input, which is `['1', '2', '+']`.
An empty list s is created to be used as a stack for the operations.
The code enters a loop that iterates over the elements of n.
For each element i in n:
- If the element is "+", it pops the last two elements from the stack s, adds them, and appends the result back to s.
- If the element is "-", it pops the last two elements from the stack s, subtracts the second popped element from the first, and appends the result back to s.
- If the element is "*", it pops the last two elements from the stack s, multiplies them, and appends the result back to s.
- If the element is a number, it converts it to an integer and appends it to s.

In this case, the input is `1 2 +`, so the following operations occur:
- '1' is appended to s, s becomes [1].
- '2' is appended to s, s becomes [1, 2].
- '+' causes the last two elements (1 and 2) to be popped from s, added together to get 3, and the result is appended back to s, s becomes [3].

After the loop, the last element of s is popped and printed, which is 3.
