<<<Analysis>>>
The variables x, a, and b are initialized to 4, 3, and 6, respectively.
The code then checks if b is less than or equal to a. In this case, 6 is not less than or equal to 3, so the first condition is false.
Next, the code checks if (b - a) is less than or equal to x. Since (6 - 3) equals 3, which is less than or equal to 4, this condition is true.
Because the second condition is true, the code will execute the corresponding print statement and print 'safe'.
<<<Output>>>
safe
