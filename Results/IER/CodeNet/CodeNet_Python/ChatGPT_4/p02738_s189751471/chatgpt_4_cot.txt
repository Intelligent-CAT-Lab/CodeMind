The variables N and M are initialized to 1 and 998244353, respectively.

The `mod_inv` function is defined to calculate the modular multiplicative inverse of x modulo M using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. It is decorated with `lru_cache` to memoize the results for efficiency.

The `gen_Y` function is a generator that yields a sequence of values based on the formula given in the comments. Since N is 1, the range for j in `gen_Y` will be from 1 to 1 (inclusive), and it will only yield a single value.

The `gen_X` function is a generator that yields a sequence of values based on the formula given in the comments. Since N is 1, the range for i in `gen_X` will be from 1 to 1 (inclusive), and it will only yield a single value.

The `acc_mulmod` function is a generator that takes an iterable and an initial value, and yields a running product of the elements of the iterable modulo M.

The `ans` variable is calculated by summing the sum of the products of the values generated by `gen_Y(i)` and the corresponding values from `acc_mulmod(gen_X())`, modulo M. Since N is 1, there will be only one value from `gen_X` and one value from `gen_Y(0)`.

Let's calculate the values step by step:
- `gen_X` will yield `1 * 2 * 1 * mod_inv(1)`, which is `2 * mod_inv(1)`. Since `mod_inv(1)` is `1`, `gen_X` yields `2`.
- `acc_mulmod(gen_X())` will yield `1` and then `2`.
- `gen_Y(0)` will yield `3 * (1-0) * (3 * (1-0) - 1) >> 1 * mod_inv(1)`, which simplifies to `3 * 2 >> 1 * 1`, which is `3`.
- `acc_mulmod(gen_Y(0), 2)` will yield `2` and then `6 % 998244353`, which is `6`.
- The sum of the products of the values from `gen_Y(0)` and `acc_mulmod(gen_X())` is `2 * 6`, which is `12`.

Finally, `ans` is `12 % 998244353`, which is `12`.

Therefore, the output of the code execution given the input `1 998244353` is `12`.
