<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized to 10.
The variable answer is initialized to 0, which will be used to store the final result.
The code enters a loop that starts from the integer part of the square root of N and decrements down to 1.
For each number i in this range, the code checks if N is divisible by i (N % i == 0).
If it is, the code calculates the answer as (i - 1) + (N // i - 1) and breaks out of the loop.
For N = 10, the square root is approximately 3.16, so the loop starts at 3 and goes down to 1.
When i is 2, 10 is divisible by 2 (10 % 2 == 0), so the answer is calculated as (2 - 1) + (10 // 2 - 1) = 1 + (5 - 1) = 1 + 4 = 5.
The loop breaks and the code prints the value of answer, which is 5.
<<<Output>>>
