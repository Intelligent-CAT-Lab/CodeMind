The variables a, h, and x are initialized to 2, 2, and 4, respectively, from the input.
The variable y is calculated using the formula y = 2*h/a - 2*x/a**3, which simplifies to y = 2*2/2 - 2*4/2**3, resulting in y = 1 - 1 = 0.
The variable z is calculated using the formula z = (h**2)*a/(2*x), which simplifies to z = (2**2)*2/(2*4), resulting in z = 4*2/8 = 1.
The variable b is calculated using the formula b = x/(a**2), which simplifies to b = 4/(2**2), resulting in b = 4/4 = 1.
The condition checks if b > h/2, which is if 1 > 2/2, which is false.
Since the condition is false, the code executes the else block and prints the degrees of the arctangent of z.
The arctangent of z (which is 1) is 45 degrees in radians.
The math.degrees function is used to convert the angle from radians to degrees.
Therefore, the output will be the degree value of an angle whose tangent is 1, which is 45 degrees.

45.0
