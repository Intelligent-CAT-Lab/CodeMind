<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 2.
The variables a, b, and c are initialized to 1, 1, and n (which is 2) respectively.
The variable p is initialized to n-1 (which is 1).

The code then enters a loop that iterates n-1 times, which is 1 time in this case since n is 2.

In the first iteration of the loop:
- p is incremented by a-1, which is 0, so p remains 1.
- a, b, and c are updated to the values of b, c, and a formula respectively.
- a becomes 1 (the old value of b).
- b becomes 2 (the old value of c).
- c becomes ((n-1)**2 + p + c) % (10**9+7), which is (1**2 + 1 + 2) % 1000000007, which is 4 % 1000000007, which is 4.

Since the loop only runs once, there are no more iterations.

The code prints the final value of c, which is 4.
