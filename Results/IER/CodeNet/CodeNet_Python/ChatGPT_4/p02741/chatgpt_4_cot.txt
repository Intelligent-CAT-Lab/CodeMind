<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a list `nums` with a sequence of integers.
It then prints the element of `nums` at the index provided by the user input.
The input provided is `6`.
Since Python uses zero-based indexing, the element at index `6` is the seventh element in the list.
The seventh element in the list `nums` is `2`.
Therefore, the output will be `2`.
