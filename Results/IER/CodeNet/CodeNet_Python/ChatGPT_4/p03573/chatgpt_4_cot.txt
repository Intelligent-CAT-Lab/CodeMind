<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a, b, and c are initialized to 5, 7, and 5, respectively.
The code then checks if a is equal to b, which is not the case (5 is not equal to 7).
Next, it checks if b is equal to c, which is also not the case (7 is not equal to 5).
Since neither of the first two conditions is met, the code executes the else block and prints the value of b.
The output will be the value of b, which is 7.
<<<Output>>>
7
