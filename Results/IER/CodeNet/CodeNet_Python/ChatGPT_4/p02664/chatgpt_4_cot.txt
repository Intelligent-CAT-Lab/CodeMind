<<<Analysis>>>
The variable a is initialized with the input string "PD?D??P?".
The string is then converted into a list of characters.
The code enters a loop that iterates over the length of the list a.
During each iteration, it checks if the current character is a question mark "?".
If it finds a question mark, it replaces that character with the letter "D".
After the loop, the code initializes an empty string b.
It then enters another loop that iterates over the length of the list a again.
During each iteration, it concatenates the current character to the string b.
After the loop, the code prints the final value of b, which should be the original string with all question marks replaced by "D".
The expected output is "PDDDDDPD" after replacing all "?" with "D".
<<<Output>>>
PDDDDDPD
