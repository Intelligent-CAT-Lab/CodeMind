<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 25.
An empty list l is created.
The code enters a while loop that continues as long as n is not zero.
In the first iteration, since 25 % 3 is 2, the code executes the else block, adding "-" to the list l and updating n to (25 + 1) // 3, which is 26 // 3, resulting in n = 8.
In the second iteration, 8 % 3 is 2, so the else block is executed again, adding "-" to the list l and updating n to (8 + 1) // 3, which is 9 // 3, resulting in n = 3.
In the third iteration, 3 % 3 is 0, so the if block is executed, adding "0" to the list l and updating n to 3 // 3, which is 1.
In the fourth iteration, 1 % 3 is 1, so the elif block is executed, adding "+" to the list l and updating n to (1 - 1) // 3, which is 0 // 3, resulting in n = 0.
The while loop ends because n is now 0.
The list l now contains ["+", "0", "-", "-"].
The code prints the list l joined into a string, which results in "+0--".
<<<Output>>>
+0--
