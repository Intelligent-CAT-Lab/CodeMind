<<<Analysis>>>
The variable x is initialized to 7.
The variable ans is calculated as the integer division of x by 11, which is 7//11, resulting in 0.
The code then checks if x - 11*ans is greater than 6. Since ans is 0, this check is equivalent to checking if 7 is greater than 6, which is true.
Therefore, the code executes the first branch of the if statement and prints 2*ans+2, which is 2*0+2, resulting in 2.
<<<Output>>>
