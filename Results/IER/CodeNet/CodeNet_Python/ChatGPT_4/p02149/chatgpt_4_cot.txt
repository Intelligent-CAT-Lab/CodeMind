<<<Analysis>>>
The variable S is initialized as a list of integers from the input, which are 1000, 900, and 850.
The code then checks the index of the maximum value in the list S.
The max(S) is 1000, and its index is 0 since it's the first element in the list.
The condition S.index(max(S)) == 0 is True, so the code will print "A".
The elif conditions are not checked because the if condition has already been met.
<<<Output>>>
A
