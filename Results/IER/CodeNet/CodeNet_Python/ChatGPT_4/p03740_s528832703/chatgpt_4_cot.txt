<<<Analysis>>>
The variables X and Y are initialized to 2 and 1, respectively, from the input.
The code then checks the absolute difference between X and Y using the expression abs(X - Y).
The absolute difference between 2 and 1 is 1, which is less than 2.
Since the condition abs(X - Y) < 2 is true, the code will print 'Brown'.
<<<Output>>>
Brown
