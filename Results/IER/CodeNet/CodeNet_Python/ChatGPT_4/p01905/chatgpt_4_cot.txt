<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N and variable M are initialized to 2 and 0, respectively.
The list 'a' is initialized as an empty list.
Since M is 0, the loop to append elements to 'a' does not execute.
The variable 'num' is calculated as N - M, which is 2 - 0 = 2.
The variable 'ans' is initialized to 0.
A while loop runs as long as 'num' is not zero. In each iteration, 'ans' is incremented by 1 and 'num' is decremented by 1.
This loop will run twice because 'num' starts at 2.
After the loop, 'ans' will be 2, but the final print statement prints 'ans - 1', which is 2 - 1 = 1.
