<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized to -9.
The list s is initialized to an empty list, which will be used to store the binary representation of the number.
The code checks if N is 0, and if so, it would print 0. However, N is not 0, so it proceeds to the else block.
The code enters a while loop that continues until N becomes 1.
Since N is -9, it is not even, so the else block is executed:
- s.append(1) adds 1 to the list s.
- N is updated to (1 - (-9)) // 2, which is 5.
Now N is 5, which is odd, so the else block is executed again:
- s.append(1) adds another 1 to the list s.
- N is updated to (1 - 5) // 2, which is -2.
Now N is -2, which is even, so the if block is executed:
- s.append(0) adds 0 to the list s.
- N is updated to -(-2) // 2, which is 1.
Now N is 1, so the loop terminates.
s.append(1) adds another 1 to the list s.
The list s now contains [1, 1, 0, 1].
The code prints the reversed list s without spaces, which is "1011".
