<<<Analysis>>>
The input string is 'RRLRL', and an 'R' is appended to it, making it 'RRLRLR'.
The length of the string is now 6, and an answer list 'ans' of length 5 is initialized with all zeros.
The variables rcnt, lcnt, rpos, lpos, and flag are initialized to 0.

The code then enters a loop that iterates over each character in the string.

1. The first character is 'R', so rcnt is incremented to 1, rpos is set to 0, and flag remains 0.
2. The second character is 'R', so rcnt is incremented to 2, rpos is updated to 1, and flag remains 0.
3. The third character is 'L', so lpos is set to 2, lcnt is incremented to 1, and flag is set to 1.
4. The fourth character is 'R', and since flag is 1, the code updates the ans list for the previous 'RL' sequence. rcnt is 2 (even), so ans[rpos] and ans[lpos] are both incremented by 1. lcnt is 1 (odd), so ans[rpos] remains 1 and ans[lpos] is incremented to 2. rcnt and lcnt are reset to 0. flag is set to 0, rcnt is incremented to 1, and rpos is updated to 3.
5. The fifth character is 'L', so lpos is set to 4, lcnt is incremented to 1, and flag remains 1.
6. The sixth character is the appended 'R', and since flag is 1, the code updates the ans list for the previous 'RL' sequence. rcnt is 1 (odd), so ans[rpos] is incremented by 1 and ans[lpos] remains 0. lcnt is 1 (odd), so ans[rpos] remains 1 and ans[lpos] is incremented by 1. rcnt and lcnt are reset to 0.

The final ans list is [1, 1, 2, 1, 1], which is printed out.
