The variable n is initialized to 2.
Variables ant, bnt, and cnt are all initialized to 1.

The code enters a loop that iterates n times, which is 2 times in this case.

In each iteration:
- ant is multiplied by 10 and then the result is taken modulo 1000000007.
- bnt is multiplied by 9 and then the result is taken modulo 1000000007.
- cnt is multiplied by 8 and then the result is taken modulo 1000000007.

After the first iteration:
- ant becomes (10 * 1) % 1000000007 = 10
- bnt becomes (9 * 1) % 1000000007 = 9
- cnt becomes (8 * 1) % 1000000007 = 8

After the second iteration:
- ant becomes (10 * 10) % 1000000007 = 100
- bnt becomes (9 * 9) % 1000000007 = 81
- cnt becomes (8 * 8) % 1000000007 = 64

The final values after the loop are:
- ant = 100
- bnt = 81
- cnt = 64

The code then calculates ans as follows:
ans = (ant - (bnt * 2 - cnt)) % 1000000007
ans = (100 - (81 * 2 - 64)) % 1000000007
ans = (100 - (162 - 64)) % 1000000007
ans = (100 - 98) % 1000000007
ans = 2 % 1000000007
ans = 2

Since ans is greater than or equal to 0, the code prints ans directly.
