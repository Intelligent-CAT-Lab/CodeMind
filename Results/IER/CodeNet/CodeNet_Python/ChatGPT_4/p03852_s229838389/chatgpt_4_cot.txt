<<<Analysis>>>
The variable c is initialized with the input, which is the character 'a'.
The code checks if the character 'a' is in the string 'aeiou', which contains all the vowels.
Since 'a' is indeed a vowel, it is found in the string 'aeiou'.
Therefore, the condition in the if statement is True.
As a result, the code will execute the print statement under the if block.
The output will be the string 'vowel'.
<<<Output>>>
