<<<Analysis>>>
The variables n and d are initialized to 6 and 2, respectively.
The code checks if the remainder of n divided by (2*d+1) is greater than 0.
In this case, 2*d+1 equals 5, and n is 6.
The remainder of 6 divided by 5 is 1, which is greater than 0.
Therefore, the condition is true, and the code executes the first branch of the if statement.
The answer is calculated as the integer division of n by (2*d+1) plus 1, which is 6//5 + 1.
6//5 equals 1, so the final answer is 1 + 1, which is 2.
The code then prints the value of ans.
<<<Output>>>
