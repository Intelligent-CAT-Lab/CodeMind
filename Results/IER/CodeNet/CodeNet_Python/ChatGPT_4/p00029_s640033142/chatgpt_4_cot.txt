<<<Analysis>>>
The input string is "Thank you for your mail and your lectures".
The string is split into a list of words: ['Thank', 'you', 'for', 'your', 'mail', 'and', 'your', 'lectures'] and stored in variable A.
Two empty lists, S and L, are created for storing counts of each word's occurrence and lengths of each word, respectively.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each word in A.
For each word i, the code counts how many times it appears in A and appends this count to S.
For each word i, the code also calculates its length and appends this length to L.
After the loop, the code finds the maximum value in S (M) and L (m), which represent the highest frequency of any word and the maximum length of any word, respectively.
The code finds the index of M in S (Y) and the index of m in L (y), which correspond to the positions of the most frequent word and the longest word in the original list A.
The code prints the word at index Y and the word at index y from list A.
The most frequent word is 'your' which appears twice, and the longest word is 'lectures' with 8 characters.
<<<Output>>>
your lectures
