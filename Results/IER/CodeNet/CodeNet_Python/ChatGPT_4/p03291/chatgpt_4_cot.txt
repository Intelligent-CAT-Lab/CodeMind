<<<Analysis>>>
The input string s is initialized to "A??C".
The length of the string n is 4.
A 2D list dp is created with dimensions 5x4 (since len(s)+1 = 5), initialized with zeros.
The first element dp[0][0] is set to 1.
A list string containing the characters "A", "B", and "C" is created.
A variable num is set to 10^9 + 7, which will be used for modulo operations.

The code then enters a nested loop to fill the dp list:
- The outer loop iterates over the characters of the input string (4 iterations).
- The inner loop iterates over the range 0 to 3 (4 iterations).

For each character in the input string, the code performs the following operations:
- Initializes variables m and b to 0 and 1, respectively.
- If the current character is '?', it sets b to 3.
- If j is 0, it updates dp[i+1][j] based on whether the current character is '?' or not.
- If j is not 0 and the current character is the same as string[j-1] or is '?', it sets m to 1.
- It updates dp[i+1][j] with the sum of m*dp[i][j-1] and b*dp[i][j], modulo num.

The final result is the last element of the last row of the dp list, dp[-1][3].

Let's go through the iterations:
- For i = 0 (character 'A'):
  - j = 0: dp[1][0] = dp[0][0] = 1
  - j = 1: dp[1][1] = dp[0][0] = 1 (since s[0] == 'A')
  - j = 2: dp[1][2] = dp[0][2] = 0
  - j = 3: dp[1][3] = dp[0][3] = 0

- For i = 1 (character '?'):
  - j = 0: dp[2][0] = dp[1][0] * 3 = 3
  - j = 1: dp[2][1] = dp[1][0] + dp[1][1] * 3 = 1 + 3 = 4
  - j = 2: dp[2][2] = dp[1][1] + dp[1][2] * 3 = 1 + 0 = 1
  - j = 3: dp[2][3] = dp[1][2] + dp[1][3] * 3 = 0 + 0 = 0

- For i = 2 (character '?'):
  - j = 0: dp[3][0] = dp[2][0] * 3 = 9
  - j = 1: dp[3][1] = dp[2][0] + dp[2][1] * 3 = 3 + 12 = 15
  - j = 2: dp[3][2] = dp[2][1] + dp[2][2] * 3 = 4 + 3 = 7
  - j = 3: dp[3][3] = dp[2][2] + dp[2][3] * 3 = 1 + 0 = 1

- For i = 3 (character 'C'):
  - j = 0: dp[4][0] = dp[3][0] = 9
  - j = 1: dp[4][1] = dp[3][1] = 15
  - j = 2: dp[4][2] = dp[3][1] = 15
  - j = 3: dp[4][3] = dp[3][2] + dp[3][3] = 7 + 1 = 8

The final result is dp[-1][3], which is dp[4][3] = 8.
