<<<Analysis>>>
The input `5 3` initializes N to 5 and K to 3.
The MOD variable is set to 10^9 + 7, which is a large prime number often used for modulo operations in competitive programming to avoid integer overflow.

The `between` function is defined to calculate a combination of (k-1) choose (i-1) modulo MOD, but it returns 1 when i is 1.

The `comb` function is defined to calculate a combination of n choose r modulo MOD. It uses the multiplicative inverse to calculate the combination efficiently.

The main part of the code iterates over the range from 1 to K (inclusive), which is 1 to 3 in this case.

For each i in this range, the code checks if i is greater than K or N-K+1. If it is, it prints 0. This condition is never true for the given input because i will be at most 3, K is 3, and N-K+1 is 3.

If the condition is not met, the code calculates the answer as the product of `comb(N-K+1, i, MOD)` and `between(N, K, i)`, then takes the result modulo MOD.

The `comb(N-K+1, i, MOD)` calculates the number of ways to choose i elements from N-K+1 elements.

The `between(N, K, i)` calculates the number of ways to choose i-1 elements from K-1 elements.

The final answer is the product of these two values modulo MOD.

For i = 1:
- `comb(N-K+1, i, MOD)` is `comb(3, 1, MOD)` which is 3.
- `between(N, K, i)` is 1 (since i is 1).
- The answer is 3 * 1 % MOD, which is 3.

For i = 2:
- `comb(N-K+1, i, MOD)` is `comb(3, 2, MOD)` which is 3.
- `between(N, K, i)` is `comb(K-1, i-1, MOD)` which is `comb(2, 1, MOD)` which is 2.
- The answer is 3 * 2 % MOD, which is 6.

For i = 3:
- `comb(N-K+1, i, MOD)` is `comb(3, 3, MOD)` which is 1.
- `between(N, K, i)` is `comb(K-1, i-1, MOD)` which is `comb(2, 2, MOD)` which is 1.
- The answer is 1 * 1 % MOD, which is 1.

The output will be the answers for i = 1, i = 2, and i = 3, each on a new line.
