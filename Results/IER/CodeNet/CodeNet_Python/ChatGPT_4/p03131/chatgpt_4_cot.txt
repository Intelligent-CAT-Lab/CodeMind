The variables K, A, and B are initialized to 4, 2, and 6, respectively.
The code first checks if B - A <= 2, which is not the case here (6 - 2 > 2).
Since the condition is not met, it proceeds to the else block.
The variable first_num_exchanges is set to A + 1, which is 3.
The variable rest_num_exchanges is set to K - first_num_exchanges, which is 4 - 3 = 1.
The variable gain_per_two_manipulation is set to B - A, which is 6 - 2 = 4.
The variable num_cookies is calculated as follows:
- rest_num_exchanges // 2 is 1 // 2, which is 0 (integer division).
- 0 * gain_per_two_manipulation is 0.
- 0 + B is 0 + 6, which is 6.
Since rest_num_exchanges % 2 is 1, the code adds 1 to num_cookies, making it 6 + 1 = 7.
Finally, the code prints the value of num_cookies, which is 7.
<<<Output>>>
