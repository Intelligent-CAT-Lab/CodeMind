<<<Analysis>>>
The function `resolve()` is defined to take no arguments. Inside the function, it reads two integers from the input, `a` and `b`, which are assigned the values 5 and 3, respectively.
The function then prints the maximum of three expressions:
1. `2*a-1`, which is `2*5-1 = 10-1 = 9`
2. `a+b`, which is `5+3 = 8`
3. `2*b-1`, which is `2*3-1 = 6-1 = 5`

The maximum of these three numbers (9, 8, 5) is 9.
The function `resolve()` is then called, which will execute the above logic and print the result.
<<<Output>>>
9
