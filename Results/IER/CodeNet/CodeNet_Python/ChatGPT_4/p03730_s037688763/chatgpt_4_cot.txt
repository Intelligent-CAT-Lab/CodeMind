<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a, b, and c are initialized to 7, 5, and 1, respectively.
The code uses a generator expression within the any() function to check if there exists an integer i in the range from 1 to b (inclusive) such that (a * i) % b equals c.
The range of i is from 1 to 5, inclusive.
The expression (a * i) % b is calculated for each i and checked if it equals c (which is 1).
The calculations are as follows:
- For i = 1: (7 * 1) % 5 = 7 % 5 = 2
- For i = 2: (7 * 2) % 5 = 14 % 5 = 4
- For i = 3: (7 * 3) % 5 = 21 % 5 = 1
- For i = 4: (7 * 4) % 5 = 28 % 5 = 3
- For i = 5: (7 * 5) % 5 = 35 % 5 = 0
The condition is met when i = 3, as (7 * 3) % 5 equals 1, which is the value of c.
Since there is at least one value of i that satisfies the condition, the any() function returns True.
Therefore, the code prints "YES".
