The variables n and k are initialized to 3 and 10, respectively.
The variable score is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the total score.
The variable r is calculated as 1/n, which is 1/3 in this case.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider dice values from 1 to 3.
For each dice value in this range, it initializes a counter to 0 and sets mul to the current dice value.
While mul is less than k (10 in this case), it doubles mul and increments the counter by 1. This loop calculates how many times the dice value needs to be doubled to reach or exceed k.
After the while loop, it adds to score the value of r multiplied by (.5) raised to the power of counter.
For dice value 1: mul needs to be doubled 4 times to reach 16, which is greater than 10. So, counter is 4, and the score increment is (1/3) * (.5)^4.
For dice value 2: mul needs to be doubled 3 times to reach 16, which is greater than 10. So, counter is 3, and the score increment is (1/3) * (.5)^3.
For dice value 3: mul needs to be doubled 2 times to reach 12, which is greater than 10. So, counter is 2, and the score increment is (1/3) * (.5)^2.
The final score is the sum of these increments.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of score, rounded to 12 decimal places.
The calculation is as follows:
score = (1/3) * (.5)^4 + (1/3) * (.5)^3 + (1/3) * (.5)^2
score = (1/3) * (1/16) + (1/3) * (1/8) + (1/3) * (1/4)
score = (1/48) + (1/24) + (1/12)
score = (1 + 2 + 4) / 48
score = 7 / 48
score = 0.145833333333
When rounded to 12 decimal places, the score is 0.145833333333.
<<<Output>>>
