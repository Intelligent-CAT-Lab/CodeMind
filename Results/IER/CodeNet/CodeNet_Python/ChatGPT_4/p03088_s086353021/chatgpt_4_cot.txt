<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized to 3, and MOD is set to 10^9 + 7.
A list called memo is created with N+1 (4) empty dictionaries to memoize the results of the recursive function dfs.

The function ok checks if a string of the last four characters contains the substring 'AGC' after any possible adjacent swap of characters. If 'AGC' is found, it returns False; otherwise, it returns True.

The function dfs is a recursive function that takes two arguments: cur, which is the current length of the string being built, and last3, which is the last three characters of the string built so far.

The base case of the recursion is when cur equals N (3 in this case), which means a string of length N has been successfully built without containing 'AGC' even after any adjacent swaps. In this case, the function returns 1.

The recursive case iterates over each character 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' and checks if adding this character to last3 (after removing the first character of last3) results in a string that passes the ok function. If it does, it recursively calls dfs with cur incremented by 1 and the new last3.

The result is accumulated in ret, and the modulo operation ensures that the result stays within the bounds of MOD.

The memoization stores the result of each (cur, last3) pair to avoid recalculating the same state.

Finally, the dfs function is called with initial arguments 0 and 'TTT', and the result is printed.

Let's simulate the dfs function calls:
- dfs(0, 'TTT') will call dfs(1, 'TTA'), dfs(1, 'TTC'), dfs(1, 'TTG'), and dfs(1, 'TTT').
- Each of these will call dfs with cur incremented and last3 updated accordingly.
- Since N is 3, the recursion will only go three levels deep before hitting the base case and starting to return values.

Since the input is small (N=3), we can manually calculate the number of valid strings of length 3. There are 4 choices for each position, so normally there would be 4^3 = 64 possible strings. However, we need to exclude those that contain 'AGC' after any swap. Since N is only 3, we don't have to worry about swaps creating 'AGC' in this case, so we only exclude 'AGC' itself. There are no other invalid 3-character strings, so the result is 64 - 1 = 63.
