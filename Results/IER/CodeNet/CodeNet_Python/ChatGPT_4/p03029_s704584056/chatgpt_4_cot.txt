<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a and b are initialized with the values 1 and 3, respectively, from the input.
The variable c is calculated as a times 3, which is 1 * 3 = 3.
The variable d is calculated as c plus b, which is 3 + 3 = 6.
The variable e is calculated as the integer division of d by 2, which is 6 // 2 = 3.
The code then prints the value of e, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>
3
