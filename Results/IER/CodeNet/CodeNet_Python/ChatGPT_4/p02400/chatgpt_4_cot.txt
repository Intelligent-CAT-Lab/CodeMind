<<<Analysis>>>
The variable r is initialized to the float value of the input, which is 2.0.
The variable s is calculated as the area of a circle with radius r, using the formula s = r^2 * π. With r = 2.0, s = 2.0 * 2.0 * π = 4.0 * π.
The variable l is calculated as the circumference of a circle with radius r, using the formula l = 2 * r * π. With r = 2.0, l = 2.0 * 2.0 * π = 4.0 * π.
The print statement outputs the values of s and l formatted to 5 decimal places. Given that π is approximately 3.14159, the calculations are:
s = 4.0 * π ≈ 4.0 * 3.14159 ≈ 12.56636
l = 4.0 * π ≈ 4.0 * 3.14159 ≈ 12.56636
Therefore, the output will be the values of s and l formatted to 5 decimal places.
