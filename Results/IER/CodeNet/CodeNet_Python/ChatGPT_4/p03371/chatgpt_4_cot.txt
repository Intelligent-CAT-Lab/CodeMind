The variables A, B, C, X, and Y are initialized to 1500, 2000, 1600, 3, and 2, respectively.
The variable mi is initialized to the minimum of X and Y, which is 2.
Three different cost calculations are performed:
a. The cost of buying X pizzas of type A and Y pizzas of type B separately, which is A*X + B*Y = 1500*3 + 2000*2 = 4500 + 4000 = 8500.
b. The cost of buying mi pizzas of type C (as half & half pizzas), and the remaining pizzas of types A and B separately. This is calculated as mi*C*2 + A*(X-mi) + B*(Y-mi) = 2*2*1600 + 1500*(3-2) + 2000*(2-2) = 6400 + 1500 + 0 = 7900.
c. The cost of buying max(X, Y) pizzas of type C (as half & half pizzas), which is max(X, Y)*C*2 = 3*1600*2 = 9600.
The minimum of the three calculated costs is then printed, which is min(a, b, c) = min(8500, 7900, 9600) = 7900.
<<<Output>>>
7900
