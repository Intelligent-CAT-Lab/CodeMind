The variable N is initialized to 8.
The variable n is set to the integer part of the square root of N, which is 2.
An empty list plist is created to store the factors of N.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 2.
For each number i in this range, it checks if N is divisible by i. If it is, i is added to plist. Additionally, if i is not equal to N/i, then N/i is also added to plist as a factor. For N=8, the factors are 1, 8, 2, and 4.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of certain values.
The code then enters another loop that iterates over the elements of plist.
For each element x in plist, it calculates kari as N/x - 1. If kari is 0, it does nothing. Otherwise, it calculates q as N/kari and r as N%kari. If q equals r, it adds kari to ans.
For N=8, the factors are 1, 8, 2, and 4. The calculations are as follows:
- For x=1, kari=7, q=1, r=1 (q == r, so ans += 7)
- For x=8, kari=0 (pass)
- For x=2, kari=3, q=2, r=2 (q == r, so ans += 3)
- For x=4, kari=1, q=2, r=0 (q != r, so nothing is added)
The final value of ans is 7 + 3 = 10.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
