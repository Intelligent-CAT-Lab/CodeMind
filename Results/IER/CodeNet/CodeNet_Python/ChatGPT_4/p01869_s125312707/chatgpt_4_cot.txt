<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a recursive function `f` that generates all numbers consisting of digits 2 and 8 that are less than or equal to `n`, and stores them in the list `a`. It also defines a function `g` that finds the maximum number of times `n` can be divided by the elements of `a` before it becomes less than the square of the current element of `a`.

The input `n` is read and checked if it is odd. If `n` is odd, the code prints `-1` and exits because an odd number cannot be formed by multiplying numbers consisting of only the digits 2 and 8 (which are even).

Since the input is `1`, which is odd, the code will print `-1` and exit without executing the rest of the code.

<<<Output>>>
-1
