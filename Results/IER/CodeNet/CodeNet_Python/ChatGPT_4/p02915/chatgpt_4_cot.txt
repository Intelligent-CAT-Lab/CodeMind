<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads from standard input using sys.stdin.
It expects to receive lines of input, and for each line, it processes the input as follows:
- It takes the first element from the split line (assuming the input is split by whitespace) and converts it to an integer.
- It then calculates the cube of this integer by raising it to the power of 3.
- Finally, it prints the result of this calculation.

Given the input `2`, the code will process it as follows:
- It reads the line, which is '2'.
- It splits the line and takes the first element, which is '2'.
- It converts '2' to an integer, which is 2.
- It calculates 2 ** 3, which is 8.
- It prints the result, which is 8.

<<<Output>>>
8
