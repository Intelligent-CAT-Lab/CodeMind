<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 8.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of times we can multiply tmp by 3 before it exceeds n.
The variable tmp is initialized to 1, which will be multiplied by 3 in each iteration of the while loop.
The while loop continues as long as n is greater than tmp.
In the first iteration, tmp is multiplied by 3, resulting in tmp = 3, and ans is incremented by 1, resulting in ans = 1.
In the second iteration, tmp is multiplied by 3 again, resulting in tmp = 9, and ans is incremented by 1, resulting in ans = 2.
Now, tmp is no longer less than n (since 9 is not less than 8), so the loop terminates.
The final value of ans, which is 2, is printed.
