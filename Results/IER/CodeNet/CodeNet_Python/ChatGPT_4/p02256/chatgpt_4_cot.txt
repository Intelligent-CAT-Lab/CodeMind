<<<Analysis>>>
The variables x and y are initialized to 54 and 20, respectively.
The first if statement checks if x is greater than y, which is true in this case (54 > 20), so x and y are swapped. Now x is 20 and y is 54.
The code then enters a while loop that continues as long as the remainder of x divided by y is not 0.
In the first iteration, x % y is 20 % 54, which is 20, so the condition is true.
Inside the loop, x and y are reassigned: x becomes y (54), and y becomes x % y (20).
In the second iteration, x % y is 54 % 20, which is 14, so the condition is true again.
x becomes 20, y becomes 14.
In the third iteration, x % y is 20 % 14, which is 6, so the condition is true.
x becomes 14, y becomes 6.
In the fourth iteration, x % y is 14 % 6, which is 2, so the condition is true.
x becomes 6, y becomes 2.
In the fifth iteration, x % y is 6 % 2, which is 0, so the condition is false, and the loop ends.
The final value of y, which is 2, is printed. This value is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original input numbers 54 and 20.
