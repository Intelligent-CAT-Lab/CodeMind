<<<Analysis>>>
The input string '9 12' is split into a list of strings ['9', '12'].
Each string in the list is converted to an integer, resulting in the list [9, 12].
The code then adds the two numbers in the list, resulting in 21.
The sum (21) is then taken modulo 24, which is also 21 since 21 is less than 24.
Finally, the result is converted to an integer (although it is already an integer) and printed.
<<<Output>>>
21
