The variable N is initialized to 3.
The variable res is initialized to 'Yes'.
The variable k is initialized to 0.

The while loop will execute as long as 2 ** (k + 1) - 1 is less than or equal to N. Since 2 ** (1 + 1) - 1 = 3, which is equal to N, k is incremented by 1. The loop stops after this single iteration because 2 ** (k + 1) - 1 would be 7, which is greater than N.

K is then calculated as 2 ** k - 1, which is 2 ** 1 - 1 = 1.

The first if condition checks if N is 1, which it is not, so res remains 'Yes'.
The second if condition checks if N is K + 1, which it is (3 == 1 + 1), so res is set to 'No'.

The code then checks if N is even, which it is not, so M is set to N, which is 3.

The next if condition checks if (M - K) % 4 == 0 and M > K. Since (3 - 1) % 4 == 2 and 3 > 1, the condition is false, so L is set to M, which is 3.

P is calculated as N - K, which is 3 - 1 = 2. Since P is even, P is set to 2.

The code prints the value of res, which is 'No'.

Since res is 'No', the code does not execute the if block that follows and the program ends.
