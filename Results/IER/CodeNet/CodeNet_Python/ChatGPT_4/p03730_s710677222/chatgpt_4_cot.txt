<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a, b, and c are initialized to 7, 5, and 1, respectively.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 100 (inclusive).
For each number n in this range, it calculates the value of (a*n) % b and checks if it is equal to c.
The condition is met when the remainder of the division of (a*n) by b is equal to c.
The code checks this condition for n from 0 to 100. It will find a match when n is 1 because (7*1) % 5 equals 2, which is not equal to c. However, when n is 3, (7*3) % 5 equals 1, which is equal to c.
As soon as the condition is met, the code prints "YES" and exits the loop.
Since the condition is met when n is 3, the code will print "YES" and will not reach the print("NO") statement.
<<<Output>>>
YES
