The variables n, m, and k are initialized to 3, 2, and 1, respectively.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the final answer.
The function cmb is defined to calculate the combination of n and r modulo mod.

The mod is set to 998244353, which is a prime number often used in competitive programming for modulo operations due to its properties.

The code initializes lists g1, g2, and inverse to store factorial values, inverse factorial values, and inverse values, respectively, for numbers up to 2*10^5.

The loop from 2 to N + 1 (where N is 2*10^5) populates the g1, g2, and inverse lists with the appropriate values modulo mod.

The variable kk is initialized to n - k, which is 2 in this case.

The variable color is calculated using the formula m * (m - 1)^(kk - 1) % mod, which in this case is 2 * (2 - 1)^(2 - 1) % 998244353, which equals 2.

The while loop starts with kk <= n, which is true for kk = 2 and n = 3.

Inside the loop, the variable now is set to the current value of color, and color is updated to color * (m - 1) % mod.

The value of now is then multiplied by the combination of (n - 1) and (n - kk) modulo mod, which is cmb(2, 1, 998244353) in the first iteration.

The value of kk is incremented by 1, and the value of now is added to ans, with ans being updated modulo mod.

The loop continues until kk > n, which happens after one iteration in this case since kk becomes 3 and n is 3.

Finally, the code prints the value of ans, which is the accumulated sum of the now values modulo mod.

After the first iteration, ans is 2 * cmb(2, 1, 998244353) % 998244353, which is 2 * 2 % 998244353, which equals 4.

Since kk is now equal to n, the loop ends, and the final value of ans is printed.
