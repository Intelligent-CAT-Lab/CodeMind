<<<Analysis>>>
The variables W, H, and C are initialized to 10, 20, and 5, respectively.
The code calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of W and H using the gcd function from the math module. In this case, gcd(10, 20) is 10.
The code then calculates the number of chocolates by multiplying W, H, and C and then dividing by the square of the gcd (g*g). The calculation is as follows: (10*20*5) // (10*10) which simplifies to 1000 // 100.
The result of this calculation is 10.
After the calculation, the code prints the result, which is the number of chocolates that can be made.
<<<Output>>>
10
