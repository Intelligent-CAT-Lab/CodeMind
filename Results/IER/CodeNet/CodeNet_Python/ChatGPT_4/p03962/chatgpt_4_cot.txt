<<<Analysis>>>
The input string "3 1 4" is split into a list of strings ['3', '1', '4'].
The map function applies the int function to each element of the list, converting them to integers, resulting in the list [3, 1, 4].
This list is then converted to a set, which removes any duplicate elements. However, since there are no duplicates in the list, the set remains the same as the list: {3, 1, 4}.
The len function is then called on the set to determine its size, which is 3, as there are three unique elements in the set.
The print function outputs this number.
<<<Output>>>
3
