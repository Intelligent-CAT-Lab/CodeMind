The variables a, b, and k are initialized to 5, 4, and 2, respectively.
The main function enters a loop that will iterate k (2) times.
In the first iteration (i = 0), since i is even, the play function is called with a and b as arguments.
The play function returns a tuple where the first element is a // 2 (integer division of a by 2) and the second element is b + a // 2. With a = 5 and b = 4, play(5, 4) returns (2, 6) because 5 // 2 is 2 and 4 + 2 is 6.
The returned values are assigned back to a and b, so now a = 2 and b = 6.
In the second iteration (i = 1), since i is odd, the play function is called with b and a as arguments.
The play function is now called with the values of b and a swapped, so play(6, 2) is executed.
play(6, 2) returns (3, 5) because 6 // 2 is 3 and 2 + 3 is 5.
The returned values are assigned back to b and a, so now b = 3 and a = 5.
After the loop finishes, the main function prints the final values of a and b, which are 5 and 3.
