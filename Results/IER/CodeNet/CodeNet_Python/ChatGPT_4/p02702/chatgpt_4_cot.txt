The input string `s` is initialized to '1817181712114'.
An array `remain` of size 2020 is created, initialized with zeros. This array will keep track of the remainders when the current number is divided by 2019.
Variables `now` and `ans` are initialized to 0. `now` will be used to calculate the current number from the end of the string, and `ans` will accumulate the number of pairs that satisfy the condition.
The code enters a loop that iterates backwards through the string `s`.
For each character `s[i]` in the string, starting from the last one, it calculates the current number `now` by adding the integer value of `s[i]` multiplied by 10 raised to the power of the position from the end, modulo 2019.
It then increments `ans` by the count of the current remainder `now%2019` found in `remain`.
The count of the current remainder `now%2019` in `remain` is then incremented by 1.
After the loop, `ans` is incremented by the count of remainder 0 in `remain`.
Finally, the code prints the value of `ans`.

Let's calculate the remainders and the value of `ans` step by step:
- For i = 13 (last character '4'), now = 4, now%2019 = 4, remain[4] = 1, ans = 0
- For i = 12 ('1'), now = 41, now%2019 = 41, remain[41] = 1, ans = 0
- For i = 11 ('1'), now = 411, now%2019 = 411, remain[411] = 1, ans = 0
- For i = 10 ('2'), now = 2411, now%2019 = 372, remain[372] = 1, ans = 0
- For i = 9 ('1'), now = 3721, now%2019 = 1682, remain[1682] = 1, ans = 0
- For i = 8 ('7'), now = 16827, now%2019 = 1709, remain[1709] = 1, ans = 0
- For i = 7 ('1'), now = 17091, now%2019 = 953, remain[953] = 1, ans = 0
- For i = 6 ('8'), now = 95318, now%2019 = 1701, remain[1701] = 1, ans = 0
- For i = 5 ('7'), now = 170118, now%2019 = 1000, remain[1000] = 1, ans = 0
- For i = 4 ('1'), now = 1000118, now%2019 = 1001, remain[1001] = 1, ans = 0
- For i = 3 ('7'), now = 1001117, now%2019 = 1000, remain[1000] = 2, ans = 1 (because remain[1000] was already 1)
- For i = 2 ('8'), now = 10001117, now%2019 = 1701, remain[1701] = 2, ans = 2 (because remain[1701] was already 1)
- For i = 1 ('1'), now = 17001117, now%2019 = 953, remain[953] = 2, ans = 3 (because remain[953] was already 1)
- For i = 0 ('8'), now = 9531117, now%2019 = 1709, remain[1709] = 2, ans = 4 (because remain[1709] was already 1)

Finally, `ans` is incremented by `remain[0]` which is 1, so `ans` becomes 5.
