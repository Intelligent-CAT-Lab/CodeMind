<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a main function that reads four integers h, w, a, and b. These represent the height and width of a grid, and the dimensions of a subgrid, respectively.
The input provided is `3 3 1 1`, which means h=3, w=3, a=1, b=1.
An empty list S is initialized to store strings representing each row of the grid.
The first for loop runs for b iterations, which is 1 in this case. It appends a string to S that consists of '1' repeated a times (which is 1) followed by '0' repeated (w-a) times (which is 2). So the string "100" is added to S.
The second for loop runs for (h-b) iterations, which is 2 in this case. It appends a string to S that consists of '0' repeated a times (which is 1) followed by '1' repeated (w-a) times (which is 2). So the strings "011" are added to S twice.
The final for loop iterates over the range h (which is 3) and prints each string in S. The expected output is the three strings in S printed on separate lines.
The output will be:
100
011
011
<<<Output>>>
100
011
011
