The input "11 2" initializes N to "11" and K to "2".
The function Base_10_to_n is defined to convert a base-10 number X to base-n recursively.
The function is called with X as 11 (base-10) and n as 2 (the new base).
The function works as follows:
- Since 11 divided by 2 is 5 with a remainder of 1, the function calls itself with X as 5 and n as 2, and appends the remainder "1" to the result.
- Now with X as 5, since 5 divided by 2 is 2 with a remainder of 1, the function calls itself with X as 2 and n as 2, and appends the remainder "1" to the result.
- With X as 2, since 2 divided by 2 is 1 with a remainder of 0, the function calls itself with X as 1 and n as 2, and appends the remainder "0" to the result.
- Finally, with X as 1, since 1 divided by 2 is 0 with a remainder of 1, the function does not call itself again and returns "1".
- The results of the remainders are concatenated in reverse order of the calls: "1" + "0" + "1" + "1", which is the binary representation of 11.
The length of the binary representation "1011" is 4.
The print statement outputs the length of the string returned by the function, which is 4.
