The code imports the log and ceil functions from the math module.
The code reads an input, which is the string '8', and converts it to an integer.
The log function is called with 8 and 3 as arguments, which calculates the base-3 logarithm of 8.
The result of the logarithm is then passed to the ceil function, which rounds it up to the nearest integer.
The ceil function returns a float, so the result is wrapped with int() to convert it to an integer.
The base-3 logarithm of 8 is approximately 1.8928, and when rounded up using ceil, it becomes 2.0.
After converting to an integer, the final result is 2.
The code then prints this integer.
