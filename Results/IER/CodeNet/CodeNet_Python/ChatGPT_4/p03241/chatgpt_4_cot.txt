The input values for N and M are 3 and 14, respectively.
The function make_divisors is defined to find all divisors of a given number n.
The main function is then called, which calculates MN as M/N, which is 14/3 â‰ˆ 4.6667.
The make_divisors function is called with M (14) to find all divisors of 14, which are 1, 2, 7, and 14.
The variable max_gcd is initialized to 0.
The code then iterates over each divisor and checks if it is less than or equal to MN (4.6667) and greater than or equal to max_gcd.
The divisors that satisfy the condition are 1, 2, and 4 (since 7 and 14 are greater than MN).
The greatest divisor that satisfies the condition is 4, so max_gcd is updated to 4.
Finally, the code prints the value of max_gcd, which is 4.
<<<Output>>>
4
