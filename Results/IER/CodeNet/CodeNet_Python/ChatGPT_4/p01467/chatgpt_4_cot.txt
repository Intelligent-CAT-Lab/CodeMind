<<<Analysis>>>
The input "99 98 1" initializes A to [9, 9], B to [9, 8], and K to 1.
The length of A is 2, and B is padded with zeros to match the length of A, but since B is already of length 2, no padding is needed.
C is initialized as [0, 0], which will hold the result of the subtraction.

The solve function is called with C, K, n-1 (which is 1), and 0 for borrow.

The solve function works as follows:
- It checks if the current index i is -1, which would mean that the function has processed all digits. If so, it returns the integer value of the joined list C.
- If not, it checks if A[i] - borrow is greater than or equal to B[i]. If it is, it sets C[i] to A[i] - borrow - B[i] and calls solve recursively with i-1 and borrow set to 0.
- If A[i] - borrow is less than B[i], it sets C[i] to A[i] - borrow + 10 - B[i], simulating a borrow from the next digit.
- If K is greater than 0, it can choose to either borrow or not borrow from the next digit. It calls solve recursively for both cases and returns the maximum result.
- If K is 0, it must borrow from the next digit and calls solve recursively with i-1 and borrow set to 1.

For the given input:
- At i = 1, A[1] - borrow (9 - 0) is greater than B[1] (8), so C[1] is set to 1 (9 - 0 - 8), and solve is called with i-1 (0) and borrow 0.
- At i = 0, A[0] - borrow (9 - 0) is equal to B[0] (9), so C[0] is set to 0 (9 - 0 - 9), and solve is called with i-1 (-1) and borrow 0.
- At i = -1, the function returns the integer value of C, which is now [0, 1].

The output of the function is 1, which is the result of subtracting B from A without needing to use the allowed borrow (K).
