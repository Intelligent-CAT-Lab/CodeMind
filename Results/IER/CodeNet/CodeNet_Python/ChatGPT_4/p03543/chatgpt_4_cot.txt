<<<Analysis>>>
The main function is defined, which takes no arguments.
The variable N is initialized with the input value '1118'.
The variables a, b, c, d are assigned to the individual characters of the string N, which are '1', '1', '1', and '8' respectively.
The if condition checks if either the first three characters (a, b, c) are the same or the last three characters (b, c, d) are the same.
Since a, b, c are all '1', the condition a == b == c is True.
The condition b == c == d is not checked because the first condition is already True.
The program prints "Yes" because the condition is met.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
