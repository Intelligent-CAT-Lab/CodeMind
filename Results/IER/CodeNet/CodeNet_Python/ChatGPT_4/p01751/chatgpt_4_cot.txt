The variables a, b, and c are initialized to 10, 10, and 5, respectively.
The variable t is initialized to 0, which will be used to keep track of time in seconds.
The code then enters a loop that iterates 61 times, representing each second from 0 to 60.

For each iteration (each second), the code checks if the current time modulo 60 is within the range [c, c + a]. This range represents the time window when the event can occur starting from second c and lasting for a seconds.

The condition is checked as follows:
- In the first iteration (loop = 0), t % 60 is 0. The condition 0 <= c <= 0 + a is false because c is 5.
- The value of t is then increased by a + b, which is 10 + 10 = 20.
- In the second iteration (loop = 1), t % 60 is 20. The condition 20 <= c <= 20 + a is false because c is 5 and 20 + a is 30.
- The value of t is increased again by a + b, now t is 40.
- In the third iteration (loop = 2), t % 60 is 40. The condition 40 <= c <= 40 + a is true because c is 5 and 40 + a is 50.

Since the condition is met, the code prints t / 60 * 60 + c, which is 0 * 60 + 5 = 5, and breaks out of the loop.

If the loop had completed all 61 iterations without breaking (which it doesn't in this case), the code would print -1, indicating that the condition was never met.
