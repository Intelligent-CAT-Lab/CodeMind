<<<Analysis>>>
The variables m, f, and b are initialized to 1000, 3000, and 3000, respectively.
The code then checks if b is less than or equal to m. In this case, b is not less than or equal to m (3000 is not less than or equal to 1000), so it does not print 0.
Next, the code checks if b is less than or equal to m + f. Since m + f is 4000 (1000 + 3000), and b is 3000, this condition is true.
Because the condition is true, the code prints b - m, which is 3000 - 1000, resulting in 2000.
The code does not reach the else statement because one of the previous conditions was met.
<<<Output>>>
2000
