The input values for x and y are 4 and 12, respectively.
The function ex_euclid is called with these values.

The initial values are set as follows:
c0 = x = 4
c1 = y = 12
a0 = 1
a1 = 0
b0 = 0
b1 = 1

The while loop will execute as long as c1 is not zero.

First iteration:
- a0,a1 = a1,a0-c0//c1*a1 => a0,a1 = 0,1-4//12*0 => a0,a1 = 0,1
- b0,b1 = b1,b0-c0//c1*b1 => b0,b1 = 1,0-4//12*1 => b0,b1 = 1,0
- c0,c1 = c1,c0%c1 => c0,c1 = 12,4%12 => c0,c1 = 12,4

Second iteration:
- a0,a1 = a1,a0-c0//c1*a1 => a0,a1 = 1,0-12//4*1 => a0,a1 = 1,-3
- b0,b1 = b1,b0-c0//c1*b1 => b0,b1 = 0,1-12//4*0 => b0,b1 = 0,1
- c0,c1 = c1,c0%c1 => c0,c1 = 4,12%4 => c0,c1 = 4,0

The loop ends because c1 is now zero.

The function returns c0,a0,b0 which are 4,1,0.

The output will be the values of a and b, which are 1 and 0.
