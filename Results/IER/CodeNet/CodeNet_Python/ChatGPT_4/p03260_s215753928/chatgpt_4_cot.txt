<<<Analysis>>>
The variables A and B are initialized to 3 and 1, respectively.
The code checks if both A and B are odd numbers by using the modulo operator (%). The expression A%2!=0 checks if A is odd, and B%2!=0 checks if B is odd.
Since both 3 and 1 are odd numbers, the condition (A%2!=0 and B%2!=0) evaluates to True.
Therefore, the code will execute the print statement under the if condition and print "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
