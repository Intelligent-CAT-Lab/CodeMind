The variable s is initialized with the string 'QWERTYASDFZXCV'.
The code then finds the index of the first occurrence of 'A' in the string using s.find('A'), which is 6.
Next, it finds the index of the last occurrence of 'Z' in the string using s.rfind('Z'), which is 11.
It then slices the string from the index of 'A' to the index of 'Z' inclusive, which results in the substring 'ASDFZ'.
The length of this substring is calculated using len(), which is 5.
Finally, the code prints the length of the substring, which is 5.
<<<Output>>>
5
