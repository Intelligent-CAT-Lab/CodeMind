<<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized to the string "needed".
The first loop iterates over the length of the string minus one (since it checks the current and next character).
The loop checks if two consecutive characters are the same. If they are, it prints the indices of these characters (1-based) and exits the program.
In the given string "needed", there are no two consecutive characters that are the same, so the first loop completes without printing anything or exiting.
The second loop iterates over the length of the string minus two (since it checks the current character and the one two positions ahead).
The loop checks if a character and the one two positions ahead are the same. If they are, it prints the indices of these characters (1-based) and exits the program.
In the given string "needed", the first and fourth characters are the same ('n' and 'n'), so the second loop prints "1 4" and exits.
Therefore, the output will be the indices "1 4".
