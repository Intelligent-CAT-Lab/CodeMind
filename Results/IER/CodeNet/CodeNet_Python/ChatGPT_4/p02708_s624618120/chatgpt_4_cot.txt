The variables n and k are initialized to 3 and 2, respectively.
The variable mod is set to 10^9 + 7, which is a large prime number often used for modulo operations in programming contests to avoid integer overflow.

The function `coun` takes two arguments, n and r, and returns the result of the expression `n*r + 1 + r - r**2`.

The function `sigma` takes a function `func`, a starting point `frm`, and an ending point `too`. It initializes a variable `result` to 0 and then iterates from `frm` to `too+2` (inclusive). For each iteration, it calls `func` with arguments `too` and `i`, adds the result to `result`, and finally prints `result % mod`.

The `sigma` function is called with `coun` as the function argument, `k` as `frm`, and `n` as `too`.

Let's calculate the result step by step:
- For i = 2, `coun(3, 2)` returns `3*2 + 1 + 2 - 2**2` which is `6 + 1 + 2 - 4` = 5.
- For i = 3, `coun(3, 3)` returns `3*3 + 1 + 3 - 3**2` which is `9 + 1 + 3 - 9` = 4.
- For i = 4, `coun(3, 4)` returns `3*4 + 1 + 4 - 4**2` which is `12 + 1 + 4 - 16` = 1.

The sum of these results is 5 + 4 + 1 = 10.

Finally, the `sigma` function prints `10 % mod`, which is `10 % (10**9 + 7)`. Since 10 is much smaller than 10^9 + 7, the modulo operation will just return 10.
