<<<Analysis>>>
The variables X and Y are initialized to 3 and 20, respectively.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of times the value of seki can be doubled without exceeding Y.
The variable seki is initialized to the value of X, which is 3.
The code enters a while loop that continues as long as seki is less than or equal to Y.
Inside the loop, seki is doubled (multiplied by 2) and ans is incremented by 1.
The loop runs as follows:
- First iteration: seki = 3 * 2 = 6, ans = 1
- Second iteration: seki = 6 * 2 = 12, ans = 2
- Third iteration: seki = 12 * 2 = 24, ans = 3
The loop stops because seki is now 24, which is greater than Y (20).
The final value of ans, which is 3, is printed.

3
