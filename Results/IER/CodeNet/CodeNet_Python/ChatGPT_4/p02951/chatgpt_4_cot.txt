<<<Analysis>>>
The variables A, B, and C are initialized to 6, 4, and 3, respectively.
The variable 'get' is calculated as A - B, which is 6 - 4, resulting in 2.
The variable 'i' is calculated as C - get, which is 3 - 2, resulting in 1.
The if condition checks if 'i' is less than 0, which it is not (since 'i' is 1), so the code inside the if block is not executed.
The value of 'i' remains 1, and that is what is printed.
