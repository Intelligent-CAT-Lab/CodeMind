The input is processed by the inpl() function, which reads the input and converts it into a list of integers. The variables A and B are set to 4 and 6, respectively.

The calca(x) function is defined to calculate x divided by A (integer division) plus the remainder of x divided by A.

X is calculated as the smallest multiple of A that is not less than B. Since B is 6 and A is 4, the smallest multiple of A that is not less than B is 8 (2 * 4). Therefore, X is set to 8.

Y is calculated by calling calca with the argument (X - X//B*B), which simplifies to (8 - 8//6*6). Since 8//6 is 1 and 1*6 is 6, the expression simplifies to (8 - 6), which is 2. The calca function then calculates 2//4 + 2%4, which is 0 + 2, so calca returns 2. Y is then set to 2 + X//B, which is 2 + 8//6. Since 8//6 is 1, Y is set to 3.

The condition -(-B//A) < Y is then checked. -(-B//A) is the same as ceil(B/A), which is the smallest integer not less than B/A. Since B/A is 6/4, which is 1.5, ceil(B/A) is 2. The condition checks if 2 < Y, which is 2 < 3. This condition is true.

Since the condition is true, the code prints the value of X, which is 8.
