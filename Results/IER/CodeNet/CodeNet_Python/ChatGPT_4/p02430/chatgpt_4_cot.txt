The variables n and k are initialized to 5 and 3, respectively.
The variable l is initialized to a range object representing the numbers 0 to 4.
The variable combs is initialized to a list of all possible combinations of the numbers 0 to 4 taken 3 at a time.
The sumlist is initialized to an empty list, which will store the sums of powers of 2 corresponding to each combination.
The code then enters a loop over each combination in combs.
For each combination, it initializes a sum to 0 and then enters another loop over each element c in the combination.
For each element c, it adds 2 raised to the power of c to the sum.
After the inner loop, the sum is appended to sumlist.
The variable z is initialized to a zip object containing pairs of sums and their corresponding combinations.
The zip object is then sorted, which sorts the pairs based on the sums.
The sorted pairs are unzipped into sumlist and combs.
Finally, the code enters a loop that prints each sum and its corresponding combination in the format "sum: combination".
The output will be the sorted sums with their corresponding combinations.

The combinations of 0 to 4 taken 3 at a time are:
(0, 1, 2), (0, 1, 3), (0, 1, 4), (0, 2, 3), (0, 2, 4), (0, 3, 4), (1, 2, 3), (1, 2, 4), (1, 3, 4), (2, 3, 4)

The sums of powers of 2 for each combination are:
(0, 1, 2): 2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2 = 1 + 2 + 4 = 7
(0, 1, 3): 2^0 + 2^1 + 2^3 = 1 + 2 + 8 = 11
(0, 1, 4): 2^0 + 2^1 + 2^4 = 1 + 2 + 16 = 19
(0, 2, 3): 2^0 + 2^2 + 2^3 = 1 + 4 + 8 = 13
(0, 2, 4): 2^0 + 2^2 + 2^4 = 1 + 4 + 16 = 21
(0, 3, 4): 2^0 + 2^3 + 2^4 = 1 + 8 + 16 = 25
(1, 2, 3): 2^1 + 2^2 + 2^3 = 2 + 4 + 8 = 14
(1, 2, 4): 2^1 + 2^2 + 2^4 = 2 + 4 + 16 = 22
(1, 3, 4): 2^1 + 2^3 + 2^4 = 2 + 8 + 16 = 26
(2, 3, 4): 2^2 + 2^3 + 2^4 = 4 + 8 + 16 = 28

After sorting these sums with their combinations, the output will be printed in ascending order of the sums.
