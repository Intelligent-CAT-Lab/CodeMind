<<<Analysis>>>
The input string `s` is initialized to "1111".
The first `if` statement checks if the last character of `s` is "1" or the first character is "0". Since the last character is "1" and the first character is not "0", the condition is true, and the code prints -1 and exits. Therefore, the rest of the code is not executed.
<<<Output>>>
-1
