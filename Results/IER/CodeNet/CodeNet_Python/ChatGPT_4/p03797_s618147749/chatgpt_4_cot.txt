<<<Analysis>>>
The variables n and m are initialized to 1 and 6, respectively.
The code first checks if n multiplied by 2 is greater than or equal to m. In this case, 1 * 2 is not greater than or equal to 6, so the condition is false.
Since the first condition is false, the code proceeds to the else block.
In the else block, the variable amari is calculated as m minus n times 2, which is 6 - 1 * 2 = 4.
The final print statement prints the result of amari divided by 4 plus n, which is 4//4 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2.
<<<Output>>>
