The input list A is initialized to [3, 6, 9, 7, 5].
The sort function is defined to perform a bubble sort on the list A in descending order.
The length of A, N, is 5.
The outer loop runs 5 times, for each element in the list.
The inner loop runs N-i-1 times, which decreases with each iteration of the outer loop.
The inner loop compares adjacent elements and swaps them if the left element is smaller than the right element.
After the first pass, the largest element, 9, will be at the end of the list.
After the second pass, the second-largest element, 7, will be in the second to last position.
This process continues until the list is sorted in descending order.
The final sorted list is [9, 7, 6, 5, 3].
The sorted list is then converted to a list of strings and joined with spaces to form the final output string.
<<<Output>>>
9 7 6 5 3
