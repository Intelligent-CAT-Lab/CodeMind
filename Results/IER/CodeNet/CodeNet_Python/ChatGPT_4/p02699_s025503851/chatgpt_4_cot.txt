<<<Analysis>>>
The input '4 5' is split into a list of integers, resulting in sw being [4, 5].
The if condition checks if the second element of the list (sw[1], which is 5) is greater than or equal to the first element (sw[0], which is 4).
Since 5 is indeed greater than 4, the condition is true.
Therefore, the code prints 'unsafe'.
<<<Output>>>
unsafe
