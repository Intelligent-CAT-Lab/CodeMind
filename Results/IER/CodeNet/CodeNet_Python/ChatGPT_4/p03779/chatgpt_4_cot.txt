<<<Analysis>>>
The variable x is initialized to 6.
The code is solving a quadratic equation to find the minimum value of t such that the sum of integers from 1 to t is greater than or equal to x.
The quadratic equation being solved is t(t+1)/2 = x, which is derived from the sum of the first t natural numbers.
The code calculates t using the formula t = int((-1+(1+8*x)**0.5)//2), which simplifies to t = int((-1+(1+48)**0.5)//2) = int((-1+7)//2) = int(3.0) = 3.
It then checks if t * (t+1) // 2 is greater than or equal to x. In this case, 3 * (3+1) // 2 = 6, which is equal to x.
Since the condition is met, the code prints t, which is 3.
