<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string S from the standard input, which is "0011" in this case.
It then calculates the number of occurrences of '0' in S using S.count('0'), which is 2 for the given input.
Similarly, it calculates the number of occurrences of '1' in S using S.count('1'), which is also 2 for the given input.
The min function is used to find the smaller of these two counts, which is 2 since both counts are equal.
This minimum count is then multiplied by 2, resulting in 4.
Finally, the code prints this result, which is 4.
<<<Output>>>
4
