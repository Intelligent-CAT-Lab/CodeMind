<<<Analysis>>>
The variable S is initialized to the string "KIHBR".
The code first checks if the string "AA" is in S, which it is not.
Then it replaces "KIH" with an empty string in S, resulting in "BR".
Next, it replaces "A" with an empty string in the already modified string, which does not change it since there is no "A" left, so the result is still "BR".
The code then checks if the final string is equal to "BR", which it is.
Since the condition is met, the code prints "YES".
<<<Output>>>
YES
