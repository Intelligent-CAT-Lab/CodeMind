<<<Analysis>>>
The input string "01B0" is converted to a list of characters ['0', '1', 'B', '0'].
A deque named ans is initialized to be empty.
The code then iterates over each character in the list.
For the first character '0', it is not 'B', so it is appended to the deque, making ans deque(['0']).
For the second character '1', it is also not 'B', so it is appended to the deque, making ans deque(['0', '1']).
For the third character 'B', it is 'B', so the code checks if ans is empty. It is not, so the last element is popped from ans, removing '1' and making ans deque(['0']).
For the fourth character '0', it is not 'B', so it is appended to the deque, making ans deque(['0', '0']).
Finally, the deque is converted back to a string using "".join(ans), resulting in "00".
