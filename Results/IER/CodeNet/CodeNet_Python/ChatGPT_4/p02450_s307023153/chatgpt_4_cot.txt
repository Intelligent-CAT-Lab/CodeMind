<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 2.
The list nl is created with the string representations of numbers from 1 to n, which will be ['1', '2'].
The function perm is defined to generate all permutations of the list nl.
The function is called with nl as the argument.

The perm function works as follows:
- If the list is empty, it returns an empty list.
- If the list contains only one element, it returns a list containing that element as the only permutation.
- Otherwise, it initializes an empty list l to store the permutations.
- It then iterates over the elements of nl, selecting one element m at each iteration and computing the permutations of the rest of the list.
- For each permutation of the rest of the list, it prepends the selected element m and appends this new permutation to the list l.
- Finally, it returns the list l containing all the permutations.

Since n is 2, the perm function will generate two permutations: ['1', '2'] and ['2', '1'].
The for loop at the end of the code will iterate over these permutations and print them, joining each permutation's elements with a space.
