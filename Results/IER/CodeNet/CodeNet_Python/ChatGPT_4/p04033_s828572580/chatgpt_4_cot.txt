<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a and b are initialized to 1 and 3, respectively, from the input.
The first condition checks if a is greater than 0, which is true since a is 1.
Since the first condition is met, the code prints 'Positive' and does not check the other conditions.
The output of the code will be 'Positive'.
<<<Output>>>
Positive
