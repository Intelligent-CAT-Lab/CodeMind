<<<Analysis>>>
The variable X is initialized to 725.
The code then checks which range X falls into using a series of if-elif statements.
Since X is 725, it falls into the second range check (X >= 600 and X <= 799).
Therefore, the code will execute the print statement associated with that range, which is `print(7)`.
<<<Output>>>
