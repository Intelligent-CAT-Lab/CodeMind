<<<Analysis>>>
The input string `s` is initialized to "needed".
The function `solve` is defined and then called with `s` as its argument.
The length of the string `n` is calculated to be 6.
The first for loop iterates from 1 to 5 (since range(1, n) goes up to n-1).
It checks if any two consecutive characters are the same.
In the string "needed", the characters at index 1 and 2 are both 'e', so the condition `s[i-1] == s[i]` is true when `i` is 2.
The function prints the values of `i` and `i+1`, which are 2 and 3, respectively, and then returns, ending the function.
The second for loop and the final print statement are not executed because the function has already returned after finding the first pair of consecutive identical characters.
