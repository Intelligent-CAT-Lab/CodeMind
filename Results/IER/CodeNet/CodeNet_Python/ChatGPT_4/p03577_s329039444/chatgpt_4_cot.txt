<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function `resolve()` that takes no arguments. It reads a string `s` from the input and then prints the string `s` with the last 8 characters removed.
The `if __name__ == '__main__':` block checks if the script is being run directly (not imported as a module), and if so, it calls the `resolve()` function.
The input provided is `CODEFESTIVAL`.
The `resolve()` function will be called and it will print the input string without the last 8 characters. The string `CODEFESTIVAL` is 12 characters long, so removing the last 8 characters will leave us with `CODE`.
