<<<Analysis>>>
The variables x and y are initialized to 10 and 20, respectively.
The first if condition checks if the product of x and y is greater than 0, which is true (10*20 > 0), so k is set to 2.
The second if condition checks if x is equal to y, which is false (10 is not equal to 20), so it does not print 0.
The third if condition checks if x is 0 and y is less than 0, which is false (x is not 0 and y is not less than 0), so it does not execute the print statement.
The code then checks if x is less than y, which is true (10 < 20). Since k is 2 and x is not 0, it enters the first if block inside this condition and prints y - x, which is 20 - 10.
The remaining else conditions are not checked because the condition x < y was true and the corresponding block was executed.
The output will be the result of 20 - 10, which is 10.
