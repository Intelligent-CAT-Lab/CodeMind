The input `1 25 25 50` initializes N, A, B, and C to 1, 25, 25, and 50, respectively.
MOD is set to 10^9 + 7, which is a large prime number often used for modular arithmetic in competitive programming to avoid integer overflow.

The `Comb` class is initialized with `2 * N` (which is 2) and `MOD`. It precalculates factorials, modular inverses, and factorial inverses up to `2 * N`.

The `Inv` class is initialized with `MOD` and is used to calculate modular inverses. `IL` is a list of modular inverses of `A + B` raised to powers from 0 to `2 * N`. `IC` is the modular inverse of `100 - C`.

Arrays `PA` and `PB` are initialized to store the powers of `A` and `B` modulo `MOD`, respectively, up to `N`.

The variable `ans` is initialized to 0, which will accumulate the answer.

The loop iterates over the range from 0 to `N - 1` (in this case, just 0 since N is 1). Inside the loop, `ans` is updated twice for each `i`:
1. It adds the product of `(N + i)`, `IC`, `100`, `PA[N]`, `PB[i]`, `IL[N + i]`, and `com.com(N + i - 1, i)` modulo `MOD`.
2. It adds the product of `(N + i)`, `IC`, `100`, `PB[N]`, `PA[i]`, `IL[N + i]`, and `com.com(N + i - 1, i)` modulo `MOD`.

Finally, the answer `ans` is printed modulo `MOD`.

Let's calculate the values step by step:
- `com = Comb(2, MOD)` initializes factorials and inverses for `n = 0, 1, 2`.
- `inv = Inv(MOD)` is ready to calculate inverses.
- `IL = inv.invL(50, 2)` calculates the list of inverses for `1/50` raised to powers `0, 1, 2`.
- `IC = inv.invx(50)` calculates the inverse of `50` modulo `MOD`.
- `PA[1] = PA[0] * A % MOD` calculates `25` modulo `MOD`.
- `PB[1] = PB[0] * B % MOD` calculates `25` modulo `MOD`.

In the loop, since `N` is 1, we only have one iteration with `i = 0`:
- `ans` is updated with `(1 + 0) * IC * 100 * PA[1] * PB[0] * IL[1 + 0] * com.com(1 + 0 - 1, 0) % MOD`.
- `ans` is updated again with `(1 + 0) * IC * 100 * PB[1] * PA[0] * IL[1 + 0] * com.com(1 + 0 - 1, 0) % MOD`.

Since `com.com(0, 0)` is 1, `PA[1]` and `PB[1]` are both `25`, `IL[1]` is the inverse of `50`, and `IC` is the inverse of `50`, we can simplify the updates to `ans` as:
- `ans = ans + 1 * IC * 100 * 25 * 1 * IL[1] * 1 % MOD`.
- `ans = ans + 1 * IC * 100 * 25 * 1 * IL[1] * 1 % MOD`.

Since `IC` and `IL[1]` are both inverses of `50`, they effectively cancel out the multiplication by `50` in the `100 * 25` part, so we get:
- `ans = ans + 1 * 1 * 2 * 25 % MOD`.
- `ans = ans + 1 * 1 * 2 * 25 % MOD`.

This simplifies to:
- `ans = ans + 50 % MOD`.
- `ans = ans + 50 % MOD`.

So `ans` becomes `100` modulo `MOD`, which is just `100` since `100` is less than `MOD`.

Finally, the output is `ans % MOD`, which is `100`.
