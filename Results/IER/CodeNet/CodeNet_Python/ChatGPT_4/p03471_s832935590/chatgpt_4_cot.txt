<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function `readInts()` that reads a line of input, splits it into integers, and returns them as a list. The `main()` function is then defined, which reads two integers `n` and `y` from the input. These represent the number of bills and the total amount of money, respectively.

The `main()` function initializes a variable `wa` to 0, which is not used in the rest of the code.

The code then enters a nested loop, iterating over all possible combinations of the number of 10000 yen bills (`i`) and 5000 yen bills (`j`) such that `i + j` does not exceed `n`. For each combination, it calculates the number of 1000 yen bills (`y1000`) by subtracting the total value of 10000 yen and 5000 yen bills from `y` and dividing the result by 1000.

If the sum of `i`, `j`, and `y1000` equals `n`, it means a valid combination of bills that sum up to `y` has been found. The code then prints `i`, `j`, and `y1000` and exits.

If no valid combination is found after all iterations, the code prints `-1 -1 -1` and exits.

Given the input `9 45000`, the code will find the combination of bills that sum up to 45000 yen with exactly 9 bills.

Let's analyze the iterations:
- For `i = 0` and `j = 0`, `y1000` would be 45, which is more than `n`, so it's not a valid combination.
- The loop continues until it finds a valid combination or exhausts all possibilities.

The valid combination is found when `i = 4`, `j = 0`, because:
- The total value of 10000 yen bills is `4 * 10000 = 40000`.
- The total value of 5000 yen bills is `0 * 5000 = 0`.
- The remaining amount is `45000 - 40000 = 5000`, which means `y1000 = 5000 / 1000 = 5`.
- The sum of the number of bills is `4 + 0 + 5 = 9`, which equals `n`.

Therefore, the output will be `4 0 5`, and the program will exit after printing this result.
