<<<Analysis>>>
The variables K and N are initialized to 3 and 2, respectively.
The code checks if K is even by using the modulo operator. Since 3 % 2 is not equal to 0, the condition is false, and the code does not execute the code block inside the if statement.
Instead, it goes to the else block, where it initializes a list X with N (which is 2) elements, each being (K+1)//2, which is 2 in this case. So X starts as [2, 2].
The code then enters a loop that will iterate N//2 times, which is 2//2, so it will iterate 1 time.
Inside the loop, it checks if the last element of X is 1. Since the last element is 2, it does not execute the code block inside the if statement.
Instead, it decreases the last element of X by 1 (so X becomes [2, 1]) and then extends X with K (which is 3) until the length of X is equal to N. Since the length of X is already equal to N, it does not extend X.
After the loop, the code prints the elements of X separated by spaces. So the output will be "2 1".
