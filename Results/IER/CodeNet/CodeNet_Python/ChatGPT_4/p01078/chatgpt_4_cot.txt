<<<Analysis>>>
The variables N and K are initialized to 5 and 2, respectively.
The code calculates the area of a star with N points and a density of K using the provided formula.
The formula for the area is: area = N * r^2 * sin(180/N) * cos(180K/N) * sec(180(K-1)/N)
Since r is not provided, we assume r = 1 for the calculation.
The code uses the math library to calculate the sine, cosine, and secant (which is 1/cosine) of the angles in radians.
The angles are converted from degrees to radians by multiplying with PI / 180, but since the formula already uses radians (PI/N, K*PI/N, (K-1)*PI/N), there is no need for conversion.
The calculation is as follows:
- math.sin(PI/N) calculates the sine of PI/5 radians.
- math.cos(K*PI/N) calculates the cosine of 2*PI/5 radians.
- math.cos((K-1)*PI/N) calculates the cosine of 1*PI/5 radians.
- The final area is then calculated by multiplying N with the sine and cosine values and dividing by the cosine of (K-1)*PI/N.
The result of the calculation is printed out.
