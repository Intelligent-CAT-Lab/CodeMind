<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 2.
The code calculates the value of (n-1)*n//2, which is the formula for the sum of the first n-1 natural numbers.
Here, it calculates (2-1)*2//2, which simplifies to 1*2//2.
The integer division of 2 by 2 is 1.
The code then prints the result, which is 1.
