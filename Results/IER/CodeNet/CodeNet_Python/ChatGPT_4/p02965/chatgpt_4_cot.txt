The code is a Python program that calculates the number of sequences with certain properties modulo a prime number (MOD = 998244353). The input consists of two integers, N and M, which are read from the standard input.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the code execution with the input `2 2`:

1. The variables N and M are set to 2.
2. The function `get_factorials` computes the list of factorials up to `M * 3 // 2 + N` modulo MOD. In this case, it will compute factorials up to `2 * 3 // 2 + 2 = 5`.
3. The function `mod_invs` computes the modular inverses of numbers from 0 to `M * 3 // 2 + N` modulo MOD.
4. The `factorials` array is filled with the factorials computed by `get_factorials`, and `finvs` is filled with the modular inverses computed by `mod_invs`.
5. The function `ncr` computes the binomial coefficient nCr modulo MOD.
6. The code calculates the number of sequences where the sum is `M*3` and the number of odd numbers is at most M. It does this by considering the number of ways to choose odd numbers and the number of ways to arrange the remaining numbers.
7. The code calculates the number of sequences where the maximum number is greater than `M*2`, the sum is M, and the number of odd numbers is at most M, multiplied by N.
8. The final result is the difference between the two counts calculated in steps 6 and 7, modulo MOD.

Given the input `2 2`, the code will perform the following specific calculations:

- Calculate factorials up to 5 modulo 998244353.
- Calculate modular inverses up to 5 modulo 998244353.
- Calculate binomial coefficients for various combinations of n and r.
- Calculate the number of sequences with the sum `M*3 = 6` and at most 2 odd numbers.
- Calculate the number of sequences with the sum `M = 2`, at least one element greater than 0, and at most 2 odd numbers, multiplied by N.

After performing these calculations, the code will print the final result modulo 998244353.
