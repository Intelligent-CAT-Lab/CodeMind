<<<Analysis>>>
The variable S is initialized with the input string 'hihi'.
The if statement checks if S is equal to any of the following strings: 'hi', 'hihi', 'hihihi', 'hihihihi', or 'hihihihihi'.
Since S is equal to 'hihi', the condition of the if statement is True.
As a result, the code will execute the print statement within the if block and print 'Yes'.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
