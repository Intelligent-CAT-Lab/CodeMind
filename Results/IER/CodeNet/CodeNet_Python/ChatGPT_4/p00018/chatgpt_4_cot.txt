<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string input, splits it by spaces, and maps each split string to an integer, resulting in a list of integers.
The list of integers is then sorted in ascending order.
The sorted list is then reversed to get a descending order.
The code iterates through the reversed list and prints each number followed by a comma and a space.
Given the input `3 6 9 7 5`, the sorted list would be `[3, 5, 6, 7, 9]`.
Reversing the sorted list would give `[9, 7, 6, 5, 3]`.
The code will print each number in this reversed list followed by a comma and a space, resulting in `9, 7, 6, 5, 3,`.
<<<Output>>>
9, 7, 6, 5, 3,
