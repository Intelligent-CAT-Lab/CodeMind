The variable ans is initialized to 100000.
The code then enters a loop that iterates 5 times because the input is `5`.
In each iteration, ans is multiplied by 1.05 (increased by 5%).
After the multiplication, if ans is not a multiple of 1000 (ans % 1000 is not 0), it is rounded up to the nearest thousand. This is done by adding 1000 minus the remainder of ans divided by 1000.
The loop runs 5 times with the following calculations:
1. ans = 100000 * 1.05 = 105000 (no rounding needed as it's already a multiple of 1000)
2. ans = 105000 * 1.05 = 110250, rounded up to 111000
3. ans = 111000 * 1.05 = 116550, rounded up to 117000
4. ans = 117000 * 1.05 = 122850, rounded up to 123000
5. ans = 123000 * 1.05 = 129150, rounded up to 130000
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans as an integer, which is 130000.
<<<Output>>>
130000
