<<<Analysis>>>
The variable S is initialized to the string "apple".
The code checks if the last character of S is "s" by accessing S[len(S)-1].
Since the last character of "apple" is not "s", the else block is executed.
The code concatenates "s" to the end of S, resulting in "apples".
The code then prints the value of ans, which is "apples".
<<<Output>>>
apples
