<<<Analysis>>>
The variables n, a, and b are initialized to 7, 17, and 120, respectively.
The code calculates the product of a and n, which is 17 * 7 = 119.
Then it compares this product with b, which is 120.
The min function is used to determine the smaller of the two values, which in this case is 119.
The code then prints the smaller value.
<<<Output>>>
119
