The function rep_pow is defined to calculate a^k mod p, where p is by default set to 10**9+7.
The variables m and n are initialized to 2 and 3, respectively, from the input.
The function rep_pow is called with arguments m=2 and n=3.
Inside the function, the variable ans is initialized to 1.
The while loop will run as long as k (which is 3) is greater than 0.
The first iteration checks if k (3) is odd using bitwise AND with 1 (k & 1), which is true.
ans is updated to ans * a % p, which is 1 * 2 % (10**9+7), so ans becomes 2.
a is squared and updated to 4 % (10**9+7), so a remains 4.
k is right-shifted by 1 (k >>= 1), so k becomes 1.
The second iteration checks if k (1) is odd, which is true.
ans is updated to ans * a % p, which is 2 * 4 % (10**9+7), so ans becomes 8.
a is squared and updated to 16 % (10**9+7), so a remains 16.
k is right-shifted by 1 (k >>= 1), so k becomes 0.
The loop ends because k is now 0.
The function returns ans, which is 8.
The print statement outputs the result of rep_pow(m, n), which is 8.
