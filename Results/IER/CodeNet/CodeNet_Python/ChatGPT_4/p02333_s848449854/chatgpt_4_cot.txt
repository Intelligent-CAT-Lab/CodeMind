The input is `4 3`, which means n is 4 and k is 3.

The `combMod` function is used to calculate the combination of n and r modulo p, where p is a prime number (in this case, MOD is 10**9 + 7).

The `resolve` function is where the main logic of the program resides. Since n (4) is greater than or equal to k (3), the program enters the first branch of the if statement.

The variable `ans` is initialized to 0. A loop is then started, which will iterate from 0 to k-1 (inclusive), meaning it will iterate 3 times for i = 0, 1, 2.

In each iteration, the following calculation is performed:
- `combMod(k, k - i, MOD)` calculates the combination of k and k-i modulo MOD.
- `pow(k - i, n, MOD)` calculates (k - i) raised to the power of n modulo MOD.
- The result of the combination and the power calculation is multiplied together, and then multiplied by (-1) ** i (which alternates the sign).
- The result of this multiplication is added to `ans`, and the modulo operation ensures that `ans` remains within the bounds of MOD.

The calculations for each iteration are as follows:
- For i = 0: (-1) ** 0 * combMod(3, 3, MOD) * pow(3, 4, MOD) = 1 * 1 * 81 = 81
- For i = 1: (-1) ** 1 * combMod(3, 2, MOD) * pow(2, 4, MOD) = -1 * 3 * 16 = -48
- For i = 2: (-1) ** 2 * combMod(3, 1, MOD) * pow(1, 4, MOD) = 1 * 3 * 1 = 3

Adding these up and taking modulo MOD:
ans = (81 - 48 + 3) % MOD = 36 % MOD = 36

Finally, the `ans` is printed, which is 36.
