<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads lines from the standard input (stdin) until it encounters a None or a newline character.
For the given input '1 21', the code splits the line into two parts '1' and '21' and concatenates them to form the string '121'.
This string is then converted to an integer, resulting in the number 121.
The code then checks if the square root of 121 is an integer by comparing the square of the integer part of the square root with the original number.
The square root of 121 is 11, and 11 squared is indeed 121.
Since the condition is met (11 * 11 == 121), the code prints "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
