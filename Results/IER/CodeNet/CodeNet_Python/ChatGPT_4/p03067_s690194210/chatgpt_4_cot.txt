<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a, b, and c are initialized to 3, 8, and 5, respectively.
The code then checks if either of the following conditions is true:
1. a < c < b
2. a > c > b
For the given input, the first condition a < c < b is true because 3 < 5 < 8.
Since the condition is met, the code will execute the print statement under the if clause.
Therefore, the output will be 'Yes'.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
