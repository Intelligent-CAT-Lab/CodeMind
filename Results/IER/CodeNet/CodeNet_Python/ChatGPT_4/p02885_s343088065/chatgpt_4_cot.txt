<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a and b are initialized to 12 and 4, respectively, from the input.
The code calculates the expression a - 2*b, which is 12 - 2*4 = 12 - 8 = 4.
The max function is used to compare the result of the expression with 0, and since 4 is greater than 0, the max function will return 4.
The code then prints the result, which is 4.
<<<Output>>>
4
