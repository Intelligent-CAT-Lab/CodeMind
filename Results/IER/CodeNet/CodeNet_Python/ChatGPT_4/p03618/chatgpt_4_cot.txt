<<<Analysis>>>
The input string `s` is initialized to 'aatt'.
The string is sorted, which does not change it since it is already in sorted order.
The `groupby` function is used to group the characters, which will group 'a' together and 't' together.
The length of the string `l` is 4.
The variable `res` is initialized to the number of possible substrings in `s`, which is calculated by the formula `l * (l - 1) // 2 + 1`. This equals `4 * 3 // 2 + 1`, which is `6 + 1`, so `res` is initially set to 7.
The loop iterates over the groups created by `groupby`. There are two groups: one for 'a' and one for 't'.
For each group, it calculates the number of substrings that can be formed with the repeated characters and subtracts this from `res`.
For 'a', there are 2 occurrences, so the number of substrings that can be formed with 'a' is `2 * (2 - 1) // 2`, which is `1`. `res` is reduced by 1 to 6.
For 't', there are also 2 occurrences, so the number of substrings that can be formed with 't' is the same as for 'a', which is `1`. `res` is reduced by 1 again to 5.
The final value of `res` is 5, which is the number of distinct substrings that can be formed from 'aatt'.
