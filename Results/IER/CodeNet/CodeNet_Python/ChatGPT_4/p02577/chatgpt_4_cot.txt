<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to the string '123456789'.
The variable tmp is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of the digits modulo 9.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the length of the string n, which is 9 characters long.
For each character in the string, it converts the character to an integer, adds it to tmp, and then takes the result modulo 9.
The sum of the digits of '123456789' is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9 = 45.
Taking 45 modulo 9 results in 0.
Since tmp is equal to 0, the condition in the if statement is true.
Therefore, the code will print "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
