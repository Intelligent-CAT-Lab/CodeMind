<<<Analysis>>>
The input is a string "5 5 7" which is split into a list of strings ['5', '5', '7'].
Each string in the list is converted to an integer, resulting in the list A = [5, 5, 7].
The list A is sorted, but since it is already in ascending order, the sorted list remains the same: A = [5, 5, 7].
The if condition checks if the first element is 5, the second element is 5, and the third element is 7.
Since all conditions are true, the code prints "YES".
<<<Output>>>
YES
