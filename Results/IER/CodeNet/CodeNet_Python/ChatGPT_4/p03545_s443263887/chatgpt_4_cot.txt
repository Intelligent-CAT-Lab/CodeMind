<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to the string '1222'.
The variable op_cnt is calculated as the length of n minus 1, which is 3 in this case.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 2^op_cnt - 1 (which is 7 for op_cnt=3), representing all possible combinations of '+' and '-' operations between the digits in n.
For each iteration, a list of '-' operations of length op_cnt is created.
The inner loop iterates over the range of op_cnt (0 to 2) and checks each bit of the binary representation of i. If the bit is 1, it replaces the corresponding '-' with a '+' in the op list, starting from the end.
The formula string is constructed by concatenating each digit of n with the corresponding operation from op, with an empty string appended to op to handle the last digit.
The eval function is used to evaluate the formula as a Python expression.
If the result of the evaluation is 7, the formula followed by '=7' is printed and the loop is broken.
For the input '1222', the loop will eventually find the combination '1+2+2-2' which evaluates to 7.
<<<Output>>>
1+2+2-2=7
