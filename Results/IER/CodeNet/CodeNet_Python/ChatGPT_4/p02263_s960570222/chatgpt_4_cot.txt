<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines an empty list called `stack`.
It then reads a string from the input and splits it into a list of tokens based on spaces. For the given input `1 2 +`, the list of tokens will be `['1', '2', '+']`.
The code enters a loop that iterates over each token in the list.
For the first token '1', since it is not one of the operators '+', '-', or '*', it is appended to the `stack`, which becomes `['1']`.
For the second token '2', the same happens, and the `stack` becomes `['1', '2']`.
For the third token '+', it is an operator, so the code pops the last two elements from the `stack` (which are '2' and '1'), and evaluates the expression '1+2'. The result of this evaluation is '3', which is then converted to a string and appended back to the `stack`, which now becomes `['3']`.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the elements of `stack` joined together as a string. Since `stack` contains only one element '3', the output will be '3'.
