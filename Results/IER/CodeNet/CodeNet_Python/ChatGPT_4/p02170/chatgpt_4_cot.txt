<<<Analysis>>>
The input `1 1 50` initializes the variables n, k, and a to 1, 1, and 50, respectively.

The list `lst` is initialized with k+1 zeros, which means it will have 2 elements, both 0.
The second to last element of `lst` is set to 1, so `lst` becomes [0, 1].

The variable `A` is calculated as `a * pow(100*n, mod-2, mod)`, which simplifies to `50 * pow(100, mod-2, mod)` since n is 1. The `pow` function here is used to calculate the modular inverse of `100*n` modulo `mod`.

The variable `inv` is calculated as `pow(n, mod-2, mod)`, which simplifies to `pow(1, mod-2, mod)` and is equal to 1 since n is 1.

The loop iterates over the range `k-1` in reverse, but since k is 1, the loop does not execute.

Finally, the code prints `(lst[0] - lst[1]) % mod`. Since `lst` is [0, 1], the output will be `(0 - 1) % mod`, which is `-1 % mod`.

Since `mod` is 998244353, the result of `-1 % mod` is `mod - 1`, which is `998244353 - 1`.

Therefore, the output will be `998244352`.
