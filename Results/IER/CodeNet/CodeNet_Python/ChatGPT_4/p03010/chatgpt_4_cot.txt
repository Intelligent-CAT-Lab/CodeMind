<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a main function that is immediately called at the end. The function reads an integer input `n` which is set to 3 in this case.

The `base` list is predefined with specific values.

The `ans` list of lists is initialized to be an n by n matrix of zeros. Then, two elements are set to 1: `ans[1][0]` and `ans[0][1]`.

The code enters a loop that starts from `vn = 3` to `n + 1` (inclusive), which means it will only iterate once for `vn = 3` since `n` is 3.

Inside the loop, the code initializes `mx` to 0 and then iterates over all permutations of the numbers from 0 to `vn - 2` (which is 1 in this case, so there is only one permutation: (0,)).

For each permutation, it calculates the sum of `ans[v0][v1]` for each consecutive pair of values in the permutation. Since there is only one permutation and it contains only one element, the sum `cur` will be 0.

The code then updates `ans[vn - 1][0]` and `ans[0][vn - 1]` to `base[vn-2] * (mx + 1)`, which is `base[1] * (0 + 1)`, so both `ans[2][0]` and `ans[0][2]` are set to `2 * 1 = 2`.

Next, it updates `ans[vn - 1][vn-2]` and `ans[vn-2][vn - 1]` to `base[vn-3] * (mx + 1)`, which is `base[0] * (0 + 1)`, so both `ans[2][1]` and `ans[1][2]` are set to `1 * 1 = 1`.

Since `vn-2` is 1, the loop for updating the remaining elements of `ans` does not execute.

Finally, the code prints the `ans` matrix row by row. The resulting matrix is:
```
0 1 2
1 0 1
2 1 0
```
<<<Output>>>
0 1 2
1 0 1
2 1 0
