<<<Analysis>>>
The variable S is initialized to the string "RRS".
Two variables, cur_l and max_l, are initialized to 0. These will keep track of the current length of consecutive 'R's and the maximum length found, respectively.

The code enters a loop that iterates over each character in the string S.
- For the first character 'R', cur_l is incremented to 1.
- For the second character 'R', cur_l is incremented to 2.
- For the third character 'S', the else block is executed. Since cur_l (2) is greater than max_l (0), max_l is updated to 2. cur_l is reset to 0.

After the loop, there is a final check to see if the current length of consecutive 'R's is greater than the maximum length found. This is not the case here, as cur_l is 0 and max_l is 2.

Finally, the code prints the value of max_l, which is 2.
