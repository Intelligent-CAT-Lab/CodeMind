The function `solve` is defined and then called after the input is given.
The variables M and D are initialized to 15 and 40, respectively.
The variable `ans` is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of days that meet the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 12 to D (inclusive), meaning it will consider days from 12 to 40.
For each day `i` in this range, it splits the day into two digits `a` (tens place) and `b` (ones place).
The condition checks if both `a` and `b` are greater than 1, and if the product of `a` and `b` is less than or equal to M (15 in this case).
If the condition is met, `ans` is incremented by 1.
The days that meet the condition are 22, 24, 26, 28, 32, 34, 36, and 38, because their tens and ones digits multiplied together are less than or equal to 15.
After the loop finishes, the function returns the final value of `ans`, which is 8.
The returned value is then printed.
<<<Output>>>
8
