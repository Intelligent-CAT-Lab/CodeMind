The variable s is initialized to a list of characters from the input string 'aabbaa'.
The variable c is initialized to 1, which will be used to count the number of distinct substrings.
The variable n is initialized to an empty string, which will be used to build substrings.
The variable k is initialized to the first character of the input string, which is 'a'.

The code then enters a loop that iterates from the second character to the last character of the input string.
In each iteration, the current character is appended to the string n.
The code checks if k (the current distinct substring) is not equal to n (the newly formed substring).
If k is not equal to n, it means a new distinct substring has been found, so k is updated to n, n is reset to an empty string, and c is incremented by 1.

The loop processes the input string as follows:
- i=1: n='a', k='a', n is reset, c remains 1
- i=2: n='b', k!='a', k is updated to 'b', n is reset, c becomes 2
- i=3: n='b', k='b', n is reset, c remains 2
- i=4: n='a', k!='b', k is updated to 'a', n is reset, c becomes 3
- i=5: n='a', k='a', n is reset, c remains 3

After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of c, which is 3, representing the number of distinct substrings in the input string 'aabbaa'.
