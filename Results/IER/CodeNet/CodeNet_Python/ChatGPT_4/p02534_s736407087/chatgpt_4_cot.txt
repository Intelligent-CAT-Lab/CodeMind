<<<Analysis>>>
The variable a is initialized to 3.
The list s is initialized with one element 'ACL'.
An empty list w is created.
The code enters a loop that iterates 3 times (since a is 3).
In each iteration, the list s is added to the list w. After the first iteration, w = ['ACL'], after the second iteration, w = ['ACL', 'ACL'], and after the third iteration, w = ['ACL', 'ACL', 'ACL'].
After the loop, the join method is used to concatenate the elements of w into a single string without any separator.
The final string 'ACLACLACL' is printed.
