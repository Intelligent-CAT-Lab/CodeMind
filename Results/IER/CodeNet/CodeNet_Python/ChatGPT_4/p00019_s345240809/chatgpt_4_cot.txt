The input is the string '5', which is then converted to an integer and passed to the factorial function.
The factorial function is a recursive function that calculates the factorial of a given number n.
Here's the breakdown of the recursive calls:
- factorial(5) calls factorial(4)
- factorial(4) calls factorial(3)
- factorial(3) calls factorial(2)
- factorial(2) calls factorial(1)
- factorial(1) returns 1 (base case)
Then the recursion starts to unwind:
- factorial(2) returns 2 * factorial(1) which is 2
- factorial(3) returns 3 * factorial(2) which is 6
- factorial(4) returns 4 * factorial(3) which is 24
- factorial(5) returns 5 * factorial(4) which is 120
Finally, the print statement outputs the result of factorial(5), which is 120.
<<<Output>>>
120
