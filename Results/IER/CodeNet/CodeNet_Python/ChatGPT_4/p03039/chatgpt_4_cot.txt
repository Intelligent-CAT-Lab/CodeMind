<<<Analysis>>>
The variables n, m, and k are initialized to 2, 2, and 2, respectively.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the answer.
The variable INF is set to 10^9 + 7, which is a large prime number often used for modulo operations in competitive programming to prevent integer overflow.

Since n is not greater than m, the first block of code is executed:
- M is calculated as -(m-1)*m*(2*m-1)//3 + m*m*(m-1), which simplifies to -(1)*2*(3)//3 + 2*2*(1) = -6 + 4 = -2.
- Ms is calculated as m*m*(m-1)//2 - (m-1)*m*(2*m-1)//6, which simplifies to 2*2*(1)//2 - (1)*2*(3)//6 = 4 - 1 = 3.
- Both M and Ms are taken modulo INF, but since they are both less than INF, they remain unchanged (M = -2, Ms = 3).

The nested loops iterate over all pairs (i, j) where 1 <= i <= j <= n. Since n is 2, the pairs are (1, 1), (1, 2), and (2, 2).
- For (1, 1) and (2, 2), i equals j, so Ms is added to ans, resulting in ans = 3 + 3 = 6.
- For (1, 2), i does not equal j, so d is calculated as j - i = 1, and ans is updated as ans + d*m^2 + M, which is 6 + 1*2^2 - 2 = 6 + 4 - 2 = 8. Now ans = 6 + 8 = 14.
- After each update, ans is taken modulo INF, but since ans is less than INF, it remains unchanged.

The final part of the code calculates the binomial coefficient (n*m-2)! / ((n*m-k)! * (k-2)!) and multiplies it by ans. This is the number of ways to choose k-2 elements from n*m-2 elements.
- n*m-2 is 2*2-2 = 2.
- n*m-k is 2*2-2 = 2.
- k-2 is 2-2 = 0.
- The factorial of 2 is 2, and the factorial of 0 is 1.
- The binomial coefficient is (2! / (2! * 0!)) * ans = (2 / (2 * 1)) * 14 = 1 * 14 = 14.
- Finally, ans is taken modulo INF, but since it is less than INF, it remains unchanged.

The code prints the final value of ans, which is 14.
