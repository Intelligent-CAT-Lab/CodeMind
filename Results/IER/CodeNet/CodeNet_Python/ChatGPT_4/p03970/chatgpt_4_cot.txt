The variable S is initialized to the string 'C0DEFESTIVAL2O16'.
The variable A is initialized to the string 'CODEFESTIVAL2016'.
The variable cnt is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of characters that differ between S and A.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the indices of the string A.
For each index i, the code compares the character at position i in A with the character at position i in S.
If the characters are different, cnt is incremented by 1.
The differences are at index 1 ('0' vs 'O') and index 13 ('O' vs '0'), so cnt will be incremented twice.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of cnt, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
