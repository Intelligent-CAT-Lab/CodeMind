<<<Analysis>>>
The input is `3`. The main function is called and the variable `n` is initialized to 3.
An empty list `l` is created, and a variable `i` is initialized to 1.
The while loop starts and will run until `n` is no longer greater than 0.
In the first iteration, `n` is reduced by `i` (which is 1), so `n` becomes 2.
The variable `t` is calculated as `i * (i - 1) // 2`, which is 0 for the first iteration.
A list ranging from `t + 1` to `t + i + 1` is appended to `l`. For the first iteration, this is the list `[1]`.
`i` is incremented to 2.
In the second iteration, `n` is reduced by `i` (which is 2), so `n` becomes 0.
`t` is calculated as `1` (2 * (2 - 1) // 2).
A list ranging from `t + 1` to `t + i + 1` is appended to `l`. For the second iteration, this is the list `[2, 3]`.
`i` is incremented to 3.
Since `n` is now 0, the loop ends.
The condition `if n < 0` is not met, so the program continues.
The program prints "Yes" because a solution exists.
`i` is decremented to 2.
The variable `ans` is created with the following elements: `[i + 1]` which is `[3]`, `[i]` which is `[2]`, and `[l[j][-1] for j in range(i)]` which is `[1, 3]`. So `ans` is `[3, 2, 1, 3]`.
For `j` in range `i` (which is 2), the following elements are appended to `ans`: `[i]` which is `[2]`, `l[j]` which is `[1]` for the first iteration and `[2, 3]` for the second iteration, and `[l[k][j] for k in range(j + 1, i)]` which is empty for both iterations since `k` in `range(j + 1, i)` is an empty range. So `ans` becomes `[3, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 2, 3]`.
The program prints the elements of `ans` joined by spaces.
