<<<Analysis>>>
The variables A, B, and T are initialized to 3, 5, and 7, respectively.
The code calculates the integer division of T by A, which is 7//3, resulting in 2.
This result is then multiplied by B, which is 2*5, resulting in 10.
The code prints the final result, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
