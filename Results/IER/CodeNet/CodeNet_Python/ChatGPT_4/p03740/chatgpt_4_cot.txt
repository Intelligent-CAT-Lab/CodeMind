<<<Analysis>>>
The variables x and y are initialized to 2 and 1, respectively, from the input.
The code then checks if the absolute difference between x and y is less than or equal to 1.
Since abs(2-1) equals 1, which is less than or equal to 1, the condition is true.
Therefore, the code will print 'Brown'.
<<<Output>>>
Brown
