<<<Analysis>>>
The variables n and m are initialized to 3 and 100, respectively.
The variable points is initialized to a list of "0" strings, with the same length as n, so points = ["0", "0", "0"].
The code then enters a loop that starts from n//2 + 1 and goes up to n - 1 (since range in Python is exclusive of the end value). Since n is 3, n//2 is 1, and n//2 + 1 is 2. Therefore, the loop will only run for i = 2.
In the loop, the value at index i of the points list is set to the string representation of m, which is "100". So points[2] becomes "100".
After the loop, the list points is ["0", "0", "100"].
The code then prints the elements of points joined by a space, resulting in the output "0 0 100".
<<<Output>>>
0 0 100
