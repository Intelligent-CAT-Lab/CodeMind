The variables x1, y1, x2, and y2 are initialized to 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, and 1.0, respectively.
The code calculates the distance between the points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) using the Euclidean distance formula.
The distance is calculated as the square root of the sum of the squares of the differences in x and y coordinates: sqrt((1-0)^2 + (1-0)^2).
This results in sqrt(1 + 1), which is sqrt(2).
The value of sqrt(2) is approximately 1.414213.
The code then prints the distance with 6 decimal places of precision.
<<<Output>>>
1.414214
