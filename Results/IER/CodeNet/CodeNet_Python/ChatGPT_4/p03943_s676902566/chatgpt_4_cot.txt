<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a, b, and c are initialized to 10, 30, and 20, respectively.
The code then checks if any of the following conditions are true:
1. a is equal to the sum of b and c (10 == 30 + 20), which is not true.
2. The sum of a and b is equal to c (10 + 30 == 20), which is not true.
3. The sum of a and c is equal to b (10 + 20 == 30), which is true.

Since the third condition is true, the code will execute the corresponding branch and print 'Yes'.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
