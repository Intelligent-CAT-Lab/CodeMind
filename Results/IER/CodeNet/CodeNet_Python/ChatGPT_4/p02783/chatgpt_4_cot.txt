<<<Analysis>>>
The variables H and A are initialized to 10 and 4, respectively.
The code uses the math.ceil function to calculate the smallest integer greater than or equal to the division of H by A.
The division of H by A (10/4) is 2.5.
The smallest integer greater than 2.5 is 3.
Therefore, the output will be 3.
