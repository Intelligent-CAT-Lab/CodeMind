<<<Analysis>>>
The variables A, B, and C are initialized to 50, 100, and 120, respectively.
The code checks if the sum of A and B is greater than or equal to C.
In this case, A + B equals 150, which is indeed greater than or equal to C (120).
Since the condition A + B >= C is true, the code will execute the print statement under the if clause.
Therefore, the output will be 'Yes'.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
