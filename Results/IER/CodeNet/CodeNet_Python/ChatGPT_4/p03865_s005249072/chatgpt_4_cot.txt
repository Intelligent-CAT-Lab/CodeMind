<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string `s` from the standard input, which is 'aba' in this case.
The length of the string `n` is calculated, which is 3 for 'aba'.
The code checks if the first and the last characters of the string are the same. For 'aba', `s[0]` is 'a' and `s[n-1]` is also 'a', so they are the same.
Since the first and last characters are the same, `move` is set to 1.
Next, the code calculates `(n - move) % 2`, which is `(3 - 1) % 2 = 2 % 2 = 0`.
Since `move` is 0 after the modulo operation, the code prints 'Second'.
<<<Output>>>
Second
