<<<Analysis>>>
The variables D and L are initialized to 10 and 5, respectively.
The code calculates the integer division of D by L, which is int(10/5), resulting in 2.
Then, it calculates the remainder of the division of D by L, which is D - L * int(D/L), resulting in 10 - 5 * 2, which is 0.
The final answer is the sum of the integer division result and the remainder, which is 2 + 0.
Therefore, the output will be 2.
