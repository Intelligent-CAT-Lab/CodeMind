<<<Analysis>>>
The variables N and C are initialized to 0 and 5, respectively.
The code checks if C is equal to 100. Since C is 5, the condition is false.
The else block is executed, which prints the result of 100 raised to the power of N multiplied by C.
Since N is 0, 100 ** N is 1 (any number raised to the power of 0 is 1).
Therefore, the result is 1 * 5, which is 5.
<<<Output>>>
5
