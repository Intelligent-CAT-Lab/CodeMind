The code defines a function `resolve()` which is intended to be called to process the input and print the output. The input is the number `18`.

1. The function `make_prime_list_2(num)` is defined to create a list of prime numbers up to `num`. It initializes a list with numbers from 0 to `num` and then marks non-prime numbers as 0 by sieving multiples of each prime number found. It returns a list of prime numbers.

2. The function `prime_factorization_2(num)` is defined to perform prime factorization of `num`. It returns a dictionary where keys are prime factors and values are their respective exponents in the factorization.

3. The input `18` is passed to `prime_factorization_2`, which first finds all prime numbers up to the square root of `18` using `make_prime_list_2`. The primes up to the square root of `18` are `[2, 3]`.

4. The function then performs prime factorization on `18`. The prime factors of `18` are `2` and `3`, with `2` appearing once and `3` appearing twice in the factorization. Thus, the dictionary `d` becomes `{2: 1, 3: 2}`.

5. The code then calculates the number of divisors of `18` by taking the product of `(exponent + 1)` for each prime factor's exponent. This is because if a number `n` has a prime factorization of `p1^e1 * p2^e2 * ... * pk^ek`, the number of divisors of `n` is `(e1 + 1) * (e2 + 1) * ... * (ek + 1)`. For `18`, this calculation is `(1 + 1) * (2 + 1) = 2 * 3 = 6`.

6. The code prints the number of distinct prime factors, which is the length of dictionary `d` (2 in this case), and the number of divisors minus 1, which is `6 - 1 = 5`.

Therefore, the output will be `2 5`.
