<<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized to the string 'BBW'.
The variable cnt is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the total number of moves.
The variable l is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of 'W' characters encountered.

The code then enters a loop that iterates over the indices of the string s.
For each character in the string:
- If the character is 'W', it calculates the difference between the current index (i) and the number of 'W' characters encountered so far (l), and adds this difference to cnt. It then increments l by 1.

The loop processes the characters in 'BBW' as follows:
- For the first 'B' at index 0, nothing happens because it's not 'W'.
- For the second 'B' at index 1, nothing happens because it's not 'W'.
- For the 'W' at index 2, cnt is increased by 2 - 0 = 2, and l is incremented to 1.

After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of cnt, which is 2.
