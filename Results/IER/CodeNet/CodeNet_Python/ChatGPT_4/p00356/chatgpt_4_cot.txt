<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a and b are initialized to 4 and 4, respectively.
The code calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of a and b using math.gcd(a, b), which is 4 since both a and b are 4.
The code then calculates the expression a + b - (math.gcd(a, b)) + 1, which simplifies to 4 + 4 - 4 + 1.
This simplifies further to 8 - 4 + 1, which equals 5.
The code prints the result of the expression, which is 5.
<<<Output>>>
