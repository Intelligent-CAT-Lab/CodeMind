<<<Analysis>>>
The code is designed to determine whether it is possible to hit a target at coordinates (X, Y) with a projectile launched with velocity V, considering gravity g and any obstacles that may be in the way. The input `0 7 3 1` sets the number of obstacles to 0, the velocity V to 7, the target X coordinate to 3, and the target Y coordinate to 1.

Since there are no obstacles (N is 0), the obstacles list remains empty.

The first check is to see if the target X coordinate is 0. If it is, the code checks if the initial vertical velocity squared divided by twice the gravity is less than Y minus a very small epsilon value. If this is true, it prints 'No' and exits. However, in this case, X is not 0, so this check is skipped.

Next, the code checks if it is possible to hit the target directly using the can_hit function. Since there are no obstacles, the function will only check if the projectile can reach the target coordinates (X, Y) with the given velocity V. The function calculates the discriminant D to determine if the projectile can reach the target. If D is negative, it means the projectile cannot reach the target, and the function returns False. If D is zero or positive, it calculates the time t and the velocities vx and vy to see if the projectile can go above the target Y coordinate.

However, since there are no obstacles, the loop that checks for collisions with obstacles will not execute, and the function will return True if the projectile can reach the target.

Since the target coordinates are (3, 1) and the velocity is 7, the projectile can reach the target without any obstacles in the way. Therefore, the can_hit function will return True, and the code will print 'Yes' and exit.
