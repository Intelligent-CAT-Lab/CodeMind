<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function `make_divisors` that calculates all divisors of a given number `n` and returns them in a list sorted from smallest to largest. The variable `N` and `M` are initialized to 3 and 14, respectively.

The `div` list is initialized with the value 1 and then extended with the divisors of `M` (14) calculated by the `make_divisors` function. The divisors of 14 are 1, 2, 7, and 14. Since 1 is already in the list, the final `div` list will be [1, 1, 2, 7, 14].

The `div` list is then sorted, which will not change the order because it is already sorted.

The `bisect_left` function from the `bisect` module is used to find the index of the first element in `div` that is greater than or equal to `N` (3). The index found will be 2, which corresponds to the value 2 in the `div` list.

The value at this index (2) is stored in the variable `g`.

Finally, the code prints the result of `M` (14) divided by `g` (2), which is 7.
