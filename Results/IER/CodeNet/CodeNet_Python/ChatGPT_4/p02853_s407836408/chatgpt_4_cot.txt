<<<Analysis>>>
The variables x and y are initialized to 1 and 1, respectively, from the input.
The variable prize is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the total prize amount.
The code checks if both x and y are equal to 1. Since this is true, it adds 400000 to prize.
Then, the code checks if x is less than or equal to 3. Since x is 1, it adds the first element of sknList (300000) to prize.
Next, the code checks if y is less than or equal to 3. Since y is 1, it adds the first element of sknList (300000) to prize again.
The final value of prize is the sum of 400000, 300000, and 300000, which is 1000000.
The code prints the final value of prize.
<<<Output>>>
1000000
