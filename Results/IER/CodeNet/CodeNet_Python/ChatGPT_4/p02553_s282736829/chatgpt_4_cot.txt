<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a set of functions for input handling, but the main part of the code starts after these definitions.

The variables a, b, c, and d are initialized with the values from the input, which are 1, 2, 1, and 1, respectively.

The code then calculates four products:
- p = a * c = 1 * 1 = 1
- q = a * d = 1 * 1 = 1
- r = b * c = 2 * 1 = 2
- s = b * d = 2 * 1 = 2

The code then prints the maximum of these four values, which is 2.

<<<Output>>>
2
