<<<Analysis>>>
The input is split into a list of integers, so `data` becomes [1000, 15, 80].
The code then checks if the division of the first element by the second element (1000 / 15) is less than or equal to the third element (80).
The result of 1000 / 15 is approximately 66.67.
Since 66.67 is less than 80, the condition is true.
Therefore, the code will print 'Yes'.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
