<<<Analysis>>>
The variables n and p are initialized to 3 and 24, respectively.
The code then checks for three conditions:
1. If n is 1, it prints p.
2. If p is 1, it prints 1.
3. If n is greater than or equal to 40, it prints 1.

Since none of these conditions are met, the code proceeds to the else block.
In the else block, the variable ans is initialized to 1, and count is initialized to 2.
The variable tmp is initialized to count raised to the power of n, which is 2^3 = 8.
The code enters a while loop that continues as long as tmp is less than or equal to p.
Inside the loop, the code checks if p is divisible by tmp (p % tmp == 0).
If it is, ans is multiplied by count (ans *= count), p is divided by tmp (p = int(p/tmp)), and count is decremented by 1.
If it is not, count is incremented by 1, and tmp is recalculated as count raised to the power of n.

The loop runs as follows:
- count = 2, tmp = 2^3 = 8, p = 24. Since 24 is divisible by 8, ans becomes 2, p becomes 3, and count becomes 1.
- count is incremented to 2, tmp = 2^3 = 8, p = 3. Since 3 is not divisible by 8, the loop continues.
- count is incremented to 3, tmp = 3^3 = 27, p = 3. Since 27 is greater than 3, the loop ends.

The final value of ans, which is 2, is printed.
