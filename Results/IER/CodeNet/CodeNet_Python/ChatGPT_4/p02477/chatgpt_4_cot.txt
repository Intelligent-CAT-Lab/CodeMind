The code takes two integers as input, separated by a space. These integers are assigned to variables a and b.
The input provided is '5 8', so a is assigned the value 5 and b is assigned the value 8.
The code then prints the product of a and b, which is 5 * 8.
The output will be the result of this multiplication, which is 40.
