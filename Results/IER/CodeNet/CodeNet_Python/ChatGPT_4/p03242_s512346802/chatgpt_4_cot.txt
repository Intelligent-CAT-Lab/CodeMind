<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with the string "119".
The code then performs a series of replace operations on the string n:
1. It replaces all occurrences of "1" with "x", resulting in the string "x19".
2. It replaces all occurrences of "9" with "1", resulting in the string "x11".
3. It replaces all occurrences of "x" with "9", resulting in the string "911".
Finally, the code prints the modified string.
<<<Output>>>
911
