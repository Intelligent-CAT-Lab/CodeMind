<<<Analysis>>>
The variables w, a, and b are initialized to 3, 2, and 6, respectively.
The code checks if the absolute difference between a and b is less than w.
The absolute difference between a and b is |2 - 6| = 4.
Since 4 is not less than w (which is 3), the code proceeds to the else block.
The code then prints the result of the expression abs(a-b) - w, which is 4 - 3 = 1.
