<<<Analysis>>>
The input string 'atcoder' is taken by the input() function.
The str() function is redundant here since input() already returns a string, but it does not affect the result.
The slicing operation [::2] is applied to the string, which means that we take every second character from the string, starting from the first character (index 0).
The slicing will result in 'atcoder' being transformed to 'acdr' because it takes the characters at indices 0, 2, 4, and 6.
Finally, the resulting string 'acdr' is printed.
<<<Output>>>
acdr
