<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized to 29.
The code first checks if the last digit of N is 9 by using the modulo operator (N % 10 == 9). Since 29 % 10 equals 9, the condition is true.
Because the first condition is true, the code prints "Yes" and does not check the other conditions.
The output will be "Yes" as the first condition is met.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
