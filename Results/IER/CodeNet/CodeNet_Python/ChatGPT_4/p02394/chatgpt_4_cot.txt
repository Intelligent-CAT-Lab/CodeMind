The input list `i` is initialized with the values [5, 4, 2, 2, 1].
The code then checks a series of conditions:
1. `i[2] + i[4] <= i[0]`: This checks if 2 (the third element) + 1 (the fifth element) is less than or equal to 5 (the first element). This is true (3 <= 5).
2. `i[2] - i[4] >= 0`: This checks if 2 (the third element) - 1 (the fifth element) is greater than or equal to 0. This is true (1 >= 0).
3. `i[3] + i[4] <= i[1]`: This checks if 2 (the fourth element) + 1 (the fifth element) is less than or equal to 4 (the second element). This is true (3 <= 4).
4. `i[3] - i[4] >= 0`: This checks if 2 (the fourth element) - 1 (the fifth element) is greater than or equal to 0. This is true (1 >= 0).

Since all conditions are true, the code will print "Yes".
