<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 5, which represents the number of iterations the loop will run.
The variable _debt is initialized to 100000, which represents the initial debt amount.
The code enters a loop that iterates 5 times.
In each iteration, the debt is increased by 5% (0.05), but since the debt must be a multiple of 1000, the increase is calculated by first multiplying the debt by 0.05, then multiplying by 0.001 to convert to 'thousands', then using math.ceil to round up to the nearest whole number, and finally multiplying by 1000 to get back to the unit of the debt.
The updated debt after each iteration is as follows:
1st iteration: _debt = 100000 + math.ceil(100000 * 0.05 * 0.001) * 1000
              _debt = 100000 + math.ceil(5) * 1000
              _debt = 100000 + 5 * 1000
              _debt = 105000
2nd iteration: _debt = 105000 + math.ceil(105000 * 0.05 * 0.001) * 1000
              _debt = 105000 + math.ceil(5.25) * 1000
              _debt = 105000 + 6 * 1000
              _debt = 111000
3rd iteration: _debt = 111000 + math.ceil(111000 * 0.05 * 0.001) * 1000
              _debt = 111000 + math.ceil(5.55) * 1000
              _debt = 111000 + 6 * 1000
              _debt = 117000
4th iteration: _debt = 117000 + math.ceil(117000 * 0.05 * 0.001) * 1000
              _debt = 117000 + math.ceil(5.85) * 1000
              _debt = 117000 + 6 * 1000
              _debt = 123000
5th iteration: _debt = 123000 + math.ceil(123000 * 0.05 * 0.001) * 1000
              _debt = 123000 + math.ceil(6.15) * 1000
              _debt = 123000 + 7 * 1000
              _debt = 130000
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of _debt, which is 130000.
<<<Output>>>
130000
