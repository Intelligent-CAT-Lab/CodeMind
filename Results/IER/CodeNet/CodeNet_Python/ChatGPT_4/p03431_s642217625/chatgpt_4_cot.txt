<<<Analysis>>>
The input provided is `2 4`, which means N is 2 and K is 4.

The `solve` function is called, and the first thing it does is check if K < N, which is not the case here (4 is not less than 2), so it continues.

The `combs_mod` function is called with parameters (4, 4, 998244353) to calculate the combinations from 4C0 to 4C4 modulo 998244353. This function first calculates the modular inverses of numbers from 1 to k (inclusive) and then uses these inverses to calculate the combinations.

The `solve` function then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to K (inclusive), which means it will consider r from 0 to 4.

For each r, it calculates b as K - r and dif as r - b. It then checks if dif is less than 0 or if r is less than N. If either is true, it continues to the next iteration of the loop.

If dif is 0, it calculates the combinations from (K-1)C0 to (K-1)C(K-1) using `combs_mod` again. It then adds com2[r] to ans and subtracts com2[N-2] from ans if N is greater than or equal to 2.

If dif is less than N but not 0, it adds com[r] - com[N-1-dif] to ans.

If dif is greater than or equal to N, it adds com[r] to ans.

After each addition or subtraction, ans is taken modulo 998244353.

Finally, the function returns ans, which is then printed.

Let's calculate the values:
- For r = 0, b = 4, dif = -4, so we continue to the next iteration.
- For r = 1, b = 3, dif = -2, so we continue to the next iteration.
- For r = 2, b = 2, dif = 0, so we calculate com2 and update ans.
  - com2 is calculated with (3, 3, 998244353), which gives [1, 3, 3, 1].
  - ans += com2[2] which is 3.
  - Since N >= 2, ans -= com2[N-2] which is com2[0], so ans -= 1.
  - ans is now 2.
- For r = 3, b = 1, dif = 2, which is less than N, so we add com[3] - com[N-1-dif] to ans.
  - com[3] is 4 and com[N-1-dif] is com[0], which is 1.
  - ans += (4 - 1) which is 3.
  - ans is now 5.
- For r = 4, b = 0, dif = 4, which is greater than N, so we add com[4] to ans.
  - com[4] is 1.
  - ans += 1.
  - ans is now 6.

After the loop, ans is 6, and this is the final result modulo 998244353.
