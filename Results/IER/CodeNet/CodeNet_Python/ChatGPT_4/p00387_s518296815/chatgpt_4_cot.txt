<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a and b are initialized to 3 and 5, respectively.
The expression (b + a - 1) // a calculates the smallest integer greater than or equal to b/a, which is essentially the ceiling of the division of b by a.
The calculation is as follows: (5 + 3 - 1) // 3 = 7 // 3 = 2, since // is the floor division operator in Python.
The code then prints the result of this calculation, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
