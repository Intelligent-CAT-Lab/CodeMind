<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized to 105.
The function `divisor(n)` is defined to find all divisors of a given number n and return the count of unique divisors.
The variable `i` is initialized to 1, and `answer` is initialized to 0.
The code enters a while loop that iterates over odd numbers from 1 to N (inclusive), because `i` is incremented by 2 in each iteration.
For each odd number `i`, the code calls the `divisor(i)` function to get the count of unique divisors of `i`.
If the count of divisors is exactly 8, the code increments `answer` by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of `answer`, which is the count of odd numbers up to 105 that have exactly 8 divisors.
The numbers up to 105 that are odd and have exactly 8 divisors are 9, 15, 21, 33, 49, 65, 77, 85, and 93.
Therefore, the final value of `answer` is 9.
