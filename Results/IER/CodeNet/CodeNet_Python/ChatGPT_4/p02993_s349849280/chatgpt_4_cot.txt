<<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized to the string '3776'.
The variable is_good is initialized to True, which will be used to determine if the string s is "good" or "bad".
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to the length of s minus 2 (since it checks pairs of characters).
For each index i in this range, it checks if the character at position i is the same as the character at position i+1.
If it finds two adjacent characters that are the same, it sets is_good to False and breaks out of the loop.
In the given string '3776', the characters at positions 1 and 2 are both '7', so is_good is set to False.
After the loop, the code checks the value of is_good. Since it is False, it prints 'Bad'.
<<<Output>>>
Bad
