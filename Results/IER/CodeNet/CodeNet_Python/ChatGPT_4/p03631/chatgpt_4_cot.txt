<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 575.
The variable i is calculated as the integer division of n by 100, which results in 5.
The variable j is calculated as the remainder of n divided by 10, which results in 5.
The code then checks if i is equal to j. Since both i and j are 5, the condition is true.
As a result, the code will print "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
