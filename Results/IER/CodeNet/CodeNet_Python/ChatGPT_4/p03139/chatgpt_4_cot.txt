<<<Analysis>>>
The variables N, A, and B are initialized to 10, 3, and 5, respectively, from the input.
The code prints two values separated by a space:
1. The first value is the minimum of A and B, which is min(3, 5). The minimum value is 3.
2. The second value is the maximum of 0 and (A+B-N), which is max(0, (3+5-10)). The expression (A+B-N) evaluates to -2, so the maximum between 0 and -2 is 0.

Therefore, the output will be the minimum of A and B, followed by the maximum of 0 and (A+B-N).
