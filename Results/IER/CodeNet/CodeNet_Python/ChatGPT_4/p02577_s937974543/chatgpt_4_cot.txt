<<<Analysis>>>
The input '123456789' is converted into a list of characters ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9'].
The variable ans is initialized to 0.
The code enters a loop that iterates over the indices of the list n.
For each index i, the corresponding character in the list n is converted to an integer and added to ans.
The sum of the digits is calculated as follows: 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9 = 45.
After the loop, the code checks if the sum ans is divisible by 9.
Since 45 is divisible by 9, the condition ans%9==0 is True.
Therefore, the code will print 'Yes'.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
