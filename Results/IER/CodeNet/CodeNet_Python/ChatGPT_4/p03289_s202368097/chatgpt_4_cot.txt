<<<Analysis>>>
The variable word is initialized to the string 'AtCoder'.
The variable cflg is initialized to True, which will be used as a flag to determine if the word meets certain conditions.
The code checks if the first character of word is not 'A'. Since the first character is 'A', it does not set cflg to False.
Next, the code checks if there is exactly one 'C' in the substring from the third character to the second to last character. Since there is exactly one 'C' in 'Code', this condition is satisfied and cflg remains True.
The code then initializes a variable cnt to 0 and enters a loop to count the number of uppercase letters in the word starting from the second character. There is one uppercase letter 'C', so cnt is incremented to 1.
After the loop, the code checks if cnt is not equal to 1. Since cnt is 1, cflg remains True.
Finally, the code checks if cflg is True. Since it is, the code prints 'AC'.
<<<Output>>>
AC
