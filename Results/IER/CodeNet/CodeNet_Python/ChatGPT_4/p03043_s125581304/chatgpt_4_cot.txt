<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a custom input function that reads a line from standard input and strips it of any trailing whitespace. It also defines a lambda function `mi` that maps the input to integers.

The variables N and K are initialized to 3 and 10, respectively.

The variable `ans` is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of probabilities.

The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 3.

For each number i in this range, it checks if i is greater than or equal to K. If it is, it increments `ans` by 1. Since K is 10, none of the numbers from 1 to 3 will satisfy this condition.

If i is less than K, the code calculates the probability of reaching at least K by repeatedly doubling i. It does this by taking the ceiling of the base 2 logarithm of K/i, which gives the number of times i needs to be doubled to exceed or equal K. It then raises 1/2 to this power to get the probability, and adds this to `ans`.

For i = 1, the probability is pow(1/2, math.ceil(math.log2(10/1))) = pow(1/2, 4) = 1/16.
For i = 2, the probability is pow(1/2, math.ceil(math.log2(10/2))) = pow(1/2, 3) = 1/8.
For i = 3, the probability is pow(1/2, math.ceil(math.log2(10/3))) = pow(1/2, 3) = 1/8.

The total `ans` is the sum of these probabilities: 1/16 + 1/8 + 1/8 = 1/16 + 2/8 = 1/16 + 1/4 = 1/16 + 4/16 = 5/16.

Finally, the code prints the value of `ans` divided by N, which is 5/16 divided by 3.

The output is therefore 5/16 / 3 = 5/48, which in decimal form is approximately 0.10416666666666667.
