<<<Analysis>>>
The input string '1 3 8' is split into a list of strings ['1', '3', '8'] and stored in the variable s.
The if statement compares the strings in the list lexicographically, not numerically, because the elements of s are strings and not integers.
The comparison '1' < '3' is True and '3' < '8' is also True.
Since both conditions are True, the if block will execute and 'Yes' will be printed.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
