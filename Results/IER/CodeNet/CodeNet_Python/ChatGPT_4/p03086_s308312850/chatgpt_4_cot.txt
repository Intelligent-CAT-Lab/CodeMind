<<<Analysis>>>
The variable S is initialized to the string "ATCODER".
The list ls is created from the string S.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to store the maximum length of a substring containing only 'A', 'T', 'C', or 'G'.
The code enters a nested loop where the outer loop iterates over the indices of the list ls and the inner loop iterates from the current index of the outer loop to the end of the list.
For each character in the substring starting from index i, the code checks if it is one of 'A', 'T', 'C', or 'G'.
If it is, cnt is incremented by 1.
If the character is not one of 'A', 'T', 'C', or 'G', or if it is the last character in the list, the current value of cnt is compared with ans, and ans is updated to the maximum of the two.
The inner loop breaks if a character not in ['A', 'T', 'C', 'G'] is encountered.
After both loops finish, the code prints the final value of ans, which is the length of the longest substring containing only 'A', 'T', 'C', or 'G'.
In the given string "ATCODER", the longest such substring is "ATC" which has a length of 3.
