<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function `solve()` which reads a string from the standard input, decodes it from 'utf-8', and removes any trailing newlines or carriage returns.
The string `s` is then compared to various patterns to determine the output:
- If `s` is exactly "RRR", it prints 3.
- If `s` is "RRS" or "SRR", it prints 2.
- If `s` contains no "R" characters (i.e., `s.count("R")` is 0), it prints 0.
- For any other case, it prints 1.

Since the input is `RRS`, the condition `elif s == "RRS" or s == "SRR":` is met, and the function will print 2.

The `if __name__ == '__main__':` block checks if the script is being run directly (not imported as a module), and if so, it calls the `solve()` function.

Given the input `RRS`, the output will be 2.
