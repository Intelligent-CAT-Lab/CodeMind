<<<Analysis>>>
The variables r, d, and x are initialized to 2, 10, and 20, respectively.
The code enters a loop that will iterate 10 times, from 1 to 10 (inclusive).
In each iteration, the value of x is updated to be r times the current x minus d.
The updated value of x is printed in each iteration.

Let's calculate the value of x for each iteration:
1. x = 2 * 20 - 10 = 40 - 10 = 30
2. x = 2 * 30 - 10 = 60 - 10 = 50
3. x = 2 * 50 - 10 = 100 - 10 = 90
4. x = 2 * 90 - 10 = 180 - 10 = 170
5. x = 2 * 170 - 10 = 340 - 10 = 330
6. x = 2 * 330 - 10 = 660 - 10 = 650
7. x = 2 * 650 - 10 = 1300 - 10 = 1290
8. x = 2 * 1290 - 10 = 2580 - 10 = 2570
9. x = 2 * 2570 - 10 = 5140 - 10 = 5130
10. x = 2 * 5130 - 10 = 10260 - 10 = 10250

These values will be printed one per line.
