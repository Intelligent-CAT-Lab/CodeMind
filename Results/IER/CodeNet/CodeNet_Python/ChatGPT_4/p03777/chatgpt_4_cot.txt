<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a and b are initialized with the input values 'H' and 'H', respectively.
The first if condition checks if a is equal to 'H', which is true.
Since the condition is true, the code prints the value of b, which is also 'H'.
The else block is not executed because the if condition was met.
<<<Output>>>
H
