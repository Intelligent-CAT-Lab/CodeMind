<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines several functions and constants, but only a few of them are used in the main part of the code. The input is read using the LI() function, which reads a line of input, splits it into a list of strings, and then converts each string to an integer. The input `3 7` sets K to 3 and X to 7.

The code then enters a loop that starts at `max(X-K+1, -1000000)` and ends at `min(X+K, 1000000)`. For the given input, this translates to a loop starting at `max(7-3+1, -1000000)` which is `max(5, -1000000)` which is 5, and ending at `min(7+3, 1000000)` which is `min(10, 1000000)` which is 10. However, since the range in Python is non-inclusive on the upper bound, the loop will iterate up to but not including 10.

The loop will print each number from 5 to 9 followed by a space, and after the loop, it prints an empty string to move to the next line.
