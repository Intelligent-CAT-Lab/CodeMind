<<<Analysis>>>
The variables n and m are initialized to 3 and 9, respectively.
The variable MOD is set to 10**9+7, which is a large prime number often used for modulo operations in competitive programming to avoid integer overflow.

The function sum(a, d, n) is defined to calculate the sum of an arithmetic progression with the first term a, common difference d, and n terms. The formula used is the standard arithmetic progression sum formula.

The main function is then executed with the input values for n and m.

Since n is not equal to 1, the else block is executed.

The sum function is called with the following parameters:
- a = m + 1, which is 9 + 1 = 10
- d = -n + 1, which is -3 + 1 = -2
- n = 1 + m // (n - 1), which is 1 + 9 // (3 - 1) = 1 + 9 // 2 = 1 + 4 = 5

The sum function thus calculates the sum of the arithmetic progression with the first term 10, common difference -2, and 5 terms. The sum is 5 * (2 * 10 + (5 - 1) * -2) // 2 = 5 * (20 - 8) // 2 = 5 * 12 // 2 = 30.

The result of the sum function is then multiplied by 2 and reduced by (m + 1), which is 30 * 2 - 10 = 60 - 10 = 50.

Finally, the result is taken modulo MOD, which is 50 % (10**9+7) = 50.

The output of the code is therefore 50.
