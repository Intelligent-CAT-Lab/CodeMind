<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a main function that reads two integers H and W, which represent the height and width of a grid, respectively. The input provided is `4 5`, so H is 4 and W is 5.
The main function then prints the result of `ceil(H*W/2)` if neither H nor W is equal to 1. Otherwise, it prints 1.
Since neither H nor W is 1, the code will calculate `ceil(4*5/2)`, which is `ceil(20/2)` or `ceil(10)`.
The `ceil` function rounds up to the nearest integer, but since 10 is already an integer, it remains 10.
Therefore, the output will be 10.
