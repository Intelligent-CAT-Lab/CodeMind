<<<Analysis>>>
The variables n and k are initialized to 1 and 1, respectively.
The variables l and r are initialized to 0 and k+1, which is 2 in this case.
The code enters a while loop that continues as long as r - l > 1.
Inside the loop, m is calculated as the integer division of l + r, which is (0 + 2) // 2 = 1 in the first iteration.
The variable res is set to the value of m, which is 1.
The variable t is also set to the value of m, which is 1.
Since n is 1, the for loop is not executed because the range(n-1) is range(0), which has no iterations.
The if condition checks if res is greater than k. Since res equals k (both are 1), the else block is executed, setting l to m.
The while loop condition is checked again, and since r - l is now 1 (2 - 1), the loop exits.
The final value of l, which is 1, is printed.
