<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to the integer value of the input, which is 67.
The code then checks if n is within the range of ASCII values for uppercase letters (65 to 90).
Since 67 falls within this range, the condition is true.
Therefore, the code prints "1" and does not check the other conditions.
<<<Output>>>
