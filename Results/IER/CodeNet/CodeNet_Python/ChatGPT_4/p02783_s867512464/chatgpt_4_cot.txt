<<<Analysis>>>
The variables h and a are initialized with the input values '10' and '4', respectively, and then converted to integers.
The code checks if h is divisible by a without any remainder using the modulo operator (%).
Since 10 % 4 equals 2, which is not 0, the condition h % a == 0 is False.
Therefore, the else block is executed, and ans is calculated as the integer division of h by a plus 1, which is int(10 // 4 + 1).
The integer division 10 // 4 equals 2, and adding 1 gives us 3.
The code then prints the value of ans, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>
3
