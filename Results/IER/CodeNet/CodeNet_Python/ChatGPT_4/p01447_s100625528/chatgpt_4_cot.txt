<<<Analysis>>>
The code imports the math module, which provides access to mathematical functions.
The input is read as a string and converted to an integer.
The math.log function is used to calculate the natural logarithm of the input number, which is 8 in this case.
The result of math.log(8) is then divided by math.log(3) to calculate the logarithm base 3 of the number 8.
The math.ceil function is used to round up the result to the nearest integer.
The logarithm base 3 of 8 is between 1 and 2, specifically around 1.8928.
When rounded up using math.ceil, the result is 2.
The code then prints the result, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
