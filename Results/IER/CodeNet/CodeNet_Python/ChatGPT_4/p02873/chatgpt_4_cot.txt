<<<Analysis>>>
The input string S is initialized to "<>>".
The length of S is 3, so n is set to 4.
Two lists, sho and dai, are initialized with 4 zeros each.

The first for loop iterates over the characters in S and their indices.
For each character, if it is ">", sho[i] is set to 0, otherwise, it is set to sho[i-1] + 1.
After the first loop, sho will be [0, 1, 0, 0].

The second for loop iterates over the characters in S in reverse order and their reversed indices.
For each character, if it is "<", dai[i] is set to 0, otherwise, it is set to dai[i+1] + 1.
After the second loop, dai will be [0, 0, 1, 2].

The seq list is created by taking the maximum of corresponding elements from sho and dai.
seq will be [max(0,0), max(1,0), max(0,1), max(0,2)], which is [0, 1, 1, 2].

The sum of the elements in seq is calculated and printed, which is 0 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 4.
