<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a, b, c, and k are initialized to 2, 1, 1, and 3, respectively.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to store the final answer.
The code then checks if k is less than or equal to a. Since k is 3 and a is 2, this condition is false.
Next, the code checks if k is less than or equal to (a+b). Since (a+b) is 3 and k is also 3, this condition is true.
Because the second condition is true, ans is set to the value of a, which is 2.
The code does not execute the else block because the previous condition was met.
Finally, the code prints the value of ans, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
