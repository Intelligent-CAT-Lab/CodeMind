<<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized with the string '1905'.
The variable a is assigned the value of the first two characters of s converted to an integer, which is 19.
The variable b is assigned the value of the last two characters of s converted to an integer, which is 5.

The code then checks the following conditions:
- If both a and b are between 1 and 12, it prints "AMBIGUOUS".
- If a is between 1 and 12 and b is not between 1 and 12, it prints "MMYY".
- If a is not between 1 and 12 and b is between 1 and 12, it prints "YYMM".
- If neither a nor b is between 1 and 12, it prints "NA".

In this case, a is 19, which is not between 1 and 12, and b is 5, which is between 1 and 12. Therefore, the condition for "YYMM" is met.

<<<Output>>>
YYMM
