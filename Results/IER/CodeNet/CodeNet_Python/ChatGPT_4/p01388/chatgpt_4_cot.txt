<<<Analysis>>>
The input string is "KUPCkupcKUPC".
The code counts the occurrences of the uppercase letters 'K', 'U', 'P', and 'C' in the input string.
The counts are as follows:
- K appears 3 times.
- U appears 3 times.
- P appears 3 times.
- C appears 3 times.
The code then prints the minimum of these counts, which is 3, since all the letters 'K', 'U', 'P', and 'C' appear the same number of times (3 times each).
<<<Output>>>
3
