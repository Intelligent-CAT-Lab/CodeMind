<<<Analysis>>>
The input string is `mmemewwemeww`.
The function `isCat` is called with the input string.
The function checks if the string is empty, which it is not.
The function then checks if the first character is 'm' and the last character is 'w', which is true for the input string.
The function initializes a counter `c` to 0 and an index `i` to 0.
The function enters a loop to iterate through the characters of the string from the second character to the second-to-last character.
The loop increments `c` for every 'm' and decrements `c` for every 'w'.
The loop breaks when `c` becomes 0, which happens after the substring "mmeme" (i.e., at index 4).
The function checks if the character following the substring where `c` became 0 is 'e', which is true.
The function then recursively calls `isCat` on the substring before 'e' (which is "mme") and the substring after 'e' (which is "wwemeww").
For the substring "mme", the function will return False because it does not start with 'm' and end with 'w'.
Since the function returns False for the substring "mme", the overall result of `isCat` will be False.
The main part of the code will then print "Rabbit" because `isCat` returned False.
