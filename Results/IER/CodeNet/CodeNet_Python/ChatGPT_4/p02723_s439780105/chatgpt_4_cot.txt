<<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized to the string 'sippuu'.
The code checks if the third character is the same as the fourth character and if the fifth character is the same as the sixth character in the string s.
In the given string 'sippuu', the third and fourth characters are 'p' and 'p', which are the same, and the fifth and sixth characters are 'u' and 'u', which are also the same.
Since both conditions are true, the variable ans is set to 'Yes'.
Finally, the code prints the value of ans, which is 'Yes'.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
