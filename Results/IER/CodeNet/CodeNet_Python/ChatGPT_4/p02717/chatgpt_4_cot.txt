<<<Analysis>>>
The variables X, Y, and Z are initialized to 1, 2, and 3, respectively, from the input.
The variables A, B, and C are initially set to the values of X, Y, and Z, respectively, so A=1, B=2, C=3.
Then, the values of A, B, and C are reassigned as follows:
B is set to the value of X, so B=1.
C is set to the value of Y, so C=2.
A is set to the value of Z, so A=3.
The final values of A, B, and C are 3, 1, and 2, respectively.
The code prints the values of A, B, and C in that order.
<<<Output>>>
