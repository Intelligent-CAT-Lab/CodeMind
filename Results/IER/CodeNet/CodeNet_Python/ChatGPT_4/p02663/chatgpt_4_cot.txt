<<<Analysis>>>
The variables h1, m1, h2, m2, and k are initialized to 10, 0, 15, 0, and 30, respectively.
The code converts the start time (h1:m1) and the end time (h2:m2) to minutes by multiplying the hours by 60 and adding the minutes. This results in t1 being 600 (10*60 + 0) and t2 being 900 (15*60 + 0).
The difference between t2 and t1 is calculated, which is 900 - 600 = 300 minutes.
The variable k, which represents the duration to subtract, is then subtracted from this difference, resulting in 300 - 30 = 270 minutes.
Finally, the code prints the result, which is 270.
<<<Output>>>
270
