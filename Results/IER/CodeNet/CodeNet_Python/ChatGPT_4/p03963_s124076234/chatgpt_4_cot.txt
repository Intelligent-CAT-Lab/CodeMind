<<<Analysis>>>
The variables N and K are initialized to 2 and 2, respectively.
The code calculates K multiplied by (K-1) raised to the power of (N-1).
Since K is 2, (K-1) is 1.
(N-1) is also 1, since N is 2.
Therefore, the expression simplifies to 2 * (1**1), which is 2 * 1.
The final result is 2.
<<<Output>>>
