<<<Analysis>>>
The function MI() is defined to return a map object that converts each item in the input to an integer.
The variables N, X, and T are initialized with the values 20, 12, and 6, respectively, by calling the MI() function and unpacking the returned map object.
The code then checks if N is not divisible by X using the modulo operator. Since 20 % 12 is 8, which is not equal to 0, the condition is true.
The code executes the first branch of the if statement, calculating the answer as (N // X + 1) * T. Since 20 // 12 is 1, the calculation is (1 + 1) * 6, which equals 12.
The code then prints the value of ans, which is 12.
<<<Output>>>
12
