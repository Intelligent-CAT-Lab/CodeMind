<<<Analysis>>>
The variables X and Y are initialized to 2 and 1, respectively.
The code checks the absolute difference between X and Y using the abs() function.
The absolute difference between 2 and 1 is 1.
Since 1 is not greater than or equal to 2, the condition abs(X-Y) >= 2 is False.
Therefore, the code will execute the else block and print 'Brown'.
<<<Output>>>
Brown
