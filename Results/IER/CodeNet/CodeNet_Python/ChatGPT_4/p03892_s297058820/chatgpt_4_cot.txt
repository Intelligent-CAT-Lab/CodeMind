The variables a, b, c, and d are initialized with the values 1, 1, 3, and 4, respectively, from the input.
The variable x is calculated as the absolute difference between c and a, which is abs(3-1) = 2.
The variable y is calculated as the absolute difference between d and b, which is abs(4-1) = 3.
The code checks if either x or y is 0. Since neither is 0, it does not print 0 or exit the program.
The gcd function is defined to calculate the greatest common divisor of two numbers using recursion.
The gcd of x and y is calculated using the gcd function, which is gcd(2,3). Since 3 is not divisible by 2, the function calls itself with gcd(3, 2 % 3), which is gcd(3, 2). Now, since 2 is not divisible by 3, the function calls itself with gcd(2, 3 % 2), which is gcd(2, 1). Finally, since 1 is divisible by 2, the function returns 1 as the gcd.
The value of e is set to 1, which is the gcd of x and y.
The values of x and y are divided by e, so x becomes 2/1 = 2 and y becomes 3/1 = 3.
The final print statement calculates (x+y-1) * e, which is (2+3-1) * 1 = 4 * 1 = 4.
The output of the code is 4.
