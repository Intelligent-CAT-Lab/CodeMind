<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a, t, and r are initialized to 180, 120, and 90, respectively, from the input.
The variable ans is calculated by multiplying r and t, then dividing by a. This results in ans = 90 * 120 / 180.
The calculation simplifies to ans = 1 * 120 / 2, which equals 60.
The code then prints the value of ans formatted to 6 decimal places, which will be 60.000000.
<<<Output>>>
60.000000
