<<<Analysis>>>
The variable x is initialized to 7.
The variable n is calculated as x divided by 11 using integer division, which results in n being 0 because 7//11 is 0.
x is updated by subtracting 11*n, which is 0, so x remains 7.
The first if condition checks if x is 0, which it is not, so it is skipped.
The elif condition checks if x is between 1 and 6 inclusive. Since x is 7, this condition is also skipped.
The code then proceeds to the else block, which executes print(2+2*n).
Since n is 0, the expression evaluates to 2+2*0, which is 2.
The code prints the value 2.
