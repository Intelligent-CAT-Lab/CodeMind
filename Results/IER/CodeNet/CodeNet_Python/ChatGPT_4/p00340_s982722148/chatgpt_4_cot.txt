<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a, b, c, and d are initialized to 1, 1, 3, and 4, respectively.
The code then checks if a is equal to b and c is equal to d. In this case, a is equal to b, but c is not equal to d, so this condition is false.
Next, the code checks if a is equal to c and b is equal to d. Since a is not equal to c and b is not equal to d, this condition is also false.
Then, the code checks if a is equal to d and b is equal to c. Since a is not equal to d and b is not equal to c, this condition is false as well.
Since none of the conditions are met, the code reaches the else block and prints 'no'.
<<<Output>>>
no
