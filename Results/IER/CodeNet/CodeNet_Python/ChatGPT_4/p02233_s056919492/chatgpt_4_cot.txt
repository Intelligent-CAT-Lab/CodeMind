<<<Analysis>>>
The input is `3`, which means we want to calculate the 3rd Fibonacci number using the provided `fib` function.
The `fib` function is a recursive function that uses memoization to store previously calculated Fibonacci numbers in a dictionary called `memo` to avoid redundant calculations.
When `fib(3)` is called, the function checks if `n` is 0 or 1. Since it's not, it then checks if `n` is in the `memo` dictionary. It's not there either since this is the first call, so it proceeds to the `else` block.
In the `else` block, it calls `fib(2)` and `fib(1)`.
`fib(2)` is not in the memo, so it calls `fib(1)` and `fib(0)`, both of which return 1, and stores `fib(2)` in the memo as 2.
Now that `fib(2)` is calculated, the original call `fib(3)` now calculates `fib(1)` (which is 1) and adds it to `fib(2)` (which is 2), resulting in 3.
The result of `fib(3)` is then returned and printed, which is 3.
