<<<Analysis>>>
The input '8' is read as a string and then converted to an integer using the int() function.
The integer value 8 is then divided by 3 using integer division (//), which means it will divide and return the integer quotient without the remainder.
The result of 8 // 3 is 2, because 3 goes into 8 twice with a remainder of 2, but the remainder is discarded in integer division.
The result, which is 2, is then printed out.
<<<Output>>>
2
