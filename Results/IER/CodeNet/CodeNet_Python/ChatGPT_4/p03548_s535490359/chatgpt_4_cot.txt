<<<Analysis>>>
The variables X, Y, and Z are initialized to 13, 3, and 1, respectively.
The expression `(X-Z)//(Y+Z)` calculates how many times the length of Y plus Z fits into the length X minus Z.
First, it subtracts Z from X, which results in `13 - 1 = 12`.
Then, it adds Y to Z, which results in `3 + 1 = 4`.
Finally, it performs integer division of the two results: `12 // 4 = 3`.
The code prints the result of this calculation, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>
3
