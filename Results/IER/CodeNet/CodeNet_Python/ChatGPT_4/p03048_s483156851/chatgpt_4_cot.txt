<<<Analysis>>>
The variables r, g, b, and n are initialized to 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively.
A dictionary named mem is created to memoize the results of the recursive function dfs to avoid redundant calculations.
The dfs function is defined to calculate the number of ways to combine the elements of ais (which is a list containing r, g, b) to sum up to tot, which is initially n.
The function first checks if tot is negative, in which case it returns 0 because we cannot have a negative total.
If i equals the length of ais, it means we've considered all elements, and we return 1 if tot is 0 (meaning we've found a valid combination), otherwise 0.
If i is the second to last index, we check if the remaining tot is non-negative and divisible by the last element of ais. If so, we return 1, otherwise 0.
The key (i, tot) is used to check if the current state has already been computed.
The function then tries two possibilities: not taking the current element ais[i] (by calling dfs with i+1 and the same tot) and taking the current element (by decreasing tot by ais[i] and calling dfs with i+1).
This process is repeated in a loop until tot is no longer positive.
The memoization dictionary mem is updated with the cumulative number of ways for the current state.
Finally, the function returns the cumulative number of ways to reach the total using the elements of ais.

The initial call to dfs is with i=0 and tot=n, which is 4 in this case.
The function will explore all combinations of 1, 2, and 3 that sum up to 4.
The possible combinations are:
- 1+1+1+1 (using four 1's)
- 1+1+2 (using two 1's and one 2)
- 2+2 (using two 2's)
- 1+3 (using one 1 and one 3)

There are no other combinations that sum up to 4 using 1, 2, and 3. Therefore, there are 4 ways in total.
