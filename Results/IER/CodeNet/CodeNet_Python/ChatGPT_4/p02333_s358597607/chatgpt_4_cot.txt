<<<Analysis>>>
The variables N and K are initialized to 4 and 3, respectively.
MOD is set to 10^9 + 7, which is a large prime number often used for modulo operations in competitive programming to avoid integer overflow.

The code then initializes lists for factorial, inverse, and invere_base with base cases for 0 and 1.

The loop from 2 to K (inclusive) populates the factorial list with factorial values modulo MOD, the invere_base list with base values for calculating modular inverses, and the inverse list with the actual modular inverses.

The function nCr(n, r) is defined to calculate the combination of n choose r under modulo MOD using Fermat's little theorem.

The initial value of ans is set to K^N modulo MOD, which is 3^4 = 81 modulo MOD.

The loop from 1 to K (inclusive) calculates the inclusion-exclusion principle to find the final answer. It iterates through all r from 1 to K and subtracts the terms from ans using the nCr function and modular exponentiation.

For r = 1:
ans -= ((-1) ** ((1 % 2) ^ 1)) * nCr(3, 1) * pow(3 - 1, 4, MOD) % MOD
ans -= (-1) * 3 * 2^4 % MOD
ans -= (-1) * 3 * 16 % MOD
ans -= (-48) % MOD
ans -= MOD - 48

For r = 2:
ans -= ((-1) ** ((2 % 2) ^ 1)) * nCr(3, 2) * pow(3 - 2, 4, MOD) % MOD
ans -= 1 * 3 * 1^4 % MOD
ans -= 3 % MOD

For r = 3:
ans -= ((-1) ** ((3 % 2) ^ 1)) * nCr(3, 3) * pow(3 - 3, 4, MOD) % MOD
ans -= (-1) * 1 * 0^4 % MOD
ans -= 0 % MOD (since anything to the power of 0 is 1, and 0 times anything is 0)

Finally, the answer is printed modulo MOD.

Calculating the values:
ans = 81 initially
For r = 1: ans -= MOD - 48
For r = 2: ans -= 3
For r = 3: ans -= 0

The final answer is (81 - (MOD - 48) - 3) % MOD.

Let's calculate the final answer:
ans = (81 + 48 - 3) % MOD
ans = 126 % MOD
ans = 126 (since 126 is less than MOD)

<<<Output>>>
126
