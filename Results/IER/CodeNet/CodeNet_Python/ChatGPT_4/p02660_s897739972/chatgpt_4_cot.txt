<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 24.
The function factorization is defined to factorize the given number n into its prime factors and count the number of times each prime factor appears.
The function starts by creating an empty list arr to store the prime factors and their counts.
It then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to the square root of n (rounded down to the nearest integer), checking if the current number i is a factor of n.
If i is a factor, it counts how many times i divides n (stored in cnt) and divides n by i that many times, updating temp each time.
Each prime factor and its count are appended to arr as a list [i, cnt].
After the loop, if temp is not 1, it means there is a remaining prime factor that is greater than the square root of n, and it is added to arr with a count of 1.
If arr is still empty (which means n is a prime number), it adds n itself with a count of 1 to arr.
The function returns arr, which now contains the prime factorization of n.
Since n is not 1, the program proceeds to calculate the answer.
The factorization of 24 is calculated, which results in arr being [[2, 3], [3, 1]] because 24 = 2^3 * 3^1.
The program then initializes ans to 0 and enters a loop to calculate the sum of the maximum power of each prime factor that can be used in a triangular number formula.
For the prime factor 2 with a count of 3, the formula (-1+(1+8*3)**(0.5))/2 is used to find the maximum power, which is 2.
For the prime factor 3 with a count of 1, the formula (-1+(1+8*1)**(0.5))/2 is used to find the maximum power, which is 1.
The sum of these maximum powers is 2 + 1 = 3, which is stored in ans.
The program prints the value of ans, which is 3.
