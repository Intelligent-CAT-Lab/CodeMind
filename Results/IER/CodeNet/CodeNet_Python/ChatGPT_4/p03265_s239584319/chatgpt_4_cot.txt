The code is designed to calculate the coordinates of a rectangle given two diagonal points. It uses the numpy library to handle vector operations.

1. The input `0 0 0 1` is read and split into integers x1, y1, x2, y2, which are 0, 0, 0, and 1, respectively.
2. Two numpy arrays p1 and p2 are created to represent the points (0, 0) and (0, 1).
3. The vector v1 from p1 to p2 is calculated by subtracting p1 from p2, resulting in the vector (0, 1).
4. The vector v2 is calculated as the perpendicular vector to v1 by swapping the elements of v1 and negating the first element, resulting in the vector (-1, 0).
5. The point p3 is calculated by adding the vector v2 to p2, resulting in the point (0 + (-1), 1 + 0) which is (-1, 1).
6. The point p4 is calculated by adding the negated vector v1 to p3, resulting in the point (-1 + 0, 1 + (-1)) which is (-1, 0).
7. The coordinates of p3 and p4 are concatenated into a list, converted to strings, and joined with spaces to form the final output.

The output will be the coordinates of points p3 and p4, which are the remaining two corners of the rectangle.
