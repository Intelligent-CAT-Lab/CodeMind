<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a physics simulation for a projectile motion problem, where it checks if it's possible to throw an object from the origin to a point (X, Y) without hitting any obstacles. The input consists of the number of obstacles N, the initial velocity V, and the target coordinates (X, Y). Since N is 0 in the given input, there are no obstacles to consider.

The function `calc(vy, t)` calculates the y-coordinate of the projectile at time t, given the initial y-velocity vy.
The function `cmp(lb, ub, x)` compares a value x with a range defined by lb (lower bound) and ub (upper bound), with a small epsilon to account for floating-point precision issues.
The function `check(qx, qy)` checks if it's possible to hit the target (qx, qy) without hitting any obstacles.

Given the input `0 7 3 1`, the variables are set as follows:
- N (number of obstacles) = 0
- V (initial velocity) = 7
- X (target x-coordinate) = 3
- Y (target y-coordinate) = 1

Since there are no obstacles, the `obstacles` list remains empty.

The `check` function is called with the target coordinates (X, Y). Since qx is 0 (the target is directly above the origin), the function immediately returns 0, indicating that it's not possible to hit the target without hitting obstacles (although there are no obstacles in this case).

The code then checks if `check(X, Y)` returns 1 (which it doesn't), and since there are no obstacles, it doesn't enter the loop to check individual obstacles.

Finally, since all checks have failed, the code prints 'No'.

No
