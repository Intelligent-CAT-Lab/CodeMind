<<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized with the string '+-++'.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the result.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each character in the string s.
For each character i in the string:
- If i is '+', it increases the value of ans by 1.
- If i is '-', it decreases the value of ans by 1.
The sequence of operations based on the input string '+-++' is as follows:
1. i = '+', ans = 0 + 1 = 1
2. i = '-', ans = 1 - 1 = 0
3. i = '+', ans = 0 + 1 = 1
4. i = '+', ans = 1 + 1 = 2
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 2.
