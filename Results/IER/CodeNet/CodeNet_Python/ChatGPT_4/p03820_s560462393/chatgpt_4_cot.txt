<<<Analysis>>>
The input is `2 1`, which means N is 2 and K is 1.

The code defines a function `cmb` for fast computation of combinations (n choose r) modulo `mod`.

The `mod` is set to 10^9 + 7.

The code initializes lists `g1`, `g2`, and `inverse` for the purpose of calculating combinations and their modular inverses.

The loop populates `g1` with factorial values modulo `mod`, `inverse` with modular inverses, and `g2` with the inverse factorial values modulo `mod`.

After the input is read, the code checks if N is 1. If so, it prints 1. This is not the case here.

Next, it checks if K is 1. Since K is indeed 1, the code executes the `elif K==1:` block.

Inside this block, it calculates `pow(2, N-2, mod)` which is `pow(2, 0, mod)` since N is 2. This evaluates to 1 because 2^0 is 1.

Therefore, the output will be 1.
