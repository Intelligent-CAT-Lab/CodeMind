<<<Analysis>>>
The variables A, B, and K are initialized to 3, 8, and 2, respectively.
The variable A_th is calculated. Since A+K (3+2=5) is not greater than B+1 (8+1=9), A_th is set to A+K, which is 5.
A_l is a list of numbers from A to A_th (not including A_th), which is [3, 4].
The variable B_th is calculated. Since B-K (8-2=6) is greater than A-1 (3-1=2), B_th is set to B-K+1, which is 7.
B_l is a list of numbers from B_th to B+1 (not including B+1), which is [7, 8].
X_l is the sorted set of the union of A_l and B_l, which results in [3, 4, 7, 8].
The code then prints each element in X_l on a separate line.
