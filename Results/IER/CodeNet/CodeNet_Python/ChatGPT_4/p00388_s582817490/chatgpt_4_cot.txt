<<<Analysis>>>
The variable H, A, and B are initialized to 100, 2, and 4, respectively.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of divisors of H within the range [A, B].
The code then enters a loop that iterates from A to B (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers 2, 3, and 4.
For each number i in this range, it checks if H is divisible by i (i.e., H % i == 0).
If H is divisible by i, it increments ans by 1.
The condition is met when i is 2 and 4, as 100 is divisible by both 2 and 4.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
