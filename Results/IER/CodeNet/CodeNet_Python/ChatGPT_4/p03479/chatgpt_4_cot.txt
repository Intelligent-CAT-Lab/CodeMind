<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a and b are initialized to 3 and 20, respectively.
The variable count is initialized to 1, which will be used to count the number of times the value of x can be doubled without exceeding b.
The variable x is initialized to the value of a, which is 3.
The code enters a while loop that continues as long as x multiplied by 2 is less than or equal to b.
In each iteration of the loop, x is doubled, and count is incremented by 1.
The loop runs as follows:
- First iteration: x = 3 * 2 = 6 (count becomes 2)
- Second iteration: x = 6 * 2 = 12 (count becomes 3)
- Third iteration: x = 12 * 2 = 24, but since 24 is greater than 20, the loop stops and does not enter this iteration.
The loop stops after the second iteration because the next value of x (24) would exceed b (20).
The final value of count, which is 3, is printed.
