<<<Analysis>>>
The input '36' is converted into a list of integers [3, 6].
The variable n is set to the length of this list, which is 2.
A list of lists named dp is created with n+1 elements, each being [0, 1]. So initially, dp = [[0, 1], [0, 1], [0, 1]].
The code enters a loop that iterates over the range of n (which is 2 in this case).

For i = 0 (first iteration):
- dp[1][0] is set to the minimum of dp[0][0] + x[0] (which is 0 + 3 = 3) and dp[0][1] + 10 - x[0] (which is 1 + 10 - 3 = 8). So dp[1][0] becomes 3.
- dp[1][1] is set to the minimum of dp[0][0] + x[0] + 1 (which is 0 + 3 + 1 = 4) and dp[0][1] + 9 - x[0] (which is 1 + 9 - 3 = 7). So dp[1][1] becomes 4.

For i = 1 (second iteration):
- dp[2][0] is set to the minimum of dp[1][0] + x[1] (which is 3 + 6 = 9) and dp[1][1] + 10 - x[1] (which is 4 + 10 - 6 = 8). So dp[2][0] becomes 8.
- dp[2][1] is set to the minimum of dp[1][0] + x[1] + 1 (which is 3 + 6 + 1 = 10) and dp[1][1] + 9 - x[1] (which is 4 + 9 - 6 = 7). So dp[2][1] becomes 7.

After the loop, the code prints dp[n][0], which is dp[2][0] and its value is 8.
