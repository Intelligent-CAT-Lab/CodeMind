<<<Analysis>>>
The variables x, a, and b are initialized to 5, 2, and 7, respectively.
The variable p is calculated as the absolute difference between x and a, which is abs(5-2) = 3.
The variable q is calculated as the absolute difference between x and b, which is abs(5-7) = 2.
The code then checks if p is less than q. Since p (3) is not less than q (2), the condition is false.
Therefore, the code will execute the else block and print "B".
<<<Output>>>
B
