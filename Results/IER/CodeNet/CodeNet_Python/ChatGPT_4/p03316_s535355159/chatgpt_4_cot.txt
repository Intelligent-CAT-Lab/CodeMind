<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 12.
The code then converts n to a string, iterates over each character in the string, converts each character back to an integer, and creates a list of these integers. This list is [1, 2] for the number 12.
The sum function is used to calculate the sum of the integers in the list, which is 1 + 2 = 3. This sum is stored in the variable s_n.
The code then checks if n is divisible by s_n. In this case, 12 % 3 equals 0, which means 12 is divisible by 3.
Since the condition is true, the code prints "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
