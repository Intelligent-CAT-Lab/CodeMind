<<<Analysis>>>
The variables x and y are initialized to 3 and 20, respectively.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of times the loop is executed.
The code enters a while loop that will continue to execute as long as x is less than or equal to y.
Inside the loop, ans is incremented by 1, and x is doubled (multiplied by 2).
The loop will run as follows:
- First iteration: x = 3 * 2 = 6, ans = 1
- Second iteration: x = 6 * 2 = 12, ans = 2
- Third iteration: x = 12 * 2 = 24, ans = 3
The loop stops because x is now greater than y (24 > 20).
The code then prints the final value of ans, which is 3.
