<<<Analysis>>>
The variables A, B, C, and K are initialized to 1, 2, 3, and 1, respectively.
The code checks if K is even by using the bitwise AND operator with 1 (K&1). If K is even, the result of K&1 will be 0; otherwise, it will be 1.
Since K is 1, which is odd, K&1 is not equal to 0.
Therefore, the else block is executed, and the code prints B-A, which is 2-1.
