<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a and b are initialized to 2 and 5, respectively.
The code checks if the maximum of a and b is greater than 9. In this case, the maximum is 5, which is not greater than 9.
Since the condition is not met, the code proceeds to the else block and prints the product of a and b.
The product of a and b is 2 * 5, which equals 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
