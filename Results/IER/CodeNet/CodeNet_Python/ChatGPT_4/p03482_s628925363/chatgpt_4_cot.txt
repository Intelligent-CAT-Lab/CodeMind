<<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized to the string "010".
The variable n is initialized to the length of s, which is 3.
The variable ans is initialized to the value of n, which is 3.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider the indices 1 and 2 of the string "010".
For i=1, s[i-1] is '0' and s[i] is '1'. Since they are not equal, the code executes the else block. It calculates min(ans, max(i, n-i)), which is min(3, max(1, 2)), resulting in min(3, 2), which is 2. The value of ans is updated to 2.
For i=2, s[i-1] is '1' and s[i] is '0'. Since they are not equal, the code executes the else block again. It calculates min(ans, max(i, n-i)), which is min(2, max(2, 1)), resulting in min(2, 2), which is 2. The value of ans remains 2.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
