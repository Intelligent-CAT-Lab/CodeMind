<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a, b, and c are initialized to 4, 5, and 3, respectively.
The first if condition checks if a < b, which is true (4 < 5).
Inside this if block, the next if condition checks if c < a, which is also true (3 < 4).
Since the condition is true, the code prints the values of c and b, which are 3 and 5, respectively.
No other conditions are checked or executed after this point.
<<<Output>>>
3 5
