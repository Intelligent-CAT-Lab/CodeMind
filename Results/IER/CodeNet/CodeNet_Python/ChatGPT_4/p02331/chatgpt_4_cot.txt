<<<Analysis>>>
The code imports several modules and sets the recursion limit to a high value, which is not relevant for the given input as there is no recursion in the code.
The MOD variable is set to 10^9 + 7, which is a common modulus used in programming contests for avoiding integer overflow issues.
The variables n and k are initialized to 2 and 3, respectively, from the input.
The code calculates k raised to the power of n, which is 3^2 = 9.
Then it takes the result modulo MOD, which is 9 % (10^9 + 7) = 9, since 9 is much less than 10^9 + 7.
Finally, the code prints the result of the modulo operation.
<<<Output>>>
9
