<<<Analysis>>>
The input N is initialized to 5.
The function fib(n) is defined to calculate the nth Fibonacci number, but with a twist: the sequence starts with 2 and 1 instead of the traditional 0 and 1.
The memo list is initialized with n zeros.
The first two elements of the memo list are set to [2, 1].
The for loop calculates the Fibonacci sequence starting from the third element (index 2) up to the nth element (index n-1) by summing the two preceding numbers in the sequence.
The function returns the last element of the memo list, which is the nth Fibonacci number in this modified sequence.
The solve function reads the input, calls fib(N + 1) since we want the (N+1)th number in the sequence, and prints the result.
For N = 5, the sequence generated by fib(6) will be [2, 1, 3, 4, 7, 11].
The 6th element (index 5) of this sequence is 11, which is the output of the function.
