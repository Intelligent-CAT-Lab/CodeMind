<<<Analysis>>>
The input string "2 5" is split into two parts '2' and '5' and assigned to variables a and b respectively.
The variables a and b are then converted to integers.
The if condition checks whether both a and b are greater than 0 and less than 10, which is true for the values 2 and 5.
Since the condition is met, the code executes the print statement inside the if block, which prints the product of a and b.
The product of 2 and 5 is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
