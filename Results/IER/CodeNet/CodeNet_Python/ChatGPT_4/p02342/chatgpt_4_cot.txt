The variables N and K are initialized to 10 and 5, respectively.
MOD is set to 10^9 + 7, which is a large prime number often used for modulo operations in competitive programming to avoid integer overflow.

A 2D list D is created with dimensions (N+1) x (K+1), and all elements are initialized to 0. This list will be used for dynamic programming to store intermediate results.

The first loop initializes the first column (index 1) of each row from 1 to N in D to 1. This corresponds to the base case where there is only one way to partition a number into exactly one part.

The second loop initializes the diagonal elements where the row index is equal to the column index, up to min(N, K). This corresponds to the base case where there is only one way to partition a number into parts that are all equal to 1.

The third loop fills in the rest of the table D using a dynamic programming approach. For each pair (n, k) where n ranges from 1 to N and k ranges from 2 to min(n-1, K), it calculates D[n][k] as the sum of D[n-k][k] and D[n-1][k-1], modulo MOD. This is based on the recurrence relation for partitioning numbers.

Finally, the code prints the value of D[N][K] modulo MOD, which is the number of ways to partition the number N into exactly K parts.

Let's calculate the values for D when N=10 and K=5:

D[1][1] = 1
D[2][1] = 1, D[2][2] = 1
D[3][1] = 1, D[3][2] = 1, D[3][3] = 1
D[4][1] = 1, D[4][2] = 2, D[4][3] = 1, D[4][4] = 1
D[5][1] = 1, D[5][2] = 2, D[5][3] = 2, D[5][4] = 1, D[5][5] = 1
...
D[10][1] = 1, D[10][2] = 5, D[10][3] = 5, D[10][4] = 5, D[10][5] = 1

The final value of D[10][5] is 1, which is the number of ways to partition the number 10 into exactly 5 parts.
