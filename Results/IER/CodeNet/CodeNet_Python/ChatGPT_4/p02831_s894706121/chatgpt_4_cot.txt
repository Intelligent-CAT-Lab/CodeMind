<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a and b are initialized to 2 and 3, respectively.
The code uses the fractions module to calculate the greatest common divisor (gcd) of a and b.
The gcd of 2 and 3 is 1, since they are coprime (no common factors other than 1).
The code then calculates the least common multiple (lcm) by multiplying a and b and dividing by their gcd.
Since the gcd is 1, the lcm is simply the product of a and b, which is 2 * 3 = 6.
The code prints the lcm, which is 6.
<<<Output>>>
6
