<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized to the string "100".
The variable c is initialized to the integer value of the first character of N, which is 1.
The variable K is initialized to the length of N, which is 3.
The variable ans is calculated as c + 9 * (K - 1) - 1, which is 1 + 9 * (3 - 1) - 1 = 1 + 18 - 1 = 18.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the characters of N starting from the second character, which are "0" and "0".
The loop checks if each character is not "9". Since both characters are "0", the loop breaks immediately and does not execute the else block.
The else block would have added 1 to ans if all characters after the first were "9", but this is not the case.
The final value of ans, which is 18, is printed.
<<<Output>>>
18
