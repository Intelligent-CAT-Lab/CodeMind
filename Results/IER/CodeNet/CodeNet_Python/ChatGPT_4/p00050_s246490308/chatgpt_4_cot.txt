<<<Analysis>>>
The input string is "the cost of one peach is higher than that of one apple."
The code performs a series of string replacements:
1. It replaces all occurrences of 'apple' with '???'. The string becomes "the cost of one peach is higher than that of one ???."
2. It then replaces all occurrences of 'peach' with 'apple'. The string becomes "the cost of one apple is higher than that of one ???."
3. Finally, it replaces all occurrences of '???' with 'peach'. The string becomes "the cost of one apple is higher than that of one peach."
The code then prints the final modified string.
<<<Output>>>
the cost of one apple is higher than that of one peach.
