The variables n and x are initialized to 5 and 2, respectively.
The code then sets x to the minimum of x and n-x, which is min(2, 5-2) = min(2, 3) = 2.
n is updated to n - x, which is 5 - 2 = 3.
The variable ans is initialized to 0.
The code enters a while loop that will continue indefinitely until an exit condition is met.
Inside the loop:
- new_x is set to the remainder of n divided by x, which is 3 % 2 = 1.
- new_n is set to the integer division of n by x, which is 3 // 2 = 1.
- The code checks if new_x is 0, which it is not (new_x is 1), so it proceeds to the else block.
- In the else block, ans is updated to ans + x * new_n * 3, which is 0 + 2 * 1 * 3 = 6.
- n is updated to the value of x, which is 2.
- x is updated to the value of new_x, which is 1.
The loop continues with the new values of n and x:
- new_x is now n % x, which is 2 % 1 = 0.
- new_n is now n // x, which is 2 // 1 = 2.
- Since new_x is 0, the if condition is met, and the code prints ans + x * new_n * 3, which is 6 + 1 * 2 * 3 = 12.
- The code then exits, so the loop does not continue.

<<<Output>>>
