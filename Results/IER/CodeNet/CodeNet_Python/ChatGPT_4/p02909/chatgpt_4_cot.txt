<<<Analysis>>>
The variable S is initialized with the string "Sunny".
The code checks if S is equal to "Sunny". Since it is, the code enters the first if block.
The code then prints "Cloudy" because the condition S == "Sunny" is true.
No further conditions are checked since the first if condition was met and executed.
<<<Output>>>
Cloudy
