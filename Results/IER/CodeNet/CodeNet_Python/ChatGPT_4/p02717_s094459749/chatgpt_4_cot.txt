<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a, b, and c are initialized with the values '1', '2', and '3' respectively, as strings, because the input() function reads the input as a string and the split() function splits the input string into a list of strings.
The print function is then called with the arguments c, a, and b, which are '3', '1', and '2' respectively.
The output will be the values of c, a, and b printed in that order, separated by spaces.
<<<Output>>>
