The code defines a function `SumOfDigits(n)` that calculates the sum of the digits of a given number `n`.
The variables `n`, `a`, and `b` are initialized to 20, 2, and 5, respectively, based on the input.
The variable `sum` is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to `n` (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 20.
For each number `i` in this range, the function `SumOfDigits(i)` is called to calculate the sum of its digits and store it in the variable `add`.
The code checks if `add` is within the range [`a`, `b`], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number `i` to `sum`.
The condition is met when `i` is 2, 3, 4, 5, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of `sum`, which is the sum of the numbers that met the condition.
The output will be the sum of the numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 20, which is 84.
