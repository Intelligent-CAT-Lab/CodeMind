<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function `solve()` that reads an integer `n` from the input, and then prints the number followed by its prime factorization. The prime factorization is obtained by calling the `prime_factorization(n)` function.

The `prime_factorization(n)` function checks if `n` is less than 2, and if so, returns a list containing `n` itself. Since the input is 12, this condition is not met.

The function then initializes an empty list `res` to store the prime factors and calculates the square root of `n` to limit the range of numbers to check for factors.

It then enters a loop from 2 to the square root of `n` (inclusive). For each number `p` in this range, it checks if `p` is a factor of `n` by using the modulo operator. If `p` is a factor, it appends `p` to `res` and divides `n` by `p` using integer division.

For the input `12`, the square root is between 3 and 4, so the loop will check for factors from 2 to 4. The number 12 is divisible by 2, so 2 is appended to `res` twice (since 12 divided by 2 is 6, and then 6 divided by 2 is 3), and `n` becomes 3. The number 3 is also a prime factor, so it is appended to `res`.

Finally, if `n` is greater than 1 after the loop, it means `n` is a prime number and is appended to `res`. In this case, `n` is 3, which is already in `res`.

The `solve()` function then prints the prime factors separated by spaces.

The expected output for the input `12` is the number 12 followed by its prime factors: 2, 2, and 3.
