<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a and b are initialized to -13 and 3, respectively.
The code then checks which of the three expressions (a+b, a-b, a*b) is the largest.
First, it checks if a+b is greater than or equal to both a-b and a*b:
    a+b = -13+3 = -10
    a-b = -13-3 = -16
    a*b = -13*3 = -39
Since a+b (-10) is greater than a-b (-16) and a*b (-39), the first condition is true.
Therefore, the code will print the result of a+b, which is -10.
<<<Output>>>
-10
