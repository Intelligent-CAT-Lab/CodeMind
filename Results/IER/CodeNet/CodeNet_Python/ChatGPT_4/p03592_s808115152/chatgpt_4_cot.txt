<<<Analysis>>>
The variables N, M, and K are initialized to 2, 2, and 2, respectively.
The code then enters a nested loop, with the outer loop iterating over x from 0 to N (inclusive) and the inner loop iterating over y from 0 to M (inclusive). This means x will take values 0, 1, 2 and y will take values 0, 1, 2.
For each pair (x, y), the code calculates the value of res using the formula res = x * M + y * N - x * y * 2.
The code checks if res is equal to K. If it is, it prints "Yes" and exits the loop and the program immediately.
If the loops finish without finding any (x, y) pair that satisfies the condition res == K, the code prints "No".

Let's calculate the value of res for each pair (x, y):
- For (0, 0): res = 0 * 2 + 0 * 2 - 0 * 0 * 2 = 0 (not equal to K)
- For (0, 1): res = 0 * 2 + 1 * 2 - 0 * 1 * 2 = 2 (equal to K)
Since we found a pair (x, y) that satisfies the condition res == K, the code will print "Yes" and exit before checking any other pairs.

<<<Output>>>
Yes
