<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string input and splits it into three parts based on spaces. These parts are assigned to variables a, x, and c.
The input string is "AtCoder Beginner Contest".
After splitting, a = "AtCoder", x = "Beginner", and c = "Contest".
The code then prints the first character of each of these strings concatenated together.
The first character of "AtCoder" is 'A', the first character of "Beginner" is 'B', and the first character of "Contest" is 'C'.
Therefore, the output will be the concatenation of 'A', 'B', and 'C', which is "ABC".
<<<Output>>>
ABC
