<<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized with the input string "bac".
The code checks if the sorted version of the string s, when joined back into a string, equals "abc".
The sorted version of "bac" is ['a', 'b', 'c'], which when joined becomes "abc".
Since "abc" equals "abc", the condition is True.
Therefore, the code will print "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
