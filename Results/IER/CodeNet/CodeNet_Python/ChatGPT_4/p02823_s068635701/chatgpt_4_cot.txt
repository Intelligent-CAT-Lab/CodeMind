<<<Analysis>>>
The variables n, a, and b are initialized to 5, 2, and 4, respectively.
The variable diff is calculated as b - a, which is 4 - 2 = 2.
Since diff % 2 == 0 (2 is even), the code prints diff//2, which is 2//2 = 1.
The other conditions are not evaluated because the first if condition is met.
