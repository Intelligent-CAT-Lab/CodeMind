<<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized with the string '3776'.
The function f(s) is defined to check for consecutive identical characters in the string s.
The function uses the zip function to iterate over pairs of consecutive characters in the string (u, v).
For the input '3776', the pairs generated by zip(s, s[1:]) will be: ('3', '7'), ('7', '7'), and ('7', '6').
The function checks each pair to see if the characters are the same (u == v).
When it checks the pair ('7', '7'), it finds that u == v, meaning there are consecutive identical characters.
As a result, the function returns 'Bad'.
The print statement then outputs the result of the function f(s), which is 'Bad'.
<<<Output>>>
Bad
