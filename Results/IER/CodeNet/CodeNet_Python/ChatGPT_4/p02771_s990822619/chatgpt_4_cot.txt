<<<Analysis>>>
The variables A, B, and C are initialized with the input values '5', '7', and '5', respectively.
The first if condition checks if A, B, and C are all equal. Since A is equal to C but B is different, this condition is not met.
The elif condition checks if A, B, and C are all different from each other. Since A is equal to C, this condition is also not met.
Since neither the if nor the elif conditions are met, the code proceeds to the else block.
The else block prints "Yes" because the input values meet the condition where at least two variables are equal, but not all three.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
