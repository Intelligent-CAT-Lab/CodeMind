<<<Analysis>>>
The input string '4 5 3' is split into a list of strings ['4', '5', '3'].
The map function applies the int function to each element of the list, converting them to integers, resulting in the list [4, 5, 3].
The min function is called on the list [4, 5, 3], returning the smallest element, which is 3.
The max function is called on the same list, returning the largest element, which is 5.
The min and max values are converted to strings and concatenated with a space between them, resulting in the string '3 5'.
This string is printed as the output.
<<<Output>>>
