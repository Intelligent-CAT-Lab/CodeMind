<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 1.000, which is a float.
The code then checks if n multiplied by the square root of 2 is less than the integer part of n plus 1.
The square root of 2 is approximately 1.414.
So, n * sqrt(2) is 1.000 * 1.414 which is approximately 1.414.
The integer part of n is 1, so int(n) + 1 is 2.
The condition 1.414 < 2 is true.
Since the condition is true, the code will execute the part of the ternary operator before the else, which is int(n) + 1.
int(n) + 1 is 2.
The code will print 2 as the output.
