The variables A, B, and DEGREE are initialized to 4, 3, and 90, respectively.
The variable rad is calculated by converting DEGREE from degrees to radians using math.radians(DEGREE).
The area S of the triangle is calculated using the formula S = A*B*math.sin(rad)/2.0. Since DEGREE is 90, which is the angle in radians for a right angle, math.sin(rad) will be 1. Therefore, S = 4*3*1/2.0 = 6.0.
The length of the hypotenuse C is calculated using the Pythagorean theorem, which is C = math.sqrt(A*A + B*B - 2*A*B*math.cos(rad)). Since DEGREE is 90, math.cos(rad) will be 0, and the formula simplifies to C = math.sqrt(A*A + B*B) = math.sqrt(4*4 + 3*3) = math.sqrt(16 + 9) = math.sqrt(25) = 5.0.
The height h of the triangle from side A is calculated using the formula h = 2*S/A. Since S is 6.0 and A is 4, h = 2*6.0/4 = 3.0.
The output is formatted to print the area S, the perimeter A+B+C, and the height h, each with 10 decimal places of precision.
Therefore, the output will be "6.0000000000 12.0000000000 3.0000000000".
