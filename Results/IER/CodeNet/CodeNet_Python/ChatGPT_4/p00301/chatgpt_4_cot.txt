<<<Analysis>>>
The code is designed to find a representation of the input number W (which is 25 in this case) as a sum of powers of 3, using only the digits '0', '+', and '-'.

First, the code initializes a constant SIZE to 15 and calculates powers of 3 up to 3^(SIZE-1) and stores them in the list POW.

The input W is read and set to 25.

The code then finds the smallest digit 'max_digit' such that the sum of powers of 3 from 0 to 'max_digit' is at least twice the input number W. This is done to ensure that we can represent W using '+' and '-' signs.

The 'recursive' function is defined to try all combinations of '0', '+', and '-' for each power of 3, starting from the highest one down to 0. It accumulates the sum 'tmp_sum' and if it matches W, it copies the current combination to 'ans'.

The 'recursive' function is called with the initial digit set to 'max_digit' and 'tmp_sum' set to 0.

After the recursive function completes, the code prints the representation by iterating over 'ans' from the highest digit to the lowest, skipping initial '0's and not skipping them once a '+' or '-' has been encountered.

Let's follow the recursive calls with W = 25:
- The smallest 'max_digit' such that (3^max_digit - 1)/2 >= 25 is 3 because (3^3 - 1)/2 = 13 which is not greater than or equal to 25, but (3^4 - 1)/2 = 40 which is greater than 25.
- The recursive function will try all combinations of '0', '+', and '-' for powers of 3 from 3^3 down to 3^0.
- The correct combination that sums up to 25 is "+0-+", which corresponds to 3^3 + 3^0 = 27 + 1 = 28, then subtracting 3^1 = 3 to get 25.

Therefore, the output will be the string "+0-+" without any leading '0's.
