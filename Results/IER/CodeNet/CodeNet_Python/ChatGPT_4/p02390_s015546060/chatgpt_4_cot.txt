<<<Analysis>>>
The variable x is initialized to 46979.
The variable h (hours) is calculated by integer division of x by 3600, which is 46979 // 3600 = 13.
The variable m (minutes) is calculated by first getting the remainder of x divided by 3600, which is 46979 % 3600 = 679, and then integer dividing that by 60, which is 679 // 60 = 11.
The variable s (seconds) is calculated by getting the remainder of x divided by 60, which is 46979 % 60 = 19.
The code then prints the formatted time in the format "h:m:s", which will be "13:11:19".
<<<Output>>>
13:11:19
