<<<Analysis>>>
The variable h is initialized to 2.
The code enters a loop that will iterate from 0 to 9999999999.
For each iteration i, the code checks if 2 raised to the power of i is greater than h.
The loop starts with i=0, and 2**0 is 1, which is not greater than h.
Next, i=1, and 2**1 is 2, which is not greater than h.
Then, i=2, and 2**2 is 4, which is greater than h.
Since 2**i is greater than h when i=2, the code prints 2**i - 1, which is 4 - 1 = 3.
The loop breaks after printing the value.
