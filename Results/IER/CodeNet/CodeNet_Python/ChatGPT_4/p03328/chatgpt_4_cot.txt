<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a and b are initialized to 8 and 13, respectively.
The variable tower_dis is calculated as b - a, which is 13 - 8 = 5.
The variable b_height is calculated as the sum of the first tower_dis natural numbers, which is the triangular number for tower_dis. This is calculated as tower_dis * (tower_dis + 1) // 2, which is 5 * (5 + 1) // 2 = 5 * 6 // 2 = 15.
The variable ans is calculated as b_height - b, which is 15 - 13 = 2.
The code then prints the value of ans.
