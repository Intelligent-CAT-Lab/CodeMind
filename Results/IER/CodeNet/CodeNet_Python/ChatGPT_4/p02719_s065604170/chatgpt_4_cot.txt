<<<Analysis>>>
The variables n and m are initialized to 7 and 4, respectively.
The code calculates n % m, which is the remainder of 7 divided by 4, resulting in 3.
The code also calculates -n % m, which is the remainder of -7 divided by 4. In Python, the result of this operation is 1 because when the dividend is negative, the remainder is calculated as the smallest non-negative remainder that satisfies the equation dividend = divisor * quotient + remainder. In this case, -7 = 4 * (-2) + 1.
The code then prints the minimum of these two values, which is 1.
