<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a main function that reads three integers as input, assigns them to variables A, B, and C, and then checks if C is between A and B (inclusive). If C is between A and B, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".

The input provided is `1 3 2`. The variables are assigned as follows:
- A = 1
- B = 3
- C = 2

The condition `B >= C >= A` translates to `3 >= 2 >= 1`, which is True. Therefore, the code will print "Yes".

<<<Output>>>
Yes
