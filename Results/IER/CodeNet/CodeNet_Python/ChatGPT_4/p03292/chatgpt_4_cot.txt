<<<Analysis>>>
The list A is initialized with the input values [1, 6, 3].
The variable b is calculated as the sum of the absolute differences between the first and second elements, and the first and third elements of A: abs(1-6) + abs(1-3) = 5 + 2 = 7.
The variable c is calculated as the sum of the absolute differences between the first and second elements, and the second and third elements of A: abs(1-6) + abs(6-3) = 5 + 3 = 8.
The variable d is calculated as the sum of the absolute differences between the first and third elements, and the second and third elements of A: abs(1-3) + abs(6-3) = 2 + 3 = 5.
The code then prints the minimum of b, c, and d, which is 5.
<<<Output>>>
5
