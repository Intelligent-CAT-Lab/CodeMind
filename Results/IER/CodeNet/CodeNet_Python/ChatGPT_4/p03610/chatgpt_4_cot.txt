<<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized with the string 'atcoder'.
The print statement uses slicing to print every second character of the string, starting from the first character (index 0).
The slicing syntax s[::2] means start at index 0, go to the end of the string, and use a step of 2.
This will result in the characters at indexes 0, 2, 4, and 6 being printed, which are 'a', 'c', 'd', and 'r' respectively.
