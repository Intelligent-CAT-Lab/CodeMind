<<<Analysis>>>
The variables A, B, and X are initialized to 180, 100, and 2400, respectively.
The code calculates three different answers based on the given input:
- ans1 is calculated as the ceiling of X divided by 1000, multiplied by A. This represents the cost if we only use the first option (A) to cover the entire distance X.
- ans2 is calculated as the ceiling of X divided by 500, multiplied by B. This represents the cost if we only use the second option (B) to cover the entire distance X.
- ans3 is calculated as the floor of X divided by 1000, multiplied by A, plus the ceiling of the remainder of X divided by 1000, divided by 500, multiplied by B. This represents the cost if we use a combination of both options, using A for the full 1000 units and B for any remaining distance less than 1000 units.

For the given input:
- ans1 = math.ceil(2400/1000) * 180 = 3 * 180 = 540
- ans2 = math.ceil(2400/500) * 100 = 5 * 100 = 500
- ans3 = math.floor(2400/1000) * 180 + math.ceil((2400 % 1000)/500) * 100 = 2 * 180 + 1 * 100 = 360 + 100 = 460

The code then prints the minimum of these three answers, which is 460.
<<<Output>>>
460
