<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a, b, and C are initialized to 4, 3, and 90, respectively.
The angle C is converted from degrees to radians by multiplying it by pi and dividing by 180.
Using the cosine rule, the length of side c is calculated as sqrt(4^2 + 3^2 - 2*4*3*cos(C radians)).
Since C is 90 degrees, cos(C) is 0, so the formula simplifies to sqrt(4^2 + 3^2), which is 5.
The height of the triangle from base a is calculated using b * sin(C), which is 3 * sin(90 degrees in radians), which is 3.
The area of the triangle is calculated as (a * height) / 2, which is (4 * 3) / 2, which is 6.
The perimeter of the triangle is calculated as a + b + c, which is 4 + 3 + 5, which is 12.
The output is formatted to 8 decimal places for each of the calculated values: area, perimeter, and height.
