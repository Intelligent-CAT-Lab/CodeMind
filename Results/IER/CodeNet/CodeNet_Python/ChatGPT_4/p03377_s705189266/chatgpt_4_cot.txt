<<<Analysis>>>
The input string '3 5 4' is split into a list of strings ['3', '5', '4'] and then each string is converted to an integer, resulting in the list l = [3, 5, 4].
The code then checks if the first element of the list (l[0] which is 3) is less than or equal to the third element (l[2] which is 4) and if the sum of the first and second elements (l[0] + l[1] which is 3 + 5 = 8) is greater than or equal to the third element (l[2] which is 4).
Since both conditions are true (3 <= 4 and 8 >= 4), the code prints "YES".
<<<Output>>>
YES
