The function `e_cell_distance` is defined to calculate a certain value based on the inputs N, M, K, and a default MOD value of 10**9 + 7.

The input `2 2 2` initializes N, M, and K to 2, 2, and 2, respectively.

The `Combination` class is defined within the function, which precomputes factorials and their modular inverses up to `max_n` (which is N * M = 4 in this case) for efficient computation of combinations modulo `mod`.

The `combination` method of the `Combination` class is used to calculate the combination of (N * M - 2) choose (K - 2), which is (4 - 2) choose (2 - 2) = 2 choose 0 = 1.

The variable `t1` is calculated as the sum of `d * (M - d) * (N**2)` for `d` in the range from 1 to M-1. Since M is 2, the range is just 1, and the calculation is 1 * (2 - 1) * (2**2) = 1 * 1 * 4 = 4.

The variable `t2` is calculated as the sum of `d * (N - d) * (M**2)` for `d` in the range from 1 to N-1. Since N is 2, the range is just 1, and the calculation is 1 * (2 - 1) * (2**2) = 1 * 1 * 4 = 4.

The variable `t` is the sum of `t1` and `t2` modulo MOD, which is (4 + 4) % 10**9 + 7 = 8 % 10**9 + 7 = 8.

The final result is the product of `comb` and `t` modulo MOD, which is 1 * 8 % 10**9 + 7 = 8.

Therefore, the output of the code execution given the input `2 2 2` is 8.
