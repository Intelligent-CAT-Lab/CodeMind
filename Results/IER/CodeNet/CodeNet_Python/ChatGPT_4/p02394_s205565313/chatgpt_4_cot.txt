The input is a list of integers that are passed to the function `in_retangle` as arguments. The input `5 4 2 2 1` corresponds to the variables `w=5`, `h=4`, `x=2`, `y=2`, and `r=1`.
The function `in_retangle` checks if a circle with radius `r` and center at `(x, y)` is completely inside a rectangle with width `w` and height `h`. The circle is inside the rectangle if the following conditions are met:
- The distance from the left edge of the rectangle to the center of the circle is greater than or equal to `r`.
- The distance from the right edge of the rectangle to the center of the circle is greater than or equal to `r`.
- The distance from the top edge of the rectangle to the center of the circle is greater than or equal to `r`.
- The distance from the bottom edge of the rectangle to the center of the circle is greater than or equal to `r`.

In this case, the conditions translate to:
- `r <= y` which is `1 <= 2` (True)
- `y <= h - r` which is `2 <= 4 - 1` (True)
- `r <= x` which is `1 <= 2` (True)
- `x <= w - r` which is `2 <= 5 - 1` (True)

Since all conditions are True, the function will print "Yes".
