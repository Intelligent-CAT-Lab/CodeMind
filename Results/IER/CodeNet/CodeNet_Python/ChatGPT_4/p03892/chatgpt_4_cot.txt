<<<Analysis>>>
The input values are assigned to variables a, b, c, and d, which are 1, 1, 3, and 4, respectively.
The variable h is calculated as the absolute difference between b and d, which is |1 - 4| = 3.
The variable w is calculated as the absolute difference between c and a, which is |3 - 1| = 2.
The code checks if either h or w is 0, and if so, it returns 0. In this case, neither is 0, so it proceeds.
The gcd function is called with the maximum and minimum of h and w, which are 3 and 2, respectively.
The gcd function calculates the greatest common divisor of 3 and 2 using the Euclidean algorithm:
- gcd(3, 2) calls gcd(2, 3 % 2) which is gcd(2, 1)
- gcd(2, 1) calls gcd(1, 2 % 1) which is gcd(1, 0)
- Since 1 % 0 is 0, the base case of the recursive function is reached, and it returns 1.
The main function then returns h + w - m, which is 3 + 2 - 1 = 4.
