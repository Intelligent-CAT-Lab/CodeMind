<<<Analysis>>>
The input string 'aab' is converted into a list of characters and stored in variable w.
The length of the list w is stored in variable n, which is 3.
Variable t is initialized to -1, which will be used later to check for a certain condition.
The function Z(s) is defined to calculate the Z-array and a filter array f for a given string s.
The code then enters a loop that checks if the string w has a period t such that w is composed of repetitions of w[0:t]. Since 'aab' does not satisfy this condition for any t, t remains -1.
Since t is -1, the code prints '1' and '1' on separate lines, indicating that the string does not have a smaller period and the number of ways to partition the string into substrings that are repetitions of a smaller string is 1.
