<<<Analysis>>>
The variables N, K, and S are initialized to 4, 2, and 3, respectively.
The code checks if S is equal to 10^9. Since S is 3, it does not satisfy the condition.
Since S is not 10^9, the code proceeds to the else block.
In the else block, it creates a list 'ans' that contains K occurrences of S followed by (N - K) occurrences of 10^9.
In this case, 'ans' will contain 2 occurrences of 3 followed by (4 - 2) occurrences of 10^9, which is 2 occurrences of 10^9.
Finally, the code prints the elements of 'ans' separated by spaces.
<<<Output>>>
3 3 1000000000 1000000000
