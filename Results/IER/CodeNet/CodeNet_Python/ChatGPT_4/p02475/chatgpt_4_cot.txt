<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a and b are initialized to 5 and 8, respectively.
The function round is defined to take two arguments, a and b.
The function checks if the product of a and b is negative. Since 5 * 8 is 40, which is not negative, the condition is false.
Therefore, the else block is executed, which returns the integer division of a by b, a // b.
The integer division of 5 by 8 is 0, since 5 is less than 8 and we are performing integer division.
The print statement then outputs the result of the round function, which is 0.
<<<Output>>>
