<<<Analysis>>>
The variables X and Y are initialized to 2 and 1, respectively.
The code checks if the absolute difference between X and Y is less than or equal to 1.
Since abs(2-1) equals 1, which is less than or equal to 1, the condition is true.
Therefore, the code prints 'Brown'.
<<<Output>>>
Brown
