<<<Analysis>>>
The variables n, a, and b are initialized to 8, 3, and 4, respectively.
The variable k is calculated as the integer division of n by the sum of a and b, which is 8 // (3+4) = 8 // 7 = 1.
The variable p is calculated as the remainder of the division of n by the sum of a and b, which is 8 % (3+4) = 8 % 7 = 1.
The print statement calculates k*a + min(p,a), which is 1*3 + min(1,3) = 3 + 1 = 4.
The output of the code will be 4.
