<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a and b are initialized with the input values 8 and 6, respectively.
The list j represents the order of cards where 1 is considered the highest value and 2 is the lowest.
The code checks the index of a and b in the list j to determine which card is higher.
The index of 8 in list j is 6.
The index of 6 in list j is 4.
Since the index of a (8) is greater than the index of b (6), the code will print 'Alice' indicating that Alice has the higher card.
<<<Output>>>
Alice
