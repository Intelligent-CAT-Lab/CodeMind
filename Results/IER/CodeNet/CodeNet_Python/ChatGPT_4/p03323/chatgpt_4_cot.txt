<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a and b are initialized to 5 and 4, respectively, from the input.
The code then checks if both a and b are less than 9.
Since both 5 and 4 are less than 9, the condition is True.
Therefore, the code will execute the first branch of the if statement and print "Yay!".
<<<Output>>>
Yay!
