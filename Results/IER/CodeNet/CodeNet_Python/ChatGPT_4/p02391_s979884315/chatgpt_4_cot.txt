<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a and b are initialized with the values 1 and 2, respectively, from the input.
The code then checks if a is less than b, which is true since 1 is less than 2.
Since the condition is true, the code prints 'a < b' and does not check the other conditions.
<<<Output>>>
a < b
