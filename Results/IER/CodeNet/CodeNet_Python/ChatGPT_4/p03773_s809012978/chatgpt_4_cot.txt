<<<Analysis>>>
The variables A and B are initialized to 9 and 12, respectively, by splitting the input string and converting each part to an integer.
The code then calculates the sum of A and B, which is 9 + 12 = 21.
Next, it calculates the remainder of this sum when divided by 24, which is 21 % 24.
Since 21 is less than 24, the remainder is simply 21.
The code then prints this result.
<<<Output>>>
21
