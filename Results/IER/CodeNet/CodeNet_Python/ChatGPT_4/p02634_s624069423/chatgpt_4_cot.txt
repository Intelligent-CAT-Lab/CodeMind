<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a, b, c, and d are initialized to 1, 1, 2, and 2, respectively.
A 2D list `dp` is created with dimensions c x d, which is 2 x 2 in this case, and all elements are initialized to 0.
The element at position (a-1, b-1) in the `dp` list is set to 1, which means `dp[0][0]` is set to 1.
The variable `mod` is set to 998244353, which will be used for modulo operations.

The code then checks if a == c and b == d. Since a == 1, c == 2, b == 1, and d == 2, this condition is not met, so the code does not print 1 and exit.

Next, the code checks if a == c. Since a == 1 and c == 2, this condition is not met, so the code does not print (a**(d-b))%mod and exit.

Then, the code checks if b == d. Since b == 1 and d == 2, this condition is not met, so the code does not print (b**(c-a))%mod and exit.

The code then enters a nested loop to fill the `dp` list. The outer loop iterates from a-1 to c-1, which is from 0 to 1. The inner loop iterates from b-1 to d-1, which is from 0 to 1.

For each cell (y, x) in the `dp` list, the code calculates the value based on the formula:
dp[y][x] += dp[y][x-1]*(y+1) + dp[y-1][x]*(x+1) - dp[y-1][x-1]*x*y
and then applies modulo operation with `mod`.

The calculation proceeds as follows:
- For y = 0, x = 1: dp[0][1] += dp[0][0]*(0+1) + dp[-1][1]*(1+1) - dp[-1][0]*0*1
  Since dp[-1][*] does not exist, it is considered as 0.
  dp[0][1] = 1*(0+1) + 0 - 0 = 1
- For y = 1, x = 0: dp[1][0] += dp[1][-1]*(1+1) + dp[0][0]*(0+1) - dp[0][-1]*0*1
  Since dp[*][-1] does not exist, it is considered as 0.
  dp[1][0] = 0 + 1*(0+1) - 0 = 1
- For y = 1, x = 1: dp[1][1] += dp[1][0]*(1+1) + dp[0][1]*(1+1) - dp[0][0]*1*1
  dp[1][1] = 1*(1+1) + 1*(1+1) - 1*1*1 = 2 + 2 - 1 = 3

Finally, the code prints the value of the last element in the `dp` list modulo `mod`, which is dp[-1][-1] % mod = dp[1][1] % mod = 3 % 998244353 = 3.
