<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized to 4.
The expression (N//2) performs integer division of N by 2, which results in 2 since 4 divided by 2 is 2.
This result is then divided by N (which is 4), resulting in 2/4, which simplifies to 0.5.
The code then calculates 1 - 0.5, which equals 0.5.
Finally, the code prints the result of this calculation.
<<<Output>>>
0.5
