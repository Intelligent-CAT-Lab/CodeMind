<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a, t, and r are initialized to 180.0, 120.0, and 90.0, respectively, as they are converted to floats.
The code calculates the result of the expression t * r / a, which is 120.0 * 90.0 / 180.0.
The calculation is performed as follows: 120.0 * 90.0 equals 10800.0, and then 10800.0 / 180.0 equals 60.0.
The code then prints the result of the calculation, which is 60.0.
<<<Output>>>
60.0
