The function `d_XorSum(N)` is defined to calculate the number of pairs of non-negative integers `(a, b)` such that `a + b <= N` and `a XOR b <= N`, with the additional condition that `a >= b`. The function uses a memoization technique to store previously calculated results in a dictionary named `memo`.

The `memo` dictionary is initialized with two base cases:
- `memo[0] = 1`, which corresponds to the single pair `(0, 0)` when `N = 0`.
- `memo[1] = 2`, which corresponds to the pairs `(0, 0)` and `(1, 1)` when `N = 1`.

The function `f(k)` is defined within `d_XorSum(N)` to calculate the number of valid pairs for a given `k`. If the result for `k` is already in the `memo` dictionary, it returns the stored value. Otherwise, it calculates the result recursively using the formula:
`ret = (f(k // 2) + f((k - 1) // 2) + f((k - 2) // 2)) % MOD`
and stores the result in `memo` before returning it.

The `MOD` variable is set to `10**9 + 7`, which is a large prime number commonly used to avoid integer overflow in competitive programming.

Given the input `3`, the function `d_XorSum(N)` is called with `N = 3`. The following steps occur:
1. `f(3)` is called.
2. Since `3` is not in `memo`, it calculates `f(3 // 2)`, `f((3 - 1) // 2)`, and `f((3 - 2) // 2)` which are `f(1)`, `f(1)`, and `f(0)` respectively.
3. `f(1)` is already in `memo` with a value of `2`.
4. `f(0)` is already in `memo` with a value of `1`.
5. The result for `f(3)` is calculated as `(2 + 2 + 1) % MOD = 5 % MOD = 5`.
6. The result `5` is stored in `memo` with the key `3`.
7. The function `d_XorSum(N)` returns `5`.

Finally, the program prints the result, which is `5`.
