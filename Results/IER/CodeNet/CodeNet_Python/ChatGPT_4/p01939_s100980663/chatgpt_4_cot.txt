<<<Analysis>>>
The variables n and m are initialized to 3 and 9, respectively.
Two modulus values, mod1 and mod2, are defined as 10**9+7 and 998244353, respectively.
The variable mod is set to mod1, which is 10**9+7.
The variable ans is initialized with the value (m+1)%mod, which is (9+1)%10**9+7 = 10.
The code then checks if n is not equal to 1. Since n is 3, the condition is true, and the code inside the if block is executed.
Inside the if block, the variable a is calculated as m//(n-1), which is 9//(3-1) = 4.
The variable ans is then updated with the following expression:
((m+1)*(a+1)+(m+1)*a-(n-1)*a*(a+1))%mod
Substituting the values, we get:
((9+1)*(4+1)+(9+1)*4-(3-1)*4*(4+1))%10**9+7
(10*5+10*4-2*4*5)%10**9+7
(50+40-40)%10**9+7
50%10**9+7
The final value of ans is 50.
<<<Output>>>
50
