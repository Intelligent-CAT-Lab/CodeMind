The variable N is initialized to 2.
The function `ok` checks if the equation 4*h*n*w == N*(n*w + n*h + h*w) holds true, returning 1 if it does, and 0 otherwise. However, this function is not used in the code.
The function `kiyaku` checks if b is divisible by a, returning 1 if it is, and 0 otherwise.
The function `solve` is defined to find a solution for the problem. It uses two nested loops to iterate over possible values of i and j, where i starts from N//4+1 to 3*N//4+1 and j starts from 3*N//4+1 to 3500 (since 3501 is the upper limit in the loop).
The condition inside the nested loop checks if 4*i*j - N*(i+j) is greater than 0 and if N*i*j is divisible by 4*i*j - N*(i+j). If both conditions are met, it returns a tuple (i, j, N*i*j // (4*i*j - N*(i+j))).
The `solve` function is called with the input N, and the returned tuple is unpacked into variables h, n, w.
Finally, the values of h, n, and w are printed.

Let's go through the loops with N=2:
- i starts from 2//4+1 = 1 to 3*2//4+1 = 2 (only the value 1 is valid for i).
- j starts from 3*2//4+1 = 2 to 3501 (but the loop will break as soon as a valid j is found).

The first valid pair (i, j) that satisfies the conditions is (1, 4):
- 4*i*j - N*(i+j) = 4*1*4 - 2*(1+4) = 16 - 10 = 6, which is greater than 0.
- N*i*j is divisible by 4*i*j - N*(i+j) because 2*1*4 % 6 == 0.

Therefore, the function will return (1, 4, 2*1*4 // 6) which is (1, 4, 1).
