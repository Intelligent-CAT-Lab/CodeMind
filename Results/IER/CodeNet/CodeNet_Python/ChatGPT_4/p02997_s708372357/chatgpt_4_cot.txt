<<<Analysis>>>
The variables n and k are initialized to 5 and 3, respectively.
The variable edges is initialized with pairs of edges connecting node 1 to all other nodes, resulting in edges = [[1, 2], [1, 3], [1, 4], [1, 5]].
The variable cnt is calculated as the number of ways to choose 2 nodes out of n-1 nodes, which is (n-1)*(n-2)//2 = 6 in this case.
The variable ans is initialized to n-1, which is 4, representing the number of edges already in the list.

The code checks if cnt is less than k. Since cnt is 6 and k is 3, the condition is not met, so it proceeds to the else block.

The code enters a nested loop to potentially add more edges between nodes other than node 1. It will add edges between nodes i and j (where i ranges from 2 to n-1 and j ranges from i+1 to n) until cnt is not greater than k.

The first iteration of the nested loop would consider adding an edge between nodes 2 and 3. Since cnt (6) is greater than k (3), it decrements cnt by 1 (making it 5), increments ans by 1 (making it 5), and adds the edge [2, 3] to the edges list.

The loop continues to consider adding edges [2, 4], [2, 5], [3, 4], and [3, 5]. After adding the edge [2, 4], cnt becomes equal to k (3), so the loop breaks.

The final value of ans is 5, representing the total number of edges in the graph.

The code prints the value of ans and then prints each edge in the edges list on a new line.
