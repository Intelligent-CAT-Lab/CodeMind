<<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized to the string "oxoxoxoxoxoxox".
The variable batu is set to the count of "x" in the string, which is 7.
The variable maru is set to the count of "o" in the string, which is also 7.
The variable leng is set to the length of the string, which is 14.
The condition checks if 15 minus the count of "x" (batu) is greater than or equal to 8. Since batu is 7, 15 - 7 equals 8, which is equal to 8.
Since the condition is true (8 is greater than or equal to 8), the code will print "YES".
<<<Output>>>
YES
