The input string `t` is initialized to "PD?D??P".
The variable `n` is set to the length of `t`, which is 7.
An empty list `ans` is created to store the result.
The code enters a loop that iterates over each character in the input string.
If the current character is a '?', it appends 'D' to the `ans` list.
Otherwise, it appends the current character as it is to the `ans` list.
The loop processes the characters as follows:
- 'P' is appended to `ans`.
- 'D' is appended to `ans`.
- '?' is replaced by 'D' and appended to `ans`.
- 'D' is appended to `ans`.
- '?' is replaced by 'D' and appended to `ans`.
- '?' is replaced by 'D' and appended to `ans`.
- 'P' is appended to `ans`.
After the loop, the `ans` list contains ['P', 'D', 'D', 'D', 'D', 'D', 'P'].
The `join` function is used to convert the `ans` list back into a string.
The final string "PDDDDDP" is printed.
