<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 0.
The code then prints the result of an expression that uses a ternary-like operation.
The expression `0 * (n == 0)` evaluates to 0 because n is indeed 0, and the multiplication by 0 results in 0.
The expression `len(str(bin(n))[2:]) * (n != 0)` would normally calculate the length of the binary representation of n (excluding the '0b' prefix), but since n is 0, this part of the expression is effectively multiplied by 0, which results in 0.
Since both parts of the expression evaluate to 0, the final result printed is 0.
