The variable L is initialized to 4.
An empty list xs is created to store tuples.

The first for loop runs with m ranging from 0 to 20. The condition checks if (2 << m) is greater than L.
- When m is 0, (2 << m) equals 1, which is not greater than L.
- When m is 1, (2 << m) equals 2, which is not greater than L.
- When m is 2, (2 << m) equals 4, which is equal to L, so the loop continues.
- When m is 3, (2 << m) equals 8, which is greater than L, so the loop breaks.

Before breaking, the loop appends tuples to xs:
- For m = 0, it appends (1, 2, 0) and (1, 2, 1).
- For m = 1, it appends (2, 3, 0) and (2, 3, 2).
- For m = 2, it appends (3, 4, 0) and (3, 4, 4).

The variable b is set to 1 << m, which is 8.

The variable x is set to L - b, which is 4 - 8 = -4.

The second for loop runs with i ranging from m - 1 to 0 (inclusive), in reverse order.
- When i is 2, c equals 4. Since x is not greater than or equal to c, nothing happens.
- When i is 1, c equals 2. Since x is not greater than or equal to c, nothing happens.
- When i is 0, c equals 1. Since x is not greater than or equal to c, nothing happens.

The loop does not append any additional tuples to xs because x is negative and not greater than or equal to any c.

The output prints the number of vertices, which is m + 1 (4), and the number of edges, which is the length of xs (6).

Finally, the output prints each tuple in xs on a separate line.
