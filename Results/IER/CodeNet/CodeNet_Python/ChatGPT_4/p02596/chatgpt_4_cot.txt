The input is `101`. The code first checks the last digit of `k` to determine which branch of the conditional to execute. Since the last digit of `101` is `1`, it enters the `elif k % 10 == 1:` branch.

The variable `tmp` is initialized to `k * 7`, which is `101 * 7 = 707`. The variable `ans` is initialized to `1`.

The code enters a `while True` loop, which will continue until it either finds a number composed only of the digit `7` or exceeds the number of iterations given by `k`.

The first condition in the loop checks if `tmp` is composed only of `7`s by comparing the count of `7`s in `tmp` to the length of `tmp`. Since `707` contains two `7`s and one `0`, the condition is not met.

The code then checks the second digit of `tmp` (from the right), which is `0`. Since `0` is less than `7`, `num` is set to `7 - 0 = 7`.

`tmp2` is then calculated as `k * num`, which is `101 * 7 = 707`.

`tmp` is updated to be `tmp // 10 + tmp2`, which is `70 + 707 = 777`.

`ans` is incremented by `1`, resulting in `ans = 2`.

The loop continues, and now `tmp` is `777`, which is composed only of `7`s. The count of `7`s in `tmp` is equal to the length of `tmp`, so the condition is met.

The code prints `ans + len(str(tmp)) - 1`, which is `2 + 3 - 1 = 4`.

Since the condition is met, the loop breaks and the program ends, outputting `4`.
