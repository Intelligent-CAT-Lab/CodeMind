<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a, b, and x are initialized to 3, 5, and 4, respectively, from the input.
The code checks if x is greater than or equal to a and less than or equal to a + b.
In this case, a + b equals 3 + 5, which is 8.
Since x is 4, it is within the range [3, 8].
Therefore, the condition is true, and the code will execute the first branch of the if statement.
The code will print 'YES' as the output.
<<<Output>>>
YES
