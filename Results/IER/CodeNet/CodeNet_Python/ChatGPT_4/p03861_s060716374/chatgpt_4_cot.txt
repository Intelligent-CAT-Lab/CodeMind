<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a, b, and x are initialized to 4, 8, and 2, respectively.
The code calculates the number of multiples of x between a and b (inclusive).
First, it calculates the number of multiples of x up to b, which is b // x. This is 8 // 2, which equals 4.
Then, it calculates the number of multiples of x strictly less than a, which is (a - 1) // x. This is (4 - 1) // 2, which equals 1.
Finally, it subtracts the second result from the first to get the number of multiples of x between a and b, which is 4 - 1 = 3.
The code prints this result.
