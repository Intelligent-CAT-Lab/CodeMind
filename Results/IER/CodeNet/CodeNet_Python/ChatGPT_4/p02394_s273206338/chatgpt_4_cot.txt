The variables W, H, x, y, and r are initialized to 5, 4, 2, 2, and 1, respectively.
The code then checks if the circle with radius r and center (x, y) fits inside the rectangle with width W and height H without crossing the borders.
The variable 'left' checks if the leftmost point of the circle (x-r) is greater than or equal to 0. In this case, 2-1 >= 0, which is true.
The variable 'right' checks if the rightmost point of the circle (x+r) is less than or equal to W. In this case, 2+1 <= 5, which is true.
The variable 'top' checks if the topmost point of the circle (y+r) is less than or equal to H. In this case, 2+1 <= 4, which is true.
The variable 'bottom' checks if the bottommost point of the circle (y-r) is greater than or equal to 0. In this case, 2-1 >= 0, which is true.
Since all conditions are true, the product of left, right, top, and bottom is 1.
Therefore, the code will print "Yes" because the circle fits inside the rectangle without crossing the borders.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
