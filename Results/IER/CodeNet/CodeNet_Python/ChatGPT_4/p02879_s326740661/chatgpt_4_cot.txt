<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a and b are initialized to 2 and 5, respectively, from the input.
The code checks if both a and b are within the range [1, 9].
Since both 2 and 5 are within this range, the condition is true.
Therefore, the code executes the print statement inside the if block, which prints the product of a and b.
The product of 2 and 5 is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
