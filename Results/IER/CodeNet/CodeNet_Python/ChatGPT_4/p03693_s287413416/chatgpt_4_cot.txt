<<<Analysis>>>
The variables r, g, and b are initialized to 4, 3, and 2, respectively.
The variable answer is calculated as r*100 + g*10 + b, which is 4*100 + 3*10 + 2 = 432.
The code then checks if answer is divisible by 4.
432 is divisible by 4 (432 % 4 == 0), so the condition is true.
Since the condition is true, the code will print "YES".
<<<Output>>>
YES
