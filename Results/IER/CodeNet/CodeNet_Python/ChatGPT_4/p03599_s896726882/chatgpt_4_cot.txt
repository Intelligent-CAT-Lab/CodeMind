<<<Analysis>>>
The variables A, B, C, D, E, and F are initialized to 1, 2, 10, 20, 15, and 200, respectively.
The list 'a' is initialized with a single element, a list containing the strings '100' (representing 100 grams of water from source A with no sugar) and '0' (representing 0 grams of sugar).

The code then enters a nested loop structure that iterates over four variables i, j, k, and l, each ranging from 0 to 100. These variables represent the number of 100g water portions from source A and B, and the number of sugar portions from sources C and D, respectively.

For each combination of i, j, k, and l, the code calculates the total weight of water (x) and sugar (y) in grams. The condition `x+y>F` checks if the total weight exceeds the capacity of the container F (200g in this case). The condition `x==0` checks if there is no water, which is not allowed.

If neither condition is met, the code checks if the concentration of sugar in the solution is less than or equal to the saturation limit E (15% in this case). The concentration is calculated as `100*y/(x+y)` and the saturation limit as `(E*100)/(100+E)`.

If the concentration is within the limit, the code appends a list containing the strings of the total weight (x+y) and the weight of sugar (y) to the list 'a'.

After all iterations, the code sorts the list 'a' based on the concentration of sugar in descending order (highest concentration first) and prints the last element of the sorted list, which corresponds to the highest concentration of sugar that does not exceed the saturation limit.

The output will be the total weight of the solution and the weight of the sugar in the solution that has the highest sugar concentration without exceeding the saturation limit or the container's capacity.
