<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 100.
The variable c is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of coins.

First, the code calculates how many 25-cent coins can fit into n and adds this to c. Since 100 divided by 25 is 4, c is incremented by 4.
Next, n is updated to the remainder of n divided by 25, which is 0 because 100 is a multiple of 25.

The code then calculates how many 10-cent coins can fit into the updated n (which is now 0) and adds this to c. Since 0 divided by 10 is 0, c remains unchanged.

n is updated again to the remainder of n divided by 10, which is still 0.

The code calculates how many 5-cent coins can fit into the updated n (which is still 0) and adds this to c. Since 0 divided by 5 is 0, c remains unchanged.

Finally, the code adds the remainder of n divided by 5 to c. Since n is 0, this operation also adds 0 to c.

The final value of c, which is 4, is printed as the output.

<<<Output>>>
4
