<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a main function that reads two strings a and b from the input, concatenates them, and converts the result to an integer x. In this case, a is '1' and b is '21', so x becomes 121.
A nested function named judge is defined within main. This function iterates from 0 to 10000 (inclusive) and checks if the square of the current number i is equal to x. If it finds such an i, it returns True; otherwise, it returns False after the loop.
The judge function is called within main. Since 121 is a perfect square (11^2), the judge function will return True.
As a result, the main function will print "Yes" because the condition if judge() is satisfied.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
