<<<Analysis>>>
The variable x is initialized to 7.
The variable s is calculated as the integer division of x by 11, which is 0 since 7 divided by 11 is less than 1.
The variable cnt is initialized to s*2, which is 0*2 = 0.
The value of x is reduced by s*11, which is 0*11 = 0, so x remains 7.
The following conditions are checked:
- If x is 0, nothing happens (pass).
- If x is less than or equal to 6, cnt is increased by 1.
- If x is less than 11 (but greater than 6), cnt is increased by 2.
Since x is 7, which is greater than 6 but less than 11, cnt is increased by 2.
There is no 'else' case executed because x is within the specified range.
The final value of cnt, which is 2, is printed.
<<<Output>>>
2
