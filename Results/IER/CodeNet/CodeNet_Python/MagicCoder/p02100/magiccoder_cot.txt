I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
[Question]
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

<<<Analysis>>>
The input string S is "x^2+3x+2".
The length of S is 9.

The function expr() is defined to parse the expression. It starts by calling term() to parse the first term. Then it enters a loop that continues until the end of the string. In each iteration, it reads the next operator (either "+" or "-") and calls term() to parse the next term.

The function term() is defined to parse a term. It starts by calling num() to parse the coefficient of the term. If the next character is "x", it reads the exponent of the term. If the exponent is not specified, it defaults to 0.

The function num() is defined to parse a number. It starts by reading the first digit of the number. Then it enters a loop that continues until the end of the string or until it encounters a non-digit character. In each iteration, it multiplies the current number by 10 and adds the next digit.

The function f(P, x) is defined to evaluate the polynomial P at x. It calculates the sum of P[i]*(x**i) for i from 0 to 5.

The main part of the code calculates the roots of the polynomial. It starts by finding the highest degree of the polynomial. Then it iterates over the range -2000 to 2000 in reverse order. For each x, it checks if f(P, x) equals 0. If it does, it adds x to the list R.

Finally, it prints the list R as a string.

<<<Output>>>
"(x-2)(x-1)(x+1)(x+2)"
