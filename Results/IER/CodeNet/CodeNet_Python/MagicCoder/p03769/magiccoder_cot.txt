I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
[Question]
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

84

fact = [1]
for i in range(1, 101):
    fact.append(fact[-1]*i)
    
def C(a, b):
    return fact[a]//(fact[b]*fact[a-b])

def sC(a, b):
    ret = 0
    for i in range(min(b, a-b) + 1):
        ret += C(b, i) * C(a - b, i)
    return ret

def calc(n, k):
    if n<=0:
        return []
    i = 0
    while (1<<(i+1)) -1 <= n:
        i += 1
        
    ret = [str(k)] * (i+1)
    rem = n-((1<<i) - 1)
    kk = k + 1
    i += 1
    j = i // 2
    
    while j > 0:
        while True:
            tmp = sC(i, j)
            if tmp <= rem:
                ret.insert(j, str(kk))
                ret.append(str(kk))
                kk += 1
                rem -= tmp

            else:
                break
                
        j -= 1

<<<Analysis>>>
The code first calculates the factorial of numbers from 1 to 100 and stores them in the list fact. Then it defines two functions C and sC, which calculate the combination and the sum of combinations respectively.

The function calc is the main function that calculates the sequence X. It takes two parameters: n and k. If n is less than or equal to 0, it returns an empty list. Otherwise, it calculates the maximum power of 2 that is less than or equal to n, and then calculates the sequence X.

The input is read from the standard input and converted to an integer. The function calc is called with the input as the parameter. The length of the sequence X and the sequence X are printed.

<<<Output>>>
The output will be the length of the sequence X and the sequence X itself. For example, if the input is 7, the output will be:

5
1 1 2 2 3
