The code begins by defining several helper functions for reading input, calculating distances, and checking if two points are on the same side of a line.

The main function reads an integer n, which is the number of strings to be processed. If n is 0, the function breaks the loop and returns the result.

The function then defines a helper function f(n) that processes n strings. It first reads n strings and stores them in a list a. Then it iterates over the list and checks if each string is a substring of any other string in the list. If it is, it removes the string from the list.

The function then calculates the maximum length of common suffixes for each pair of strings in the list and stores the results in a 2D list d.
