I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
[Question]
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
L = int(input())

xs = []

for m in range(21):
    if (2 << m) > L:
        break
    xs.append((m+1, m+2, 0))
    xs.append((m+1, m+2, 1 << m))

b = 1 << m
x = L - b

for i in range(m - 1, -1, -1):
    c = 1 << i
    if x >= c:
        xs.append((i+1, m+1, b))
        x -= c
        b += c

print(m + 1, len(xs))

for x in xs:
    print(*x)

<<<Analysis>>>
The variable L is initialized to 4.
The list xs is initialized to an empty list.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 20. For each m in this range, it checks if 2 raised to the power of m is greater than L. If it is, it breaks the loop.
For each m, it appends a tuple to xs, which represents a possible operation. The first two elements of the tuple are the indices of the numbers being operated on, and the third element is the result of the operation.
The code then calculates the value of b and x.
The code then enters another loop that iterates from m - 1 to 0. For each i in this range, it calculates the value of c and checks if x is greater than or equal to c. If it is, it appends a tuple to xs, updates x and b, and decreases c.
Finally, the code prints the length of xs and each tuple in xs.
