I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
[Question]
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
n =int(input())
yes = True
primesand10=[10,11,13,17,19,23,29,31,37,41,43,47,53,59,61,67,71,73,79,83,89,97]
if n <= 10:
  yes = True
elif n <= 81:
  for prime in primesand10:
    if n%prime == 0:
      yes = False
      break
else:
  yes = False

if yes:print("Yes")
else: print("No")

<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 10.
The variable yes is initialized to True.
The list primesand10 contains prime numbers less than or equal to 10.
If n is less than or equal to 10, yes is set to True.
If n is less than or equal to 81, the code checks if n is divisible by any number in primesand10. If it is, yes is set to False and the loop is broken.
If n is greater than 81, yes is set to False.
Finally, the code prints "Yes" if yes is True and "No" if yes is False.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
