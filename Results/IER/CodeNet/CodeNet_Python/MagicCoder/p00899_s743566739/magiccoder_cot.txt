I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
[Question]
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

84

while True:

    ss = [ input() for _ in range(n) ]
    ts = [ s for s in ss if all ( t.find(s) < 0 for t in ss if not (t == s)) ]
    m = len(ts)

    def overlap(c, d):

        sd = ts[d]
        s = len(sc)
        return max ( s - i for i in range(s+1) if sd.startswith(sc[i:]) )

    ov = [ [ overlap(c,d) for d in range(m) ] for c in range(m)]

    memo = [ [ -1 for _ in range(1<<m) ] for _ in range(m) ]

    def rec(c, cs):
        if cs == 0: return 0
        if memo[c][cs] >= 0: return memo[c][cs]
        ans= max (ov[c][d] + rec(d, cs - (1<<d)) for d in range(n) if not (((1<<d) & cs) == 0))
        memo[c][cs] = ans
        return ans

    # naive version
    # c : the tail city
    # cs : cities to be used (set)
    # def rec(c, cs):

    # maxov =  max ( rec(i, { j for j in range (m) if not (j == i) } ) for i in range (m) )

    maxov =  max ( rec(i, ((1<<m) - 1) - (1<<i) ) for i in range (m) )
    ans = sum (len(t) for t in ts) - maxov

<<<Analysis>>>
The code first reads an integer n from the input. If n is 0, it breaks the loop.
Then it reads n strings from the input and stores them in the list ss.
It then creates a list ts, which contains the strings from ss that do not overlap with any other strings in ss.
The overlap function calculates the maximum overlap between two strings.
The rec function is a recursive function that calculates the maximum overlap between the cities.
The maxov variable is the maximum overlap between the cities.
The ans variable is the total length of the strings in ts minus the maximum overlap.
Finally, it prints the ans.
<<<Output>>>
The output will be the length of the strings in ts minus the maximum overlap.
