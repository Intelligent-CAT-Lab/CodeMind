I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
[Question]
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
n, a, b = map(int, raw_input().split())

def doit(a, b, mask):
    differ = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if mask & (1 << i) == 0 and (a ^ b) & (1 << i) != 0:
            differ = i
    same = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if mask & (1 << i) == 0 and i != differ:
            same = i
    if same == -1:
        return [a, b]
    return (doit(a, a ^ (1 << same), mask | (1 << differ)) +
            doit(a ^ (1 << same) ^ (1 << differ), b, mask | (1 << differ)))

if bin(a ^ b).count('1') % 2 != 1:
    print "NO"
else:
    print "YES"
    ret = doit(a, b, 0)
    print " ".join(map(str, ret))

<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n, variable a and variable b are initialized to 2, 1 and 3, respectively.
The function doit is defined to calculate the result.
The function doit is called with a, b and 0 as arguments.
The function doit checks if the number of 1s in the binary representation of a and b is odd. If it is not, it prints "NO". If it is, it prints "YES" and the result of doit is printed.
The function doit calculates the result by iterating over the bits of a and b. If the bit is different in a and b, it calculates the result by changing the bit in a and b.
<<<Output>>>
YES
