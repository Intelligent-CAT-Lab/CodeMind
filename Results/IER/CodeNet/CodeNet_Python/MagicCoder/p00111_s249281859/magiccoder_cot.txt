I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
[Question]
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```?D-C'KOPUA```

@@ Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The code first defines a dictionary called encode and decode. The encode dictionary maps each character to its binary representation. The decode dictionary maps each binary representation to its corresponding character.

The code then enters a loop that reads input until it encounters an EOFError. For each input, it converts each character to its binary representation and concatenates them into a string called code0.

Then, it iterates over the characters in code0. If a sequence of characters is found in the decode dictionary, it adds the corresponding character to the output string code and resets the temporary string temp.

Finally, it prints the output string code.

The input "?D-C'KOPUA" is converted to binary as follows:

"?" -> "11111"
"D" -> "00100"
"-" -> "11101"
"C" -> "0001"
"'" -> "000000"
"K" -> "01001"
"O" -> "00111"
"P" -> "111"
"U" -> "00101"
"A" -> "10010000"

The binary sequence "11111001001111010001000011110010010000" is then decoded to "?D-C'KOPUA".

<<<Output>>>
?D-C'KOPUA
