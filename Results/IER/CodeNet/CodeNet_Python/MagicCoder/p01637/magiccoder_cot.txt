I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
[Question]
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(a,b,c):
    return a*b<100*c
m,rd,rr,cd,cr=map(int,input().split())
ex=cd*100//rd
if(f(ex,rd,cd)):ex+=1
ey=cr*100//rr
if(f(ey,rr,cr)):ey+=1
print(m-ex-ey if m-ex-ey>=0 else -1)

<<<Analysis>>>
The code first reads the input and splits it into 5 variables: m, rd, rr, cd, cr.
Then it calculates the value of ex and ey.
The function f(a,b,c) returns True if a*b<100*c, otherwise it returns False.
If the function f(ex,rd,cd) returns True, ex is incremented by 1.
If the function f(ey,rr,cr) returns True, ey is incremented by 1.
Finally, it prints the result of m-ex-ey if it is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise it prints -1.
<<<Output>>>
The output will depend on the input values.
