I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
[Question]
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
n,x,y = map(int,input().split())
x,y = x-1,y-1

D = [0 for _ in range(n+1)]
    
for i in range(n-1):
    for j in range(i+1,n):
        dist1 = j-i
        dist2 = abs(i-x) +1 + abs(j-y)
        dist = min(dist1,dist2)
        D[dist] = D[dist]+1

<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n, variable x and variable y are initialized to 5, 2 and 4, respectively.
x and y are decremented by 1 to make them 1 and 3, respectively.
A list D is initialized with n+1 zeros.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n-2.
For each pair of numbers i and j in this range, it calculates the distance between them and stores it in dist1.
The code calculates the distance between i and x, plus 1, and the distance between j and y, and stores it in dist2.
The code then calculates the minimum of dist1 and dist2 and stores it in dist.
The value at index dist in D is incremented by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code enters another loop that iterates from 1 to n-1.
For each number i in this range, it prints the value at index i in D.
