I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
[Question]
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
S = input()
l = len(S)
mod = 10**9+7
dp = [[0]*13 for _ in range(l+1)]
dp[0][0] = 1

for i,s in enumerate(S):
    for j in range(13):
        if(s=="?"):
            for k in range(10):
                dp[i+1][((j*10)+k)%13] += dp[i][j]
                dp[i+1][((j*10)+k)%13]%=mod
        else:
            dp[i+1][((j*10)+int(s))%13] += dp[i][j]
            dp[i+1][((j*10)+int(s))%13]%=mod
print(dp[l][5])

[Question]
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```??2??5```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

@@ Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable S is initialized to "??2??5".
The length of S is calculated and stored in l.
The mod variable is initialized to 10^9+7.
A 2D list dp is initialized with dimensions (l+1)x13.
dp[0][0] is set to 1.

The code then enters a loop that iterates over each character s in S.
For each character s, the code enters another loop that iterates over each possible remainder j when the current number is divided by 13.
If s is "?", the code enters another loop that iterates over each possible digit k. For each k, it updates dp[i+1][((j*10)+k)%13] by adding the current value of dp[i][j] to it, and then takes the modulus of the result with mod.
If s is not "?", it updates dp[i+1][((j*10)+int(s))%13] by adding the current value of dp[i][j] to it, and then takes the modulus of the result with mod.

After the loops finish, the code prints the value of dp[l][5], which is the number of ways to make the remainder of the final number when divided by 13 equal to 5.
