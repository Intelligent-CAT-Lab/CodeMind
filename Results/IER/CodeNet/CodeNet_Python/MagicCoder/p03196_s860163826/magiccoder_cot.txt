I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
[Question]
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

<<<Analysis>>>
The code first defines a function getprime(n) to get all prime numbers less than n. Then it defines another function factorization(n) to factorize n into prime numbers.

The input n and p are taken from the user. If p is 1, the output is 1. Otherwise, it calculates the prime factorization of p and then calculates the answer.

The prime factorization of p is stored in a dictionary d. For each prime number k in d, if the power of k in the factorization of p is greater than or equal to n, it multiplies the answer by k to the power of the quotient of the power of k in the factorization of p divided by n.

Finally, it prints the answer.

<<<Output>>>
The output will be the smallest number m such that m^n divides p.

For example, if n=3 and p=24, the output will be 2 because 2^3 divides 24.
