I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
[Question]
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

<<<Output>>>

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
from itertools import accumulate

S = input()
N = len(S)

A = [0] + list(accumulate(1 if s == "1" else -1 for s in S))

ma = max(A)
cur = A[-1]
C = [ma - cur]
for a in reversed(A):
    cur = max(a, cur)
    C.append(ma - cur)

d, e = 0, 0
D, E = A[:], A[:]
for i, (s, c) in enumerate(zip(S, reversed(C[:-1])), 1):
    if s == '?' and c >= d + 2:
        d += 2
    if s == '?' and c >= e + 1:
        e += 2
    D[i] += d
    E[i] += e

print(min(max(D) - min(D), max(E) - min(E)))

[Question]
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```0??```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

@@ Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The input string S is initialized to "0??", which is a string of length 3.
The variable N is initialized to the length of S, which is 3.
The list A is initialized to [0] followed by the accumulated sum of 1s and -1s in S.
The variable ma is initialized to the maximum value in A.
The variable cur is initialized to the last value in A.
The list C is initialized to [ma - cur].
The code then enters a loop that iterates from the last to the first element in A, updating cur and appending ma - cur to C.
The variable d and e are initialized to 0.
The lists D and E are initialized to A.
The code then enters another loop that iterates over the elements in S and C, updating D and E accordingly.
Finally, the code prints the minimum of the differences between the maximum and minimum values in D and E.
