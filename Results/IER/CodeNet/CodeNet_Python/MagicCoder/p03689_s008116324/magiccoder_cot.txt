I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
[Question]
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
H,W,h,w = map(int,input().split())
if H%h == 0 and W%w == 0:
    print('No')
    exit()
print('Yes')

n = 1000
if W%w:
    m = -((w-1)*n + 1)
    row = [m if i%w==w-1 else n for i in range(W)]
    for i in range(H):
        print(*row)
else:
    m = -((h-1)*n + 1)
    for i in range(H):
        if i%h == h-1:
            print(*([m] * W))
        else:
            print(*([n] * W))

<<<Analysis>>>
The variable H, W, h, and w are initialized to 3, 3, 2, and 2, respectively.
The code checks if H is divisible by h and W is divisible by w. If either of these conditions is not met, it prints 'No' and exits the program. If both conditions are met, it prints 'Yes'.
If W is not divisible by w, it calculates m as -((w-1)*n + 1) and creates a list row of length W with m at every w-th position and n elsewhere. It then prints row H times.
If W is divisible by w, it prints n H times, but with m at every h-th position.
