I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
[Question]
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

<<<Analysis>>>
The input string S is read from the standard input.
The length of S is calculated and stored in n.
Two lists, sho and dai, are initialized with n elements each.
The code then enters two loops.
The first loop iterates over S, and for each character, it checks if it is ">". If it is, it sets sho[i] to 0. If it is not, it sets sho[i] to the previous value of sho[i-1] plus 1.
The second loop does the same as the first loop, but it iterates over S in reverse order.
After the loops, a new list, seq, is created by taking the maximum value between each corresponding element of sho and dai.
Finally, the code prints the sum of all elements in seq.
