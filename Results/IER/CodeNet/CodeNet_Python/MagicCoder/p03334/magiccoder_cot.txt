I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
[Question]
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
from math import sqrt
from itertools import product

import numpy as np

def judge(D):
  n = 1
  while D%4==0:
    n *= 2
    D //= 4

  def h1(x,y):
    return ~(x//n+y//n)%2
  def h2(x,y):
    return ~(x//n)%2

  return h1 if D%2==1 else h2

N,D1,D2 = map(int,input().split())
j1,j2 = judge(D1),judge(D2)
cnt = 0
for x,y in product(range(N*2),repeat=2):
  if j1(x,y) and j2(x,y):
    print(x,y)
    cnt += 1
    if cnt >= N*N:
      break

<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable D1 and variable D2 are initialized to 2, 1 and 2, respectively.
The function judge is defined to calculate the function h1 and h2 based on the input D.
The function j1 and j2 are initialized to the return values of judge function with D1 and D2 as input.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over all possible pairs of x and y in the range [0, N*2) and checks if both h1 and h2 are true for each pair. If they are, it prints the pair and increments the counter. If the counter reaches N*N, it breaks the loop.
