I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
[Question]
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

<<<Output>>>

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:

import sys

A, B, C, D, E, F = map(int, input().split())
wdp = [0] * (F + 1)
sdp = [0] * (F + 1)
wdp[0] = 1
sdp[0] = 1
resa = 100 * A
resb = 0
for i in range(F + 1):
  if i + A * 100 <= F: wdp[i + A * 100] += wdp[i]
  if i + B * 100 <= F: wdp[i + B * 100] += wdp[i]
for i in range(F + 1):
  if i + C <= F: sdp[i + C] += sdp[i]
  if i + D <= F: sdp[i + D] += sdp[i]
for i in range(1, F + 1):
  if sdp[i] == 0: continue
  w = 0
  for j in range(1, F + 1):
    if i + j > F: break
    if wdp[j] == 0: continue
    if i <= j * E // 100:
      w = j
      break
  if w == 0: continue
  #print(i, i + w)
  #print(float(i) / float(i + w))
  if resb / resa < float(i) / float(i + w):
    resb = i
    resa = i + w
print(resa, resb)

<<<Analysis>>>
The variables A, B, C, D, E, F are initialized to 1, 2, 10, 20, 15, 200, respectively.
Two arrays wdp and sdp are initialized to 0. wdp will be used to store the number of ways to get the weight, and sdp will be used to store the number of ways to get the sugar.
wdp[0] and sdp[0] are set to 1, indicating that there is 1 way to get 0 weight and 0 sugar.
The code then enters two loops. The first loop adds A * 100 to the weight and the second loop adds C to the sugar.
The second loop does the same for B * 100 and D.
The third loop calculates the number of ways to get the weight and sugar.
The code then enters a loop to find the maximum ratio of weight to sugar.
The code prints the maximum ratio of weight to sugar.
<<<Output>>>
200 190
