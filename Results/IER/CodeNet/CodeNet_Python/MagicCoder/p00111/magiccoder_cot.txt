I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

@@ Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The code first defines two dictionaries, tableA and tableB, which map characters to binary strings and binary strings to characters respectively.

The code then enters a loop that reads a line of input, converts each character to its binary representation using tableA, and concatenates them.

After reading the entire line, it checks if the concatenated string is in tableB. If it is, it adds the corresponding character to ans and resets tmp to an empty string.

Finally, it prints ans.

The input "?D-C'KOPUA" is converted to binary as follows:

"?" -> "11111"
"D" -> "01001"
"-" -> "10010010"
"C" -> "010000"
"'" -> "000010"
"K" -> "0110"
"O" -> "00100"
"P" -> "111"
"U" -> "10011100"
"A" -> "10010000"

The binary string is "111110100100100100000000101100011110010010010000"

The binary string is split into substrings of length 5 or 6, depending on whether the next character is in tableB.

The substrings "11111", "01001", "10010010", "010000", "000010", "0110", "00100", "111", "10011100", and "10010000" are not in tableB, so they are ignored.

The remaining substrings "01000", "00101", "10011010", "0001", "000000", "000011", "10011000", "00110", "00111", "10011110", "000001", "10011011", "0101", "10011001", "0110", "00100", "10011111", "1000", "00110", "00111", "10011101", "000010", "10010010", "10010011" are in tableB.

The corresponding characters are "E", "O", "G", "D", " ", ",", "-", "C", "S", "T", "N", "M", "K", "L", "O", "Q", "R", "S", "T", "V", "W", "X", "Y", "Z", "?".

The output is "EOD-CGOSUA".
