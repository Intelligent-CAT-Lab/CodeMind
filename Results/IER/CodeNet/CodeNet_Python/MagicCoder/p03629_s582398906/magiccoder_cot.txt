I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
[Question]
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

import sys

from collections import *
from bisect import *

A = input()[:-1]
K = [0]*(len(A)) #K[i]: A[i+1:]の部分列に含まれない最小の文字列の長さ
s = set()
cnt = 1

for i in range(len(A)-1, -1, -1):
    K[i] = cnt
    s.add(A[i])
    
    if len(s)==26:
        cnt += 1
        s = set()

d = defaultdict(list)

for i in range(len(A)):
    d[A[i]].append(i)

ans = []
now = -1

for i in range(cnt):
    for alpha in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':
        idx = bisect_right(d[alpha], now)
        
        if idx==len(d[alpha]):
            ans.append(alpha)
            break
        
        nex = d[alpha][idx]
        
        if K[nex]==cnt-i-1:
            now = nex
            ans.append(alpha)
            break

print(''.join(ans))

<<<Analysis>>>
The input string A is read and stored.
A list K is initialized with zeros, which will be used to store the minimum length of the substring that does not contain each character.
A set s is initialized to store the characters that have been encountered so far.
A counter cnt is initialized to 1.

The code then enters a loop that iterates from the end of the string to the beginning. For each character in the string, it adds the character to the set s and increments the counter cnt if the size of the set s becomes 26.

A defaultdict d is initialized to store the indices of each character in the string.

The code then enters another loop that iterates from 0 to cnt-1. For each character in the alphabet, it finds the index of the next character that is not in the set s and appends it to the answer list.

Finally, the code prints the answer list as a string.

<<<Output>>>
The output will be the lexicographically smallest string that contains each character in the input string exactly once.
