I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
[Question]
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

            E.append((i, i+1, 0))
            E.append((i, i+1, x))
        if l - x >= 2**(n-1):
            E.append((i, n-1, l-x))
            l -= x
    print(n, len(E))
    for u, v, x in E:
        print(u+1, v+1, x)

l = int(input())

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:

<<<Analysis>>>
The variable l is initialized to 4.
The while loop checks if 2^n is less than or equal to l. If it is, n is incremented by 1. The loop continues until 2^n is greater than l.
The variable n is the number of bits needed to represent l.
The list E is initialized to an empty list.
The for loop iterates from n-1 to 0 (inclusive). For each iteration, x is set to 2^i.
If i is not equal to n-1, two edges are added to the list E. The first edge connects node i to node i+1 with weight 0, and the second edge connects node i to node i+1 with weight x.
If l - x is greater than or equal to 2^(n-1), another edge is added to the list E. This edge connects node i to node n-1 with weight l-x.
l is then updated by subtracting x.
Finally, the number of nodes, the number of edges, and the edges themselves are printed.
