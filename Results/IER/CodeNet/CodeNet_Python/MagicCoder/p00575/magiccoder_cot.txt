You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
[Question]
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import math as m
A,B,C=(float(x) for x in input().split())

a=m.ceil(C/A)

s=7*A+B
t=C//s
#sは1週間にもらえるコインの枚数
u=C-s*t
#uは端数
v=m.ceil(u/A)

if v<=7:
    b=7*t+v
    
else:
    b=7*t+7
    
if a>b:
    print(int(b))
else:
    print(int(a))

<<<Analysis>>>
The variables A, B, and C are initialized to 3, 0, and 10, respectively.
The variable a is calculated by rounding up the result of C divided by A.
The variable s is calculated by adding 7 times A and B.
The variable t is calculated by rounding down the result of C divided by s.
The variable u is calculated by subtracting s times t from C.
The variable v is calculated by rounding up the result of u divided by A.
If v is less than or equal to 7, the variable b is calculated by adding 7 times t and v.
If v is greater than 7, the variable b is calculated by adding 7 times t and 7.
Finally, the code prints the smaller value between a and b.
<<<Output>>>
