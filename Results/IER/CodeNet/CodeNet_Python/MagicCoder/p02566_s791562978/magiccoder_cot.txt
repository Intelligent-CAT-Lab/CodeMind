I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
[Question]
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

@@ Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The input string is converted to an array of integers representing the ASCII values of the characters in the string. The suffix array is then computed using the suffix_array function. The LCP array is then computed using the lcp_array function. The sum of the LCP array is subtracted from the total number of substrings in the string, which gives the number of distinct substrings in the string.

The input string is "abcbcba". The ASCII values of the characters are 97 (a), 98 (b), 99 (c), 98 (b), 97 (a), 98 (b), 99 (c). The suffix array is [6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0], which represents the order of the suffixes in the string. The LCP array is [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5], which represents the length of the longest common prefix of consecutive suffixes.

The total number of substrings in the string is 7*8/2 = 28. The sum of the LCP array is 0+1+2+3+4+5 = 15. Therefore, the number of distinct substrings is 28 - 15 = 13.
