The code is a Python program that calculates the number of ways to choose k elements from a set of n+m elements, where n and m are the number of elements in two different sets, and k is the number of elements to choose. The sets are disjoint, meaning that no element can belong to both sets.

The program reads the input in the form of three integers n, m, and k. If n is 0, the program breaks the loop and ends.

The function f(n, m, k) calculates the number of ways to choose k elements from a set of n+m elements. It uses the combination formula to calculate the number of ways to choose i elements from the first set and j elements from the second set, where i and j are non-negative integers and i+j=k.

The function f(n, m, k) returns the number of ways to choose k elements from a set of n+m elements.

The main function reads the input, calls the function f(n, m, k), and prints the result.

The program uses the modulo operation to handle large numbers. The modulo operation is used to ensure that the result is within the range of a 32-bit integer.
