I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
[Question]
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
# ABC074C - Sugar Water
# input
a, b, c, d, e, f = list(map(int, input().rstrip().split()))
A = a * 100
B = b * 100

# default values
x, y = min(a, b) * 100, 0
dens = y / x


# exhaustive search
for i in range(f // A + 1):
    for j in range(((f - A * i) // B) + 1):
        if i == 0 and j == 0:
            continue
        water = i * A + j * B
        rest = f - water
        for k in range(rest // c + 1):
            for l in range((rest - c * k) // d + 1):
                sugar = c * k + d * l
                total = water + sugar

                if sugar / total > e / (e + 100):  # compare to e (the max density)
                    break
                else:
                    if sugar / total > dens:
                        dens = sugar / total
                        x, y = total, sugar
print(x, y)

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:

<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a, b, c, d, e, f are initialized to 1, 2, 10, 20, 15, 200, respectively.
A and B are the maximum amount of sugar and water that can be used, respectively.
x and y are the total amount of water and sugar that can be used, respectively.
dens is the density of the solution.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to f // A (inclusive), meaning it will consider the number of times A can be used.
For each number i in this range, it enters another loop that iterates from 0 to (f - A * i) // B (inclusive), meaning it will consider the number of times B can be used.
The code then enters another loop that iterates from 0 to (f - A * i - B * j) // c (inclusive), meaning it will consider the number of times C can be used.
For each number k in this range, it enters another loop that iterates from 0 to (f - A * i - B * j - C * k) // d (inclusive), meaning it will consider the number of times D can be used.
The code checks if the density of the solution is greater than the maximum density e / (e + 100). If it is, it breaks the loop.
If the density of the solution is greater than the current density, it updates the density and the total amount of water and sugar.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the total amount of water and sugar that can be used to achieve the maximum density.
