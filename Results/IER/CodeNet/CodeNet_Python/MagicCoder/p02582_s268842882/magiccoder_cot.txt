You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
[Question]
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
S = input()

cur_l, max_l = 0, 0

for s in S:
  if s == 'R':
    cur_l += 1
  else: # s == 'R'
    if cur_l > max_l:
      max_l = cur_l
    cur_l = 0

if cur_l > max_l:
  max_l = cur_l

print(max_l)

<<<Analysis>>>
The variable S is initialized to "RRS".
variable cur_l and max_l are initialized to 0 and 0, respectively.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each character in S.
If the character is 'R', it increments cur_l by 1.
If the character is not 'R', it checks if cur_l is greater than max_l. If it is, it updates max_l to cur_l. Then it resets cur_l to 0.
After the loop finishes, it checks if cur_l is greater than max_l. If it is, it updates max_l to cur_l.
Finally, it prints the final value of max_l, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
