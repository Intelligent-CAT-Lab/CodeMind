The input string s is "acpc".
The alphabet is "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz".
The length of the string is 4.
The dictionary alpha2 is created where each alphabet is mapped to its index.
The memo list is initialized with 26 empty lists.
The mod variable is set to 10^9+7.
For each character in the string, the index of the character in the string is appended to the corresponding list in memo.
The dp list is initialized with 0s.
The ans variable is initialized to 0.
For each pair of indices i and j in the string, if dp[i][j] is not 0, then for each alphabet, the number of pairs of indices (x, y) such that x is the smallest index in the list of the alphabet and y is the largest index in the list of the alphabet and x < y is calculated. The ans variable is updated accordingly.
