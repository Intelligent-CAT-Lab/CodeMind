The output of the code for the input 4 would be 10. This is because the divisors of 1, 2, and 4 are 1, 2, and 4, and their sum is 7. The divisors of 3 are 1 and 3, and their sum is 4. Therefore, the sum of the divisors of all numbers from 1 to 4 is 7 + 4 = 11.

The output of the code for the input 10 would be 105. This is because the divisors of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10, and their sum is 55. Therefore, the sum of the divisors of all numbers from 1 to 10 is 55.
