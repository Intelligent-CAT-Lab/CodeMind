I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
[Question]
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

def divide_h(h, w):

    for x in range(1, h):
        h_rem = h - x
        s_A = x * w

        # vertical devide
        w1 = w // 2
        s_B = w1 * h_rem
        s_C = (w - w1) * h_rem

        tmp = max(s_A, s_B, s_C) - min(s_A, s_B, s_C)
        if min_diff > tmp:
            min_diff = tmp

        # horizontal devide
        h1 = h_rem // 2
        s_B = w * h1
        s_C = w * (h_rem - h1)
        tmp = max(s_A, s_B, s_C) - min(s_A, s_B, s_C)
        if min_diff > tmp:
            min_diff = tmp

    return min_diff



H, W = map(int, input().split())

a1 = divide_h(H, W)
a2 = divide_h(W, H)

print(min(a1, a2))

The function divide_h is defined to calculate the minimum difference between the maximum and minimum areas of three rectangles. The function takes two parameters: h and w.

The function then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to h (exclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to h-1. For each number x in this range, it calculates the remaining height h_rem and the area of the first rectangle s_A.

The function then calculates the areas of the other two rectangles s_B and s_C by dividing the width w and height h_rem by 2. It calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum areas of these three rectangles and updates min_diff if the current difference is smaller.

The function repeats the process for the width and height swapped.

Finally, the function returns the minimum difference found.

The input is read using the map function to split the input string into two integers H and W. The function divide_h is called twice with H and W as parameters, and the minimum of the results is printed.
