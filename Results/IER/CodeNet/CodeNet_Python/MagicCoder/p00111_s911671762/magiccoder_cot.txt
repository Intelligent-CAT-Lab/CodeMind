I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
[Question]
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

<<<Analysis>>>
The code first defines a dictionary L that maps characters to their Morse code equivalents. It then defines a second dictionary de that maps characters to their binary equivalents.

The code then enters a loop that reads input until an exception is raised (indicating the end of input). For each input string, it converts each character to its Morse code equivalent and concatenates them into a single string.

The code then enters another loop that continues until the Morse code string is empty. For each 6-bit chunk of the Morse code string, it checks if it is a valid Morse code character. If it is, it adds the corresponding character to the output string and removes the chunk from the Morse code string.

Finally, the code prints the output string.

<<<Output>>>
The output of the code execution given the input "?D-C'KOPUA" would be "HELLO WORLD".
