I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
[Question]
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())

can_be_ans = False
for k in range(1, 10 ** 5):
    if 2 * N == k * (k - 1):
        can_be_ans = True
        break
    elif 2 * N < k * (k - 1):
        break
        
if not can_be_ans:
    print("No")
else:
    print("Yes")
    print(k)
    s_grid = [[0 for i in range(k - 1)] for j in range(k)]
    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        for j in range(k - i):
            s_grid[i - 1][i - 1 + j] = (i - 1) * k - i * (i - 1) // 2 + 1 + j
            s_grid[i + j][i - 1] = (i - 1) * k - i * (i - 1) // 2 + 1 + j
            
    for row in s_grid:
        print(k - 1, end=" ")
        print(" ".join(map(str, row)))

<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized to 3.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 10^5 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 10^5.
For each number k in this range, it checks if 2 * N equals k * (k - 1). If it does, it sets can_be_ans to True and breaks the loop. If 2 * N is less than k * (k - 1), it breaks the loop.
If can_be_ans is still False after the loop finishes, it prints "No". Otherwise, it prints "Yes" and the value of k.
Then it creates a 2D list s_grid with k rows and k - 1 columns. For each row i in the range from 1 to k + 1, it fills the columns from i - 1 to k - i with the value of the formula (i - 1) * k - i * (i - 1) // 2 + 1 + j.
Finally, it prints the 2D list s_grid.
