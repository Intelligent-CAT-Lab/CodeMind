I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
[Question]
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

<<<Analysis>>>
The code is a simple binary to text converter. It first maps each character to its binary representation from the dictionary d1. Then it checks if the length of the binary string is not a multiple of 5, it appends '0's to the end of the string until it is. After that, it splits the binary string into 5-bit chunks and maps each chunk to its corresponding character from the dictionary d2. The output is the text representation of the input.

The input "PETER POTTER" is converted to binary as follows:

P -> 01010
E -> 01110
T -> 01010
E -> 01110
R -> 01001

P -> 01010
O -> 00111
T -> 01010
T -> 01010
E -> 01110
R -> 01001

So the binary string is "01010011101010010100101110010101001010010111001010100101001".

After appending '0's to make the length a multiple of 5, the binary string becomes "010100111010100101001011100101010010100101110010101001010010".

Finally, the binary string is split into 5-bit chunks and mapped to their corresponding characters:

01010 -> E
01110 -> R
01010 -> E
01001 -> R
01010 -> E
01110 -> R
01010 -> E
01001 -> R
01010 -> E
01110 -> R
01010 -> E
01001 -> R

So the output is "ERERERERERER".

<<<Output>>>
ERERERERERER
