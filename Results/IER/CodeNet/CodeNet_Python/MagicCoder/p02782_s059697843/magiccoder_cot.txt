I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
[Question]
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
r1, c1, r2, c2 = map(int, input().split())
L = 10 ** 9 + 7

# 互除法
def get_euclidian (A, B):
  if B == 1:
    return (1)
  else:
    return (int((1 - A * get_euclidian (B, A % B)) / B))

# 階乗計算
F = [1]
for i in range(1, r2 + c2 + 3):
  F.append((F[i - 1] * i) % L)

# 組み合わせ計算
def get_combi (n, r):

  Euc = get_euclidian(L, (F[r] * F[n - r]) % L)
  return ((F[n] * Euc) % L)

combi1 = get_combi(r2 + c2 + 2, r2 + 1)
combi2 = get_combi(r2 + c1 + 1, c1)
combi3 = get_combi(r1 + c2 + 1, r1)
combi4 = get_combi(r1 + c1, r1)

print ((int(combi1 - combi2 - combi3 + combi4) + L) % L)

<<<Analysis>>>
The variables r1, c1, r2, c2 are initialized to 1, 1, 2, 2, respectively.
The variable L is initialized to 10^9 + 7.
The function get_euclidian is defined to calculate the greatest common divisor of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.
The list F is initialized with the first 3 elements as 1, and then each subsequent element is calculated as the product of the previous element and its index.
The function get_combi is defined to calculate the combination of two numbers.
The variables combi1, combi2, combi3, combi4 are calculated using the get_combi function.
The final output is calculated as the sum of combi1, combi2, combi3, and combi4, and then the result is modulo L.
