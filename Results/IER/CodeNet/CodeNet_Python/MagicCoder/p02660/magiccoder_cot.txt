I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
[Question]
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

    f = 3
    while f * f <= n:

            a.append(f)
            n //= f
        else:
            f += 2
    if n != 1:
        a.append(n)
    return a

n = int(input())
res = prime_factorize(n)
if len(res) == 1:
  print(1)
else:
  cnt = 0
  c = None
  p = 0
  l = set()
  for r in res:
    if c == r:
      p += 1
      if not p in l:
        l.add(p)
        p = 0
        cnt += 1
    else:
      l.clear()
      p = 0
      l.add(1)
      cnt += 1
      c = r
  print(cnt)

<<<Analysis>>>
The function prime_factorize is defined to factorize a number into its prime factors. The input number n is converted into its prime factors and stored in the list a.
The input number is then converted into an integer and stored in the variable n.
The prime factors of n are stored in the list res.
If the length of res is 1, it means n is a prime number and the output is 1.
Otherwise, the code counts the number of distinct prime factors in res.
The distinct prime factors are stored in the set l.
The code then prints the count of distinct prime factors.
