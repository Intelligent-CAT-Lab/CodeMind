I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
[Question]
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

<<<Analysis>>>
The code first reads an integer n from the input. If n is 0, it breaks the loop. Otherwise, it reads n strings from the input and stores them in the list S.

Then it initializes a list dup of length n with all elements as 0. This list will be used to mark the duplicate strings.

The code then enters a loop that iterates over the strings in S. For each string si, it checks if there is another string sj in S such that si is a substring of sj. If it is, it marks the corresponding element in dup as 1.

After the loop, it removes the duplicate strings from S and updates n accordingly.

Then it initializes a 2D list P of size n*n. For each pair of strings si and sj in S, it calculates the length of the longest common prefix of si and sj and stores it in P[i][j].

Finally, it calculates the minimum length of the shortest superstring that can be formed from the remaining strings in S. It uses depth-first search (dfs) to find the minimum length.

<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will be the minimum length of the shortest superstring that can be formed from the remaining strings in S.
