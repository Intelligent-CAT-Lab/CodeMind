I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
[Question]
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
S = input()
N = len(S)
mod = 10**9 + 7

p = 1

dp = [[0]*13 for _ in range(N+1)]
dp[0][0] = 1

for i in range(1,N+1):
  if S[-i] == '?':
    for k in range(10):
      a = (k * p) % 13
      for j in range(13):
        dp[i][j] += dp[i-1][j-a] % mod
        dp[i][j] %= mod
  else:
    a = (int(S[-i]) * p) % 13
    for j in range(13):
      dp[i][j] += dp[i-1][j-a] % mod
  p = (p * 10) % 13

print(dp[N][5])

[Question]
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```??2??5```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

<<<Analysis>>>
The variable S is initialized to "??2??5".
The variable N is initialized to the length of S, which is 7.
The variable mod is initialized to 10^9 + 7.
The variable p is initialized to 1.
The 2D list dp is initialized with 0s.
dp[0][0] is set to 1.

The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N+1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 8.

For each number i in this range, if the i-th digit from the end of S is '?', the code calculates the remainder of the product of the current digit and p divided by 13, and adds it to a. Then, for each j in the range from 0 to 12, it adds the value of dp[i-1][j-a] to dp[i][j] and takes the modulus of mod.

If the i-th digit from the end of S is not '?', the code calculates the remainder of the product of the current digit and p divided by 13, and adds it to a. Then, for each j in the range from 0 to 12, it adds the value of dp[i-1][j-a] to dp[i][j] and takes the modulus of mod.

After the loop finishes, the code prints the value of dp[N][5], which is the number of ways to make the remainder of the sum of the digits of S divided by 13 equal to 5.

<<<Output>>>
The output of the code execution is 2.
