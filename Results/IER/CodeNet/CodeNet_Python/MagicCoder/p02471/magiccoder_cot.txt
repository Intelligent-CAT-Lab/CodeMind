I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
[Question]
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

<<<Analysis>>>
The code first reads two integers a and b from the input. It then calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of a and b using the Euclidean algorithm. The gcd is then used to calculate the coefficients x and y such that a * x + b * y = gcd.

The code then calculates the coordinates of the closest point to the origin (0, 0) on the line a * x + b * y = gcd. The coordinates are calculated by moving in the direction of the line from the origin, and stopping when the distance to the origin is greater than or equal to the distance to the previous point.

Finally, the code prints the coordinates of the point.

<<<Output>>>
The output will be the coordinates of the closest point to the origin on the line a * x + b * y = gcd. For the input "4 12", the output will be "2 -1".
