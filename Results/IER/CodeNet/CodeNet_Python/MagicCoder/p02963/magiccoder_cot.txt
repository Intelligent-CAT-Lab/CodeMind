I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
[Question]
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
S = int(input())

X1 = 0
Y1 = 0

tmp = int(S**0.5)
if tmp**2 >= S:
    X2 = Y3 = tmp
else:
    X2 = Y3 = tmp+1

rest = X2**2 - S

if rest == 0:
    X3 = Y2 = 0
else:
    if rest < 10**9:
        X3 = 1
        Y2 = rest
    else:
        for i in range(2, int(rest**0.5)+2):
            if rest % i == 0:
                X3 = i
                Y2 = rest // i

print(X1, Y1, X2, Y2, X3, Y3)

<<<Analysis>>>
The variable S is initialized to 3.
X1 and Y1 are initialized to 0.
The code calculates the square root of S and stores it in tmp. If the square of tmp is greater than or equal to S, X2 and Y3 are set to tmp. Otherwise, X2 and Y3 are set to tmp+1.
The code calculates the rest of the square of X2 minus S. If rest equals 0, X3 and Y2 are set to 0. Otherwise, if rest is less than 10^9, X3 is set to 1 and Y2 is set to rest. Otherwise, the code enters a loop that iterates from 2 to the square root of rest plus 2. If rest is divisible by i, X3 is set to i and Y2 is set to the integer division of rest by i.
Finally, the code prints the values of X1, Y1, X2, Y2, X3, and Y3.
