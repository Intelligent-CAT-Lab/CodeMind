I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
[Question]
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

84

a=[[str(100*A),'0']]
for i in range(101):

        for k in range(101):
            for l in range(101):
                x=100*A*i+100*B*j
                y=C*k+D*l
                if x+y>F or x==0:
                    break
                if 100*y/(x+y)<=(E*100)/(100+E):
                    a.append([str(x+y),str(y)])
print(' '.join(sorted(a, key=lambda x: (100*int(x[1]))/int(x[0]) if int(x[0])!=0 else 0)[-1]))

<<<Analysis>>>
The variables A, B, C, D, E, F are initialized to 1, 2, 10, 20, 15, 200, respectively.
The variable a is initialized to a list containing a list with two elements, the first being a string representation of 100*A and the second being '0'.
The code then enters four nested loops, each of which iterates from 0 to 100.
For each combination of i, j, k, and l, it calculates the values x and y.
If x+y is greater than F or x is 0, it breaks the loop.
If the ratio of y to (x+y) is less than or equal to E/(100+E), it appends a list containing the strings representing x+y and y to the list a.
After the loops finish, the code sorts the list a based on the ratio of y to (x+y) and prints the last element of the sorted list.
<<<Output>>>
200 200
