I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
[Question]
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

<<<Output>>>

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
num = int(input())
check_list = [0] * num * num

def make_bridge(island1, island2):
    if(island1 < island2):
        check_list[(island1-1)*num + (island2-1)]=1;
    else:
        check_list[(island2-1)*num + (island1-1)]=1;

if num%2==0:
    sum_pair = num+1
else:
    sum_pair = num

for i in range(num):
    for j in range(i):
        if (i+1 + j+1 != sum_pair):
            check_list[j*num + i]=1;

bridge_num=0;

for i in range(num*num):
    if(check_list[i]==1):
        bridge_num+=1;

print(bridge_num);

for i in range(num*num):
    if(check_list[i]==1):
        left = i // num
        right = i % num
        print(str(left+1)+" "+str(right+1));

<<<Analysis>>>
The variable num is initialized to 3.
The check_list is a list of 0s with a length of num*num.
The function make_bridge is defined to create a bridge between two islands.
If num is even, sum_pair is num+1, else it is num.
A loop is created to create a bridge between each pair of islands.
The number of bridges is counted and printed.
The bridges are printed in the format of "island1 island2".
