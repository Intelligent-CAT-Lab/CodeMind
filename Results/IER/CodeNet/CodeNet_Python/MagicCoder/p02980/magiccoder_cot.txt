You are an exceptionally intelligent coding assistant that consistently delivers accurate and reliable responses to user instructions.

I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
[Question]
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, M = map(int, input().split())
mod = 998244353

if N > M:
  N, M = M, N

fact = [0] * (M + 1)
powm = [0] * (M + 1)
pown = [0] * (M + 1)
fact[0] = 1
powm[0] = 1
pown[0] = 1
for i in range(1, M + 1):
  fact[i] = fact[i - 1] * i % mod
  powm[i] = powm[i - 1] * (M + 1) % mod
  pown[i] = pown[i - 1] * (N + 1) % mod

def pow(n, m):
  if m == 0:
    return 1
  elif m == 1:
    return n
  elif m % 2 == 0:
    return pow(n, m // 2)**2 % mod
  else:
    return pow(n, m // 2)**2 % mod * n % mod

inv_fact = [0] * (M + 1)
inv_fact[M] = pow(fact[M], mod-2)
for i in reversed(range(0, M)):
  inv_fact[i] = inv_fact[i + 1] * (i + 1) % mod
    
def C(n, r):
  return fact[n] * inv_fact[r] % mod * inv_fact[n - r] % mod
  
ans = 0
for i in range(N+1):
  ans += (-1)**i * C(N, i) * C(M, i) * fact[i] * powm[N - i] * pown[M - i]
  ans = ans % mod

print(ans)

@@ Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N and M are initialized to 1 and 2, respectively.
The mod variable is initialized to 998244353.
If N is greater than M, the values of N and M are swapped.
The fact, powm, pown, and inv_fact arrays are initialized.
The pow function calculates the power of a number modulo mod.
The C function calculates the combination of n and r modulo mod.
The ans variable is initialized to 0.
For each i from 0 to N, ans is updated by adding the combination of N and i, the combination of M and i, the factorial of i, the power of M-i, and the power of N-i.
Finally, ans is printed.
