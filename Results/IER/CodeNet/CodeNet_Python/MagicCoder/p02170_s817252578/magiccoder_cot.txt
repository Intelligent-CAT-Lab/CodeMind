I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
[Question]
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, K, A = map(int, input().split())
dp = [0] * (K+1) + [1] * N  # 残りが i 点のときの勝率
dp[0] = 1
c = 1
mod = 998244353
p_coin = A * pow(100, mod-2, mod) % mod
p_dice = pow(N, mod-2, mod)
for i in range(1, K+1):
    dp[i] = c * p_coin % mod
    c += (dp[i] - dp[i-N]) * p_dice % mod
print(dp[K] * pow(p_coin, mod-2, mod) % mod)

<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable K and variable A are initialized to 1, 1 and 50, respectively.
The dp array is initialized with 0s and 1s. The first K+1 elements are 1s and the rest are 0s.
The variable c is initialized to 1.
The variable mod is initialized to 998244353.
The variable p_coin is calculated as A times the power of 100 raised to the modulo of 2.
The variable p_dice is calculated as the power of N raised to the modulo of 2.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to K (inclusive).
For each i in this range, it calculates the dp[i] as c times p_coin modulo mod.
It then updates c as the sum of c and the difference between dp[i] and dp[i-N] times p_dice modulo mod.
Finally, it prints the final value of dp[K] times the power of p_coin raised to the modulo of 2 modulo mod.
