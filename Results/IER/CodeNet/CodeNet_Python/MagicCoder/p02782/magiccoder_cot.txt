I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
[Question]
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
mod = 10**9+7
rng = 2000100
fctr = [1]+[0]*(rng-1)
for i in range(1,rng):
  fctr[i] = fctr[i-1]*i%mod
def finv(x):
  return pow(fctr[x],mod-2,mod)
def cmb(n,k):
  if n<0 or k<0:
    return 0
  else:
    return fctr[n]*finv(n-k)*finv(k)%mod

x1,y1,x2,y2 = map(int,input().split())
print((cmb(x2+y2+2,x2+1)-cmb(x2+y1+1,y1)-cmb(x1+y2+1,x1)+cmb(x1+y1,x1))%mod)

<<<Analysis>>>
The code first calculates the factorial of numbers from 0 to 2000099 and stores them in the list fctr. The function finv calculates the modular multiplicative inverse of a number. The function cmb calculates the combination of two numbers.

The input is then read and split into four variables x1, y1, x2, y2.

The output is calculated by subtracting the combinations of the number of ways to choose x2+y1+1 items from x2+y2+2 items, the number of ways to choose x2+y1+1 items from x2+1 items, the number of ways to choose x1+y2+1 items from x1 items, and the number of ways to choose x1+y1 items from x1 items, and then taking the modulo of the result.

<<<Output>>>
The output of the code execution for the given input ```1 1 2 2``` is 10.
