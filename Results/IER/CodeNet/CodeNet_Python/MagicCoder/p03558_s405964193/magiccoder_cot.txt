I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
[Question]
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

<<<Analysis>>>
The input K is 6.
The function small_multiple(K: int)->int: is called with K as 6.
The function bfs01(s: int, t: int, V: int, graph: list)->int: is called with s as 1, t as 0, V as 6, and graph as the graph created in the function small_multiple(K: int)->int:.
The graph is a list of lists where each list represents a vertex and contains tuples of the form (vertex, cost).
The function bfs01(s: int, t: int, V: int, graph: list)->int: performs a breadth-first search on the graph starting from vertex s and ending at vertex t.
The function small_multiple(K: int)->int: creates a graph where each vertex is connected to its successor and its successor multiplied by 10 modulo K.
The function small_multiple(K: int)->int: returns the shortest path from vertex 1 to vertex 0 in the graph plus 1.
