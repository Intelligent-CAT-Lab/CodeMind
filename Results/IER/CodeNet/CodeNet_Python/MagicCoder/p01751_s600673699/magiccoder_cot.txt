I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
[Question]
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import sys
A,B,C = map(int,input().split())
time = 0
ss = set()
while True:
    if time%60 == C:
        print(time)
        sys.exit()
    for t in range(A):
        time += 1
        if time%60 == C:
            print(time)
            sys.exit()
    time += B
    if (time%60) in ss:
        break
    ss.add(time%60)
print(-1)

<<<Analysis>>>
The variables A, B, and C are initialized to 10, 10, and 5, respectively.
The variable time is initialized to 0, which will be used to keep track of the time.
The set ss is initialized to an empty set, which will be used to store the remainder of time divided by 60.
The code then enters a loop that continues until it breaks.
In each iteration of the loop, it increments time by A and checks if the remainder of time divided by 60 is equal to C. If it is, it prints the current time and exits the program.
If the remainder of time divided by 60 is not equal to C, it increments time by B and checks if the remainder of time divided by 60 is in the set ss. If it is, it breaks the loop. If it is not, it adds the remainder of time divided by 60 to the set ss.
If the loop finishes without breaking, it prints -1.
<<<Output>>>
-1
