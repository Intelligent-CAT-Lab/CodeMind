The code first calculates the factorial of numbers from 1 to 5555 and stores them in the list frac. It then calculates the inverse of each factorial modulo mod and stores them in the list fraci.

The variables N and K are initialized to the input values.

The dp array is initialized to store the number of ways to choose a subset of the first N elements such that the sum of the subset is divisible by 2*K.
