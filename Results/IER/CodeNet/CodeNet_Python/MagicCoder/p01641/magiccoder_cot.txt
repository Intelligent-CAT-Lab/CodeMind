I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
[Question]
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

memory = [i for i in range(30, 121, 10)]
r = ''

r += '<' * 10

point = 0
for c in s:
    c = ord(c)
    n = c / 10 - 3
    d = int(math.fabs(point - n))
    if point < n:
        r += '>' * d
    else:
        r += '<' * d
    point = n

    l = int(math.fabs(memory[point] - c))
    if memory[point] < c:
        r += '+' * l
    else:
        r += '-' * l
    memory[point] = c

    r += '.'

<<<Analysis>>>
The input string is "ABC".
The program first initializes a list of memory cells with values from 30 to 120 in steps of 10.
Then it initializes a string r with a sequence of '>' and '<' characters, each representing a movement to the right or left, respectively.
The program then iterates over each character in the input string.
For each character, it calculates the corresponding memory cell index n, which is the character's ASCII value divided by 10 minus 3.
The program calculates the absolute difference between the current memory cell index and n, and moves the pointer to the right or left accordingly.
The program then calculates the absolute difference between the current memory cell value and the character's ASCII value, and increments or decrements the memory cell value accordingly.
Finally, the program appends a '.' to the string r.
The program then prints the string r.
<<<Output>>>
>>>++++++++++[>++++++++++<-]>+.
