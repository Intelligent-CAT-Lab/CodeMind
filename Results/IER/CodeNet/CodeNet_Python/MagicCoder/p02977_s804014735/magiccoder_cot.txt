I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
[Question]
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())

res = 'Yes'

k = 0

while 2 ** (k + 1) - 1 <= N:
    k += 1

K = 2 ** k - 1


if N == 1:
    res = 'No'
if N == K + 1:
    res = 'No'
# print(N, K)

if N % 2 == 0:
    M = N - 1
else:
    M = N
if (M - K) % 4 == 0 and M > K:
    L = M - 2
else:
    L = M

P = N - K
if P % 2 == 0:
    P = 2

print(res)

if res == 'Yes':
    line = list(range(1, K + 1))
    line.remove(P)
    line = [1, P] + line[1:]
    
    for i in range(K - 1):
        print(line[i], line[i + 1])
    print(line[-1], N + 1)
    for i in range(K - 1):
        print(N + line[i], N + line[i + 1])
    if L > K:
        print(1, K + 1)
        for i in range(K + 1, L):
            print(i, i + 1)
        for i in range(K + 1, L):
            print(N + i, N + i + 1)
        print(N + L, 1)
    if M > L:
        print(N + 1, M - 1)
        print(M - 1, M)
        print(N + M - 1, N + M)
        print(N + M, N + 1)
    if N > M:
        print(N, K + 1)

@@ Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized to 3.
The variable res is initialized to 'Yes', which will be used to determine whether the output is 'Yes' or 'No'.
The variable k is initialized to 0, which will be used to calculate the value of K.
The while loop checks if 2^(k+1) - 1 is less than or equal to N. If it is, k is incremented by 1.
The value of K is calculated as 2^k - 1.
If N is 1, res is set to 'No'.
If N is K + 1, res is set to 'No'.
The if-else statement checks if N is even. If it is, M is set to N - 1. If it is not, M is set to N.
The if-else statement checks if (M - K) is divisible by 4 and M is greater than K. If it is, L is set to M - 2. If it is not, L is set to M.
The value of P is calculated as N - K. If P is even, P is set to 2.
The final result is printed.
If res is 'Yes', the code generates a sequence of numbers and prints them.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
1 2
2 3
