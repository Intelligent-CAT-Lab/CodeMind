I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
[Question]
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

84

Consider the following code:

N, d, x = map(int, read().split())

def main(N, d, x):
    ret = 0
    while N:
        ret += d + (N-0.5) * x
        d = d + (d/N) + (5*x)/(2*N)
        x += 2*x/N
        N -= 1
    return ret

print(main(N, d, x))

<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable d and variable x are initialized to 1, 3 and 3, respectively.
The function main is defined which calculates the sum of the series.
The series is calculated by adding the current value of d and the average of x and d multiplied by the number of terms left to be added.
The value of d is updated by adding the average of d and x multiplied by 2 and the number of terms left to be added.
The value of x is updated by adding 2 times the current value of x divided by the number of terms left to be added.
The number of terms left to be added is decremented by 1.
The function returns the final sum.
<<<Output>>>
10.0
