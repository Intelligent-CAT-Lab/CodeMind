Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable n is initialized to 1900.
The code checks if n is divisible by 1000. If it is, it prints 0.
If n is not divisible by 1000, it calculates the remainder of n divided by 1000.
The code prints the difference between 1000 and the remainder, which is 1900 - 900 = 100.
<<<Output>>>
100

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
n = int(input())
if n % 1000 == 0:
    print(0)
else:
    print(1000 - n % 1000)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1900
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
