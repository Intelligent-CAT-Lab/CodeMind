The variable n is initialized to 7, and variable k is initialized to 3.
The code checks if n is divisible by k. If it is, it prints 0. If it is not, it prints 1.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
n = int(input())
print(n) if n%2 == 0 else print(n+1)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable n is initialized to 10.
The code checks if n is even. If it is, it prints n. If it is not, it prints n+1.
<<<Output>>>
