Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable n is initialized to 3.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 3.
The code reads the input string a[i] for each i in the range [1, n].
The code then checks if a[i] is a substring of any other string in a[i+1:n].
If it is, it adds the length of a[i] to the answer.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of the answer, which is 10.
