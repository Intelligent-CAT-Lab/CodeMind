Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable n is initialized to [3, 7], which is the input.
The variable k is initialized to 3, which is the first element of n.
The variable x is initialized to 7, which is the second element of n.
The variable s1 is initialized to x - k + 1, which is 7 - 3 + 1 = 5.
The variable s2 is initialized to x + k - 1, which is 7 + 3 - 1 = 10.
The variable a1 is initialized to a list of numbers from s1 to s2, which is [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10].
The code then prints the list a1, which is [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10].
