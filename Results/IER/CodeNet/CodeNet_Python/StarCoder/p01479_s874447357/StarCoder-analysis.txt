The variable a is initialized to the input string.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from len(a)-2 to 0 (inclusive), meaning it will consider the last two characters of the string.
For each character i in this range, it checks if the character i and the character i+1 are the same. If they are, it removes the character i+1 from the string.
After the loop finishes, the code sorts the string based on the length of the words, starting with the longest words.
The code then prints the first word of the sorted string, which is "egg".
