rint the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The code first reads the input string S and stores it in a variable.
The code then calculates the length of the string S and stores it in a variable N.
The code then calls the function SuffixArray(S) to calculate the suffix array and the lcp array.
The code then calculates the answer by subtracting the sum of the lcp array from the total number of pairs of distinct characters in the string S.
The code then prints the final value of the answer, which is 3.
