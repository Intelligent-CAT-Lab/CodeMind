The variable x is initialized to 10, and variable y is initialized to 20.
The code checks if y is equal to 0.
If it is, the code checks if x is less than or equal to 0.
If it is, the code prints -x, which is -10.
If it is not, the code checks if x is less than or equal to -y.
If it is, the code prints -y-x+1, which is -20.
If it is not, the code checks if -y < x < 0.
If it is, the code prints x+y+1, which is 21.
If it is not, the code checks if 0 <= x <= y.
If it is, the code prints y-x, which is 10.
If it is not, the code prints x-y+2, which is 12.
After the code finishes, the output is 12.
