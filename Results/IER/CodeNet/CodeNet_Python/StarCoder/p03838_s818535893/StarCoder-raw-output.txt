The variable x is initialized to 10, and variable y is initialized to 20.
The code checks if y is equal to 0.
If it is, the code checks if x is less than or equal to 0.
If it is, the code prints -x, which is -10.
If it is not, the code checks if x is less than or equal to -y.
If it is, the code prints -y-x+1, which is -20.
If it is not, the code checks if -y < x < 0.
If it is, the code prints x+y+1, which is 21.
If it is not, the code checks if 0 <= x <= y.
If it is, the code prints y-x, which is 10.
If it is not, the code prints x-y+2, which is 12.
After the code finishes, the output is 12.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>

def main():
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    if y == 0:
        if x <= 0:
            ans = -x
        else:
            ans = x + 1
    elif y > 0:
        if x <= -y:
            ans = -y-x+1
        elif -y < x < 0:
            ans = x+y+1
        elif 0 <= x <= y:
            ans = y-x
        else:
            ans = x-y+2
    else:
        if x <= y:
            ans = y-x
        elif y < x < 0:
