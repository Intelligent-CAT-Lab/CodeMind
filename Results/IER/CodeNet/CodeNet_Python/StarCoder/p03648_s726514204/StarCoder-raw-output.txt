The variable k is initialized to 0.
The variable n is initialized to 50.
The variable a is initialized to a list of 50 elements, each of which is initialized to 49.
The variable c is initialized to k // n, which is 0 // 50 = 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 49.
For each number i in this range, it adds c to a[i].
The variable c is initialized to k % n, which is 0 % 50 = 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to c (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 0.
The variable mp is initialized to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 49.
For each number i in this range, it checks if a[i] is less than a[mp]. If it is, it sets mp to i.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 49.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is equal to mp. If it is, it adds n to a[i]. Otherwise, it subtracts 1 from a[i].
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of n, which is 50.
The code then prints the final value of a, which is [50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 5
