Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The code first reads the input and stores it in variables a and b.
The code then prints the remainder of a divided by b, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>
3

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
if __name__ == "__main__":
    a, b = list(map(lambda x: int(x), input().split()))
    print(a + b)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 8
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
