The variable n is initialized to 20.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def main():
    n = int(input())
    A = [0] * (10 ** 6)
    for x in range(1, 10 ** 2 + 1):
        for y in range(1, 10 ** 2 + 1):
            for z in range(1, 10 ** 2 + 1):
                i = x ** 2 + y ** 2 + z ** 2 + x*y + y*z + z*x
                A[i] += 1

    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        print(A[i])


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
