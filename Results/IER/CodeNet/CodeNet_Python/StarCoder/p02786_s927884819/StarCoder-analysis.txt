Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable h is initialized to 2.
variable l is initialized to 0.
The code enters a while loop that iterates as long as h is greater than 0.
Inside the loop, the value of l is doubled and 1 is added to it.
The value of h is divided by 2, which is equivalent to shifting h to the right by 1 bit.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of l, which is 5.
