Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable h is initialized to 2.
variable l is initialized to 0.
The code enters a while loop that iterates as long as h is greater than 0.
Inside the loop, the value of l is doubled and 1 is added to it.
The value of h is divided by 2, which is equivalent to shifting h to the right by 1 bit.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of l, which is 5.
<<<Output>>>
5

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if sum_order % 3 == 0:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N is initialized to 20.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will
