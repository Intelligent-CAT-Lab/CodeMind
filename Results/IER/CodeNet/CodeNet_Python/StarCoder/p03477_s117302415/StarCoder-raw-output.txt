The variables a, b, c and d are initialized to 3, 8, 7 and 1, respectively.
The code checks if a+b is greater than c+d.
Since 3+8 is greater than 7+1, the code prints 'Left'.
<<<Output>>>
Left

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b,c,d = map(int,input().split())
if a+b>c+d:
    print('Left')
elif a+b<c+d:
    print('Right')
else:
    print('Balanced')
</Code>
