Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The code first initializes a variable s to the input string.
The code then initializes a variable i to 0.
The code initializes a variable now to 0.
The code initializes a variable ans to 0.
The code enters a while loop that iterates while i is less than the length of s.
The code checks if s[i] is equal to "R".
If it is, the code increments i by 1.
The code then enters a while loop that iterates while i is less than the length of s.
The code checks if s[i] is equal to "R".
If it is, the code increments now by 1.
The code then decrements now by 1.
The code then sets now to now mod 4.
The code then increments i by 1.
The code checks if now is equal to 0.
If it is, the code enters another while loop that iterates while i is less than the length of s.
The code checks if s[i] is equal to "R".
If it is, the code increments ans by 1.
The code then breaks out of the while loop.
The code then breaks out of the while loop.
The code then breaks out of the while loop.
The code then prints the final value of ans, which is 3.
