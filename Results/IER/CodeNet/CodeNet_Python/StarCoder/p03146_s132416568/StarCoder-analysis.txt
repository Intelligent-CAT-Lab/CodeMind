The variable s is initialized to 8.
The variable a is initialized to an empty list.
The variable elm is initialized to s.
The code enters a loop that will run until the condition is met.
The code checks if the remainder of elm divided by 2 is 0. If it is, it divides elm by 2.
If the remainder is not 0, it calculates 3*elm + 1.
The code checks if elm is already in the list a. If it is, it breaks out of the loop.
If the condition is not met, the code appends elm to the list a.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the length of the list a plus 1, which is 10.
