Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable s is initialized to the list of characters in the input, which is ['A', 'S', 'S', 'A'].
The variable ans is initialized to "No", which will be used to store the answer.
The code checks if the length of the set of characters in s is 2. If it is, it sets ans to "Yes".
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if sum_order % 3 == 0:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```100
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N is initialized to 100.
The variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 100.
For each number i in
