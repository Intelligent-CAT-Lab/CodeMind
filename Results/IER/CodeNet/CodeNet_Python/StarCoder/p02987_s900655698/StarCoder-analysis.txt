Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable s is initialized to the list of characters in the input, which is ['A', 'S', 'S', 'A'].
The variable ans is initialized to "No", which will be used to store the answer.
The code checks if the length of the set of characters in s is 2. If it is, it sets ans to "Yes".
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is "Yes".
