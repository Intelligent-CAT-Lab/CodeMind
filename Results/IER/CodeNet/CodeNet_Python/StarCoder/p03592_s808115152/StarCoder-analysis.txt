The variable N, variable M and variable K are initialized to 2, 2 and 2, respectively.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 2.
For each number x in this range, it enters another loop that iterates from 0 to M (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 2.
For each number y in this range, it calculates the value of res as follows:
res = x * M + y * N - x * y * 2
The code checks if res is equal to K, which is 2 in this case. If it is, it prints "Yes" and exits the loop.
After the loop finishes, the code prints "No".
