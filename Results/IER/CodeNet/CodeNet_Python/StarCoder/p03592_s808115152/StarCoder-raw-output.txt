Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N, variable M and variable K are initialized to 2, 2 and 2, respectively.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 2.
For each number x in this range, it enters another loop that iterates from 0 to M (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 2.
For each number y in this range, it calculates the value of res as follows:
res = x * M + y * N - x * y * 2
The code checks if res is equal to K, which is 2 in this case. If it is, it prints "Yes" and exits the loop.
After the loop finishes, the code prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
Yes

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())
for i in range(1,N+1):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        print(i, end = " ")
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The variable N is initialized to 10.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 10.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is even. If it is, it prints i and a space.
