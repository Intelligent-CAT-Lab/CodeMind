Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variables a, b and c are initialized to 2, 4 and 6, respectively.
The code checks if b - a == c - b, which is true in this case.
The code prints "YES" if the condition is true, and "NO" if it is false.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
print("YES" if a + b == c or a + c == b or b + c == a else "NO")
</Code>
