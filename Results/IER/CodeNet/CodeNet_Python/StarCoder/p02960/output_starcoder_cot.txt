Instruction: I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
For example:

Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
20 2 5
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
Consider the following code:

S = input()
l = len(S)
mod = 10**9+7
dp = [[0]*13 for _ in range(l+1)]
dp[0][0] = 1

for i,s in enumerate(S):
    for j in range(13):
        if(s=="?"):
            for k in range(10):
                dp[i+1][((j*10)+k)%13] += dp[i][j]
                dp[i+1][((j*10)+k)%13]%=mod
        else:
            dp[i+1][((j*10)+int(s))%13] += dp[i][j]
            dp[i+1][((j*10)+int(s))%13]%=mod
print(dp[l][5])
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
??2??5

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable S is initialized to "??2??5".
The variable l is initialized to the length of S, which is 6.
The variable mod is initialized to 1000000007, which is used to calculate the answer modulo 1000000007.
The variable dp is initialized to a 2-dimensional array of size l+1 x 13, which is used to store the answer.
The first row of dp is initialized to 1, which is the answer for the empty string.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to l (inclusive), meaning it will consider all substrings of S from length 0 to 6.
For each substring s in this range, it calculates the answer for each possible digit d and stores it in dp[i+1][((j*10)+k)%13].
The code then prints the final value of dp[l][5], which is 10.

The output of code execution is:
10
