Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable n is initialized to 0.
The code checks if n is equal to 0. If it is, it prints 1 and ends the program.
The code checks if n is equal to 1. If it is, it prints 2 and ends the program.
The code checks if n is equal to 2. If it is, it prints 1 and ends the program.
The code checks if n is greater than 2. If it is, it prints 0 and ends the program.
The code does not reach the end of the program, so it prints 0.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
n = int(input())
if n == 0:
    print(1)
elif n == 1:
    print(2)
elif n == 2:
    print(1)
else:
    print(0)
