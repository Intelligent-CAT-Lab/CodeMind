Instruction: I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
For example:

Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
20 2 5
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
Consider the following code:

import numpy as np


def exp_np(a, e, m):
    r = np.identity(a.shape[0], dtype=np.int64)
    t = a.copy()
    while e:
        if e % 2:
            r = np.dot(r, t) % m
        t = np.dot(t, t) % m
        e >>= 1
    return r


l, a, b, m = map(int, input().split())

first_d = len(str(a))
tail = a + b * (l - 1)

lo = -1
state = np.array([[0, a % m, 1]])

for d in range(first_d, 19):
    hi = min((10 ** d - 1 - a) // b, l - 1)
    cnt = hi - lo
    coe = np.array([
        [pow(10, d, m), 0, 0],
        [1, 1, 0],
        [0, b % m, 1]
    ], dtype=np.int64)

    coe = exp_np(coe, cnt, m)
    state = np.dot(state, coe) % m

    lo = hi
    if hi == l - 1:
        break

print(state[0][0])

What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
5 3 4 10007

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The code first imports the numpy library.
The code then defines a function exp_np that takes three arguments: a, e and m.
The function returns the result of exponentiation of a to the power e modulo m.
The code then reads four integers l, a, b and m from the input.
The code then calculates the first digit d of a + b * (l - 1).
The code then calculates the tail of the sequence a + b * (l - 1).
The code then initializes the variable lo to -1.
The code then initializes the variable state to a 3x1 numpy array with the values [0, a % m, 1].
The code then enters a loop that iterates from the first digit d of a + b * (l - 1) to 19.
The code then calculates the minimum value of (10 ** d - 1 - a) // b and l - 1.
The code then calculates the difference between hi and lo.
The code then calculates the number of iterations cnt.
The code then calculates the coefficient coe as a 3x3 numpy array with the values [10 ** d % m, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0] and [0, b % m, 1].
The code then calculates the value of the state after applying the exponentiation of coe to cnt modulo m.
The code then calculates the value of lo after the loop.
The code then checks if hi is equal to l - 1.
The code then prints the value of the state at the first index, which is the value of the sequence.

The output of code execution is:
10006
