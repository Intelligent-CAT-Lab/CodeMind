Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The code first reads the input and stores it in the variable s.
The code then calculates the length of the string s and stores it in the variable n.
The code then initializes a 2-dimensional array dp of size n x 13.
The code then checks if the last character of the string s is '?'.
If it is, the code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 9, meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 9.
For each number i in this range, it enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 12, meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 12.
For each number j in this range, it enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 12, meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 12.
For each number k in this range, it adds the value of dp[i-1][k] to dp[i][(a*j+k)%13] (where a is 10, and (a*j+k)%13 is the result of (10*j+k)%13).
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of dp[n-1][5], which is 10.
