The variable s is initialized to "aabxyyzz".
The variable t is initialized to 0.
The variable d is initialized to {0:0}.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the characters in s.
For each character x in s, it calculates the value of i by subtracting the ASCII value of x from the ASCII value of 'a'.
The value of t is then updated to t XOR 1 << i, which is 1 << i if i is even, and 0 otherwise.
The value of d is then updated to d[t] if t is in d, and to 1000000 otherwise.
The value of d is then updated to min(d[t], min((d[t^(1<<j)] for j in range(26) if t^(1<<j) in d))+1), which is min(d[t], min((d[t^(1<<j)] for j in range(26) if t^(1<<j) in d))+1) if t in d, and to 1000000 otherwise.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of d[t], which is 3.
