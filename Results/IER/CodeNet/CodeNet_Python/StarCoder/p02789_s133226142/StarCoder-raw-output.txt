Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N is initialized to 3, and variable M is initialized to 3.
The code checks if N is equal to M. Since they are equal, the code prints 'Yes'.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
[END-OF-RESPONSE]



TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N,M=map(int,input().split())

if N==M:
    print('Yes')
else:
    print('No')
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 4
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
