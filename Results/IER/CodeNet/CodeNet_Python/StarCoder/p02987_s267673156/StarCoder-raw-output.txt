nt the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable S is initialized to "ASSA".
The code checks if the first and second characters are equal and if the third and fourth characters are equal.
If they are, it checks if the first and third characters are not equal.
If they are not equal, it prints "Yes".
If they are equal, it checks if the second and fourth characters are not equal.
If they are not equal, it prints "Yes".
If they are equal, it checks if the first and third characters are not equal.
If they are not equal, it prints "Yes".
If none of the conditions are met, it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
[END-OF-RESPONSE]



TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
S = input()

if S[0] == S[1] and S[2] == S[3] and S[0]!= S[2]:
    print("Yes")
elif S[0] == S[2] and S[1] == S[3] and S[0]!= S[1]:
    print("Yes")
elif S[0] == S[3] and S[1] == S[2] and S[0]!= S[2]:
    print("Yes")
else:
    print("No")

</Code>
