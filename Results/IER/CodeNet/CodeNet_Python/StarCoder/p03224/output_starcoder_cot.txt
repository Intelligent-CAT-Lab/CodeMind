Instruction: I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
For example:

Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
20 2 5
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
Consider the following code:

N = int(input())

can_be_ans = False
for k in range(1, 10 ** 5):
    if 2 * N == k * (k - 1):
        can_be_ans = True
        break
    elif 2 * N < k * (k - 1):
        break
        
if not can_be_ans:
    print("No")
else:
    print("Yes")
    print(k)
    s_grid = [[0 for i in range(k - 1)] for j in range(k)]
    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        for j in range(k - i):
            s_grid[i - 1][i - 1 + j] = (i - 1) * k - i * (i - 1) // 2 + 1 + j
            s_grid[i + j][i - 1] = (i - 1) * k - i * (i - 1) // 2 + 1 + j
            
    for row in s_grid:
        print(k - 1, end=" ")
        print(" ".join(map(str, row)))
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
3

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N is initialized to 3.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 100000 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 100000.
For each number k in this range, it checks if 2 * N is equal to k * (k - 1). If it is, it sets can_be_ans to True and breaks the loop.
If the loop finishes without breaking, it checks if can_be_ans is True. If it is, it prints "Yes" and k.
If it is not, it prints "No".
After the loop finishes, the code prints the following grid:
3 2 1
2 1 1
1 1 1
