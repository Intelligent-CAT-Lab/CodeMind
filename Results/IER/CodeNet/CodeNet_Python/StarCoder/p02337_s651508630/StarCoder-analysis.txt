Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable n, variable k are initialized to 3 and 5, respectively.
The variable a is initialized to [1, 0], which will be used to store the answer.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 2.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of the first i terms of the Fibonacci sequence and stores it in a.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of a, which is [1, 1, 2].
