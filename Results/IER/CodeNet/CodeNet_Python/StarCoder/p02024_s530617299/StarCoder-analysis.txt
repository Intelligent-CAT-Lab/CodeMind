Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variables h, w, x and y are initialized to 4, 5, 2 and 3, respectively.
The code checks if h*w is odd. If it is, it checks if (x+y) is odd. If both conditions are met, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
The code prints "No" because h*w is even, and (x+y) is even.
