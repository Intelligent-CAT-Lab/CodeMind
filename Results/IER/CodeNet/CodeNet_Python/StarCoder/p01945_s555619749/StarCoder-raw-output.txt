The variable S is initialized to the string "((*)())".
The variable S_l is initialized to the length of S, which is 7.
The variable n is initialized to 0.
The variable l is initialized to an empty list.
The variable r is initialized to an empty list.
The variable f_l is initialized to 0.
The variable f_r is initialized to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to the index of the first occurrence of the character '*' in S.
If the character at index n is '(', then f_l is incremented by 1.
If the character at index n is ')', then f_l is decremented by 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to the length of S minus the index of the first occurrence of the character '*'.
If the character at index S_l-n-1 is ')', then f_r is incremented by 1.
If the character at index S_l-n-1 is '(', then f_r is decremented by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the minimum of f_r and f_l, which is 1.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())
l = []
for i in range(1,N+1):
    if i%3==0 or i%5==0:
        l.append(i)
print(sum(l))
