The variable A is initialized to "atcoderregularcontest".
The variable N is initialized to the length of A, which is 20.
The variable a is initialized to the ASCII code of 'a', which is 97.
The variable edge is initialized to a 2-dimensional array of size N+1 x 26, which is a list of lists of size N+1 x 26.
The variable c is initialized to the ASCII code of the first character of A, which is 97.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from N-1 to 0 (inclusive), meaning it will consider characters from N-1 to 0.
For each character i in this range, it calculates the ASCII code of the current character and stores it in c.
The code then enters a nested loop that iterates from 26 to 0 (inclusive), meaning it will consider characters from 'z' to 'a'.
For each character j in this range, it calculates the ASCII code of the current character and stores it in j.
The code then enters a nested loop that iterates from 26 to 0 (inclusive), meaning it will consider characters from 'z' to 'a'.
For each character j in this range, it calculates the ASCII code of the current character and stores it in j.
