The variable MOD is initialized to 998244353.
The variables n, a, b and k are initialized to 4, 1, 2 and 5, respectively.
The list fac is initialized to [1, 1, 2, 6].
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 4.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the product of all numbers from 0 to i (inclusive) and stores it in fac[i + 1].
The code then enters another loop that iterates from 0 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 4.
For each number x in this range, it calculates the product of all numbers from 0 to x (inclusive) and stores it in fac[x].
The code then enters another loop that iterates from 0 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 4.
For each number y in this range, it calculates the product of all numbers from 0 to y (inclusive) and stores it in fac[y].
The code then enters another loop that iterates from 0 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 4.
For each number z in this range, it calculates the product of all numbers from 0 to z (inclusive) and stores it in fac[z].
The code then enters another loop that iterates from 0 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 4.
For each number w in this range, it calculates the product of all numbers from 0 to w (inclusive) and stores it in fac[w].
The code then enters another loop that iterates from 0 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 4.
For each number v in this range, it calculates the product of all numbers from 0 to v (inclusive) and stores it in fac[v].
The code then enters another loop that iterates from 0 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 4.
For each number u in this range, it calculates the product of all numbers from 0 to u
