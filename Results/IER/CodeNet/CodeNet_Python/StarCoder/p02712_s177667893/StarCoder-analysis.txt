The variable N is initialized to 15.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 15.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is divisible by 3 or 5. If it is not, it adds the current number i to ans. The condition is met when i is 1,2,4,7,8,11,13,14 and 15.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 33.
