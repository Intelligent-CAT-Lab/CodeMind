Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N is initialized to 15.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 15.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is divisible by 3 or 5. If it is not, it adds the current number i to ans. The condition is met when i is 1,2,4,7,8,11,13,14 and 15.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 33.
<<<Output>>>
33
[END-OF-RESPONSE]



TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def main():
    N = int(input())
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, N+1):
        if i % 3 == 0 or i % 5 == 0:
            ans += i
    print(ans)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```15
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
