The variable s is initialized to 'akasaka', which is the input.
The variable n is initialized to the length of s, which is 7.
The variable r_s is initialized to the empty string.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider characters from 0 to 6.
For each character c in this range, it appends c to r_s.
The code checks if s is equal to r_s. If it is not, it prints 'No' and exits the program.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider characters from 0 to 3.
For each character c in this range, it appends c to top.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider characters from 3 to 6.
For each character c in this range, it appends c to r_top.
The code checks if top is equal to r_top. If it is not, it prints 'No' and exits the program.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider characters from 3 to 6.
For each character c in this range, it appends c to last.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider characters from 6 to 6.
For each character c in this range, it appends c to r_last.
The code checks if r_last is equal to last. If it is not, it prints 'No' and exits the program.
The code prints 'Yes' and exits the program.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())

for i in range(1,N+1):
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    sum_order = 0
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if sum_order % 3 == 0:
        print(i)

<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```100
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N is initialized to 100, which is the input.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 100.
For each number i in this range, it converts i to a string and stores it in i_str.
The variable n is initialized to the length of i_str, which is 2.
The variable sum_order is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of digits of i.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider digits from 0 to 1.
For each digit j in this range, it adds j to sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is divisible by 3. If it is, it prints i and exits the program.
The code prints
