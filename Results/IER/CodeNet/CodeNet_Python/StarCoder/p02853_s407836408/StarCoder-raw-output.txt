Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable sknList is initialized to [300000, 200000, 100000], which is a list of the prizes for each of the three levels.
The variable x and variable y are initialized to 1, 1, respectively.
The variable prize is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the prize.
The code checks if x and y are both 1. If they are, the code adds 400000 to prize.
The code then checks if x is less than or equal to 3. If it is, the code adds the prize of the level x to prize.
The code then checks if y is less than or equal to 3. If it is, the code adds the prize of the level y to prize.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of prize, which is 400000.
<<<Output>>>
400000

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())

for i in range(1,N+1):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        print(i, end = " ")
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N is initialized to 10.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from
