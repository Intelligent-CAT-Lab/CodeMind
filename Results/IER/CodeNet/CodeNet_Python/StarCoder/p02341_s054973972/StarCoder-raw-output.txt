Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable a is initialized to 5, and variable b is initialized to 10.
The code then prints the value of a<=b, which is 1.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b=map(int,input().split(" "))
print(int(a>=b))

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 10
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
