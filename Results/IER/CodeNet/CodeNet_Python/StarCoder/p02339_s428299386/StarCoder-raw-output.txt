The variable N and variable K are initialized to 4 and 3, respectively.
variable MOD is initialized to 10**9 + 7, which is 1000000007.
The variable D is initialized to a 2-dimensional array of size N+1 x K+1, which is a 2-dimensional array of size 5 x 4.
The first row of D is initialized to 0, which is the base case.
The first column of D is initialized to 0, which is the base case.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 4.
For each number n in this range, it calculates the sum of the previous row of D and stores it in D0.
For each number k in this range, it calculates the sum of the previous column of D0 and stores it in D[n][k].
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of D[N][K], which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, K = map(int, input().split())
MOD = 10**9 + 7
 
D = [[0]*(K+1) for i in range(N+1)]
D[0][0] = 1
for n in range(1, N+1):
    D0 = D[n-1]
    for k in range(1, K+1):
        D[n][k] = (D0[k-1] + k * D0[k]) % MOD
print(D[N][
