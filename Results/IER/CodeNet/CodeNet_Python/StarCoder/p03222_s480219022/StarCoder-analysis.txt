The variable H, variable W and variable K are initialized to 1, 3 and 2, respectively.
The variable P is initialized to 10**9 + 7.
The variable M is initialized to W + 100.
The variable fib is initialized to a list of length M, which is initialized to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to M-2, meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 99.
fib[i] is initialized to 1, fib[i+1] is initialized to 1, and fib[i+2] is initialized to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to M-2, meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 99.
fib[i] is initialized to 1, fib[i+1] is initialized to 1, and fib[i+2] is initialized to 0.
