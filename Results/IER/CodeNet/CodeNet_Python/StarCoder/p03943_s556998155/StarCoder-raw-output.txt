The variable candy is initialized to a list of integers, which is [10, 30, 20].
The list is sorted in ascending order.
The code checks if the sum of the first two elements of the list is equal to the third element.
Since the first two elements are 10 and 30, and the third element is 20, the sum is 40.
Since 40 is equal to 20, the code prints 'Yes'.
<<<Output>>>
Yes

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())
for i in range(1,N+1):
    if i%3==0 or i%5==0:
        print(i)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```100
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N is initialized to 100.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 100.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is divisible by 3 or 5.
Since i is divisible by 3, the code prints i.
Since i is divisible by 5, the code prints i.
Since i is divisible by both 3 and 5, the code prints i.
