The variable candy is initialized to a list of integers, which is [10, 30, 20].
The list is sorted in ascending order.
The code checks if the sum of the first two elements of the list is equal to the third element.
Since the first two elements are 10 and 30, and the third element is 20, the sum is 40.
Since 40 is equal to 20, the code prints 'Yes'.
