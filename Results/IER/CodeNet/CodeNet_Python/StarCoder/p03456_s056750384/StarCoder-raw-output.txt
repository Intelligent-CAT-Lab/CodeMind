Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The code first imports the sys module, which is used to read input from the standard input.
The code then enters a loop that reads lines from the standard input until it encounters a blank line.
The code then splits the line into two parts, a and b, using the split function.
The code then calculates the sum of a and b and stores it in temp.
The code then checks if temp is a perfect square.
If it is, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
Yes

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import sys
for line in sys.stdin:
    if line == None or line == '\n':
        break
    a,b = line.split(" ")
    if int(a) % int(b) == 0:
        print("Yes")
    else:
        print("No")
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 2
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
