The code first imports the sys module, which is used to read input from the standard input.
The code then enters a loop that reads lines from the standard input until it encounters a blank line.
The code then splits the line into two parts, a and b, using the split function.
The code then calculates the sum of a and b and stores it in temp.
The code then checks if temp is a perfect square.
If it is, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".
