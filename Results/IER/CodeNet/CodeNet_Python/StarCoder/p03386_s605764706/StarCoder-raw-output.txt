Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable A, variable B and variable K are initialized to 3, 8 and 2, respectively.
The code then calculates the value of A_th, which is 5.
The code then calculates the value of B_th, which is 5.
The code then creates a list A_l containing the numbers from A to A_th (inclusive), which is [3, 4, 5].
The code then creates a list B_l containing the numbers from B_th to B (inclusive), which is [5, 6, 7, 8].
The code then creates a list X_l containing the unique elements of A_l and B_l, which is [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8].
The code then prints the elements of X_l, which is 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())

for i in range(1,N+1):
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    if n % 2 == 0:
        print(i_str)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
