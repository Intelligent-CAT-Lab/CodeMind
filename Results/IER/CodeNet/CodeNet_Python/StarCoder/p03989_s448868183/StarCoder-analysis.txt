The variable N, variable K are initialized to 3 and 1, respectively.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 3.
For each number j in this range, it initializes a 3-dimensional array dp[i][j][k] to 0 for all i, k.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 2*K (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 2.
For each number k in this range, it initializes the following values of dp[i][j][k]:
dp[0][j][2] = 1
dp[1][j][0] = 1
dp[1][j][1] = 1
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 3.
For each number i in this range, it initializes the following values of dp[i][j][k]:
dp[i][j+2*K][2] = dp[i][j+2*K][2] + dp[i][j][0] + dp[i][j][1] + dp[i][j][2]
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 3.
For each number i in this range, it initializes the following values of dp[i][j][k]:
dp[i+1][j+2*K][0] = dp[i+1][j+2*K][0] + dp[i][j][0] + dp[i][j][1] + dp[i][j][2]
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 3.
For each number i in this range, it initializes the following values of dp[i][j][k]:
dp[i][j+2*K][2] = dp[i][j+2*K][2] + dp[i][j][0] + dp[i][j][1] + dp[i][
