The variable N is initialized to 2.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 2*N+1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 6.
For each number n in this range, it enters a nested loop that iterates from 1 to N+1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 3.
For each number w in this range, it calculates the value of h as follows:
h = w*n*N // (4*w*n-(n+w)*N)
The code checks if h is positive and if the following condition is met:
h*(4*w*n-(n+w)*N) - w*n*N == 0
If both conditions are met, the code prints the values of h, n and w, which are 1, 2 and 1, respectively.
