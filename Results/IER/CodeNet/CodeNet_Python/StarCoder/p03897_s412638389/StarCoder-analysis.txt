Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable n is initialized to 2.
The code then creates two lists, odd and even, which will contain the odd and even numbers from 3 to n+1, respectively.
The code then creates a list ans, which will contain the pairs of numbers that will be used to generate the output.
The code then creates a list added, which will contain the number of times each number has been added to ans.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to n+1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 2 to 3.
For each number i in this range, it adds the pair (1, i) to ans.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to n+1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 2 to 3.
If i is even, it enters a loop that iterates from 3 to n+1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 3 to 5.
For each number item in this range, it adds the pair (item, i) to ans.
If i is odd, it enters a loop that iterates from 2 to n+1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 2 to 3.
For each number item in this range, it adds the pair (item, i) to ans.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from n to 1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from n to 1.
If (i - 2) is divisible by 3, it skips the rest of the loop.
If i is even, it enters a loop that iterates from 3 to n+1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 3 to 5.
For each number item in this range, it adds the pair (item, i) to ans.
The code then sorts ans in ascending order.
The code then prints the length of ans, which is 10.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to the length of ans (exclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 9.
For each number i in this range, it prints the pair (a, b) in ans, where a is the first element of the pair and b is the second element of the pair.
