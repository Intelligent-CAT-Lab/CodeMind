Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable n is initialized to 11.
The variable p is initialized to 0.
The variable t is initialized to True.
The code enters a while loop that iterates while p is less than 26.
The variable r is initialized to n minus 7 times p.
The code checks if r is greater than or equal to 0 and if r is divisible by 4.
If both conditions are met, the code prints "Yes" and breaks out of the loop.
If the loop finishes without breaking, the code prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
n=int(input())
p=0
t=True
while p<26:
    r=n-(7*p)
    if r>=0 and r%4 ==0:
        t=False
        print("Yes")
        break
    p+=1
if t:
    print("No")

</Code>
