The function cal is defined to calculate the sum of the first n natural numbers.
The variable x is initialized to 6.
The variable ans is initialized to [1, 12], which is the sum of the first two natural numbers.
The variable a is initialized to 0.
The code enters a while loop that iterates until the condition is met.
The variable tmp is initialized to the sum of the first two natural numbers.
The code checks if tmp is greater than x. If it is, it sets ans[1] to the sum of the first two natural numbers.
The code checks if tmp is less than x. If it is, it sets ans[0] to the sum of the first two natural numbers.
The code checks if tmp is equal to x. If it is, it prints the sum of the first two natural numbers and ends the loop.
The code checks if ans[1]-ans[0] is equal to 1. If it is, it prints the second number in ans, which is 12.
<<<Output>>>
12

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def cal(n): return n*(n+1)//2

x=int(input())
ans=[1,cal(x)]
a=0
while 1:
    a+=1
    tmp=cal(sum(ans)//2)
    if tmp>x:
        ans[1]=sum(ans)//2
    elif tmp<x:
        ans[0]=sum(ans)//2
    elif tmp==x:
        print(sum(ans)//2)
        break
    if ans[1]-ans[0]==1:
        print(ans[1])
        break
</Code>
