The function s(n) calculates the sum of the digits of n.
The function r(n) calculates the ratio of n to the sum of its digits.
The function f(n) calculates the next number in the sequence.
The variable n is initialized to 1.
The code enters a loop that iterates 10 times.
The code prints the value of n, which is 1.
The code then calls the function f(n+1), which returns the next number in the sequence.
The code then updates the value of n to the returned value.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of n, which is 100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
