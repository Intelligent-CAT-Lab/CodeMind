Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable A, variable B and variable C are initialized to 2, 11 and 4, respectively.
The code checks if B // A is greater than or equal to C.
Since B // A is 5, which is greater than or equal to C, the code prints 5.
<<<Output>>>
5

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())

for i in range(1,N+1):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        print(i)

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N is initialized to 10.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 10.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is even.
Since i is even, the code prints i.
