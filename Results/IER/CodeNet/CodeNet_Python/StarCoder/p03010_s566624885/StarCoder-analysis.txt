The variable N is initialized to 3.
The code then enters a loop that iterates 12 times.
Inside the loop, the variable sum_2 is initialized to a set of all possible sums of two elements in the list A.
The variable avoid is initialized to a set of all possible differences of two elements in the set sum_2 and the set A.
The variable x is initialized to the minimum element in the set of all integers from 1 to 999 minus the set of all elements in the set avoid and the set sum_2 and the set A.
The element x is appended to the list A.
After the loop finishes, the code enters a loop that iterates N times.
Inside the loop, the variable L is initialized to a list of N lists of length N-1-n, where n is the iteration number.
The variable x is initialized to 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to N-1-n, meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to N-2.
Inside the loop, the element x is appended to the list L[n].
If n is less than N-2, the variable x is updated to the sum of the last two elements of the list L[n].
After the loop finishes, the code enters a loop that iterates N times.
Inside the loop, the variable graph is initialized to a list of N lists of length N.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to N-1.
Inside the loop, the code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to N-1-n, meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to N-2.
Inside the loop, the element x is appended to the list graph[i].
The element x is appended to the list graph[i+j+1].
After the loop finishes, the code enters a loop that iterates N times.
Inside the loop, the code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to N-1.
Inside the loop, the code prints the elements of the list graph[i].
After the loop finishes, the code prints the elements of the list graph[i].
