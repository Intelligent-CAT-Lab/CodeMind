Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable s is initialized to the list of characters in the input, which is ['p', 'd', 'b', 'q'].
The variable sr is initialized to the list of characters in the reversed input, which is ['q', 'b', 'd', 'p'].
The variable t is initialized to the length of s divided by 2, which is 2.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to t (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 2.
For each number i in this range, it checks if the characters at positions i and t-i are equal to "b" and "d", or "d" and "b", or "p" and "q", or "q" and "p".
If any of these conditions is met, the code breaks out of the loop and prints "No".
If none of these conditions is met, the code enters the else clause, which prints "Yes".
After the loop finishes, the code prints "Yes".
