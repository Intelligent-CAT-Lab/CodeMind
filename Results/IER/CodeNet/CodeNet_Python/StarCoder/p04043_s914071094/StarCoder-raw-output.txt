Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable A is initialized to [5, 5, 7], which is a list of integers.
The code sorts the list A in ascending order.
The code checks if the first three elements of the list A are 5, 5 and 7, respectively. If they are, it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".
<<<Output>>>
YES

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, M = map(int, input().split())
A = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
B = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
C = []
for i in range(0,N):
    for j in range(0,M):
        C.append(A[i]+B[j])
C.sort()
print(C[N*M//2])
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 3
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N and variable M are initialized to 3 and 3, respectively.
The variable A is initialized to [1, 2, 3], which is a list of integers.
The variable B is initialized to [4, 5, 6], which is a list of integers.
The variable C is initialized to [], which is a list of integers.
The code enters a loop that iterates
