Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable n is initialized to 1, and variable c is initialized to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 1.
For each number k in this range, it calculates the palindrome number x = 10k + c.
The code checks if x is prime.
The code then prints the final value of x, which is 11.
<<<Output>>>
11

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
# AOJ 0587: Prime Number
# Python3 2018.6.30 bal4u

def isPrime(p):
	if (p & 1) == 0: return False
	for i in range(3, 1+int(p**0.5), 2):
		if (p % i) == 0: return False
	return True

n = int(input())
if isPrime(n): print('Prime')
else: print('Not prime')

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```11
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
