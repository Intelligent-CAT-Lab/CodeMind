Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable n is initialized to 4.
The code checks if n is even or odd.
If n is even, the code divides n by 2 and divides the result by n.
If n is odd, the code adds 1 to n and divides n by 2 and divides the result by n.
The code prints the final value of ans, which is 0.5.
<<<Output>>>
0.5

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
n = int(input())
if n%2 == 0:
    ans = (n/2)/n
else:
    ans = ((n+1)/2)/n
print(ans)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
