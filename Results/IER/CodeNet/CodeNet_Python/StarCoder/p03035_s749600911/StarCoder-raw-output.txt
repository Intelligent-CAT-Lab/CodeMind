Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable A and variable B are initialized to 30 and 100, respectively.
The code checks if A is greater than or equal to 13. If it is, it prints the value of B.
If A is less than 13, the code checks if A is greater than or equal to 6. If it is, it prints the value of B divided by 2.
If A is less than 6, the code prints 0.
<<<Output>>>
100

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())

if N % 2 == 0:
	print(N)
else:
	print(N+1)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N is initialized to 10.
The code checks if N is even. If it is, it prints the value of N.
If N is odd, the code adds 1 to N and prints the result.
<<<Output>>>
11
