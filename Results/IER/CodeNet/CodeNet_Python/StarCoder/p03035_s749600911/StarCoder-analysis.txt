Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable A and variable B are initialized to 30 and 100, respectively.
The code checks if A is greater than or equal to 13. If it is, it prints the value of B.
If A is less than 13, the code checks if A is greater than or equal to 6. If it is, it prints the value of B divided by 2.
If A is less than 6, the code prints 0.
