Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N is initialized to 0.
The code enters a while loop that continues as long as N is not equal to 0.
Inside the loop, the code divides N by 2, which is 0.
The code increments ans by 1, which is 1.
The code exits the loop and prints the final value of ans, which is 1.
<<<Output>>>
1

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())
ans = 0
while(N):
    N //= 2
    ans += 1
print(ans)

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The variable N is initialized to 10.
The code enters a while loop that continues as long as N is not equal to 0.
Inside the loop, the code divides N by 2, which is 5.
The code increments ans by 1, which is 2.
The code exits the loop and prints the final value of ans, which is 2.
