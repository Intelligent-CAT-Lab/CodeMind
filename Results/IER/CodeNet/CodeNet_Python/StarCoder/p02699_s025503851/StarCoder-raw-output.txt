Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable sw is initialized to [4, 5], which is the input.
The code checks if sw[1] is greater than or equal to sw[0], which is 4 >= 5.
Since it is not, the code prints 'unsafe'.
<<<Output>>>
unsafe

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, M = map(int, input().split())
for i in range(1,N+1):
    for j in range(1,M+1):
        print(i,j)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 4
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N is initialized to 3, and variable M is initialized to 4.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to
