Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N, variable M are initialized to 4 and 1, respectively.
The code checks if N is even or odd.
If N is even, the code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to M (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 1.
For each number i in this range, it prints the current number i and N-i+1.
If N is odd, the code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to M (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 1.
For each number i in this range, it prints the current number i and N-i.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N,M=map(int,input().split())
if N%2==0:
    for i in range(1,M+1):
        print(i,N-i+1)
    for i in range(M-1):
        print(M
