The variable N, variable M are initialized to 4 and 1, respectively.
The code checks if N is even or odd.
If N is even, the code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to M (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 1.
For each number i in this range, it prints the current number i and N-i+1.
If N is odd, the code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to M (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 1.
For each number i in this range, it prints the current number i and N-i.
