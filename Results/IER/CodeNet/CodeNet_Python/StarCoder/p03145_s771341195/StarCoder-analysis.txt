Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variables a, b and c are initialized to 3, 4 and 5, respectively.
The list variable is initialized to [a, b, c], which is a list containing the values of a, b and c.
The list is sorted in ascending order, which means that the smallest value is first, followed by the second smallest value, and so on.
The code then calculates the average of the two largest values in the list, which is (5+4)/2=3.5.
The code then prints the final value of the average, which is 3.5.
