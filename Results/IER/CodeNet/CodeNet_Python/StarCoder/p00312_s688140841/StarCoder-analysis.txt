Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable D, variable L are initialized to 10 and 5, respectively.
variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then calculates the value of ans as follows:
ans = D // L + D % L
ans = 10 // 5 + 0
ans = 2 + 0
ans = 2
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 2.
