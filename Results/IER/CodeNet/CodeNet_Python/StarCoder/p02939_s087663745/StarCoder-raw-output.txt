The variable s is initialized to the list ['a', 'a', 'b', 'b', 'a', 'a'].
The variable c is initialized to 1, which will be used to count the number of distinct substrings.
The variable n is initialized to an empty string, which will be used to store the current substring.
The variable k is initialized to the first element of the list s, which is 'a'.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to the length of the list s (inclusive), meaning it will consider all elements of the list.
For each element i in this range, it appends it to the string n.
It then checks if k is equal to n. If it is not, it means that the current substring has ended, so it increments c by 1.
It then resets n to an empty string and k to the current element i.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of c, which is 3.
