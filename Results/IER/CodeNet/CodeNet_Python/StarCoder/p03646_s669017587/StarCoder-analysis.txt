The variable K is initialized to 0.
The variable N is initialized to 50.
The variable div is initialized to K // N, which is 0.
The variable mod is initialized to K % N, which is 0.
The variable A is initialized to a list of length 50, where each element is initialized to i + div - mod, where i ranges from 0 to 49.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to mod (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 0.
For each number i in this range, it adds N + 1 to the element of A at index i.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of N, which is 50.
The code then prints the final value of A, which is 50 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49.
