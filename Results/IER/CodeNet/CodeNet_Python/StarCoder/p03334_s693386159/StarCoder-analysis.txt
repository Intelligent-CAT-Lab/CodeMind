The variable N, variable D1 and variable D2 are initialized to 2, 1 and 2, respectively.
The code then calls the helper function with N*2, D1 as arguments.
The helper function returns a grid of size 4x4, which is a square of size 2x2.
The code then calls the helper function with N*2, D2 as arguments.
The helper function returns a grid of size 4x4, which is a square of size 2x2.
The code then calculates the intersection of g1 and g2, which is a grid of size 4x4, which is a square of size 2x2.
The code then prints the coordinates of the nonzero elements of the intersection grid.
