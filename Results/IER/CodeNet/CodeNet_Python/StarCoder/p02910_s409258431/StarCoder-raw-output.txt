The variable S is initialized to 'RUDLUDR'.
The variable a is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the number of times 'L' and 'R' occur in the string S.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to len(S) (exclusive), meaning it will consider all the indices of the string S.
For each index i in this range, it checks if i is even or odd.
If i is even, it checks if S[i] is 'L'. If it is, it adds 1 to a.
If i is odd, it checks if S[i] is 'R'. If it is, it adds 1 to a.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if a is 0. If it is, it prints 'Yes'. Otherwise, it prints 'No'.
