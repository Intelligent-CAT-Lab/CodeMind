Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The code reads the input line by line and stores it in the variable digits.
The code checks if digits is equal to the list ['1', '4', '7', '9'], which is the case when the input is '1 7 9 4'.
If the condition is met, the code prints 'YES'.
If the condition is not met, the code prints 'NO'.
<<<Output>>>
YES

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
# 2019-11-28 00:55:58(JST)
import sys
def main():
    N = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    A = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    B = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    sum_1 = 0
    for i in range(1,N+1):
        sum_order = 0
        i_str = str(i)
        n = len(i_str)
        for j in range(0,n):
            sum_order += int(i_str[j])
        if A <= sum_order <= B:
            sum_1 += i
    print(sum_1)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20 2 5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
