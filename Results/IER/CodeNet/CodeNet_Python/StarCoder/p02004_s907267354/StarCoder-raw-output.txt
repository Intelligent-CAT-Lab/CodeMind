The code reads the input and stores it in the variable S.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the number of times the robot has to turn.
The variable d is initialized to 0, which will be used to store the direction of the robot.
The variable cur is initialized to 0, which will be used to store the number of times the robot has to turn in the current direction.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the characters in S.
For each character c in S, the code checks if c is "R". If it is, it increments d by 1 and modulos it by 4. If d is 0, it also increments cur by 1.
If d is not 0, it decrements d by 1 and modulos it by 4.
If d is 0, it also sets cur to 0.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 3.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import sys
readline = sys.stdin.readline
write = sys.stdout.write
def solve():
    N = int(readline())
    A = list(map(int, readline().split()))
    B = list(map(int, readline().split()))
    ans = 0
    for i in range(N):
        if A[i] == B[i]:
            ans += 1
    write("%d\n" % ans)
solve()
</Code>
