Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The code first reads the input and stores it in the variable a.
The code then checks if a is equal to 'ani'. If it is, it prints'square1001'.
If it is not, it prints 'e869120'.
<<<Output>>>
square1001

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
a = input()
if a == 'ani':
    print('square1001')
elif a == 'e869120':
    print('square1002')
else:
    print('square1003')

</Code>
