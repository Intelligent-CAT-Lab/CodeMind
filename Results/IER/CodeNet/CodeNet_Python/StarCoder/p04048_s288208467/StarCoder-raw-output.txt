Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N, variable X are initialized to 5 and 2, respectively.
The code then calls the function F(x,y) with the arguments x=2 and y=5.
The function F(x,y) calculates the distance between the diagonal and the point (x,y).
The function F(x,y) calls itself recursively until the point (x,y) is on the diagonal.
The function F(x,y) returns the distance between the diagonal and the point (x,y).
The code adds the distance between the diagonal and the point (x,y) to the variable answer.
The code prints the final value of answer, which is 11.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())

def F(n):
    """
    入力された数を2で割った時に余りが0の回数
    """
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return 1 + F(n//2)
    return 1 + F(3*n+1)

answer = F(N)
print(answer)

<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
