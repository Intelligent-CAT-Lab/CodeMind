The variable n is initialized to 4.
The variable m is initialized to 0.
The variable tmp is initialized to 0.
The code enters a while loop that iterates while m is less than n.
Inside the loop, tmp is incremented by 1.
Then m is incremented by tmp.
The code then enters a for loop that iterates from 1 to tmp+1.
Inside the loop, it checks if m-n is equal to i.
The condition is met when i is 1,2,3,4.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of i, which is 4.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
n = int(input())
m = 0
tmp = 0
while m < n:
    tmp += 1
    m += tmp
for i in range(1,tmp+1):
    if m-n!= i:
        print(i)

</Code>
