The variable N is initialized to 12.
The code checks if N is odd. Since it is, the code prints 0 and exits.
The code then divides N by 2, which is 6.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 1000, meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 1000.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of all multiples of 5 up to and including i.
The code checks if N is less than 5**i. If it is, it prints the final value of ans, which is 1000.
<<<Output>>>
1000

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N=int(input())
if N%2==1:
  print(0)
  exit()
ans=0
N//=2
for i in range(1,1000):
  ans+=N//(5**i)
  if N<5**i:
    print(
