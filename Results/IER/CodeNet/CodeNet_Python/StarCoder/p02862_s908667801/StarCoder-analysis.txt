The variable x, variable y are initialized to 3, 3, respectively.
The code calculates the number of moves n that the robot needs to make to reach the destination.
The code checks if the number of moves is not divisible by 3. If it is, it prints 0 and exits.
The code then subtracts n from x and y.
The code checks if x and y are negative. If they are, it prints 0 and exits.
