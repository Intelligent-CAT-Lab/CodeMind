Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable n, variable a and variable b are initialized to 10, 3 and 5, respectively.
variable maximum is initialized to the minimum of a and b, which is 3.
variable minimum is initialized to the maximum of 0 and a+b-n, which is 0.
The code then prints the values of maximum and minimum, which are 3 and 0, respectively.
