Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable n, variable a and variable b are initialized to 10, 3 and 5, respectively.
variable maximum is initialized to the minimum of a and b, which is 3.
variable minimum is initialized to the maximum of 0 and a+b-n, which is 0.
The code then prints the values of maximum and minimum, which are 3 and 0, respectively.
<<<Output>>>
3 0

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
n, a, b = map(int, input().split())

maximum = min(a,b)
minimum = max(0, a+b-n)

print(maximum, minimum)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10 3 5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
