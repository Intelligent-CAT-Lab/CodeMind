The variable n is initialized to 4.
The variable m is initialized to 2**n, which is 2**4, which is 16.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to m-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 15.
For each number i in this range, it initializes a list temp with n elements, which is [0,0,0,0].
The variable j is initialized to i.
The variable count is initialized to 0.
The code then enters a while loop that iterates while j is greater than 0.
Inside the while loop, it checks if j is odd. If it is, it sets temp[count] to 1.
It then divides j by 2 and stores the result in j.
It then increments count by 1.
The code then exits the while loop.
The code then initializes a list temp2 with 0 elements.
The code then enters a for loop that iterates from 0 to n-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 3.
For each number k in this range, it checks if temp[k] is 1. If it is, it appends k to temp2.
The code then exits the for loop.
The code then prints i, followed by a colon, followed by the elements of temp2.
If i is not 0, it prints a space, followed by a colon, followed by the elements of temp2.
If i is 0, it prints a colon.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the following:
0: 0
1: 1 2
2: 3 2
3: 1 2 3 2
4: 0
5: 1 2
6: 3 2
7: 1 2 3 2
8: 0
9: 1 2
10: 3 2
11: 1 2 3 2
12: 0
13: 1 2
14: 3 2
15: 1 2 3 2
