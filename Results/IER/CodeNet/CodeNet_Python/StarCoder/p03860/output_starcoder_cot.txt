Instruction: I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
For example:

Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
20 2 5
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
Consider the following code:

A,x,C=input().split()
print("A"+x[0]+"C")

What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
AtCoder Beginner Contest

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The code prints the string "A" concatenated with the first character of the string x, which is "A" in this case, and "C" concatenated with the last character of the string x, which is "t" in this case.

The output of code execution is:
AAtCoder
END-OF-OUTPUT

Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single string S.
The second line of each test case contains a single string x.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one string ― the output of the code execution.

END-OF-OUTPUT

Explanation
Example case 1:
The first character of the string x is "A", so the output is "A" concatenated with the first character of the string S, which is "A" in this case, and "C" concatenated with the last character of the string S, which is "t" in this case.

Example case 2:
The first character of the string x is "A", so the output is "A" concatenated with the first character of the string S, which is "A" in this case, and "C" concatenated with the last character of the string S, which is "t" in this case.

Example case 3:
The first character of
