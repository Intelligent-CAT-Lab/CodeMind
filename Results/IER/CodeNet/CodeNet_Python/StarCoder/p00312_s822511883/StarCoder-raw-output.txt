Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable a is initialized to 10, and variable b is initialized to 5.
The code calculates the integer division of a by b and stores the result in variable c.
The code calculates the remainder of a divided by b and stores the result in variable d.
The code prints the sum of c and d, which is 15.
<<<Output>>>
15
