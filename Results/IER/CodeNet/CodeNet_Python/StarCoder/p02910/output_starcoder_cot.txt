Instruction: I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
For example:

Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
20 2 5
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
Consider the following code:

s = input()
odd = ["R", "U", "D"]
even = ["L", "U", "D"]

for i in range(0,len(s),2):
	if s[i] not in odd:
		print("No")
		exit()
		
for j in range(1,len(s),2):
	if s[j] not in even:
		print("No")
		exit()
		
print("Yes")	
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
RUDLUDR

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The code first reads a string s and stores it in a variable.
The code then creates two lists, odd and even, which contain the characters R, U, D and L, respectively.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to the length of s in steps of 2.
For each iteration, the code checks if the character at index i is in odd. If it is not, the code prints "No" and exits the loop.
The code then enters another loop that iterates from 1 to the length of s in steps of 2.
For each iteration, the code checks if the character at index j is in even. If it is not, the code prints "No" and exits the loop.
The code then prints "Yes" and exits the loop.

The output of code execution is:
Yes
