Instruction: I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
For example:

Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
20 2 5
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84

What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
25

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The code first initializes a list lis to contain the prime factors of 25, which is [5, 5].
The code then initializes a dictionary f to store the number of ways to choose a subset of 5 numbers from 1 to 25.
The code then initializes a dictionary p to store the number of ways to choose a subset of 5 numbers from 1 to 25.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over all prime factors of 25, which is [5, 5].
For each prime factor k in this list, the code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to k (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 5.
For each number a in this range, the code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to k-a (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 4.
For each number b in this range, the code checks if the pair (a,b) has already been considered. If it has, it skips the current iteration.
If the pair (a,b) has not been considered, it adds 1 to the number of ways to choose a subset of 5 numbers from 1 to 25.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 25 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 25.
For each number a in this range, the code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 25-a (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 24.
For each number b in this range, the code checks if the pair (a,b) has already been considered. If it has, it skips the current iteration.
If the pair (a,b) has not been considered, it adds 1 to
