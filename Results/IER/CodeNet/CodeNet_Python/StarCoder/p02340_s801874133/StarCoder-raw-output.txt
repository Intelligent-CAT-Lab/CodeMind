The variable n is initialized to 5, and variable k is initialized to 3.
The code then calls the function partition(n+k, k), which is partition(8, 3).
The function partition(8, 3) is called with the following arguments:
n = 8
k = 3
The function partition(8, 3) is called with the following arguments:
n = 5
k = 2
The function partition(8, 3) is called with the following arguments:
n = 3
k = 1
The function partition(8, 3) is called with the following arguments:
n = 2
k = 0
The function partition(8, 3) is called with the following arguments:
n = 1
k = 0
The function partition(8, 3) is called with the following arguments:
n = 0
k = 0
The function partition(8, 3) returns 1.
The function partition(5, 2) is called with the following arguments:
n = 5
k = 1
The function partition(5, 2) is called with the following arguments:
n = 4
k = 0
The function partition(5, 2) is called with the following arguments:
n = 3
k = 0
The function partition(5, 2) is called with the following arguments:
n = 2
k = 0
The function partition(5, 2) is called with the following arguments:
n = 1
k = 0
The function partition(5, 2) is called with the following arguments:
n = 0
k = 0
The function partition(5, 2) returns 1.
The function partition(3, 1) is called with the following arguments:
n = 3
k = 0
The function partition(3, 1) is called with the following arguments:
n = 2
k = 0
The function partition(3, 1) is called with the following arguments:
n = 1
k = 0
The function partition(3, 1) is called with the following arguments:
