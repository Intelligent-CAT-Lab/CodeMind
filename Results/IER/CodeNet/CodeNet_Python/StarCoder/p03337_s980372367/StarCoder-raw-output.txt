The variable A and variable B are initialized to 3 and 1, respectively.
The code calculates the values of a1, a2 and a3.
The code checks if a1 is greater than or equal to a2 and a1 is greater than or equal to a3.
If it is, it prints a1.
If it is not, it checks if a2 is greater than or equal to a1 and a2 is greater than or equal to a3.
If it is, it prints a2.
If it is not, it checks if a3 is greater than or equal to a1 and a3 is greater than or equal to a2.
If it is, it prints a3.
