Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable a and variable b are initialized to 0 and 5, respectively.
The code checks if b is equal to 100. If it is, it adds 1 to b.
The code then prints the product of b and 100 raised to the power of a.
<<<Output>>>
5000

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b=map(int, input().split())
if a == 0:
  a = 1
if b == 0:
  b = 1
print(a*b)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```0 0
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
