Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable s is initialized to "pdbq".
The variable x is initialized to the length of s, which is 4.
The variable ans is initialized to "Yes", which will be used to store the answer.
The code checks if x is odd. Since x is 4, it is not odd. Therefore, ans is set to "No".
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to x//2-1, meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 2.
For each number i in this range, it checks if s[i] is equal to "b" and s[x-i-1] is equal to "d". If it is, it sets ans to "No".
The code also checks if s[i] is equal to "d" and s[x-i-1] is equal to "b". If it is, it sets ans to "No".
The code also checks if s[i] is equal to "p" and s[x-i-1] is equal to "q". If it is, it sets ans to "No".
The code also checks if s[i] is equal to "q" and s[x-i-1] is equal to "p". If it is, it sets ans to "No".
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is "Yes".
