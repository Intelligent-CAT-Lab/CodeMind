Instruction: I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
For example:

Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
20 2 5
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
Consider the following code:

def inpl(): return list(map(int, input().split()))
N, M = inpl()

n2 = N * 1
n1 = N * 1
m1 = M * 1
mall = M * 2

# うくをほろぼす
ans1 = 0
while True:
    mall -= n1
    m1 = -(-mall//2)
    
    if mall <= 0:
        break
    ans1 += 1
    
    if n2 - m1 >= 0:
        n2 -= m1
    else:
        n1 = n1 + n2 - m1
        n2 = 0
    if n1 <= 0:

        break
    ans1 += 1

# ushiを滅ぼす

ans2 = 0
n2 = N * 1
n1 = N * 1
m1 = M * 1
m2 = M * 1
mall = M * 2
nall = N * 2

while True:
    if m2 - n1 >= 0:
        m2 -= n1
    else:
        m1 = m1 + m2 - n1
        m2 = 0
    if m1 <= 0:

        break
    ans2 += 1

    nall -= m1
    n1 = -(-nall//2)
    
    if nall <= 0:
        break
    ans2 += 1

print(min(ans1, ans2))

What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
20 10

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N is initialized to 20, and the variable M is initialized to 10.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
