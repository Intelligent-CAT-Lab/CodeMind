The variable A is initialized to 0.
The variable left is initialized to an empty list.
The variable Lake is initialized to an empty list.
The variable s is initialized to the input string.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to the length of s (exclusive), meaning it will consider all characters in s.
If the character at position i is a backslash, it appends i to the list left.
If the character at position i is a forward slash, it checks if the list left is empty. If it is not empty, it pops the last element of left and stores it in w. It then calculates the distance between i and w and adds it to A.
It then enters a loop that iterates from the length of Lake (exclusive) to 0 (inclusive), meaning it will consider all elements in Lake.
If the element at position i in Lake has a starting position greater than w, it pops the last element of Lake and stores it in x. It then calculates the distance between w and x and adds it to goukei. It then appends [w, goukei] to Lake.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of A, which is 4.
The code then checks if the length of Lake is 0. If it is, it prints 0.
If it is not, it prints the length of Lake and then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to the length of Lake (exclusive), meaning it will consider all elements in Lake.
If the element at position i in Lake is the last element in Lake, it prints the distance between the starting position of the element and the ending position of the element.
If the element at position i in Lake is not the last element in Lake, it prints the distance between the starting position of the element and the ending position of the element, followed by a space.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())
A = []
for i in range(N):
    A.append(int(input()))
A.sort()
for i in range(N):
    print(A[i])

<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3
1

```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The variable N is initialized to the input integer.
The variable A is initialized to an empty list.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to N (exclusive), meaning it will consider all integers in the range [0, N).
It then appends the input integer to the list A.
After the loop finishes, the code sorts the list A in ascending order.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to N (exclusive), meaning it will consider all integers in the range [0, N).
It then prints the element at position i in A.
