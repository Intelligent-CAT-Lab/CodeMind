TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())

if N % 2 == 0:
	print("even")
else:
	print("odd")
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
