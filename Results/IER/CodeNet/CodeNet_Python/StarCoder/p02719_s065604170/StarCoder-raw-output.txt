Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable n is initialized to 7, and variable m is initialized to 4.
The code calculates the remainder of n divided by m, which is 3.
The code calculates the remainder of -n divided by m, which is -3.
The code prints the minimum of these two values, which is -3.
<<<Output>>>
-3
