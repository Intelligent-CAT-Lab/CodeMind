The code first reads the input string s and stores it in a variable.
The code then initializes a variable ans to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 3 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 3.
For each number i in this range, it enters another loop that iterates from 1 to 3 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 3.
For each number j in this range, it enters another loop that iterates from 1 to 3 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 3.
For each number k in this range, it calculates the following:
n1 = s[:i]
n2 = s[i:i+j]
n3 = s[i+j:i+j+k]
n4 = s[i+j+k:]
The code then checks if n1, n2, n3 and n4 are valid IP addresses.
The code checks if n1 is valid by checking if it is empty or if its first character is 0.
The code checks if n2 is valid by converting it to an integer and checking if it is within the range [0, 255].
The code checks if n3 is valid by converting it to an integer and checking if it is within the range [0, 255].
The code checks if n4 is valid by converting it to an integer and checking if it is within the range [0, 255].
The code then adds 1 to ans if all the conditions are met.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 2.

  return 0 <= int(num) <= 255
s = input()
ans = 0
