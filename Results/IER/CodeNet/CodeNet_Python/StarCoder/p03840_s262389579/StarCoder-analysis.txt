Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The code first imports the sys module.
The code then defines a function solve() that takes no arguments.
The function then reads the input from stdin and splits it into 7 variables.
The code then calculates the answer and stores it in the variable Ans.
The code then calculates the minimum of the variables I, J and L and stores it in the variable six.
The code then adds 3 times six to Ans.
The code then subtracts six from I, J and L.
The code then adds 2 times the sum of I, J and L divided by 2 to Ans.
The code then calculates the remainder of the sum of I, J and L divided by 2.
The code then checks if six is greater than 0 and if the remainder is 2. If both conditions are met, the code adds 1 to Ans.
The code then prints the final value of Ans, which is 10.
