Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The code first reads the input, which is 'SAT'.
The code then creates a list of days of the week, which is ['SUN','MON', 'TUE', 'WED', 'THU', 'FRI', 'SAT'].
The code then uses the index() method to find the index of the input in the list.
The index() method returns the index of the first occurrence of the input in the list.
The code then subtracts 7 from the index, which is 6.
The code then prints the final value of the index, which is 6.
<<<Output>>>
6
