The code first imports the sys module, which is used to set the recursion limit.
The function solve() is defined. It takes a string as input and returns True if the string is a valid permutation of ABC, and False otherwise.
The function first checks if the length of the string is 3. If it is, it checks if the string is ABC. If it is, it returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.
If the length of the string is not 3, the code enters a while loop that iterates over the string.
The variable i is initialized to 0.
The variables a, b and c are initialized to 0.
The list lis is initialized to an empty list.
The while loop continues as long as i is less than the length of the string.
The code checks if i+2 is less than the length of the string and if the characters at positions i, i+1 and i+2 are equal to A, B and C, respectively. If it is, it appends the string X to the list lis.
If the characters at positions i, i+1 and i+2 are not equal to A, B and C, respectively, it appends the character at position i to the list lis.
If the character at position i is equal to A, it increments the value of a.
If the character at position i is equal to B, it increments the value of b.
If the character at position i is equal to C, it increments the value of c.
The code then increments i by 1.
The code checks if a+b+c is equal to 2. If it is not, it returns False.
If a is equal to 0, it checks if the character at position i is equal to X. If it is, it replaces the character at position i with A.
If b is equal to 0, it checks if the character at position i is equal to X. If it is, it replaces the character at position i with B.
If c is equal to 0, it checks if the character at position i is equal to X. If it is, it replaces the character at position i with C.
The code then checks if the length of the string is equal to the length of the list lis. If it is, it returns False.
The code then calls the function solve() with the list lis as input.
If the function returns True, it prints Yes. Otherwise, it prints No.
