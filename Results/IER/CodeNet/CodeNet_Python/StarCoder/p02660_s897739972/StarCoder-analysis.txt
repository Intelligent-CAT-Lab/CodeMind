The variable n is initialized to 24.
The function factorization is defined. It takes a single parameter n, which is the number to be factorized.
The function creates an empty array arr.
The variable temp is initialized to n.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 2 to the square root of n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 2 to 12.
If temp is divisible by i, the code divides temp by i and stores the quotient in temp. The code also increments the counter cnt by 1.
The code then checks if temp is equal to 1. If it is, it adds the current number i to arr. The condition is met when i is 2 and 12.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if temp is not equal to 1. If it is, it adds the current number i to arr. The condition is met when i is 12.
The code then checks if arr is empty. If it is, it adds the current number n to arr. The condition is met when n is 24.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to the length of arr (exclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 2.
The variable k is initialized to the value of the ith element of arr, which is the number of times i appears in arr.
The variable ans is initialized to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to k (exclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 1.
The variable ans is incremented by 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to k (exclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 1.
The variable ans is incremented by 1.
