Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N, variable d1 and variable xx are initialized to 1, 3 and 3, respectively.
variable d is initialized to 3, which will be used to accumulate the sum of the first term of the series.
variable x is initialized to 3, which will be used to accumulate the sum of the second term of the series.
variable res is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of the series.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 1.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of the first term and the second term of the series and adds them to res.
The code then updates the values of d and x.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of res, which is 1.0.
<<<Output>>>
1.0

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())

sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if sum_order % 3 == 0:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
