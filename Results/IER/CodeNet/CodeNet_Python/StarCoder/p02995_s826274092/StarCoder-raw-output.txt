The function gcd is defined to calculate the greatest common divisor of two numbers.
The variables A, B, C and D are initialized to 4, 9, 2 and 3, respectively.
The variable CD is initialized to C*D // gcd(C,D), which is 2.
The variable a is initialized to A - (A//C + A//D - A//CD), which is 0.
The variable b is initialized to B - (B//C + B//D - B//CD), which is 5.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of b-a, which is 5.
<<<Output>>>
5

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def gcd(x,y):
	x, y = max(x,y), min(x,y)
	while(y):
		x, y = y, x%y
	return x
A,B,C,D = map(int,input().split())
A -= 1
CD = C*D // gcd(C,D)
a = A - (A//C + A//D - A//CD)
b = B - (B//C + B//D - B//CD)
print(b-a)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4 9 2 3
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
