rint the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The code first splits the input string into two strings, a and b.
The code then checks if a and b are equal. If they are not equal, the code sets res to 'D'.
Otherwise, the code sets res to 'H'.
The code then prints the value of res, which is 'H'.
