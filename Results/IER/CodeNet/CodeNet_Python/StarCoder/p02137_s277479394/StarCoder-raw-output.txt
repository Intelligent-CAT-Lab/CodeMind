The variable p is initialized to 5700.
variable sum is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code checks if p is greater than or equal to 10000. If it is, it adds 10000 to sum and subtracts 10000 from p. The condition is met when p is 5700.
The code checks if p is greater than or equal to 5000. If it is, it adds 5000 to sum and subtracts 5000 from p. The condition is met when p is 5000.

The code checks if p is greater than or equal to 500. If it is, it adds 500 to sum and subtracts 500 from p. The condition is met when p is 5000.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum, which is 10000.
