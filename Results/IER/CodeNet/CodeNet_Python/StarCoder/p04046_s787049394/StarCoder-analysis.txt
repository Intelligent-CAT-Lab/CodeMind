The variable h, variable w, variable a and variable b are initialized to 2, 3, 1 and 1, respectively.
The code then calculates the number of points that are within the rectangle.
The points are calculated by iterating over the range [h-a-1, -1] and [b, w].
The former is calculated by iterating over the points and calculating the number of combinations of choosing i points from the top and j points from the left.
The latter is calculated by iterating over the points and calculating the number of combinations of choosing i points from the bottom and j points from the right.
The code then calculates the sum of the product of the former and latter.
