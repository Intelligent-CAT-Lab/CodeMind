The variable h, variable w, variable a and variable b are initialized to 2, 3, 1 and 1, respectively.
The code then calculates the number of points that are within the rectangle.
The points are calculated by iterating over the range [h-a-1, -1] and [b, w].
The former is calculated by iterating over the points and calculating the number of combinations of choosing i points from the top and j points from the left.
The latter is calculated by iterating over the points and calculating the number of combinations of choosing i points from the bottom and j points from the right.
The code then calculates the sum of the product of the former and latter.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import sys

def solve(n, m):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    if m == 0:
        return 1
    if m == 1:
        return n
    if m == 2:
        return n * (n + 1) // 2
    if m == 3:
        return n * (n + 1) * (n + 2) // 6
    if m == 4:
        return n * (n + 1) * (n + 2) * (n + 3) // 24
    if m == 5:
        return n * (n + 1) * (n + 2) * (n + 3) * (n + 4) // 120
    if m == 6:
        return n * (n + 1) * (n + 2) * (n
