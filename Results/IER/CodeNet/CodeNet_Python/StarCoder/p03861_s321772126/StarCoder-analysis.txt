Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The function f is defined to take two arguments, n and deno.
The function returns the number of integers from 1 to n that are divisible by deno.
The variables a, b and x are initialized to 4, 8 and 2, respectively.
The code then calculates the number of integers from 1 to b that are divisible by x.
The code then calculates the number of integers from 1 to a-1 that are divisible by x.
The code then subtracts the first from the second, which gives the answer.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of the answer, which is 3.
