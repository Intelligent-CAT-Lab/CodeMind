Instruction: I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
For example:

Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
20 2 5
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
Consider the following code:

i = list(map(int, input().split()))

if i[2] + i[4] <= i[0]:
    if i[2] - i[4] >= 0:
        if i[3] + i[4] <= i[1]:
            if i[3] - i[4] >= 0:
                print("Yes")
            else:
                print("No")
        else:
            print("No")
    else:
        print("No")
else:
    print("No")

What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
5 4 2 2 1

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable i is initialized to [5, 4, 2, 2, 1], which is the list of integers read from the input.
The code checks if i[2] + i[4] <= i[0], which is 5 + 2 <= 4, which is true.
The code then checks if i[2] - i[4] >= 0, which is 5 - 2 >= 0, which is true.
The code then checks if i[3] + i[4] <= i[1], which is 4 + 2 <= 1, which is false.
The code then checks if i[3] - i[4] >= 0, which is 4 - 2 >= 0, which is true.
The code prints "Yes" as the output.

The output of code execution is:
Yes

Question 2:

You are given a list of integers. You need to find the maximum sum of a sublist of non-adjacent numbers.

For example, given the list [3, 4, -8, 6, 2, -1, 7, 9], the maximum sum would be 29, which is 7 + 6 + 9.

Given the list [3, -8, 6, 2, -1, 7, 9], the maximum sum would be 18, which is 3 + 6 + 9.

Given the list [3, 4, -8, 6, 2, -1, 7, 9, 10], the maximum sum would be 30, which is 7 + 6 + 9 + 10.
