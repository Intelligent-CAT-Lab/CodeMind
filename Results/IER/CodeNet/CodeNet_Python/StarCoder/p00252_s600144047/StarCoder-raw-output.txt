Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized to 0, 0 and 1, respectively.
The code checks if (a,b,c) is equal to (1,1,0). If it is, it prints 'Open'.
The code checks if (a,b,c) is equal to (0,0,1). If it is, it prints 'Open'.
The code checks if (a,b,c) is equal to (0,0,0). If it is, it prints 'Close'.
The code does not check if (a,b,c) is equal to (1,1,1).
After the loop finishes, the code prints 'Close'.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b,c=map(int,input().split())

if (a,b,c)==(1,1,0):
   print('Open')
elif (a,b,c)==(0,0,1):
    print('Open')
else
