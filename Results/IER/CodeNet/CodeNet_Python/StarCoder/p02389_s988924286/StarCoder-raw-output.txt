Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable a and variable b are initialized to 3 and 5, respectively.
The code then prints the product of a and b, followed by the sum of a and b, separated by a space.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b = map(int, input().split())
print(a+b, a-b, a*b, a//b, a%b, a**b)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
