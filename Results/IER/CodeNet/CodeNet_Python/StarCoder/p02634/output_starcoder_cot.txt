Instruction: I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
For example:

Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
20 2 5
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
Consider the following code:

a,b,c,d=map(int,input().split())
mod=998244353
dp=[(d+2)*[0]for _ in range(c+2)]
dp[a][b]=1
for i in range(a,c+1):
    for j in range(b,d+1):
        dp[i][j]%=mod
        dp[i+1][j]+=dp[i][j]*j
        dp[i][j+1]+=dp[i][j]*i
        dp[i+1][j+1]-=dp[i][j]*i*j
print(dp[c][d])

What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
1 1 2 2

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable a, variable b, variable c and variable d are initialized to 1, 1, 2 and 2, respectively.
The variable mod is initialized to 998244353.
The variable dp is initialized to a list of size 3 x 3, where each element is initialized to 0.
The first element of dp is a list of size 3, where each element is initialized to 0.
The second element of dp is a list of size 3, where each element is initialized to 0.
The third element of dp is a list of size 3, where each element is initialized to 0.
The first element of the first element of dp is initialized to 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from a to c (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 2.
For each number i in this range, it enters a loop that iterates from b to d (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 2.
For each number j in this range, it calculates the value of dp[i][j] and stores it in dp[i][j].
The code then enters a loop that iterates from i to c (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 2.
For each number i in this range, it enters a loop that iterates from j to d (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 2.
For each number j in this range, it calculates the value of dp[i+1][j] and stores it in dp[i+1][j].
