The variable k is initialized to 103.
The code enters a loop that iterates until now is less than k.
The code increases now by 10% and then converts it to an integer.
The code increases the counter cnt by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of cnt, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())

sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if sum_order % 3 == 0:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
