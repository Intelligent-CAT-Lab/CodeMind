Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable H, variable W, variable x and variable y are initialized to 3, 5, 1 and 4, respectively.
The code checks if H*W is odd. Since H=3 and W=5, H*W=15. Since 15 is odd, the code prints "No".
The code also checks if (x+y) is odd. Since x=1 and y=4, (x+y)=5. Since 5 is odd, the code prints "No".
