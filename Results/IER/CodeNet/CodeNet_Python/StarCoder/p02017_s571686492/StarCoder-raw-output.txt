Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable H, variable W, variable x and variable y are initialized to 3, 5, 1 and 4, respectively.
The code checks if H*W is odd. Since H=3 and W=5, H*W=15. Since 15 is odd, the code prints "No".
The code also checks if (x+y) is odd. Since x=1 and y=4, (x+y)=5. Since 5 is odd, the code prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N,M=map(int,input().split())
if N%2==0 and M%2==0:
    print("Even")
elif N%2==1 and M%2==1:
    print("Odd")
else:
    print("Either")
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 1
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N and variable M are initialized to 1 and 1, respectively.
The code checks if N is even. Since N=1, it is even.
The code also checks if M is even. Since M=1, it is even.
Since both N and M are even, the code prints "Even".
<<<Output>>>
Even
