Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable n is initialized to 5.
The code checks if n is odd or even.
If n is odd, the code adds 1 to n and then divides it by 2.
If n is even, the code divides it by 2.
The code prints the final value of s, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
n=int(input())
if n%2!=0:
  s=(n+1)//2
else:
  s=n//2
print(s)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```6
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
