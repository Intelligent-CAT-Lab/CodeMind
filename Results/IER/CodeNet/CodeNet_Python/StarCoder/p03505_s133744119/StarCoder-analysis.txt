The variable K, variable A and variable B are initialized to 4000, 2000 and 500, respectively.
The code checks if K is less than or equal to A. If it is, it prints 1.
The code checks if A is less than or equal to B. If it is, it prints -1.
The code checks if K is greater than B. If it is, it calculates the value of x as follows:
x = (K-B-1)/(A-B)+1
The code then prints the value of 2*x-1, which is 1000.
