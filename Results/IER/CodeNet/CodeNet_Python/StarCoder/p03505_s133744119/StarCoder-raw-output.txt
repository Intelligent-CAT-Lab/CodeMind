Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable K, variable A and variable B are initialized to 4000, 2000 and 500, respectively.
The code checks if K is less than or equal to A. If it is, it prints 1.
The code checks if A is less than or equal to B. If it is, it prints -1.
The code checks if K is greater than B. If it is, it calculates the value of x as follows:
x = (K-B-1)/(A-B)+1
The code then prints the value of 2*x-1, which is 1000.
<<<Output>>>
1000

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
# coding:utf-8

N, A, B = map(int, raw_input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
