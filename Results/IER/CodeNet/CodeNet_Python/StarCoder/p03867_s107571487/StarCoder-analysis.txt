The variable n is initialized to 4, and variable k is initialized to 2.
The code then calculates the prime factorization of n, which is [2,2,2,2].
The code then calculates the number of elements in the prime factorization, which is 4.
The code then initializes an array nums of length 4, which will be used to store the values of the terms in the recurrence relation.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to m-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 3.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the value of the term in the recurrence relation and stores it in val.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to i-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to i-1.
For each number j in this range, it calculates the value of the term in the recurrence relation and subtracts it from val.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to m-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 3.
For each number j in this range, it calculates the value of the term in the recurrence relation and subtracts it from val.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to m-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 3.
