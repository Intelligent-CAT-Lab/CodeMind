Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable n is initialized to 2.
The code checks if n is equal to 1 or 2. If it is, it prints the answer and exits.
If n is not equal to 1 or 2, it prints n-1, which is 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n-2, meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 1.
For each number i in this range, it prints the string "1" + "0"*i + "1", which is "1" + "0" + "1" for i=0 and "1" + "00" + "1" for i=1.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
n = int(input())

if n == 1:
    print(1)
    print(0)
    exit()
if n == 2:
    print(2)
    print(0)
    print(11)
    exit()

print(n-1)
for i in range(n-1):
    print("1" + "0"*i + "1")

<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
