Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable n is initialized to 2, and variable r is initialized to 2919.
The code checks if n is less than 10. If it is, it prints the sum of r and 100 multiplied by 10 minus n. In this case, n is 2, so the code prints 2919+100*8=2939.
If n is not less than 10, the code prints r. In this case, n is 20, so the code prints 2919.
