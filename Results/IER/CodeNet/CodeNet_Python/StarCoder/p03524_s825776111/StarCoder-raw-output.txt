Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable S is initialized to "abac".
The code counts the number of occurrences of the letter "a", which is 2.
The code counts the number of occurrences of the letter "b", which is 2.
The code counts the number of occurrences of the letter "c", which is 1.
The code checks if the difference between the maximum and minimum of these three numbers is greater than or equal to 2.
Since the difference is 1, the condition is not met, and the code prints "YES".
<<<Output>>>
YES
