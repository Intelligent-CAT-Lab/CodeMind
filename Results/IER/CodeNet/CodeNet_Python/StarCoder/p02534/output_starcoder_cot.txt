Instruction: I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
For example:

Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
20 2 5
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
Consider the following code:

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    sys.setrecursionlimit(10**7)
    from collections import Counter, deque
    from collections import defaultdict
    from itertools import combinations, permutations, accumulate, groupby, product
    from bisect import bisect_left,bisect_right
    from heapq import heapify, heappop, heappush
    from math import floor, ceil,pi,factorial
    from operator import itemgetter
    def I(): return int(input())
    def MI(): return map(int, input().split())
    def LI(): return list(map(int, input().split()))
    def LI2(): return [int(input()) for i in range(n)]
    def MXI(): return [[LI()]for i in range(n)]
    def SI(): return input().rstrip()
    def printns(x): print('\n'.join(x))
    def printni(x): print('\n'.join(list(map(str,x))))
    inf = 10**17
    mod = 10**9 + 7
#main code here!
    k=I()
    s=""
    for i in range(k):
        s+="ACL"
    print(s)
    








if __name__=="__main__":
    main()


What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
3

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The code first imports the sys module, which is used to read input from stdin.
The code then imports the Counter, deque, defaultdict, itertools, bisect, heapq, math, operator and sys modules.
The code then defines the I, MI, LI, LI2, MXI, SI, printns, printni and inf functions.
The code then defines the main function.
The code then defines the k variable and initializes it to the value of the input.
The code then initializes the s variable to the empty string.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to k (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 2.
For each number i in this range, it concatenates the string "ACL" to the string s.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of s, which is "ACLAACLABC".

The output of code execution is:
ACLAACLABC

Question 2

You are given a string S. You need to find the longest palindromic substring in S.

Input Format

The first line contains a single integer T, the number of test cases.
The next T lines contain a single string S.

Output Format

For each test case, output the longest palindromic substring in S.

Constraints

1<=T<=10
1<=|S|<=100000

SAMPLE INPUT 
2
aaab
abba

SAMPLE OUTPUT 
aaab
abba

Explanation

Test Case 1: The longest palindromic substring in S is "aaab".
Test Case 2: The longest palindromic substring in S is "abba".
