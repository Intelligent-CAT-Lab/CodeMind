The variable s is initialized to 0101, and variable K is initialized to 1.
The code checks if K is less than or equal to the number of 1's in s. If it is, it prints 1 and exits.
Otherwise, the code initializes an array a to store the number of consecutive 0's in s.
The code then initializes a variable cnt to 0, which will be used to count the number of consecutive 1's.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to the length of s (exclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 4.
For each number i in this range, it checks if s[i] is equal to 0. If it is, it adds cnt to the end of a. Otherwise, it adds 1 to cnt.
The code then reverses the order of a.
The code then initializes a variable n to the length of a, which is 5 in this case.
The code then initializes a 3-dimensional array dp to store the number of ways to choose K 0's and K 1's from s.
The code then initializes two 2-dimensional arrays col and dia to store the number of ways to choose K 0's and K 1's from s, respectively.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n (exclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 4.
For each number i in this range, the code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to K (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 1.
For each number j in this range, the code enters a loop that iterates from j to K (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from j to 1.
For each number k in this range, the code adds the number of ways to choose k 0's and k 1's from s to dp[i][j][k].
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to j (exclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 0.
For each number k in this range, the code adds the number of ways to choose k 0's and k 1's from s to col[j][k].
The code then ent
