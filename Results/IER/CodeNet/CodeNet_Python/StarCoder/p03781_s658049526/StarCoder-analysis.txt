Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable X is initialized to 6.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to X (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 6.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of the first i natural numbers.
The code checks if the sum is greater than or equal to X. If it is, it prints the current number i and breaks the loop.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of i, which is 3.
