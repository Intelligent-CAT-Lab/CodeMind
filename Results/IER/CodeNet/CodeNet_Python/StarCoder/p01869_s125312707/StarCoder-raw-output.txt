The variable n is initialized to 1.
The code first checks if n is odd. If it is, it prints -1 and exits.
Otherwise, it initializes the list a to be empty.
The code then calls the function f, which is a recursive function that generates all the binary numbers less than or equal to n.
The function f first checks if bin is greater than n. If it is, it returns.
Otherwise, it checks if bin is 0. If it is, it adds bin to the list a.
Otherwise, it calls itself recursively with bin*10+2 and n as arguments.
It also calls itself recursively with bin*10+8 and n as arguments.
The function f returns after all the recursive calls are done.
The code then sorts the list a and appends 10**20 to the end of it.
The code then calls the function g, which is a recursive function that calculates the maximum number of times that n can be divided by a[p] for all p in [0,len(a)-1].
The function g first initializes the variable m to -1<<20.
The code then finds the smallest index i such that a[i] is greater than or equal to n.
If i is not equal to len(a), it checks if a[i] is equal to n. If it is, it sets m to 1.
The code then checks if a[p]**2 is greater than n. If it is, it returns m.
Otherwise, it checks if n is divisible by a[p]. If it is, it sets m to g(n//a[p],p)+1.
The code then returns the maximum of m and g(n,p+1).
The code then prints the final value of b, which is 1.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(n):
    if n==1:return 1
    if n==2:return 2
    if n==3:return 4
    return f(n-1)+f(n-2)+f(n-3)

n=int(input())
print(f(n))
