t the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N is initialized to 11.
The code then calculates the divisors of 2N, which is 22.
The code enters a loop that iterates over the divisors of 2N.
For each divisor n, it calculates the pair (u, v) = (n, 2N/n).
The code checks if u and v are relatively prime, which is the case.
The code then calculates the solution to the Chinese Remainder Theorem, which is (0, u) and (v-1, v).
The code checks if the solution is 0, which is not the case.
The code then checks if the solution is less than the current answer, which is 10**20.
If the solution is less than the current answer, the code updates the current answer to the solution.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of the current answer, which is 10.
