The code first defines a function cmb(n, r, mod) that calculates the number of combinations of n objects taken r at a time.
The function is called with the following parameters:
n = 4*10**6
r = 2
mod = 10**9+7
The function returns the number of combinations of 4*10**6 objects taken 2 at a time.
The code then defines two global variables:
mod = 10**9+7 #出力の制限
N = 4*10**6
The code then initializes two tables:
g1 = [1]*(N+1) # 元テーブル
g2 = [1]*(N+1) #逆元テーブル
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 2 to 4*10**6.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the following:
g1[i]=( ( g1[i-1] * i ) % mod )
inverse[i]=( ( -inverse[mod % i] * (mod//i) ) % mod )
g2[i]=( (g2[i-1] * inverse[i]) % mod )
The code then enters a loop that iterates from N to 0 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 4*10**6 to 2.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the following:
for j in range(i-1,-1,-1):
    n=(N-(j+1))*(K-1)+N-i
    dp[j]+=(cmb(n+K-2,K-2,mod)*dp[j+1])%mod
    dp[j]%=mod
The code then prints the final value of dp[0]*g1[N], which is 1000000007.
