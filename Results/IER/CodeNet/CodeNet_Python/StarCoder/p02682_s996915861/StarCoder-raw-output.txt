Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variables A, B, C and K are initialized to 2, 1, 1 and 3, respectively.
variable sum is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code checks if K is greater than or equal to A. If it is, it adds A to sum and subtracts A from K.
If K is less than A, it adds K to sum and sets K to 0.
The code then checks if K is greater than or equal to B and if K is greater than 1. If it is, it subtracts B from K.
If K is less than B or 1, it sets K to 0.
The code then checks if K is greater than or equal to C and if K is greater than 1. If it is, it subtracts C from sum.
If K is less than C or 1, it subtracts K from sum.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum, which is 0.
<<<Output>>>
