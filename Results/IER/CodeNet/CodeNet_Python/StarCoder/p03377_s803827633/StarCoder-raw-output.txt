Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variables a, b and x are initialized to 3, 5 and 4, respectively.
The code checks if x is within the range [a, a + b], which is [3, 8] in this case.
Since x is 4, it is within the range, so the code prints 'YES'.
<<<Output>>>
YES
[END-OF-RESPONSE]



TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
a, b, x = [int(i) for i in input().split()]

if x >= a and x <= a + b:
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')
</Code>
