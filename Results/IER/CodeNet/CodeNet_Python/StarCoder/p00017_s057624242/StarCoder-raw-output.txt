The code first imports the sys and string modules.
The variable alpha is initialized to the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyza'.
The variable tbl is initialized to the string 'bcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzaab'.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the lines in the standard input.
Inside the loop, the code checks if the string 'the', 'this' or 'that' is in the current line. If it is not, the code translates the string using the translation table tbl.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the last line of the input, which is 'that'.
<<<Output>>>
that

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import sys
for line in sys.stdin:
  line = line.strip()
  if line == '':
    continue
  print line
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```

```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The code first imports the sys module.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the lines in the standard input.
Inside the loop, the code strips the current line of leading and trailing whitespace characters.
If the current line is empty, the code skips the rest of the loop body and goes to the next iteration.
If the current line is not empty, the code prints the current line.
After the loop finishes, the code prints nothing.
