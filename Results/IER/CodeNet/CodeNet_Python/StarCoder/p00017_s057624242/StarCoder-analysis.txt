The code first imports the sys and string modules.
The variable alpha is initialized to the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyza'.
The variable tbl is initialized to the string 'bcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzaab'.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the lines in the standard input.
Inside the loop, the code checks if the string 'the', 'this' or 'that' is in the current line. If it is not, the code translates the string using the translation table tbl.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the last line of the input, which is 'that'.
