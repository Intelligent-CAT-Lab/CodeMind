The variable d is initialized to 1.000.
The code then prints the maximum of the integer part of d plus 1 and the square root of d, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, M = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if sum_order == M:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20 2```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N, variable M are initialized to 20 and 2, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is equal to M, which is 2 in this case. If it is, it adds the current number
