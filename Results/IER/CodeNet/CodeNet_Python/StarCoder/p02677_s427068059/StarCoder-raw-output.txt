The variables A, B, H and M are initialized to 3, 4, 9 and 0, respectively.
The code calculates the value of h by multiplying H by 30 and adding M/2.
The code calculates the value of m by multiplying M by 6.
The code calculates the value of y by taking the absolute value of the difference between h and m.
The code calculates the value of x_2 by taking the square root of the sum of the squares of A and B, minus twice the product of A and B and the cosine of y.
The code calculates the value of x by taking the square root of x_2.
After the calculations are complete, the code prints the final value of x, which is 5.0.
<<<Output>>>
5.0

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, M = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if sum_order == M:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
