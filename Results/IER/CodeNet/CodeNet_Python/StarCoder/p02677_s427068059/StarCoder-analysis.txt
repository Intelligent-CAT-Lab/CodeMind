Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variables A, B, H and M are initialized to 3, 4, 9 and 0, respectively.
The code calculates the value of h by multiplying H by 30 and adding M/2.
The code calculates the value of m by multiplying M by 6.
The code calculates the value of y by taking the absolute value of the difference between h and m.
The code calculates the value of x_2 by taking the square root of the sum of the squares of A and B, minus twice the product of A and B and the cosine of y.
The code calculates the value of x by taking the square root of x_2.
After the calculations are complete, the code prints the final value of x, which is 5.0.
