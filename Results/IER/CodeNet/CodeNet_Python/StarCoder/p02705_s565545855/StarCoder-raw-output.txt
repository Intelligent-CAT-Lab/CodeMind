The code first imports the math module.
The code then reads the input and converts it to a float.
The code then multiplies the float by 2 and by pi, which is 6.283185307179586.
The code then prints the final value of the expression, which is 12.566370614359172.
<<<Output>>>
12.566370614359172

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N is initialized to 10.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of even numbers.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 10.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is even. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,4,6,8 and 10.
