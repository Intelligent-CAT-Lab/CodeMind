The variable n, variable x are initialized to 5 and 2, respectively.
The code then calculates the minimum of x and n-x, which is 2.
The code then calculates the difference between n and x, which is 3.
The code then initializes the variable ans to 0.
The code then enters a loop that will run until the condition is met.
The code calculates the new value of x by dividing n by x, which is 2.
The code calculates the new value of n by dividing n by x, which is 1.
The code checks if new_x is equal to 0. If it is, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 10.
If the condition is not met, the code adds x*new_n*3 to ans, which is 6 to ans, which is 10.
The code then updates n to x, which is 2.
The code then updates x to new_x, which is 1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 10.
