Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable n, variable x are initialized to 5 and 2, respectively.
The code then calculates the minimum of x and n-x, which is 2.
The code then calculates the difference between n and x, which is 3.
The code then initializes the variable ans to 0.
The code then enters a loop that will run until the condition is met.
The code calculates the new value of x by dividing n by x, which is 2.
The code calculates the new value of n by dividing n by x, which is 1.
The code checks if new_x is equal to 0. If it is, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 10.
If the condition is not met, the code adds x*new_n*3 to ans, which is 6 to ans, which is 10.
The code then updates n to x, which is 2.
The code then updates x to new_x, which is 1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
n = int(input())
ans = 0
for i in range(1,n+1):
  if i%3 == 0 or i%5 == 0:
    ans += i
print(ans)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
