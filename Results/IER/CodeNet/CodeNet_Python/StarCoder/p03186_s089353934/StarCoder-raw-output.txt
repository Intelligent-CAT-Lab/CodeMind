Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variables A, B and C are initialized to 3, 1 and 4, respectively.
The code checks if (A+B)>C-1, which is true in this case.
If it is true, the code prints B+C, which is 5.
If it is false, the code prints B+(A+B)+1, which is 5.
<<<Output>>>
5

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
# coding: utf-8
# Your code here!
N,M=map(int,input().split())

if N%M==0:
    print(N//M)
else:
    print(N//M+1)

<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10 3
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variables N and M are initialized to 10 and 3, respectively.
The code checks if N%M==0, which is false in this case.
If it is false, the code prints N//M+1, which is 4.
If it is true, the code prints N//M, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>
