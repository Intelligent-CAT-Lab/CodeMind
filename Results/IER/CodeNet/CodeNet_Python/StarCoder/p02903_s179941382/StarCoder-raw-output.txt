Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable h, variable w, variable a and variable b are initialized to 3, 3, 1 and 1, respectively.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to b (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 1.
For each number i in this range, it appends a string of length a to the list S.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to h-b (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 2.
For each number i in this range, it appends a string of length a to the list S.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to h (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 2.
For each number i in this range, it prints the string at index i in the list S.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the following:
```
111
011
011
```
<<<Output>>>
111

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import sys
def input(): return sys.stdin.readline().rstrip()
def main():
    n=int(input())
    S=input()
    for i in range(n):
        if S[i]=="1":
            print(i+1)

if __name__=='__main__':
    main()
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5
10101
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The variable n is initialized to 5.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 4.
For each number i in this range, it checks if the character at index i in the string S is "1". If it is, it prints the index i+1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the following
