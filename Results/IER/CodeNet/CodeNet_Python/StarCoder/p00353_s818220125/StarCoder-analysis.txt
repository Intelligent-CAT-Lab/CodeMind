Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized to 1000, 3000 and 3000, respectively.
The code checks if c is less than or equal to a. Since c is 3000 and a is 1000, the condition is met and the code prints 0.
The code then checks if c is less than or equal to a+b. Since c is 3000 and a+b is 4000, the condition is not met and the code prints NA.
