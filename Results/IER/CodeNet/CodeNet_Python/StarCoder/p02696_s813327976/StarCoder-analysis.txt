Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable a, variable b and variable n are initialized to 5, 7 and 4, respectively.
The code checks if b is less than or equal to n+1. If it is, it sets x to b-1. If it is not, it sets x to n.
The code then calculates g as the floor of a*x/b, which is 5*3/7=1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of g, which is 1.
