The variable a, variable b and variable n are initialized to 5, 7 and 4, respectively.
The code checks if b is less than or equal to n+1. If it is, it sets x to b-1. If it is not, it sets x to n.
The code then calculates g as the floor of a*x/b, which is 5*3/7=1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of g, which is 1.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_
