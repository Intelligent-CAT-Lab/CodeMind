The variables A, B and C are initialized to 2, 5 and 4, respectively.
The code then initializes two lists, odd and even, to store the odd and even numbers, respectively.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the numbers A, B and C.
For each number x in this range, it checks if x is even or odd. If it is even, it appends x to the list even. If it is odd, it appends x to the list odd.
The code then initializes a variable cnt to 0.
The code then initializes a list ns to store the numbers that will be used to calculate the answer.
The code then checks if the length of the list even is equal to 2. If it is, it enters a loop that iterates over the numbers in the list even. For each number x in this range, it adds 1 to x and appends the result to the list ns.
The code then checks if the length of the list odd is equal to 2. If it is, it enters a loop that iterates over the numbers in the list odd. For each number x in this range, it adds 1 to x and appends the result to the list ns.
The code then appends the numbers in the list even to the list ns.
The code then appends the numbers in the list odd to the list ns.
The code then sorts the list ns in ascending order.
The code then initializes a variable max_v to the maximum value in the list ns.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the numbers in the list ns. For each number x in this range, it calculates the difference between max_v and x, and divides the result by 2. The result is stored in cnt.
The code then prints the final value of cnt, which is 1.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N,M = map(int, input().split())
a = []
for i in range(N):
    a.append(list(map(int, input().split())))

for i in range(N):
    for j in range(M):
        if a[i][j] == 1:
            print(i,j)
            break
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 3
1 1 1
1 1 1
1 1 1
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variables N and M are initialized to 3 and 3, respectively.
The code then initializes a list a to store the input.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 2.
For each number i in this range, it enters a loop that iterates from 0 to M (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 2.
For each number j in this range, it checks if the value of a[i][j] is equal to 1. If it is, it prints the values of i and j and ends the loop.
The code then prints the values of i and j, which are 0 and 0.
<<<Output>>>
0 0
