The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 8, 3 and 4, respectively.
variable groups is initialized to N // (A+B), which is 2.
variable amari is initialized to N % (A+B), which is 2.
The code checks if amari is greater than A, which is 2. If it is, it prints groups*A + A, which is 2*3 + 3, which is 7.
If amari is not greater than A, it prints groups*A + amari, which is 2*3 + 2, which is 6.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N,A,B = list(map(int, input().split()))

sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
