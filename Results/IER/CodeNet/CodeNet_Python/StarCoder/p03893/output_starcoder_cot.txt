Instruction: I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
For example:

Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
20 2 5
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
Consider the following code:

g = [None]*50
h = [None]*50
h[1] = 3
g[1] = 6
X= int(input())
for i in range(2, X+1):
    h[i] = g[i-1] + 1
    g[i] = 2*h[i]
print(g[X])

What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
2

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable X is initialized to 2.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to X (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 2 to 2.
The code initializes the variables g and h to 50 elements each, with all elements set to None.
The code initializes the first element of h to 3, and the first element of g to 6.
The code initializes the variable X to 2.
The code initializes the variable i to 2.
The code initializes the variable g[i] to 2*h[i], which is 2*3 = 6.
The code initializes the variable h[i] to g[i-1] + 1, which is 6 + 1 = 7.
The code increments i by 1, which is 3.
The code enters the loop again, and the code initializes the variable g[i] to 2*h[i], which is 2*7 = 14.
The code initializes the variable h[i] to g[i-1] + 1, which is 14 + 1 = 15.
The code increments i by 1, which is 4.
The code enters the loop again, and the code initializes the variable g[i] to 2*h[i], which is 2*15 = 30.
The code initializes the variable h[i] to g[i-1] + 1, which is 30 + 1 = 31.
The code increments i by 1, which is 5.
The code enters the loop again, and the code initializes the variable g[i] to 2*h[i], which is 2*31 = 62.
The code
