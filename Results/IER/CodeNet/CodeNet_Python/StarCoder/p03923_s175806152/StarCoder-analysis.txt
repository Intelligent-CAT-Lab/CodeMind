The variable n is initialized to 8, and variable a is initialized to 1.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 39, meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 39.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the maximum value of n^i, which is 8^i, and stores it in maxi.
The code then calculates the minimum value of n^i - n^(i-1), which is 8^i - 8^(i-1), and stores it in subt.
The code checks if a*i + maxi*(i + 1) - subt is less than ans, which is 1*0 + 8*1 - 0 = 8. If it is, it updates ans to a*i + maxi*(i + 1) - subt. The condition is met when i is 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 8.
