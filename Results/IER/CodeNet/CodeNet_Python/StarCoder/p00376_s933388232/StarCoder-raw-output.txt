Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The code first reads the input and stores it in variables x1 and x2.
The code then checks if x2 is greater than x1. If it is, it prints the difference between x2 and x1. If it is not, it prints the difference between x1 and x2.
The difference is calculated by subtracting x2 from x1.
The difference is then converted to an integer and printed.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
