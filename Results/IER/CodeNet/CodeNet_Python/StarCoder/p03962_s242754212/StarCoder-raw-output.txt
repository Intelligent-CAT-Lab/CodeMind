Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The code first reads the input and stores it in a variable str.
The code then prints the length of the set of unique elements in str, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>
3

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if sum_order % 3 == 0:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```100```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N is initialized to 100.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 100.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is divisible by 3, which is true for 0,3,6,9,12,15,18,21,24,27,30,
