The variable s is initialized to the string "needed".
The variable n is initialized to the length of the string s, which is 6.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider indices from 0 to 5.
For each index i in this range, it checks if the character at index i is equal to the character at index i+1. If it is, it prints the indices i and i+1 and exits the loop.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n-2 (inclusive), meaning it will consider indices from 0 to 4.
For each index i in this range, it checks if the character at index i is equal to the character at index i+2. If it is, it prints the indices i and i+2 and exits the loop.
The code then prints -1, -1, which is not a valid pair of indices.
