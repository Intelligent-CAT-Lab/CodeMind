The variable n is initialized to 3, and variable k is initialized to 2.
The code calculates the number of ways to choose k elements from a set of n elements.
The number of ways to choose k elements from a set of n elements is equal to the number of ways to choose k elements from the first n-1 elements, plus the number of ways to choose k-1 elements from the first n-1 elements.
The number of ways to choose k elements from the first n-1 elements is equal to C(n, k) * C(n-1, k), where C(n, k) is the number of ways to choose k elements from a set of n elements.
The number of ways to choose k-1 elements from the first n-1 elements is equal to C(n-1, k-1).
The code then prints the final value of ans, which is 10.
