Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable n is initialized to 2, and variable m is initialized to 0.
The code enters a loop that iterates m times.
The code then reads a line of input and discards it.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of n-m-1, which is 1.
<<<Output>>>
1
[END-OF-RESPONSE]



TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
n,m=map(int,input().split())
for _ in [0]*m:input()
print(n-m-1)

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 1
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
