The variable H, variable W, variable h and variable w are initialized to 3, 3, 2 and 2, respectively.
The code checks if H is divisible by h and if W is divisible by w. If both are true, it prints "No" and exits the program.
If either H or W is not divisible by h or w, it prints "Yes".
If W is divisible by w, it prints "Yes" and then prints the following pattern:
```
-1 -1 -1
-1 1000 -1
-1 -1 -1
```
If H is divisible by h, it prints "Yes" and then prints the following pattern:
```
-1 -1 -1
-1 1000 -1
-1 -1 -1
```
<<<Output>>>
Yes

for i in range(1,N+1):
    if i%3 == 0 and i%5 == 0:
        print('FizzBuzz')
    elif i%3 == 0:
        print('Fizz')
    elif i%5 == 0:
        print('Buzz')
