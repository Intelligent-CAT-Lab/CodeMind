The variable n is initialized to 12.
The function factorize is defined.
The function factorize takes one argument, n, and returns a list of its prime factors.
The variable x is initialized to the return value of factorize(n).
The variable L is initialized to a list of the elements of x, converted to strings.
The variable L is converted to a string by joining the elements of L with a space in between.
The code prints the value of n, followed by a colon, followed by the string representation of L.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>

n=int(input())
def factorize(n):
    b = 2
    fct = []
    while b * b <= n:
        while n % b == 0:
            n //= b
            fct.append(b)
        b = b + 1
    if n > 1:
        fct.append(n)
    return fct

x=factorize(
