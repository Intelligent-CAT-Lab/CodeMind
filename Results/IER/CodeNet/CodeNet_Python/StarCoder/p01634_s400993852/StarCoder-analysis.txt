Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The code first reads the input and stores it in the variable lst.
The code then checks if the length of lst is greater than or equal to 6.
If it is, it checks if the string contains at least one digit, one uppercase letter and one lowercase letter.
If all three conditions are met, the code prints VALID.
If any of the conditions is not met, the code prints INVALID.
