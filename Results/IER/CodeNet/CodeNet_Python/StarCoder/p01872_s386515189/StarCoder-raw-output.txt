The code first reads the input and stores it in a list m.
The code then checks if the 12th character of m is '?'. If it is, it calls the function CheckDisit(m) and prints the output of the function.
If the 12th character of m is not '?', it then checks if the 12th character of m is equal to the output of the function CheckDisit(m). If it is, it prints the 11th character of m.
If the 12th character of m is not equal to the output of the function CheckDisit(m), it then checks if the 12th character of m is equal to the output of the function CheckDisit(m) when the 11th character of m is replaced by 0. If it is, it prints the 11th character of m.
If the 12th character of m is not equal to the output of the function CheckDisit(m) when the 11th character of m is replaced by 0, it then checks if the 12th character of m is equal to the output of the function CheckDisit(m) when the 11th character of m is replaced by 1. If it is, it prints the 11th character of m.
If the 12th character of m is not equal to the output of the function CheckDisit(m) when the 11th character of m is replaced by 1, it then checks if the 12th character of m is equal to the output of the function CheckDisit(m) when the 11th character of m is replaced by 2. If it is, it prints the 11th character of m.
If the 12th character of m is not equal to the output of the function CheckDisit(m) when the 11th character of m is replaced by 2, it then checks if the 12th character of m is equal to the output of the function CheckDisit(m) when the 11th character of m is replaced by 3. If it is, it prints the 11th character of m.
If the 12th character of m is not equal to the output of the function CheckDisit(m) when the 11th character of m is replaced by 3, it then checks if the 12th character of m is equal to the output of the function CheckDisit(m) when the 11th character of m is replaced by 4. If it is, it prints the 11th character of m.
If the 12th character of m is not equal to the output of the function CheckDisit(m) when the 11th character of m is replaced by 4, it then checks if the 12th character of m is equal to the output of the function CheckDisit(m) when the 11th character of m is replaced by 5. If it is, it prints the 11th character of m.
If the 12th character of m is not equal to the output of the function CheckDisit(m) when the 11th character of m is replaced by 5, it then checks if the 12th character of m is equal to the output of the function CheckDisit(m) when the 11th character of m is replaced by 6. If it is, it prints the 11th character of m.
If the 12th character of m is not equal to the output of the function
