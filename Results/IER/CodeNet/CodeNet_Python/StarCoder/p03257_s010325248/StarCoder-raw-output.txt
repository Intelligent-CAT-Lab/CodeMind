The variable N is initialized to 2.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 2.
The code checks if the current number i is divisible by any number in the list lis. If it is, it sets flag to False.
If flag is True, it appends the current number i to the list lis.
The code then increments now by 2, which is 3.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 2N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 3 to 4N.
The code checks if the current number now is divisible by any number in the list lis. If it is, it sets flag to False.
If flag is True, it appends the current number now to the list lis.
The code then increments now by 2, which is 5.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 2N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 5 to 6N.
The code checks if the current number now is divisible by any number in the list lis. If it is, it sets flag to False.
If flag is True, it appends the current number now to the list lis.
The code then increments now by 2, which is 7.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 2N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 7 to 8N.
The code checks if the current number now is divisible by any number in the list lis. If it is, it sets flag to False.
If flag is True, it appends the current number now to the list lis.
The code then increments now by 2, which is 9.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 2N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 9 to 10N.
The code checks if the current number now is divisible by any number in the list lis. If it is, it sets flag to False.
If flag is True, it appends the current number now to the list lis.
The code then increments now by 2, which is 11.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 2N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 11 to 12N.
The code checks if the current number now is divisible by any number in the list lis. If it is, it sets flag to False.
If flag is True, it appends the current number now to the list lis.
The code then increments now by 2, which is 13.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 2N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 13 to 14N.
The code checks if the current number now is divisible by any number in the list lis. If it is, it sets flag to False.
If flag is True, it appends the current number now to the list lis.
The code then increments now by 2, which is 15.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 2N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 15 to 16N.
The code checks if the current number now is divisible by any number in the list lis. If it is, it sets flag to False.
If flag is True, it appends the current
