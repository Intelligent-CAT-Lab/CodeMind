The variables sx, sy, tx and ty are initialized to 0, 0, 1 and 2, respectively.
The code calculates the width w and height h of the rectangle.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to h (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 2.
For each number i in this range, it adds the string "U" to the variable ans.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to w (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 1.
For each number i in this range, it adds the string "R" to the variable ans.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to h (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 2.
For each number i in this range, it adds the string "D" to the variable ans.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to w (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 1.
For each number i in this range, it adds the string "L" to the variable ans.
The code then adds the string "L" to the variable ans.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to h+1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 3.
For each number i in this range, it adds the string "U" to the variable ans.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to w+1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 2.
For each number i in this range, it adds the string "R" to the variable ans.
The code then adds the string "D" to the variable ans.
The code then adds the string "R" to the variable ans.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to h+1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 3.
For each number i in this range, it adds the string "D" to the variable ans.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to w+1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 2.
For each number i in this range, it adds the string "L" to the variable ans.
The code then adds the string "U" to the variable ans.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is "URDRULRDUL".
