rint the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable S is initialized to "3-2*3", which is the input.
The variable y is initialized to [0,0,0], which will be used to store the values of the variables A, B and C.
The variable ans is initialized to -1e64, which will be used to store the maximum value of the expression.
The function calc is defined to calculate the value of the expression.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 26, meaning it will consider all possible values of y.
The code then calculates the value of the expression for the current value of y and stores it in ans.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 12.
<<<Output>>>
12

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>

S = input()
y = [0,0,0]
ans = -1e64

def calc(s):
    #print(s)
    A = []
    i = 0
    cntr = 0
    s2 = ""
    for j,c in enumerate(s):
        if cntr > 0:
            if c == ')':
                cntr -= 1
                if cntr == 0:
                    A.append(calc(s2))
                    continue
            if c == '(':
                cntr += 1
            s2 = s2 + c
        else:
            if c.isdigit():
                i *= 10
                i += int(c)
            else:
                if c == '(':
                    cntr += 1
                    if cntr == 1:
                        s2 = ""
                    continue
                if s[j - 1]!= ')':
                    A.append
