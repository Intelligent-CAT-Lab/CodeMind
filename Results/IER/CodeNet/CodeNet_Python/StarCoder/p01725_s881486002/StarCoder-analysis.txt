rint the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable S is initialized to "3-2*3", which is the input.
The variable y is initialized to [0,0,0], which will be used to store the values of the variables A, B and C.
The variable ans is initialized to -1e64, which will be used to store the maximum value of the expression.
The function calc is defined to calculate the value of the expression.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 26, meaning it will consider all possible values of y.
The code then calculates the value of the expression for the current value of y and stores it in ans.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 12.
