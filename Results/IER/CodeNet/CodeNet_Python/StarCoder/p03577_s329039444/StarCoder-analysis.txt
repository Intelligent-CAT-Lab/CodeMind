The code first imports the sys module, which is used to modify the recursion limit.
The recursion limit is set to 10 ** 7, which is 10000000.
The code then defines the float infinity value f_inf to be 10 ** 300, which is 10 ** 300.
The code then defines the modulus mod to be 10 ** 9 + 7, which is 1000000007.
The code then reads the input s and prints the string s[:-8], which is CODEFEST.
