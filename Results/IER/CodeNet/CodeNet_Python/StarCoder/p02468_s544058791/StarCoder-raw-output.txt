Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable m, variable n are initialized to 2 and 3, respectively.
The code calculates the value of ans by taking the value of m raised to the power of n, modulo 10^9 + 7.
The code then prints the final value of ans, which is 8.
<<<Output>>>
8

for i in range(1, n + 1):
    ans += i

print(ans)
