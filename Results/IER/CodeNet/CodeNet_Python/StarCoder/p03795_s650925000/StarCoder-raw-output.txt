Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable n is initialized to 20.
The variable N is initialized to n//15, which is 20//15, which is 1.
The code then prints the final value of N, which is 1.
<<<Output>>>
1

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
n = int(input())
N = n//15
print(800*n-200*N)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```200
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
