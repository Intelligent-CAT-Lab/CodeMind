Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable a is initialized to 4, and variable b is initialized to 5.
The code checks if a is divisible by 3, b is divisible by 3, or the sum of a and b is divisible by 3.
Since none of these conditions are met, the code prints "Impossible".
