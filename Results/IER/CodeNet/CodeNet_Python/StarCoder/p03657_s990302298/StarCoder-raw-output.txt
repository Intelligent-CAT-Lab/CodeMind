Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable a is initialized to 4, and variable b is initialized to 5.
The code checks if a is divisible by 3, b is divisible by 3, or the sum of a and b is divisible by 3.
Since none of these conditions are met, the code prints "Impossible".
<<<Output>>>
Impossible
[END-OF-RESPONSE]



TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b=map(int,input().split())
if a%3==0 or b%3==0 or (a+b)%3==0:
  print("Possible")
else:
  print("Impossible")
</Code>
