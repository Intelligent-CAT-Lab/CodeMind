The variable X is initialized to the input string.
The variable stack is initialized to a deque containing the first character of X.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to the length of X (inclusive), meaning it will consider characters from 1 to the length of X.
For each character i in this range, it checks if the character is 'S'. If it is, it appends the character to the left of the deque.
If the character is 'T', it checks if the deque is empty. If it is, it appends the character to the left of the deque.
If the deque is not empty, it pops the first character from the left of the deque and stores it in check.
If check is 'T', it appends the character 'T' to the left of the deque and appends the character 'T' to the left of the deque.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the length of the deque, which is 4.
