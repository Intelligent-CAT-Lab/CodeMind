The variable N, variable X and variable D are initialized to 3, 4 and 2, respectively.
variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the answer.
The code checks if X == D == 0. If it is, it sets ans to 1 and ends the program.
The code checks if X == 0. If it is, it sets ans to N**2-N*(N+1)//2+1 and ends the program.
The code checks if D == 0. If it is, it sets ans to (N+1) and ends the program.
The code checks if D < 0. If it is, it sets X to -X and D to -D.
The code calculates the greatest common divisor of X and D and divides X and D by this value.
The code initializes a dictionary LR, which will be used to store the left and right boundaries of the intervals.
The code initializes a list of tuples LR[0] to store the left and right boundaries of the interval [0, 0].
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 3.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the left and right boundaries of the interval [Li, Ri] and stores them in LR[(i*X)%D].
The code sorts the list of tuples in LR[(i*X)%D] in ascending order of the left boundary.
The code initializes two variables lp and rp to store the left and right boundaries of the current interval.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to the number of tuples in LR[(i*X)%D] (exclusive), meaning it will consider all the tuples in LR[(i*X)%D].
For each tuple (l, r) in this range, it checks if rp < l. If it is, it adds the number of integers in the interval [rp, l] to ans, which is 1 in this case.
The code sets lp to l and rp to r.
After the loop finishes, the code adds the number of integers in the interval [rp, l] to ans, which is 1 in this case.
The code prints the final value of ans, which is
