The code first reads the input and stores it in variables h1, m1, h2, m2 and k.
The code then calculates the time r1 by multiplying h1 by 60 and adding m1.
The code then calculates the time r2 by multiplying h2 by 60 and adding m2.
The code then calculates the time difference between r2 and r1 and subtracts k.
The code then prints the final value of the time difference, which is 15.
