The variables c1, c5, c10, c50, c100 and c500 are initialized to 3, 1, 4, 0, 4 and 1, respectively.
The code calculates the sum of the variables and stores it in the variable sum.
The code checks if sum is greater than or equal to 1000. If it is, it prints 1. Otherwise, it prints 0.

for i in range(1,N+1):
    if i%3 == 0 or i%5 == 0:
        sum += i
print(sum)
</Code>
