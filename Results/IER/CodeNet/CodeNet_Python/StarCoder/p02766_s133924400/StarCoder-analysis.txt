Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable n is initialized to 11, and variable k is initialized to 2.
The variable res is initialized to 0.
The code enters a while loop that continues as long as n is greater than 0.
The code increments res by 1.
The code divides n by k.
The code exits the while loop when n is 0.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of res, which is 6.
