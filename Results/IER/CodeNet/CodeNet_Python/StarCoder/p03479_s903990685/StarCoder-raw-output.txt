rint the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable x is initialized to 3, and variable y is initialized to 20.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the number of times the loop is executed.
The code enters a while loop that executes as long as x is less than or equal to y.
Inside the loop, the code increments ans by 1.
The code then doubles x.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 6.
<<<Output>>>
6

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())

ans = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        ans += i

print(ans)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
