Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable x, variable y are initialized to 1 and 1, respectively.
variable result is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code checks if x is equal to 1, which is true. If it is, it adds 300000 to result.
The code checks if y is equal to 1, which is true. If it is, it adds 300000 to result.
The code checks if x is equal to 1 and y is equal to 1, which is true. If it is, it adds 400000 to result.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of result, which is 1000000.
<<<Output>>>
1000000
