Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable x is initialized to 2.
The variable j is initialized to 2.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to x (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 2.
For each number i in this range, it multiplies j by 2 and adds 2 to j.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of j, which is 10.
