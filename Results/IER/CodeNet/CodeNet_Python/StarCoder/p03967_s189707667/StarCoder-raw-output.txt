The variable s is initialized to 'gpg'.
The code then calculates the length of s, which is 4.
The code then calculates the number of occurrences of the letter 'p' in s, which is 1.
The code then subtracts the number of occurrences of 'p' from the length of s, which is 3.
The code prints the final value of the expression, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if sum_order % 3 == 0:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```100
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N is initialized to 100.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 100.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it
