Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The code reads the input from the standard input, which is the console.
The code then splits the input into two variables a and b.
The code then prints the sum of a and b, which is 13.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import sys
a,b=map(int,sys.stdin.readline().split())
print(a+b)

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 8
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
