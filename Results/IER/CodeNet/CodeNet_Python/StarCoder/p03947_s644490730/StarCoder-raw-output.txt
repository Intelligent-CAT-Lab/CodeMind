The variable s is initialized to 'BBBWW', which is the input.
The variable now is initialized to the first character of s, which is 'B'.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the number of characters that are different from the previous character.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to the length of s (inclusive), meaning it will consider characters from 1 to 5.
For each character i in this range, it checks if it is different from the previous character now. If it is, it adds 1 to ans and updates the value of now to i. The condition is met when i is 'W' and 'B'.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 3.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
s=raw_input()
now=s[0]
ans=0
for i in xrange(1,len(s)):
    if now!=s[i]:
        ans+=1
