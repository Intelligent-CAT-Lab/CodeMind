Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable s is initialized to the string ```+-++```.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the characters in the string s.
For each character i in this range, it checks if i is either + or -. If it is, it adds 1 to ans if i is +, and subtracts 1 from ans if i is -.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 0.
<<<Output>>>
0

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())

sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if sum_order % 3 == 0:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```100```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
