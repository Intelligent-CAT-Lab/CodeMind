The variable s is initialized to the string ```+-++```.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the characters in the string s.
For each character i in this range, it checks if i is either + or -. If it is, it adds 1 to ans if i is +, and subtracts 1 from ans if i is -.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 0.
