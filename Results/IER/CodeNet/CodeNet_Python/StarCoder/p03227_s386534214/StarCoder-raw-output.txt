Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable s is initialized to 'abc'.
The code checks if the length of s is 2. Since it is, it prints the string 'abc'.
The code checks if the length of s is 3. Since it is not, it does not print anything.
<<<Output>>>
abc

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
s = input()
if len(s) == 2:
    print(s)
if len(s) == 3:
    print(s[2] + s[1] + s[0])
if len(s) == 4:
    print(s[3] + s[2] + s[1] + s[0])
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```abcd
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
