The variable s is initialized to 010.
The variable n is initialized to the length of s, which is 4.
The variable ans is initialized to n, which is 4.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n-1, meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 3.
For each number i in this range, it checks if the previous digit is equal to the current digit. If it is, it skips the current iteration and moves on to the next iteration.
If the previous digit is not equal to the current digit, it calculates the maximum of i and n-i and stores it in ans.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 2.
