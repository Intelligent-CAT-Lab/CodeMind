int the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N is initialized to 3.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 3.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the prime factorization of i and stores it in tmp_list.
The code then calculates the number of prime factors of each prime p in the prime factorization of i and stores it in prime_list.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of prime_list, which is [1, 1, 2].
