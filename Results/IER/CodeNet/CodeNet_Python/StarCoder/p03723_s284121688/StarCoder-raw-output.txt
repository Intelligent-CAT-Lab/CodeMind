The variables a, b and c are initialized to 4, 12 and 20, respectively.
The variable d is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the number of steps the loop takes.
The code enters a while loop that checks if a, b and c are all even. If they are, it adds 1 to d and divides a, b and c by 2.
The code then checks if a, b and c are equal to each other. If they are, it prints -1 and breaks out of the loop.
