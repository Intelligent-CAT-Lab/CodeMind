Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable n is initialized to 5.
The variable a is initialized to [2,1], which will be used to store the values of the sequence.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 4.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of the last two numbers in the sequence and stores it in a.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of a, which is 13.
<<<Output>>>
13

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
n=int(input())
a=[2,1]
for i in range(n-1):
    a.append(a[len(a)-2]+a[len(a)-1])
print(a[len(a)-1])
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
