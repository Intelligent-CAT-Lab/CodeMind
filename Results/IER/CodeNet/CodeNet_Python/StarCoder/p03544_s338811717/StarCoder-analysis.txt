The variable n is initialized to 5.
The variable a is initialized to [2,1], which will be used to store the values of the sequence.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 4.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of the last two numbers in the sequence and stores it in a.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of a, which is 13.
