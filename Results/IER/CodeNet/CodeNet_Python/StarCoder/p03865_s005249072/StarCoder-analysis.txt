The variable s is initialized to 'aba'.
The variable n is initialized to the length of s, which is 3.
The code checks if s[0] is equal to s[n-1]. Since s[0] is 'a' and s[n-1] is 'a', the condition is met.
The variable move is initialized to 1.
The code then calculates the remainder of (n - move) % 2. Since n is 3 and move is 1, the remainder is 1.
The code then checks if move is equal to 1. Since move is 1, the condition is met.
The code prints 'First'.
