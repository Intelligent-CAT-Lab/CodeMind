Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The code first reads the input and stores it in the variable n.
The code then checks if n is divisible by 9. If it is, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import sys
import math
input = sys.stdin.readline
ins = lambda: input().rstrip()
ini = lambda: int(input().rstrip())
inm = lambda: map(int, input().split())
inl = lambda: list(map(int, input().split()))
out = lambda x: print('\n'.join(map(str, x)))

n = ini()
a = inl()
b = inl()
c = inl()

for i in range(n):
    if a[i] == b[i] == c[i]:
        print(a[i])
        break
else:
    print("No")
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5
1 2 3 4 5
1 2 3 4 5
1 2 3 4 5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The code first reads the input and stores it in the variable n.
The code then reads the input and stores it in the variables a, b and c.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider
