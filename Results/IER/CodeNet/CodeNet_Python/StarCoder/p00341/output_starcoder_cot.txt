Instruction: I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
For example:

Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
20 2 5
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
Consider the following code:

a=[0]*100
b=list(map(int,input().split()))
for i in range(12):
    a[b[i]-1]+=1
c=0
for i in range(100):
    if a[i] and a[i]%4==0: c+=a[i]//4
print('yes' if c==3 else 'no')
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
1 1 3 4 8 9 7 3 4 5 5 5

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The code first initializes a list a with 100 elements, all of which are initialized to 0.
The code then reads the input and stores it in a list b.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 11, meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 11.
For each number i in this range, it increments the element of a at index b[i]-1 by 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 99, meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 99.
For each number i in this range, it checks if the element of a at index i is non-zero and divisible by 4. If it is, it increments c by 1.
The code then prints the final value of c, which is 3.

The output of code execution is:
yes
