The variable s is initialized to 'abac'.
The code counts the number of occurrences of 'a', 'b' and 'c' in s.
The code checks if the absolute difference between the number of occurrences of 'a' and 'b' is less than or equal to 1, and the absolute difference between the number of occurrences of 'b' and 'c' is less than or equal to 1, and the absolute difference between the number of occurrences of 'c' and 'a' is less than or equal to 1.
If all of these conditions are met, the code prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'.
