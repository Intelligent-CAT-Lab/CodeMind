The variable S is initialized to 010.
The variable K is initialized to the length of S, which is 4.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to len(S)-1, meaning it will consider all indices of S.
For each index i in this range, it checks if S[i] is equal to S[i+1]. If it is not, it calculates the length of the longest substring that starts at index i and ends at index len(S)-1. This substring is either S[i] or S[i+1].
The code then updates K to be the minimum of the current value of K and the length of the longest substring.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of K, which is 2.
