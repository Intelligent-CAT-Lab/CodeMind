The variable a is initialized to 3.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to a (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 2.
For each number i in this range, it appends the string 'ACL' to the list w.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of w, which is ['ACL','ACL','ACL'].
