Instruction: I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
For example:

Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
20 2 5
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
Consider the following code:

s = str(input())
n = len(s)
rc = 0
lc = 0
p = 0
state = 1 #1がR、0がL
ans = [0] * n
for i in range(n):
  #print(ans, rc, lc, p)
  if state:
    if s[i] == "R":
      rc += 1
      if s[i+1] == "L":
        ans[i] += (rc+1)//2
        ans[i+1] += rc//2
        state = 0
        p = i
        rc = 0
  else:
    if s[i] == "L":
      lc += 1
      if i == n-1 or s[i+1] == "R":
        ans[p+1] += (lc+1)//2
        ans[p] += lc//2
        state = 1
        lc = 0
print(" ".join(map(str,ans)))
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
RRLRL

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The code reads the string s and stores it in a list of characters.
The code then calculates the length of the string s and stores it in the variable n.
The code initializes the variables rc and lc to 0.
The code initializes the variable p to 0.
The code initializes the variable state to 1, which means that the robot is facing right.
The code initializes the list ans to a list of n zeros.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n-1 (inclusive).
In each iteration, the code checks the value of state.
If state is 1, the code checks if the current character is "R".
If it is, it increments rc by 1.
If the current character is "L" and the next character is "R", the code increments ans[i] by (rc+1)//2 and ans[i+1] by rc//2.
The code then sets state to 0 and p to i.
The code then sets rc to 0.
If state is 0, the code checks if the current character is "L".
If it is, it increments lc by 1.
If the current character is "R" and the next character is "L", the code increments ans[p+1] by (lc+1)//2 and ans[p] by lc//2.
The code then sets state to 1 and lc to 0.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the list ans.

The output of code execution is:
0 1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 5 5 6 6 7 7 8 8 9 9 10 10 11 11 12 12 13 13 1
