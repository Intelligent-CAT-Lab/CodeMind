Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variables a, b and c are initialized to 10, 30 and 20, respectively.
The code checks if a is equal to b + c, which is not the case.
The code checks if a + b is equal to c, which is not the case.
The code checks if a + c is equal to b, which is not the case.
The code prints 'No' as the final output.
<<<Output>>>
No

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
a, b, c = map(int, input().split())

if a == b + c:
    print('Yes')
elif a + b == c:
    print('Yes')
elif a + c == b:
    print('Yes')
else:
    print('No')
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10 20 30
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
