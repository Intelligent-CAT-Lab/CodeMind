Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The code first reads the input and stores it in the variable s.
The code checks if s is equal to "RRR". If it is, it prints 3.
If s does not equal "RRR", it checks if "RR" is a substring of s. If it is, it prints 2.
If s does not equal "RRR" and "RR" is not a substring of s, it checks if "R" is a substring of s. If it is, it prints 1.
If s does not equal "RRR", "RR" is not a substring of s and "R" is not a substring of s, it prints 0.
