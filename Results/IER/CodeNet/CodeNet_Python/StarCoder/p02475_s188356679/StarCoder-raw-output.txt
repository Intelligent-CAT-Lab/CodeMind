Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable a and variable b are initialized to 5 and 8, respectively.
The code checks if a*b is greater than or equal to 0.
If it is, it prints the result of a//b, which is 0.
If it is not, it prints the result of -(-a//b), which is -1.
<<<Output>>>
0
[END-OF-RESPONSE]



TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b=map(int,input().split() )
if a*b>=0:
    print(a//b)
else:
    print(-(-a//b))

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```-5 8
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
