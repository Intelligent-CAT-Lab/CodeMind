The variables A, B, C, D, E and F are initialized to 1, 2, 10, 20, 15 and 200, respectively.
The code initializes a list a with the first element [str(100*A),'0'].
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 100, meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 100.
For each number i in this range, it enters another loop that iterates from 0 to 100, meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 100.
For each number j in this range, it enters another loop that iterates from 0 to 100, meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 100.
For each number k in this range, it enters another loop that iterates from 0 to 100, meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 100.
For each number l in this range, it calculates the sum of the products of the variables A, B, i, j, k and l.
The code checks if the sum is greater than F or if the sum is equal to 0. If it is, it breaks out of the innermost loop.
The code then checks if the ratio of y to x+y is less than or equal to the ratio of E to 100+E. If it is, it appends the pair [str(x+y),str(y)] to the list a.
After the loop finishes, the code sorts the list a based on the ratio of y to x+y.
The code then prints the last element of the list a, which is [str(1000),str(100)].
