The variables A, B, C, D, E and F are initialized to 1, 2, 10, 20, 15 and 200, respectively.
The code initializes a list a with the first element [str(100*A),'0'].
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 100, meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 100.
For each number i in this range, it enters another loop that iterates from 0 to 100, meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 100.
For each number j in this range, it enters another loop that iterates from 0 to 100, meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 100.
For each number k in this range, it enters another loop that iterates from 0 to 100, meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 100.
For each number l in this range, it calculates the sum of the products of the variables A, B, i, j, k and l.
The code checks if the sum is greater than F or if the sum is equal to 0. If it is, it breaks out of the innermost loop.
The code then checks if the ratio of y to x+y is less than or equal to the ratio of E to 100+E. If it is, it appends the pair [str(x+y),str(y)] to the list a.
After the loop finishes, the code sorts the list a based on the ratio of y to x+y.
The code then prints the last element of the list a, which is [str(1000),str(100)].

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, M = map(int, input().split())
a = []
for i in range(1,N+1):
    for j in range(1,M+1):
        a.append(str(i)+str(j))
print(' '.join(sorted(a, key=lambda x: (int(x[0])+int(x[1]))%2)))

<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 3
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variables N and M are initialized to 3 and 3, respectively.
The code initializes a list a.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 3.
For each number i in this range, it enters another loop that iterates from 1 to M (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 3.
For each number j in this range, it appends the string str(i)+str(j) to the list a.
After the loop finishes, the code sorts the list a based on the sum of the digits of the numbers i and j.
The code then prints the list a, which is ['11', '12', '13', '21', '22', '23', '31', '32', '33'].
