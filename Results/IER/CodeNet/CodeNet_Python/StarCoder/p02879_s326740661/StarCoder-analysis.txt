Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable a is initialized to 2, and variable b is initialized to 5.
The code checks if a and b are within the range [1, 9], which is [1, 9] in this case. If they are, it prints the product of a and b. The condition is met when a is 2 and b is 5.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 10.
