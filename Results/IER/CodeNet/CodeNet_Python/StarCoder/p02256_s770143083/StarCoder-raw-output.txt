The variable a and variable b are initialized to 54 and 20, respectively.
The function gcd is defined to take two integers as input and return their greatest common divisor.
The function gcd is called with the input variables a and b.
The function gcd calculates the greatest common divisor of a and b.
The function gcd returns the greatest common divisor of a and b, which is 6.
The code prints the final value of the greatest common divisor of a and b, which is 6.
<<<Output>>>
6

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
a, b = map(int, input().split())

def gcd(a,b):
    if b>a:
        a, b = b, a
    
    while b>0:
        mod = a%b
        a = b
        b = mod
    
    return a

print(gcd(a,b))

def lcm(a,b):
    return a*b//gcd(a,b)

print(lcm(a,b))

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```54 20
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
