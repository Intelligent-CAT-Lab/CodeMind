Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable s is initialized to "RUDLUDR", which is the input.
The variable flag is initialized to True, which will be used to check if the input is valid.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the characters in s.
For each character j, it checks if the current index i is even or odd.
If i is even, it checks if j is either "L", "U" or "D".
If i is odd, it checks if j is either "R", "U" or "D".
If any of these conditions is not met, the flag is set to False.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if the flag is True. If it is, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".
