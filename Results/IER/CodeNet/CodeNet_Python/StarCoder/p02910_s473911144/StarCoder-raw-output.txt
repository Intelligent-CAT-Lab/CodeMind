The variable s is initialized to "RUDLUDR", which is the input.
The variable flag is initialized to True, which will be used to check if the input is valid.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the characters in s.
For each character j, it checks if the current index i is even or odd.
If i is even, it checks if j is either "L", "U" or "D".
If i is odd, it checks if j is either "R", "U" or "D".
If any of these conditions is not met, the flag is set to False.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if the flag is True. If it is, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
Yes

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if sum_order % 3 == 0:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```100
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
