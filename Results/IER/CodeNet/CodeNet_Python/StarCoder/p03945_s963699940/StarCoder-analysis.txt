rint the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable s is initialized to 'BBBWW', which is the input.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the characters in s.
For each character, it checks if the current character is equal to the previous character.
If it is, the code adds 1 to the sum.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of the sum, which is 3.
