The function solve is called with the arguments sx=0, sy=0, tx=1 and ty=2.
The function first calculates the first string, which is "U"*(ty-sy)+"R"*(tx-sx).
The function then calculates the second string, which is "D"*(ty-sy)+"L"*(tx-sx).
The function then calculates the third string, which is "L"+"U"*(ty-sy+1)+"R"*(tx-sx+1)+"D".
The function then calculates the forth string, which is "R"+"D"*(ty-sy+1)+"L"*(tx-sx+1)+"U".
The function then prints the concatenation of the four strings, which is "UR"+"DL"+"RU"+"LD".
