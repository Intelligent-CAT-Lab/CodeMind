Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The code first reads the input and stores it in the variable n.
The code then calls the function factorial with the argument n.
The function factorial first checks if n is equal to 1. If it is, it returns 1.
If n is not equal to 1, the function factorial calls itself recursively with the argument n-1.
The function factorial returns the product of n and the result of the recursive call.
The code then prints the result of the recursive call, which is 120.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def factorial(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)
n=input()
print(factorial(int(n)))
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
