Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The code first reads the input and stores it in the variable n.
The code then calls the function factorial with the argument n.
The function factorial first checks if n is equal to 1. If it is, it returns 1.
If n is not equal to 1, the function factorial calls itself recursively with the argument n-1.
The function factorial returns the product of n and the result of the recursive call.
The code then prints the result of the recursive call, which is 120.
