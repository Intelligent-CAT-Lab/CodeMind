Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N, variable C are initialized to 0 and 5, respectively.
The code checks if C is equal to 100. If it is, it prints 100 to the power of N, multiplied by 101.
Otherwise, it prints 100 to the power of N, multiplied by C.
The code prints 100 to the power of 0, multiplied by 5, which is 100.
<<<Output>>>
100

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())

if N % 2 == 0:
  print(N)

else:
  print(N * 2)

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N is initialized to 10.
The code checks if N is even. If it is, it prints N.
Otherwise, it prints N multiplied by 2.
The code prints 10.
