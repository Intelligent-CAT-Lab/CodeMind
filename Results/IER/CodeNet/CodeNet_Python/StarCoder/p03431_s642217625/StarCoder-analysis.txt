Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The code first reads the input and initializes the variables N and K to 2 and 4, respectively.
The code then checks if K is less than N. If it is, the code returns 0.
Otherwise, the code initializes the variable ans to 0.
The code then initializes the variable com to the result of the function combs_mod(K,K,mod).
The function combs_mod(n,k,mod) calculates the number of combinations of k elements from a set of n elements.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to K (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 4.
For each number r in this range, it calculates the variable b to be K-r.
The code then calculates the variable dif to be r-b.
The code then checks if dif is less than 0 or r is less than N. If it is, the code skips the current iteration.
Otherwise, the code checks if dif is equal to 0. If it is, the code initializes the variable com2 to the result of the function combs_mod(K-1,K-1,mod).
The function combs_mod(n,k,mod) calculates the number of combinations of k elements from a set of n elements.
The code then adds the value of com2[r] to ans.
The code then checks if N is greater than or equal to 2. If it is, the code subtracts the value of com2[N-2] from ans.
Otherwise, the code adds the value of com[r] to ans.
The code then modulos ans by mod.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 1.
