Instruction: I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
For example:

Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
20 2 5
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
Consider the following code:

import sys
import math
import heapq
sys.setrecursionlimit(10**7)
INTMAX = 9223372036854775807
INTMIN = -9223372036854775808
DVSR = 1000000007
def POW(x, y): return pow(x, y, DVSR)
def INV(x, m=DVSR): return pow(x, m - 2, m)
def DIV(x, y, m=DVSR): return (x * INV(y, m)) % m
def LI(): return [int(x) for x in input().split()]
def LF(): return [float(x) for x in input().split()]
def LS(): return input().split()
def II(): return int(input())
def FLIST(n):
    res = [1]
    for i in range(1, n+1): res.append(res[i-1]*i%DVSR)
    return res
def gcd(x, y):
    if x < y: x, y = y, x
    div = x % y
    while div!= 0:
        x, y = y, div
        div = x % y
    return y

K,X=LI()

for i in range(max(X-K+1, -1000000), min(X+K, 1000000)):
    print(i, end=" ")
print("")

What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
3 7

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The code first initializes the variables K and X to 3 and 7, respectively.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from max(X-K+1, -1000000) to min(X+K, 1000000), which is from -1000000 to 1000000.
For each number i in this range, it prints i.
The output of code execution is:
-999997 -999996 -999995 -999994 -999993 -999992 -999991 -999990 -999989 -999988 -999987 -999986 -999985 -999984 -999983 -999982 -999981 -999980 -999979 -999978 -999977 -999976 -999975 -999974 -999973 -999972 -999971 -999970 -999969 -999968 -999967 -999966 -999965 -999964 -999963 -999962 -999961 -999960 -999959 -999958 -999957 -999956
