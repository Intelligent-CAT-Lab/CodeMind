Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable s is initialized to "aba".
The variable n is initialized to the length of s, which is 3.
The code checks if s[0] is equal to s[-1]. Since s[0] is "a" and s[-1] is "a", the condition is met.
The code then adds 1 to n, which is 4.
The code checks if n is even. Since n is 4, it is not even.
The code prints "Second".
<<<Output>>>
Second

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())
for i in range(1,N+1):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        print(i, end = " ")
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N is initialized to 10.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 10.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is even. Since i is 2,4,6,8 and 10, the condition is met.
The code prints i, which is 2,4,6,8 and 10.
<<<Output>>>
2 4 6 8 10
