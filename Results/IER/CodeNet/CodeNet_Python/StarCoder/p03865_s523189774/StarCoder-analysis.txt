Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable s is initialized to "aba".
The variable n is initialized to the length of s, which is 3.
The code checks if s[0] is equal to s[-1]. Since s[0] is "a" and s[-1] is "a", the condition is met.
The code then adds 1 to n, which is 4.
The code checks if n is even. Since n is 4, it is not even.
The code prints "Second".
