The variable C is initialized to 'a', which is the first character of the input.
The function alpha2num is defined to convert a character to its corresponding number.
The function num2alpha is defined to convert a number to its corresponding character.
The code then calculates the value of a by calling alpha2num(C).
The code checks if a is equal to 26. If it is, it sets a to 0.
The code then calculates the value of b by calling num2alpha(a + 1).
The code prints the final value of b, which is 'B'.
