Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variables a, b and c are initialized to 1, 1 and 10, respectively.
The variable cnt is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of even numbers.
The code checks if a is even. Since it is, it adds 1 to cnt.
The code checks if b is even. Since it is, it adds 1 to cnt.
The code checks if c is even. Since it is not, it does not add 1 to cnt.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if cnt is greater than or equal to 2. Since it is, it prints 'Tem'. Otherwise, it prints 'Hom'.
