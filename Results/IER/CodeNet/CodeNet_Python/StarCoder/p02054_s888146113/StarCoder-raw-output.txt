Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variables a, b and c are initialized to 1, 1 and 10, respectively.
The variable cnt is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of even numbers.
The code checks if a is even. Since it is, it adds 1 to cnt.
The code checks if b is even. Since it is, it adds 1 to cnt.
The code checks if c is even. Since it is not, it does not add 1 to cnt.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if cnt is greater than or equal to 2. Since it is, it prints 'Tem'. Otherwise, it prints 'Hom'.
<<<Output>>>
Hom

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())

for i in range(1,N+1):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        print(i)

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N is initialized to 10.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 10.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is even. Since it is, it prints i.
After the loop finishes, no output is printed.
