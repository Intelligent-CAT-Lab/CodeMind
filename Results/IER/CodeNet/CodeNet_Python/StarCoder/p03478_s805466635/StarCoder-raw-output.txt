The function SumOfDigits is defined to calculate the sum of digits of a number.
The variable n, variable a and variable b are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in add.
The code checks if add is within the range [a, b], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum, which is 84.

84

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def SumOfDigits(n): #各桁の和を計算する関数
    sum = 0
    while n > 0:
        sum += (n % 10)
        n //= 10
    return sum

n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
sum = 0

for i in range(n+1):
    add = 0
    add = SumOfDigits(i)
    if a <= add and add <= b:
        sum += i

print(sum)
</Code>
