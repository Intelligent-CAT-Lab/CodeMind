Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variables a,b,c,d,e,f are initialized to 3, 1, 4, 0, 4 and 1, respectively.
The code then prints 1 if the sum of the products of the variables is greater than or equal to 1000, and 0 otherwise.
<<<Output>>>
1

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b,c,d,e,f = map(int, input().split())
print(1 if a+5*b+10*c+50*d+100*e+500*f>=1000 else 0)

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 1 4 0 4 1
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
