Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N is initialized to 5, and variable K is initialized to 2.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 5.
For each number b in this range, it calculates the maximum number of times b can be used to divide N.
The code then calculates the maximum number of times b can be used to divide N, if K is 0, and if K is not 0.
The code adds the two values to sum.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum, which is 10.
