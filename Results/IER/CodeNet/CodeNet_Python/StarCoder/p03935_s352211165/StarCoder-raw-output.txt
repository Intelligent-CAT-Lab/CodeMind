The code first defines a function f that takes a single argument n.
The function f defines two lists e and z, which are initialized to [1,0,0,1] and [1,1,1,0], respectively.
The code then enters a while loop that continues until n is 0.
Inside the loop, the code checks if n is odd. If it is, it calls the function g on the lists e and z.
The function g takes two arguments, a and b.
The function g returns a list that is the result of the matrix multiplication of a and b.
The code then divides n by 2 and repeats the loop.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the value of e[1], which is 1.
The code then defines two more lists I and r, which are initialized to [1,1] and 1, respectively.
The code then enters a for loop that iterates from 2 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 2 to 4.
Inside the loop, the code calculates the value of I[i] and appends it to the list I.
The code then enters another for loop that iterates from 0 to n-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 3.
Inside the loop, the code calculates the value of r and adds it to the value of c.
The code then multiplies c by (m+i)*I[i+1] and divides it by M.
The code then multiplies c by (M-f(2*n-2-2*i)) and divides it by M.
The code then adds the value of r and the value of c and divides it by M.
The code then prints the final value of r, which is 1.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def f(n):
	e=[1,0,0,1];z=[1,1,1,0]
	while n:
		if n%2>0:e=g(e,z)
		z=g(z,z);n//=2
	return e[1]
M=998244353;g=lambda a,b:[(a[0]*b[0]+a[1]*b[2])%M,(a[0]*b[1]+a[1]*b[3])%M,(a[2]*b[0]+a[3]*b[2])%M,(a[2]*b[1]+a[3]*b[3])%M];n,m=map(int,input().split());I=[1,1];r=f(m+2*n-2);c=1
for i in range(2,n):I+=[(M-M//i)*I[M%i]%M]
for i in range(n-1):r=(r+c*(M-f(2*n-2-2*i)))%M;c=c*(m+i)*I[i+1]%M
print(r)
