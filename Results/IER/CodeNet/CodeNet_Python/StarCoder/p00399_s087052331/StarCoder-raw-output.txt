Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The code first reads the input and splits it into a list of strings.
The code then converts each string to an integer and sums the integers in the list.
The code prints the final value of the sum, which is 7.
<<<Output>>>
7

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N is initialized to 10.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of even numbers.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 10.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is even. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,4,6,8 and 10.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 20.
<<<Output>>>
20
