Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable n is initialized to 2, and variable m is initialized to 2.
The code checks if the absolute value of n - m is greater than 1. If it is, it prints 0 and ends.
Otherwise, it checks if (n + m) is even. If it is, it calculates the answer as the product of factorials of n and m, and then modulos it by 10^9 + 7.
Otherwise, it calculates the answer as the product of factorials of n and m, and then prints it.
