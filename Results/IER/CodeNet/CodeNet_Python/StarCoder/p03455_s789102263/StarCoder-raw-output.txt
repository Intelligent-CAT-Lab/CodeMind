Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable a is initialized to 3, and variable b is initialized to 4.
The code checks if a*b is even or odd.
If a*b is even, the code prints 'Even'.
If a*b is odd, the code prints 'Odd'.
<<<Output>>>
Odd

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())
for i in range(1,N+1):
    if i%2==0:
        print(i, end=' ')
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N is initialized to 10.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 10.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is even or odd.
If i is even, the code prints i and a space.
If i is odd, the code does not print anything.
After the loop finishes, the code prints nothing.
<<<Output>>>
2 4 6 8 10
