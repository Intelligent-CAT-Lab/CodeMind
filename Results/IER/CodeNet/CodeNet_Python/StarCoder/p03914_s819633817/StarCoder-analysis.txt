rint the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable n, variable m are initialized to 3, 3, respectively.
The variable MOD is initialized to 10**9+7.
The variable dp is initialized to a 2-dimensional array of size n+1 by n, where n is the value of variable n.
The first row of dp is initialized to 1, and the rest of the rows are initialized to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to m-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 2.
For each iteration, the code creates a new 2-dimensional array of size n+1 by n, where n is the value of variable n.
The code then enters a nested loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 3.
For each number j in this range, it enters a nested loop that iterates from 0 to n-j (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 2.
For each number k in this range, it calculates the value of the current cell of dp, which is dp[j][k].
If k is not equal to n-j, it adds the product of the current cell of dp and the number of ways to choose k numbers from n-j to n-j+1 to the cell dp[j][k+1].
It also adds the product of the current cell of dp and the number of ways to choose k numbers from 0 to n-j to the cell dp[j][k].
It also adds the product of the current cell of dp and the number of ways to choose j numbers from 0 to k to the cell dp[j+k][0].
After the nested loop finishes, the code copies the values of the cells of the new array to the dp array.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the value of the cell dp[n][0], which is 1.
