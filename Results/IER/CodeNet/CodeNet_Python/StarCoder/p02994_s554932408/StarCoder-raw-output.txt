Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N, variable L are initialized to 5 and 2, respectively.
The variable A is initialized to an empty list.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 5.
For each number i in this range, it appends L+i-1 to A.
The code checks if L < 0 and 0 is not in A. If it is, it removes the last element of A.
The code checks if 0 is in A. If it is, it prints the sum of A.
The code checks if L >= 0. If it is, it removes the first element of A.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of A, which is [3, 4, 5, 6, 7].

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, M = map(int, input().split())
A = []

for i in range(1,N+1):
  A.append(i)

for i in range(1,M+1):
  A.append(i)

A.sort()
print(A[N-1])
