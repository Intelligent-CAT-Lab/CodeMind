The function run() is called.
The function takes the input and splits it into two variables, n and k.
The function checks if n is greater than k. If it is, the function prints 0 and returns.
The function initializes a list table_1 with a single element, 1.
The function initializes a variable temp to 1.
The function enters a loop that iterates from 1 to k (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to k.
For each number nn in this range, it multiplies temp by nn and stores the result in temp.
The function appends temp to table_1.
The function initializes a list table_2 with the same number of elements as table_1.
The function enters a loop that iterates from 1 to k (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to k.
For each number nn in this range, it calculates the value of nn to the power of p-2 (mod p), where p is 10**9 + 7 and stores the result in temp.
The function enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to n.
For each number nn in this range, it calculates the value of nn to the power of p-2 (mod p), where p is 10**9 + 7 and stores the result in temp.
The function enters a loop that iterates from 1 to k-n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to k-n.
For each number nn in this range, it calculates the value of nn to the power of p-2 (mod p), where p is 10**9 + 7 and stores the result in temp.
The function prints the final value of a, which is 1000000001.
The function prints the final value of b, which is 1000000001.
The function prints the final value of c, which is 0.
The function prints the final value of a * b * c, which is 0.
