The variable s is initialized to 1905.
The code then extracts the first two digits of s and converts them to integers a and b.
The code checks if a and b are within the range [1, 12] and [1, 12], respectively.
If they are, it prints "AMBIGUOUS".
If a is within the range [1, 12] but b is not, it prints "MMYY".
If a is not within the range [1, 12] but b is, it prints "YYMM".
If a and b are not within the range [1, 12], it prints "NA".
