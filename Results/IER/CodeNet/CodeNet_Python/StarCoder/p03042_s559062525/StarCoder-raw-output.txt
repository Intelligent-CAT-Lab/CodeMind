Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable s is initialized to 1905.
The code then extracts the first two digits of s and converts them to integers a and b.
The code checks if a and b are within the range [1, 12] and [1, 12], respectively.
If they are, it prints "AMBIGUOUS".
If a is within the range [1, 12] but b is not, it prints "MMYY".
If a is not within the range [1, 12] but b is, it prints "YYMM".
If a and b are not within the range [1, 12], it prints "NA".
<<<Output>>>
AMBIGUOUS

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())
for i in range(1,N+1):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        print(i, end = " ")
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N is initialized to 10.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 10.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is even. If it is, it prints i.
<<<Output>>>
2 4 6 8 10
