The variable N, variable X and variable M are initialized to 6, 2 and 1001, respectively.
The code calculates the value of H, which is 3.
The variable nxt is initialized to a list of lists of length H, where each list is of length M.
The variable dp is initialized to a list of lists of length H, where each list is of length M.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to H-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider values from 0 to 2.
For each value i in this range, it enters a loop that iterates from 0 to M-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider values from 0 to 999.
For each value r in this range, it calculates the value of r mod M after 2 ** i squaring and stores it in nxt[i][r].
It then calculates the sum of sequence of lenght 2 ** i starting from r and stores it in dp[i][r].
After the loop finishes, the code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to H-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider values from 0 to 2.
For each value i in this range, it checks if N & (1 << i) is true. If it is, it adds the value of dp[i][r] to ans.
It then calculates the value of r mod M after 2 ** i squaring and stores it in r.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 1000.
<<<Output>>>
1000
