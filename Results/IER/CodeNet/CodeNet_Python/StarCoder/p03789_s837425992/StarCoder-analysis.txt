Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The code reads the input and stores it in a list N.
The code then multiplies each element of N by 9 and appends 0 to the end of N.
The code then iterates from 0 to 9, and for each iteration, it divides the i-th element of N by 10 and stores the remainder in the i-th element of N and the quotient in the i+1-th element of N.
The code then iterates from 10 to the length of N, and for each iteration, it adds 1 to the i-th element of N if the i-th element of N is 10.
The code then calculates the sum of the first 10 elements of N and stores it in low.
The code then calculates the sum of the first 10 elements of N and stores it in high1.
The code then calculates the sum of the first 10 elements of N and stores it in high2.
