Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variables a, b, c and x are initialized to 4, 7, 9 and 3, respectively.
The code checks if the absolute difference between a and c is less than or equal to x.
The absolute difference between a and c is 5, which is greater than x, so the code prints "No".
The code then checks if the absolute difference between a and b is less than or equal to x.
The absolute difference between a and b is 3, which is less than or equal to x, so the code checks if the absolute difference between b and c is less than or equal to x.
The absolute difference between b and c is 2, which is greater than x, so the code prints "No".
The code then prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
