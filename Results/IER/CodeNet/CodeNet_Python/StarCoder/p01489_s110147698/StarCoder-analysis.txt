Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable K is initialized to 5.
The code calculates the value of k0, which is (1 + 4*K)**.5 - 1) // 2.
The code checks if k0**2 + k0 == K. If it is, it decrements k0 by 1.
The code calculates the value of kk, which is k0**2+k0.
The code calculates the value of m0, which is 2*k0.
The code calculates the value of b, which is K - kk - 1.
The code checks if k0//2+1 > b. If it is, it calculates the value of v, which is fibonacci(2+2*b, MOD) * fibonacci(m0+2-2*b, MOD) % MOD.
If it is not, it calculates the value of b1, which is k0+1 - b-1.
The code calculates the value of v, which is fibonacci(3+2*b1, MOD) * fibonacci(m0+1-2*b1, MOD) % MOD.
After the calculations, the code prints the final value of v, which is 10.
