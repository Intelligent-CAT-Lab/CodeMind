Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable n, variable k are initialized to 1, 1, respectively.
variable l, variable r are initialized to 0, 2, respectively.
The code enters a loop that iterates until r-l is greater than 1.
The code calculates m as the average of l and r, which is 1.
The code calculates res as m.
The code calculates t as m.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n-1, meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 0.
The code calculates t as t // 2, which is 0.
The code calculates res as res + t, which is 1.
The code checks if t is equal to 0. If it is, the loop breaks.
The code checks if res is greater than k. If it is, the code sets r to m. If it is not, the code sets l to m.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of l, which is 1.
