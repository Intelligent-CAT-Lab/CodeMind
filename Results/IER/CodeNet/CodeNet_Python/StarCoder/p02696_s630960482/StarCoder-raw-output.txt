Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable A, variable B and variable N are initialized to 5, 7 and 4, respectively.
The code checks if N is greater than or equal to B.
If it is, then the code calculates x as B - 1, which is 6.
The code then calculates ans as ((A * x) // B) - (A * (x // B)), which is 1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 1.
<<<Output>>>
1

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())

if N % 2 == 0:
    print("even")
else:
    print("odd")
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The variable N is initialized to 10.
The code checks if N is even.
If it is, then the code prints "even".
If it is not, then the code prints "odd".
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is "odd".
<<<Output>>>
odd
