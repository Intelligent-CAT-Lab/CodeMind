Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable A, variable B and variable N are initialized to 5, 7 and 4, respectively.
The code checks if N is greater than or equal to B.
If it is, then the code calculates x as B - 1, which is 6.
The code then calculates ans as ((A * x) // B) - (A * (x // B)), which is 1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 1.
