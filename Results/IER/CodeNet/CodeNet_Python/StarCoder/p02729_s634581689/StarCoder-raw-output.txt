int the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable a and variable b are initialized to 2 and 1, respectively.
variable cnt is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the number of combinations meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to a (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 2.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the number of combinations of 2 elements and stores it in cnt.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to b (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 1.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the number of combinations of 2 elements and stores it in cnt.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of cnt, which is 1.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
a, b = map(int, input().split())
cnt = 0

# 偶数
#if a!= 0:
#    if a % 2!= 0:
#        a = a - 1

# 奇数
