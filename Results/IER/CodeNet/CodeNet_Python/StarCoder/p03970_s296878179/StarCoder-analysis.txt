rint the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable S is initialized to the list of characters in the input, which is ['C', '0', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'E', 'S', 'T', 'I', 'V', 'A', 'L', '2', 'O', '1', '6'].
The variable C is initialized to the list of characters in the string "CODEFESTIVAL2016", which is ['C', 'O', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'E', 'S', 'T', 'I', 'V', 'A', 'L', '2', '0', '1', '6'].
The variable cnt is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of mismatches between S and C.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to the length of C (exclusive), meaning it will consider characters from 0 to 17.
For each character i in this range, it checks if S[i] is equal to C[i]. If it is not, it adds 1 to cnt.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of cnt, which is 2.
