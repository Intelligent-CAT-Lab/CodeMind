The variable n, variable m are initialized to 4 and 1, respectively.
The code checks if n is odd. If it is, it sets l to 1 and r to n-1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to m-1, meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 0.
For each iteration, it prints the values of l and r.
The code then updates l and r.
If n is odd, the code will print the following:
```
1 3
2 2
3 1
```
If n is even, the code will print the following:
```
1 3
2 2
3 1
```
