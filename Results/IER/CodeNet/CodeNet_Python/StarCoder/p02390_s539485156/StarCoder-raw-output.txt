Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable s is initialized to 46979.
The code divides s by 3600, which is 11.
The code divides s by 60, which is 79.
The code takes the remainder of s divided by 60, which is 19.
The code prints the values of s divided by 3600, s divided by 60 and s divided by 60, separated by a colon.
<<<Output>>>

<Code>
N = int(input())
for i in range(1,N+1):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        print(i)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N is initialized to 10.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 10.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is even. If it is, it prints the current number i.
The code prints the numbers 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10.
<<<Output>>>
2
4
6
