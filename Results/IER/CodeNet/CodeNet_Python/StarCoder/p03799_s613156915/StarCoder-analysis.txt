The variable n is initialized to 1, and variable m is initialized to 6.
The code checks if 2*n is less than or equal to m. Since 2*n is 2, and m is 6, the condition is met.
The code then adds n to cnt, which is 1.
The code then subtracts 2*n from m, which is 4.
The code then checks if m is greater than or equal to 4. Since m is 4, the condition is met.
The code then adds m//4 to cnt, which is 1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of cnt, which is 2.
