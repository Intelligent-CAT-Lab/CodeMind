The variable n is initialized to 1, and variable m is initialized to 6.
The code checks if 2*n is less than or equal to m. Since 2*n is 2, and m is 6, the condition is met.
The code then adds n to cnt, which is 1.
The code then subtracts 2*n from m, which is 4.
The code then checks if m is greater than or equal to 4. Since m is 4, the condition is met.
The code then adds m//4 to cnt, which is 1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of cnt, which is 2.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import sys


def input(): return sys.stdin.readline().strip()


def resolve():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    cnt = 0
    if 2*n <= m:
        cnt += n
        m -= n * 2
        cnt += m // 4
    else:
        cnt += m // 2
    print(cnt)
resolve()
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
