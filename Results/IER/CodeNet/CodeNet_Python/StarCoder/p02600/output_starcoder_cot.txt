Instruction: I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
For example:

Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
20 2 5
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
Consider the following code:

X = int(input())

if X >= 400 and X <= 599:
  print(8)
elif X >= 600 and X <= 799:
  print(7)
elif X >= 800 and X <= 999:
  print(6)
elif X >= 1000 and X <= 1199:
  print(5)
elif X >= 1200 and X <= 1399:
  print(4)
elif X >= 1400 and X <= 1599:
  print(3)
elif X >= 1600 and X <= 1799:
  print(2)
elif X >= 1800 and X <= 1999:
  print(1)

What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
725

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable X is initialized to 725.
The code checks if X is within the range [400, 599], which is [400, 599] in this case. If it is, it prints 8.
The code checks if X is within the range [600, 799], which is [600, 799] in this case. If it is, it prints 7.
The code checks if X is within the range [800, 999], which is [800, 999] in this case. If it is, it prints 6.
The code checks if X is within the range [1000, 1199], which is [1000, 1199] in this case. If it is, it prints 5.
The code checks if X is within the range [1200, 1399], which is [1200, 1399] in this case. If it is, it prints 4.
The code checks if X is within the range [1400, 1599], which is [1400, 1599] in this case. If it is, it prints 3.
The code checks if X is within the range [1600, 1799], which is [1600, 1799] in this case. If it is, it prints 2.
The code checks if X is within the range [1800, 1999], which is [1800, 1999] in this case. If it is, it prints 1.
The output of code execution is:
