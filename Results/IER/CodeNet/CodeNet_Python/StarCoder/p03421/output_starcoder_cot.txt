Instruction: I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
For example:

Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
20 2 5
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
Consider the following code:

n, a, b = [int(item) for item in input().split()]
if n < a + (b-1) or n > a + (b-1) * a:
    print(-1)
    exit()
for i in range(a):
    print(n - a + i + 1, end=" ")
n -= a
if n == 0:
    print("")
    exit()
loop = n // (b-1)
option = n % (b-1)
for j in range(b-1):
    if option > 0:
        for i in range(loop+1):
            print(n - loop - 1 + i + 1, end=" ")
        n -= loop + 1
        option -= 1
    else:
        for i in range(loop):
            print(n - loop + i + 1, end=" ")
        n -= loop
print("")
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
5 3 2

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable n is initialized to 5, variable a is initialized to 3, and variable b is initialized to 2.
The code checks if n is within the range [a + (b-1), a + (b-1) * a]. In this case, n is 5, a is 3, and b is 2. The condition is met when n is 8, which is not within the range.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 2 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 2.
For each number i in this range, it prints the number n - a + i + 1, which is 2, 3, and 4.
The code then subtracts a from n, which is 2.
The code then checks if n is equal to 0. Since it is not, it enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 1.
For each number j in this range, it prints the number n - loop - 1 + i + 1, which is 1, 2, and 3.
The code then subtracts loop + 1 from n, which is 0.
The code then subtracts 1 from option, which is 1.
The code then prints a newline.
The output of code execution is:
2 3 4
