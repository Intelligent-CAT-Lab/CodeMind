The variable N, variable A, variable B and variable C are initialized to 1, 25, 25 and 50, respectively.
The code then initializes the MOD variable to 10 ** 9 + 7.
The code then initializes the com variable to an object of the Comb class, which is initialized with the value 2 * N and the MOD value.
The code then initializes the inv variable to an object of the Inv class, which is initialized with the MOD value.
The code then initializes the IL variable to the result of the inv.invL(A + B, 2 * N) method, which is the inverse of the list [1, 2, 6, 24, 120, 720, 5040, 40320, 362880, 3628800, 39916800, 479001600, 6227020800, 87178291200, 1307674368000, 20922789888000, 355687428096000, 6402373705728000, 121645100408832000, 2432902008176640000, 51090942171709440000, 1124000727777607680000, 25852016738884976640000, 620448401733239439360000, 15511210043330985984000000, 403291461126605635584
