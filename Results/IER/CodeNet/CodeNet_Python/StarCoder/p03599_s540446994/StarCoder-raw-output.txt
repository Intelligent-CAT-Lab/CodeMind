Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variables a, b, c, d, e, f are initialized to 1, 2, 10, 20, 15 and 200, respectively.
The variables A and B are initialized to 100 and 200, respectively.
The variables x and y are initialized to 100 and 0, respectively.
The variable dens is initialized to 0, which will be used to store the maximum density.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to f // A (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 200.
For each number i in this range, it enters another loop that iterates from 0 to ((f - A * i) // B) (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 100.
For each number j in this range, it calculates the amount of water and sugar needed to make the drink.
The code checks if the density of sugar is greater than the maximum density, and if it is, it updates the maximum density and the amount of water and sugar needed to make the drink.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final values of x and y, which are 200 and 200.
<<<Output>>>
200 200

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
# ABC074C - Sugar Water
# input
a, b, c, d, e, f = list(map(int, input().rstrip().split()))
A = a * 100
B = b * 100

# default values
x, y = min(a,
