The code subtracts the input from 48, which is 21.
<<<Output>>>
21

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if sum_order % 3 == 0:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The variable N is initialized to 20.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is divisible by 3, which is not the case for 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met
