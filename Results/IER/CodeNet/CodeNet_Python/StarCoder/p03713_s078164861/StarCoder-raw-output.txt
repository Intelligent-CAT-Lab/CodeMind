Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable H, variable W are initialized to 3 and 5, respectively.
The variable ans is initialized to INF, which is a very large number.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to H (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 3.
For each number h in this range, it calculates the sum of the following four numbers:
S1 = h*W
S2 = (H-h)*(W//2)
S3 = H*W-S1-S2
S4 = (H-h)//2*W
The code then checks if the maximum of these four numbers minus the minimum of these four numbers is smaller than ans. If it is, it updates ans to the maximum of these four numbers minus the minimum of these four numbers.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 1.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())

ans = 0

for i in range(1, N+1):
	if i % 3 == 0 or i % 5 == 0:
		ans += i

print(ans)
