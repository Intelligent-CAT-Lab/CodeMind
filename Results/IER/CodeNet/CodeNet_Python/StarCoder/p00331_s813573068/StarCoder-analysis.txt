Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable h is initialized to -3, and variable r is initialized to 3.
The code checks if h + r is equal to 0. If it is, it prints 0 and ends.
If h + r is greater than 0, it prints 1 and ends.
If h + r is less than 0, it prints -1 and ends.
