Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable h is initialized to -3, and variable r is initialized to 3.
The code checks if h + r is equal to 0. If it is, it prints 0 and ends.
If h + r is greater than 0, it prints 1 and ends.
If h + r is less than 0, it prints -1 and ends.
<<<Output>>>
-1

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())

if N % 2 == 0:
    print("even")
else:
    print("odd")

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
