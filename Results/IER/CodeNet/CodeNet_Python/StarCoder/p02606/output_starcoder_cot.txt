Instruction: I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
For example:

Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
20 2 5
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
Consider the following code:

L, R, d = map(int, input().split())
ans = 0
for i in range(L, R+1):
  if i%d == 0:
    ans += 1
print(ans)
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
5 10 2

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable L, variable R and variable d are initialized to 5, 10 and 2, respectively.
variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the number of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from L to R (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 5 to 10.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is divisible by d, which is 2 in this case. If it is, it adds 1 to ans. The condition is met when i is 6 and 10.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 2.

The output of code execution is:
2
