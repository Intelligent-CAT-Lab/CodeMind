The variable s is initialized to 'hihi'.
The variable cnt is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of times the letter 'h' appears in the string.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to the length of the string s (inclusive), meaning it will consider all indices of the string.
For each index i in this range, it checks if i is even or odd. If i is even, it checks if the letter at index i is 'h'. If it is, it adds 1 to cnt.
If i is odd, it checks if the letter at index i is 'i'. If it is, it adds 1 to cnt.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if the length of the string s is even and if cnt is equal to the length of the string s. If both conditions are met, it prints 'Yes'. Otherwise, it prints 'No'.
