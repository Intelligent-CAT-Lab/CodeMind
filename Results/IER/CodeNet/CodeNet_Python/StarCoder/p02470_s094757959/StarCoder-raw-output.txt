The variable n is initialized to 6.
The variable m is initialized to 6.
The variable i is initialized to 2.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 2 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 2 to 6.
For each number i in this range, it checks if n is divisible by i. If it is, it divides m by i and multiplies the result by (i-1).
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to n.
For each number j in this range, it checks if n is divisible by j. If it is, it divides m by j and multiplies the result by (j-1).
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of m, which is 1.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
n=int(input())
i=1
while i*i<=n:
    if n%i==0:
        print(i)
        if i*i!=n: print(n//i)
    i+=1
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```12```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
