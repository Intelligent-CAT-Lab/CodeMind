Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The code first reads the input and splits it into a list of integers.
Then it creates a list of odd numbers from the input.
The code then checks if the length of this list is greater than or equal to 2.
If it is, it prints "Hom", otherwise it prints "Tem".
The code prints "Hom" because the length of the list of odd numbers is 2.
<<<Output>>>
Hom

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())
for i in range(1,N+1):
    if i % 2 == 1:
        print(i)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The code first reads the input and stores it in variable N.
Then it enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 10.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is odd. If it is, it prints i.
The code prints 1,3,5,7,9.
<<<Output>>>
1
3
5
7
9
