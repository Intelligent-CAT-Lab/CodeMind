Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The code first reads the input and splits it into a list of integers.
Then it creates a list of odd numbers from the input.
The code then checks if the length of this list is greater than or equal to 2.
If it is, it prints "Hom", otherwise it prints "Tem".
The code prints "Hom" because the length of the list of odd numbers is 2.
