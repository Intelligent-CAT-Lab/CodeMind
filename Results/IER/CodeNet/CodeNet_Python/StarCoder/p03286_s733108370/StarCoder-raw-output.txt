The variable N is initialized to -9.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to -9.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is even or odd.
If i is even, it appends 0 to the list s.
If i is odd, it appends 1 to the list s.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of s, which is [1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0].

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N=int(input())
s=[]
if N==0:
    print(0)
else:
    while N!=1:
        if N%2==0:
            s.append(0)
            N=-N//2
        else:
            s.append(1)
            N=(1-N)//2
    s.append(1)
    print(*reversed(s),sep='')

<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```-10
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
