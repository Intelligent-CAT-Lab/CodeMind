The function gcd is defined to calculate the greatest common divisor of two numbers.
The variables H, W and T are initialized to 2, 2 and 1, respectively.
The code then calculates the greatest common divisor of H and T, which is 1.
The code then calculates the greatest common divisor of W and T, which is 1.
The code then calculates the greatest common divisor of h and w, which is 1.
The code then calculates the value of 2^h mod MOD, which is 2.
The code then calculates the value of 2^w mod MOD, which is 2.
The code then calculates the value of 2^gcd(h, w) mod MOD, which is 2.
The code then calculates the value of (2^h + 2^w + 2^gcd(h, w) - 3) mod MOD, which is 1.
The code then calculates the value of (2^h + 2^w + 2^gcd(h, w) - 3)^(gh * gw) mod MOD, which is 1.
The code then prints the final value of the expression, which is 1.
