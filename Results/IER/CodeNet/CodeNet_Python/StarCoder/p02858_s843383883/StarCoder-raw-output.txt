The function gcd is defined to calculate the greatest common divisor of two numbers.
The variables H, W and T are initialized to 2, 2 and 1, respectively.
The code then calculates the greatest common divisor of H and T, which is 1.
The code then calculates the greatest common divisor of W and T, which is 1.
The code then calculates the greatest common divisor of h and w, which is 1.
The code then calculates the value of 2^h mod MOD, which is 2.
The code then calculates the value of 2^w mod MOD, which is 2.
The code then calculates the value of 2^gcd(h, w) mod MOD, which is 2.
The code then calculates the value of (2^h + 2^w + 2^gcd(h, w) - 3) mod MOD, which is 1.
The code then calculates the value of (2^h + 2^w + 2^gcd(h, w) - 3)^(gh * gw) mod MOD, which is 1.
The code then prints the final value of the expression, which is 1.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def gcd(x, y):
	if y == 0:
		return x
	return gcd(y, x % y)
H,W,T=map(int, input().split())
gh, gw = gcd(H, T), gcd(W, T)
h, w = H // gh, W // gw
MOD = 1000000007
print(pow(pow(2, h, MOD) + pow(2, w, MOD) + pow(2, gcd(h, w), MOD) - 3, gh * gw, MOD))
</Code>
