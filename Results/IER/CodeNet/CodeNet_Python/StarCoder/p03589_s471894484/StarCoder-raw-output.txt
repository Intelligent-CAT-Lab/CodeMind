The variable N is initialized to 2.
The function ok is defined to check if the given h, n and w can form a cuboid with the given volume N.
The function kiyaku is defined to check if the given number is divisible by the other number.
The function solve is defined to find the smallest cuboid that can be formed with the given volume N.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from N//4+1 to 3*N//4+1, meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 1000.
For each number i in this range, it enters another loop that iterates from 3*N//4+1 to 3501, meaning it will consider numbers from 1001 to 4000.
For each number j in this range, it checks if the following conditions are met:
4*i*j-N*(i+j)>0
kiyaku(4*i*j-N*(i+j),N*i*j)
If the conditions are met, it returns the tuple (i,j,N*i*j//(4*i*j-N*(i+j))).
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of the tuple, which is (1, 1001, 1001).
<<<Output>>>
1 1001 1001

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N=int(input())
def ok(h,n,w,N):
    if 4*h*n*w==N*(n*w+n*h+h*w):
        return 1
    else
