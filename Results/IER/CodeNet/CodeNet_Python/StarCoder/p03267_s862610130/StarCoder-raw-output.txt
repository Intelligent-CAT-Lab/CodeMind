The variable l is initialized to 4.
The function solve(l) is called with l as the argument.
The function initializes variable n to 0.
The code enters a while loop that iterates while 2**n <= l, which is true for l = 4.
The code increments n by 1, which makes n = 1.
The code enters a for loop that iterates from n-1 to 0 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 1.
The code initializes variable x to 2**i, which is 2**0 = 1.
The code checks if i is not equal to n-1, which is true for i = 0.
If it is not, the code appends the tuple (i, i+1, 0) to the list E.
If it is, the code appends the tuple (i, i+1, x) to the list E.
The code checks if l - x >= 2**(n-1), which is true for l = 4 and n = 1.
If it is, the code appends the tuple (i, n-1, l-x) to the list E.
The code decrements l by x, which makes l = 0.
The code exits the for loop.
The code exits the while loop.
The code prints the values of n and the length of list E.
The code enters a for loop that iterates over the list E.
The code prints the values of u, v and x.
The code exits the for loop.
