Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable X is initialized to 3, and variable Y is initialized to 20.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 10**18 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 10**18.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the product of X and 2**i and stores it in product.
The code checks if product is greater than Y. If it is, it prints the current value of i and breaks the loop.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of i, which is 18.
