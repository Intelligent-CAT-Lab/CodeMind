Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable s is initialized to the string "575".
The code checks if s is equal to its reverse, which is "575" in this case.
Since it is, the code prints "Yes".

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
s = str(input())
if s == s[::-1]:
  print("Yes")
else:
  print("No")
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5756
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
