The variable s is initialized to "atcoder".
The code checks if the length of s is 26. If it is not, it prints the string s followed by the smallest character that is not in s. In this case, the smallest character is "a".
If the length of s is 26, the code enters a loop that iterates from 2 to 26 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 2 to 26.
For each number i in this range, it checks if the last i characters of s are in ascending order. If they are, the code exits the loop and prints the answer.
If the loop finishes without breaking, it means that the last i characters of s are not in ascending order. The code then checks if i is 26. If it is, it prints -1 and exits.
If i is not 26, the code sorts the last i characters of s in ascending order and stores the result in s_.
The code then enters another loop that iterates from 0 to i-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to i-1.
For each number j in this range, it checks if j is greater than the last character of s. If it is, the code exits the loop and prints the answer.
If the loop finishes without breaking, it means that the last i characters of s are not in ascending order. The code then prints the answer.
