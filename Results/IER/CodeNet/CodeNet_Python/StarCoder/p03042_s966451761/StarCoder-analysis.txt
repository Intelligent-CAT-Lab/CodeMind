Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The code first reads the input and stores it in variable s.
The code then extracts the first two digits of s and stores them in variable f.
The code then extracts the last two digits of s and stores them in variable l.
The code then checks if f and l are valid dates.
If f and l are valid dates, the code checks if f is greater than l.
If f is greater than l, the code prints 'YYMM'.
If f is less than l, the code prints 'MMYY'.
If f and l are not valid dates, the code prints 'NA'.
