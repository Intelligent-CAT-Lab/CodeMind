The variable s is initialized to "xabxa".
The variable i is initialized to 0.
The variable j is initialized to 5.
The variable ans is initialized to 0.
The code enters a while loop that iterates while i is less than j.
Inside the loop, the code enters a while loop that iterates while s[i] is equal to s[j].
Inside the loop, the code enters a while loop that iterates while s[i] is equal to "x".
Inside the loop, the code increments i by 1.
Inside the loop, the code decrements j by 1.
Inside the loop, the code checks if i is greater than j. If it is, the code breaks out of the loop.
