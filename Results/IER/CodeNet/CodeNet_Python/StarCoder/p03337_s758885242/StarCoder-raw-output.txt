Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable a and variable b are initialized to 3 and 1, respectively.
The code then prints the maximum of the following expressions: a+b, a-b and a*b.
The maximum of these expressions is 4, which is printed as the output.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
a, b = map(int, input().split())
print(a+b)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 1
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable a and variable b are initialized to 3 and 1, respectively.
The code then prints the sum of a and b, which is 4.
