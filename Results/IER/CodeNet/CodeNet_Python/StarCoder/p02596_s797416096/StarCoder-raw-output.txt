The variable K is initialized to 101.
The code checks if K is divisible by 7. If it is, it calculates L as 9K/7. If it is not, it calculates L as 9K.
The variable ans is initialized to -1.
The variable n is initialized to 10.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to L (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 999.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the surplus of n mod L.
If surplus is 1, it sets ans to i and breaks the loop.
Otherwise, it sets n to 10 * surplus.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 100.
<<<Output>>>
100

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())

ans = 0
for i in range(1, N+1):
    if i % 3 == 0 or i % 5 == 0:
        ans += i
print(ans)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```100
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
