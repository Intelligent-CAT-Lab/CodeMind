Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable K is initialized to 101.
The code checks if K is divisible by 7. If it is, it calculates L as 9K/7. If it is not, it calculates L as 9K.
The variable ans is initialized to -1.
The variable n is initialized to 10.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to L (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 999.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the surplus of n mod L.
If surplus is 1, it sets ans to i and breaks the loop.
Otherwise, it sets n to 10 * surplus.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 100.
