Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The code first reads the input and stores it in a list a.
The code then sorts the list a in ascending order.
The code then prints the first two elements of the list a, which are 600 and 700.
<<<Output>>>
1300
[END-OF-RESPONSE]



TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import sys
input = sys.stdin.readline

a=list(map(int,input().split()))
a.sort()
print(a[0]*a[1])

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```700 600 780
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
