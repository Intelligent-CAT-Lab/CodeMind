Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable n is initialized to 615.
The code calculates the quotient of n divided by 100 and the remainder of n divided by 100.
The code then checks if the quotient is greater than or equal to the remainder.
The quotient is 6 and the remainder is 15.
The code prints the final value of the expression, which is 1.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
n=int(input());print(+(n//100*5>=n%100))
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```614
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
