Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable X, variable A are initialized to 3 and 5, respectively.
The code checks if X is less than A, which is true in this case.
The code then prints 0.
<<<Output>>>
0

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
def main():
    X,A = map(int,input().split())
    if X < A:
        print('0')
    else:
        print('10')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 3
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
