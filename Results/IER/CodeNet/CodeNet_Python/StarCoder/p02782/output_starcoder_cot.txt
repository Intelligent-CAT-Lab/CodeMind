Instruction: I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
For example:

Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
20 2 5
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
Consider the following code:

mod = 10**9+7
rng = 2000100
fctr = [1]+[0]*(rng-1)
for i in range(1,rng):
  fctr[i] = fctr[i-1]*i%mod
def finv(x):
  return pow(fctr[x],mod-2,mod)
def cmb(n,k):
  if n<0 or k<0:
    return 0
  else:
    return fctr[n]*finv(n-k)*finv(k)%mod

x1,y1,x2,y2 = map(int,input().split())
print((cmb(x2+y2+2,x2+1)-cmb(x2+y1+1,y1)-cmb(x1+y2+1,x1)+cmb(x1+y1,x1))%mod)
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
1 1 2 2

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The code first initializes the variable mod to 1000000007, which is the modulo.
The code then initializes the variable rng to 2000100, which is the range of the factorial.
The code then initializes the variable fctr to [1,0,0,...,0].
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to rng (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 2000100.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the product of all numbers from 1 to i (inclusive) and stores it in fctr[i].
The code then defines a function finv that calculates the inverse of a number x.
The code then defines a function cmb that calculates the combination of two numbers n and k.
The code then initializes the variables x1, y1, x2, y2 to 1, 1, 2, 2, respectively.
The code then prints the final value of the expression (cmb(x2+y2+2,x2+1)-cmb(x2+y1+1,y1)-cmb(x1+y2+1,x1)+cmb(x1+y1,x1))%mod, which is 1.

The output of code execution is:
1
