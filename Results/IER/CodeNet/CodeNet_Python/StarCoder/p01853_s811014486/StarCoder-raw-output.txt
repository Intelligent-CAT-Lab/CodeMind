Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable n, variable m and variable p are initialized to 3, 100 and 2, respectively.
The code then prints the list [0, 0, 0, 100].
<<<Output>>>
0 0 0 100

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
n=int(input());print(n//2+1)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable n is initialized to 3.
The code then prints the value of n//2+1, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
