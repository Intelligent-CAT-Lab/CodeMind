The variable a is initialized to 15.
The variable list1 is initialized to a deque containing the numbers 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.
The variable i is initialized to 1.
The code enters a while loop that iterates while i is less than or equal to a.
Inside the loop, the code pops the first element of list1 and stores it in k.
The code then checks if the last digit of k is 0 or 9.
If it is 0, the code appends k with 0 and 1, and increments i by 1.
If it is 9, the code appends k with 8 and 9, and increments i by 1.
If it is neither 0 nor 9, the code appends k with k-1, k, and k+1, and increments i by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the first element of list1, which is 1.
