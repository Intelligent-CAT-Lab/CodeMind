Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The code first reads the input and stores it in variables a, b and c.
The code then prints the minimum of the sum of a and b, the sum of b and c and the sum of c and a.
The minimum of these three numbers is 1300, which is the answer.
<<<Output>>>
1300
[END-OF-RESPONSE]



TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
a, b, c = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
print(max(a+b, b+c, c+a))
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```700 600 780
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
