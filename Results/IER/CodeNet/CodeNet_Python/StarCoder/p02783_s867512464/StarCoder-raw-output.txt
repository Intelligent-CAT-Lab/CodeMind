The variable h is initialized to 10, and variable a is initialized to 4.
The code checks if h is divisible by a. If it is, it calculates the quotient of h and a and stores it in ans.
If h is not divisible by a, it calculates the quotient of h and a and adds 1 to it, and stores it in ans.
After the code finishes, it prints the final value of ans, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
