The variable n is initialized to 2.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 3500 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 3500.
For each number i in this range, it enters another loop that iterates from i to 3500 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from i to 3500.
For each number j in this range, it calculates the value of the expression 4*i*j-n*(i+j).
If this value is positive and the remainder of the division n*i*j/(4*i*j-n*(i+j)) is 0, then the code breaks out of the inner loop and continues with the next value of i.
If the value of the expression is not positive or the remainder is not 0, then the code breaks out of the outer loop and continues with the next value of j.
After the outer loop finishes, the code breaks out of the inner loop and continues with the next value of j.
After the inner loop finishes, the code breaks out of the outer loop and continues with the next value of i.
After the outer loop finishes, the code prints the values of i, j and k, which are 13, 14 and 15.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
n=int(input())
for i in range(1,n+1):
  for j in range(1,n+1):
    if i%j==0:
      print(j,end=" ")
  print()
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The variable n is initialized to 10.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 10.
