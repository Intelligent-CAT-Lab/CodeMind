The variable stack is initialized to an empty list.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the input, which is 1 2 +.
The code checks if the current operation is one of the four basic operations: +, -, *, /, and if it is, it pops two numbers from the stack and evaluates the expression.
The code then appends the result of the evaluation to the stack.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of the stack, which is 3.
