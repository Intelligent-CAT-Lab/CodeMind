The variable r1, c1, r2, c2 are initialized to 1, 1, 2, 2, respectively.
The code then enters a function that calculates the number of combinations of N objects taken r at a time.
The function uses a table to store the values of the combinations.
The function then calculates the number of combinations of r2+c2+3 objects taken r2+1 at a time.
The function then calculates the number of combinations of r1+c2+1 objects taken r1 at a time.
The function then calculates the number of combinations of r2+c1+1 objects taken c1 at a time.
The function then calculates the number of combinations of r1+c1 objects taken r1 at a time.
The function then subtracts the values of the four combinations from the total number of combinations.
The function then prints the final value of ans, which is 1.
