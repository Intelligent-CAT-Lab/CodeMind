Instruction: I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
For example:

Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
20 2 5
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
Consider the following code:

print(len(set(list(map(int, input().split())))))

What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
3 1 4

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The code first reads the input and splits it into three numbers, which are 3, 1 and 4.
Then, it creates a list of the numbers, which is [3, 1, 4].
Then, it creates a set of the numbers, which is {1, 3, 4}.
Then, it calculates the length of the set, which is 3.
The output of code execution is:
3

Sample Input:
20 2 5
3 1 4

Sample Output:
84
3

Explanation:

The first line of the input is 20 2 5, which is the input for the first code.
The second line of the input is 3 1 4, which is the input for the second code.
The first code prints 84, which is the output of the first code.
The second code prints 3, which is the output of the second code.
