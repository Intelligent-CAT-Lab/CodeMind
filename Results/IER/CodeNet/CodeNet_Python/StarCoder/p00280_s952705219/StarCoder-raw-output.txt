The variable dic is initialized to an empty dictionary.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to 9 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 2 to 9.
For each number s in this range, it enters another loop that iterates from min(5, s + 1) to s (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from min(5, s + 1) to s.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the value of j = s - i.
The code checks if j is within the range [5, s + 1] or [s - 1, -1], which is [5, 6, 7, 8, 9] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
