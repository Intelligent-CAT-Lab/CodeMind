Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The code enters a loop that iterates until the input is 0.
The input is 3, which is the number of cities.
The code then reads 3 lines of input, which are the names of the cities.
The code then creates a list ts, which contains the names of the cities that are not anagrams of any other city.
The code then creates a list ov, which contains the overlaps between the cities.
The code then creates a list memo, which is used to memoize the results of the recursive function rec.
The code then creates a function rec, which is a recursive function that calculates the maximum overlap of a city with the other cities.
The code then creates a function overlap, which calculates the overlap between two cities.
The code then calculates the maximum overlap of a city with the other cities.
The code then prints the final value of maxov, which is 1.
