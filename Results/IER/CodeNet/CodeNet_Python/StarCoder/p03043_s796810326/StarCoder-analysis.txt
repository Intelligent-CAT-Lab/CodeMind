The variable n and variable k are initialized to 3 and 10, respectively.
variable score is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of the probabilities of the dice.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 3.
For each number dice in this range, it calculates the number of times the dice can be rolled to get a sum of k.
The code then calculates the probability of rolling the dice and adds it to score.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of score, which is 0.5.
