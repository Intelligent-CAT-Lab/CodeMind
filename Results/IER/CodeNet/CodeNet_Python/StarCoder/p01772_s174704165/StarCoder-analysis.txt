The variable S is initialized to the string "AIZUNYANPEROPERO".
The variable A is initialized to False.
The variable c is initialized to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the characters in S.
For each character s in S, it checks if s is equal to "A". If it is, it sets A to True.
If s is equal to "Z" and A is True, it increments c by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if c is greater than 0. If it is, it prints the string "AZ" repeated c times. Otherwise, it prints -1.
