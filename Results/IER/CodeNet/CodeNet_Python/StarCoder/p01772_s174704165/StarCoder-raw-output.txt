The variable S is initialized to the string "AIZUNYANPEROPERO".
The variable A is initialized to False.
The variable c is initialized to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the characters in S.
For each character s in S, it checks if s is equal to "A". If it is, it sets A to True.
If s is equal to "Z" and A is True, it increments c by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if c is greater than 0. If it is, it prints the string "AZ" repeated c times. Otherwise, it prints -1.
<<<Output>>>
AZAZAZ

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(raw_input())
for i in range(1,N+1):
    if i%2 == 0:
        print i,
    else:
        print -i,
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The variable N is initialized to 10.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 10.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is even. If it is, it prints i. Otherwise, it prints -i.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of N, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
1 3 5 7 9 -11 -13 -15 -17 -19
