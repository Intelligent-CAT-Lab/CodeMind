The code first imports the string module.
The function toggle_case takes a single character as input and returns the character that is 26 positions to the right of the input character in the alphabet.
The code then reads a string from the user and stores it in the variable s.
The code then uses the map function to apply the function toggle_case to each character in the string s. The map function takes a function and a sequence as input and returns a sequence of the same length as the input sequence, where each element is the result of applying the function to the corresponding element of the input sequence.
The code then prints the final string, which is fair, later, occasionally cloudy.
<<<Output>>>
fair, later, occasionally cloudy.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def is_prime(n):
    if n == 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

n = int(input())
if is_prime(n):
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')
</Code>
