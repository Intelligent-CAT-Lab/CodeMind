The variable w, variable h and variable c are initialized to 10, 20 and 5, respectively.
The code calculates the area of the rectangle using the formula: area = width * height / gcd(width, height)**2 * color.
The code then prints the final value of the area, which is 100.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())
for i in range(1,N+1):
    if i%2 == 0:
        print(i, end=' ')
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The variable N is initialized to 10.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 10.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is even. If it is, it prints i and a space. The condition is met when i is 2,4,6,8 and 10.
After the loop finishes, the code prints nothing.
