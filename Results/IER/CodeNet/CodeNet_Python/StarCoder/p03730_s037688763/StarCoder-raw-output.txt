Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized to 7, 5 and 1, respectively.
The code checks if any of the following conditions is met:
a * 1 % b == c
a * 2 % b == c
a * 3 % b == c
a * 4 % b == c
a * 5 % b == c
The condition is met when a * 1 % b == c, which is true.
The code prints "YES" and ends the response.
<<<Output>>>
YES
[END-OF-RESPONSE]



TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
print("YES" if all((a * i) % b == c for i in range(1, b+1)) else "NO")
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```7 5 1
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
