Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized to 7, 5 and 1, respectively.
The code checks if any of the following conditions is met:
a * 1 % b == c
a * 2 % b == c
a * 3 % b == c
a * 4 % b == c
a * 5 % b == c
The condition is met when a * 1 % b == c, which is true.
The code prints "YES" and ends the response.
