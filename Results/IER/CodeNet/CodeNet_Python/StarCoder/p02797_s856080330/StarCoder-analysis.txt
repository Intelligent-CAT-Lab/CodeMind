Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N, variable K and variable S are initialized to 4, 2 and 3, respectively.
The code then checks if S is equal to 10**9. If it is, it initializes the list ans with S repeated K times and 1 repeated (N-K) times. Otherwise, it initializes the list ans with S repeated K times and 10**9 repeated (N-K) times.
After the code finishes, it prints the list ans.
