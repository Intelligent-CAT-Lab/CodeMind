Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N, variable K and variable S are initialized to 4, 2 and 3, respectively.
The code then checks if S is equal to 10**9. If it is, it initializes the list ans with S repeated K times and 1 repeated (N-K) times. Otherwise, it initializes the list ans with S repeated K times and 10**9 repeated (N-K) times.
After the code finishes, it prints the list ans.

# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

import array
from bisect import *
from collections import *
import fractions
import heapq
from itertools import *
import math

N, K = map(int, input().split())

if N % K == 0:
    print(0)
else:
    print(1)

</Code>
