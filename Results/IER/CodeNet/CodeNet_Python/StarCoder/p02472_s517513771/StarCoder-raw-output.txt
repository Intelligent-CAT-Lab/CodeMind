Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The code first reads the input and splits it into two variables a and b.
The code then converts the string variables a and b to integers and stores them in a and b, respectively.
The code then prints the sum of a and b, which is 13.
<<<Output>>>
