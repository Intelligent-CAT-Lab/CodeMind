The variable n is initialized to 3.
The code checks if n is equal to 3. If it is, it prints 22,3,5 and exits the program.
The code checks if n is equal to 4. If it is, it prints 2,3,4,9 and exits the program.
The code checks if n is equal to 5. If it is, it prints 2,3,4,6,9 and exits the program.
The code checks if n is not equal to 3, 4 or 5. If it is, it calculates the value of a and b.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to a (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to a-1.
For each number i in this range, it appends the numbers 6i+2, 6i+3, 6i+4 and 6i+6 to the list ans.
The code checks if a is even. If it is, it checks if b is equal to 1. If it is, it appends 6a+6 to the list ans.
The code checks if a is odd. If it is, it checks if b is equal to 0. If it is, it deletes the last element of the list ans. It then appends 6a+3 to the list ans.
The code checks if a is odd. If it is, it checks if b is equal to 1. If it is, it appends 6a+3 to the list ans.
The code checks if a is odd. If it is, it checks if b is equal to 2. If it is, it appends 6a+2 and 6a+4 to the list ans.
The code checks if a is odd. If it is, it checks if b is equal to 3. If it is, it appends 6a+2, 6a+3 and 6a+4 to the list ans.
The code prints the list ans and ends the program.
