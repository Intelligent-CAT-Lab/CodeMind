Instruction: I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
For example:

Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
20 2 5
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
Consider the following code:

def inpl(): return list(map(int, input().split()))
W, H, w, h, x, y = inpl()

a = (min(W//2, x + w//2) + max(-W//2, x-w//2))
b = (min(H//2, y + h//2) + max(-H//2, y-h//2))
print(b/a)

What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
6000 5000 20 10 400 300

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The function inpl() is defined to read the input and return a list of integers.
The variables W, H, w, h, x and y are initialized to 6000, 5000, 20, 10, 400 and 300, respectively.
The code calculates the following values:
a = (min(W//2, x + w//2) + max(-W//2, x-w//2)) = (min(3000, 400 + 10) + max(-3000, 400 - 10)) = 400
b = (min(H//2, y + h//2) + max(-H//2, y-h//2)) = (min(2500, 300 + 5) + max(-2500, 300 - 5)) = 300
The code then prints the final value of b/a, which is 0.6.

The output of code execution is:
0.6
