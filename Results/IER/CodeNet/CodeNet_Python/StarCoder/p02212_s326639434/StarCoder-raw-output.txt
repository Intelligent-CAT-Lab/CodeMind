Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variables a, b, c and d are initialized to 2, 1, 3 and 4, respectively.
The code then calculates the values of x, which is a list of 6 elements.
The code then prints the minimum of the absolute values of the elements of x, which is 1.
<<<Output>>>
1

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
a, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())
x = [a+b-c-d, a+c-b-d, a+d-b-c, b+c-a-d, b+d-a-c, c+d-a-b]
print(max(map(abs, x)))
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 1 3 4
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
