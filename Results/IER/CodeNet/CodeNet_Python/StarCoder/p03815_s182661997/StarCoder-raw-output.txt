Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable x is initialized to 7.
The variable N is initialized to 2*(x//11), which is 2*(7//11), which is 2*(6).
The code checks if x % 11 == 0. Since it is, the code does not execute the next line of code.
The code checks if x % 11 <= 6. Since it is, the code adds 1 to N, which is 3.
The code checks if x % 11 > 6. Since it is, the code adds 2 to N, which is 5.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of N, which is 5.
<<<Output>>>
5

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())

sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if sum_order % 3 == 0:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The variable N is initialized to 20.
The variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used
