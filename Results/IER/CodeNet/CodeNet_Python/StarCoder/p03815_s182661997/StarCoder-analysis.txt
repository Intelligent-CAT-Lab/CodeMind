Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable x is initialized to 7.
The variable N is initialized to 2*(x//11), which is 2*(7//11), which is 2*(6).
The code checks if x % 11 == 0. Since it is, the code does not execute the next line of code.
The code checks if x % 11 <= 6. Since it is, the code adds 1 to N, which is 3.
The code checks if x % 11 > 6. Since it is, the code adds 2 to N, which is 5.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of N, which is 5.
