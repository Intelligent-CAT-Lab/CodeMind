Instruction: I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
For example:

Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
20 2 5
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84

Consider the following code:

def sub(maxs, mins):
    for i in range(len(maxs)):
        if maxs[i]!= mins[i]:
            if i == len(maxs)-1:
                return int(maxs[i]) - int(mins[i])
            if i == len(maxs)-2:
                return int(maxs[i:i+2]) - int(mins[i:i+2])
            return 10
    return 0

def checkEqual(S):
    ans = 8
    for k in range(1, len(S)):
        if len(S)%k!= 0: continue
        mins = maxs = S[0:k]
        for s in range(0, len(S), k):
            maxs = max(maxs, S[s:s+k])
            mins = min(mins, S[s:s+k])
        ans = min(ans, sub(maxs, mins))

    return ans

def check12(S):
    maxv = 0
    minv = 10
    p = 0
    while p < len(S):
        v = int(S[p])
        if  S[p] == '1' and p+1 < len(S):
            v = 10 + int(S[p+1])
            p += 1
        maxv = max(maxv, v)
        minv = min(minv, v)
        p += 1
    return maxv - minv

S = input()
print(min(checkEqual(S), check12(S)))
                                                                                                                        

What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
11121314

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The function sub is defined to calculate the difference between two numbers.
The function checkEqual is defined to calculate the minimum difference between two numbers that are equal to each other.
The function check12 is defined to calculate the minimum difference between two numbers that are equal to each other.
The code first initializes the variable S to the input.
The code then calls the function checkEqual with the input S as the parameter.
The code then calls the function check12 with the input S as the parameter.
The code then prints the minimum of the two values returned by the two function calls.
The output of code execution is:
0
