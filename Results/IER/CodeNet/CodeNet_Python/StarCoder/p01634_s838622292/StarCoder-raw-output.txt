Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable s is initialized to the string "password".

[END-OF-RESPONSE]



TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
s=input()
print('INVALID' if s.isalpha() or s.isdigit() or s.islower() or s.isupper() or len(s)<6 else 'VALID')
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1234567890
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
