Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable a is initialized to 1, and variable b is initialized to 2.
The code checks if a > b. Since 1 > 2, the code executes the first branch of the if statement.
The code calculates the value of the expression 2 / 3 * math.pi * a**2 * b, which is 0.125 * math.pi * 1**2 * 2, which is 0.125 * math.pi * 1 * 2, which is 0.125 * math.pi * 2, which is 0.04714045207910317.
The code then prints the value of the expression 0.04714045207910317.
<<<Output>>>
0.04714045207910317
