The variable a is initialized to 8, and variable b is initialized to 13.
The function f is defined as a lambda function that takes a single argument x.
The function main is defined as a function that takes no arguments.
The function main calls the function f with argument b-a-1.
The function f returns the value of (b-a-1)*(b-a)/2.
The function main subtracts a from the value returned by f, and stores the result in the variable ans.
The function main prints the value of ans.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())

def main():
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        if i % 3 == 0 or i % 5 == 0:
            ans += i
    print(ans)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
