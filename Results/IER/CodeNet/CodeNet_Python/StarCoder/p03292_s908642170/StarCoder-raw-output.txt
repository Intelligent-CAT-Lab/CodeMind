Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable a is initialized to a list of integers, which is [1, 6, 3].
The code sorts the list a in ascending order.
The code then prints the difference between the second and first elements of the list, which is 5.
<<<Output>>>
5
[END-OF-RESPONSE]



TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
a = [ int(i) for i in input().split() ]
a = sorted(a)
print( a[1] - a[0] + a[2] - a[1] )

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 6 3
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
