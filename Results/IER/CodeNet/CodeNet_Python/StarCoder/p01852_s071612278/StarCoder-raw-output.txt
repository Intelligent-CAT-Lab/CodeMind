rint the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable n is initialized to 0.
The code checks if n is equal to 0. If it is, it prints 0.
Otherwise, it calculates the length of the binary representation of n, which is 1.
The code prints the final value of n, which is 1.
<<<Output>>>
1
[END-OF-RESPONSE]



TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
n = int(input())
print(n * (n == 0) + len(str(bin(n))[2:]) * (n!= 0))
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```0
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
