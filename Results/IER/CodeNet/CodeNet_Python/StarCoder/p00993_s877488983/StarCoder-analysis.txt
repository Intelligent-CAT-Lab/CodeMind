The variable num is initialized to 2, which will be used to store the product of the series.
The variable i is initialized to 3, which will be used to iterate the series.
The code then enters a loop that iterates 1500//2 times, meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 750.
For each iteration, it multiplies num by i and stores the result in num.
The code then enters a loop that iterates n times, meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 1.
For each iteration, it prints the value of a, which is 2 for the first iteration and 4 for the second.
