The variable r1, c1, r2, c2 are initialized to 1, 1, 2 and 2, respectively.
The variable L is initialized to 10 ** 9 + 7.
The code then calculates the Euclidean algorithm of the variables r2 and c2.
The code then calculates the Fibonacci numbers up to r2 + c2 + 3.
The code then calculates the number of combinations of r2 + c2 + 2 objects taken r2 + 1 at a time.
The code then calculates the number of combinations of r2 + c1 + 1 objects taken c1 at a time.
The code then calculates the number of combinations of r1 + c2 + 1 objects taken r1 at a time.
The code then calculates the number of combinations of r1 + c1 objects taken r1 at a time.
The code then prints the final value of the sum of the four combinations, which is 1.
