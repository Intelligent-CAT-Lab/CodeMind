Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable a is initialized to 1000, and variable b is initialized to 3000.
The code calculates the average of a and b, which is 2000.
The code then prints the average, which is 2000.
<<<Output>>>
2000

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b=map(int,input().split())
c=int((a+b)/2)
print(c)

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1000 3000
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
