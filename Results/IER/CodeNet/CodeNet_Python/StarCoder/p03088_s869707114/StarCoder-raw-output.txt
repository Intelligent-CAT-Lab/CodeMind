The variable n is initialized to 3.
The variables A, C, G, T and M are initialized to 0, 1, 2, 3 and 1000000007, respectively.
The variable R is initialized to the range [0, 1, 2, 3].
The variable dp is initialized to a 3-dimensional array of size n+1, 4, 4, 4, where each element is initialized to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 3.
For each number i in this range, it enters a nested loop that iterates over all possible values of the variables j, k, l and m.
The code then enters a nested loop that iterates over all possible values of the variables j, k, l and m.
