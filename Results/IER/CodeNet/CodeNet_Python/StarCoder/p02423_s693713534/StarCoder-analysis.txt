Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable n is initialized to 8.
The variable m is initialized to 4294967295, which is 32 bits of 1s.
The code then prints the binary representation of n, which is 00000000000000000000000000001000.
The code then prints the binary representation of ~n&m, which is 11111111111111111111111111110111.
The code then prints the binary representation of n<<1&m, which is 00000000000000000000000000010000.
The code then prints the binary representation of n>>1, which is 00000000000000000000000000000100.
