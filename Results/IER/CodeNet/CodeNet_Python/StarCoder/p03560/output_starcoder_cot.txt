Instruction: I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
For example:

Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
20 2 5
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
Consider the following code:

import heapq

K = int(input())

edge = [[] for i in range(K)]  # (node, cost) list list

for i in range(1, K):
    edge[i].append(( (i+1)%K, 1) )
    edge[i].append( ((i*10)%K, 0) )

# fro から to への最短距離(v は頂点数)
def dijkstra(fro, to, v):
    MAX = int(1e9)

    dist = [MAX]*v   # fro からの距離を格納する
    check = [False]*v  # すでにその頂点からを調べたかのフラグ

    dist[fro] = 0
    pq = [(0, fro)]    # (-cost, node)


    # 頂点は v 個あるので、v 周する
    for i in range(v):
        # 調べ済みでない頂点のうち、最も近い頂点を now に入れる
        nowNode = -1        # このターンにフォーカスするノード

        while True:
            nowNode = heapq.heappop(pq)[1]  # 最小コストから貪欲に取っていく
            if not check[nowNode]:    # まだチェックされていないノードだったら決定
                check[nowNode] = True
                break

        # その頂点からたどり着ける頂点の情報を更新する
        for (nextNode, cost) in edge[nowNode]:
            nextDist = dist[nowNode] + cost
            if nextDist < dist[nextNode]:  # 既存の通路より近いなら更新
                dist[nextNode] = nextDist
                heapq.heappush(pq, (dist[nextNode], nextNode))

    return dist[to]

print(dijkstra(1, 0, K) + 1)

What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
6

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable K is initialized to 6, which is the number of nodes in the graph.
The code then initializes a list edge of size K, which is a list of lists.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to K (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 6.
For each number i in this range, it adds two edges to the list edge. The first edge connects node i to node (i+1)%K, and the second edge connects node i to node (i*10)%K.
The code then initializes a list dist of size K, which is a list of MAX values.
The code then initializes a list check of size K, which is a list of False values.
The code then initializes a priority queue pq of size K, which is a list of (-cost, node) tuples.
The code then initializes a variable nowNode to -1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to v (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 5.
The code then pops the first element of the priority queue pq and assigns it to nowNode.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to v (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 5.
The code then checks if check[nowNode] is False. If it is, it assigns True to check[nowNode] and breaks out of the loop.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to v (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 5.
The code then pops the first element of the priority queue pq and assigns it to nowNode.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to v (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 5.
