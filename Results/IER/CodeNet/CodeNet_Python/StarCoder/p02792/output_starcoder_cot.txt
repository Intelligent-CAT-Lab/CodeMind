Instruction: I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
For example:

Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
20 2 5
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
Consider the following code:

N=int(raw_input())

num = [[0 for i in range(10)] for j in range(10)]

for i in range(1,N+1):
    if i % 10 > 0:
        num[int(str(i)[0])][i % 10] += 1

#print num

c = 0
for i in range(1,10):
    for j in range(1,10):
        c += num[i][j]*num[j][i]
print c

What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
25

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N is initialized to 25.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 25.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is divisible by 10. If it is, it calculates the first digit of i and the last digit of i.
If the first digit is greater than 0, it adds 1 to the corresponding element of the num array.
If the last digit is greater than 0, it adds 1 to the corresponding element of the num array.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of c, which is 100.

The output of code execution is:
100
END-OF-OUTPUT

Question 2:

Consider the following code:

N = int(raw_input())

for i in range(1,N+1):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        print i,

What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
10

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N is initialized to 10.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 10.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is divisible by 2. If it is, it prints i.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of c, which is 2,4,6,8,10.

The output of code execution is:
2 4 6 8 10
END-OF-OUTPUT
