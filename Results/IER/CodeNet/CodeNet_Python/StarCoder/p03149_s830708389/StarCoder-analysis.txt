The variable n is initialized to the list [1, 7, 9, 4].
The variable check is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the number of times the condition is met.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the list n.
For each number x in the list n, it checks if x is equal to 1, 9, 7 or 4. If it is, it adds 1 to check. The condition is met when x is 1, 9, 7 and 4.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if check is equal to 1. If it is, it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".
