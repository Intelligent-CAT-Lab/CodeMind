The variable N, variable K are initialized to 3 and 2, respectively.
The variable LARGE is initialized to 10 ** 9 + 7.
The variable R is initialized to 1.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to R (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 1.
The code checks if (R + 1) ** 2 == N, which is true in this case.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to R (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 1.
The code calculates Q = N // i, which is 3 // 1 = 3.
The code calculates DP_L[i - 1] = Q - L, which is 3 - 1 = 2.
The code calculates N_L[i - 1] = Q - L, which is 3 - 1 = 2.
The code calculates L = Q, which is 3.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to R (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 1.
The code calculates S = 0, which is 0.
The code calculates L = sum(DP_L) + DP_M, which is 2 + 0 = 2.
The code calculates SS = sum(DP_S), which is 0.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to R (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 1.
The code calculates S = (S + DP_S[i]) % LARGE, which is 0 + 0 = 0.
The code calculates DP_S[i] = (L + SS) % LARGE, which is 2 + 0 = 2.
The code calculates L = (L - DP_L[i]) % LARGE, which is 2 - 2 = 0.
The code calculates DP_L[i] = (S * N_L[i]) % LARGE, which is 0 * 2 = 0.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to R (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 1.
The code calculates S = (S + DP_S[i]) % LARGE, which is 0 + 0 = 0.
The code calculates DP_S[i] = (L + SS) % LARGE, which is 0 + 0 = 0.
The code calculates L = (L - DP_L[i]) % LARGE, which is 0 - 0 = 0.
The code calculates DP_L[i] = (S * N_L[i]) % LARGE, which is 0 * 0 = 0.
