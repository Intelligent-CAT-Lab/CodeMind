The variable X is initialized to 3, and variable Y is initialized to 20.
The variable count is initialized to 1, which will be used to count the number of times the loop is executed.
The code enters a loop that will be executed until the condition is met.
The code doubles the value of X and checks if it is greater than Y. If it is, the loop is terminated.
If the condition is not met, the code increments count by 1 and repeats the loop.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of count, which is 5.
