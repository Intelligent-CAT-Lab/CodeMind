Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable X is initialized to 3, and variable Y is initialized to 20.
The variable count is initialized to 1, which will be used to count the number of times the loop is executed.
The code enters a loop that will be executed until the condition is met.
The code doubles the value of X and checks if it is greater than Y. If it is, the loop is terminated.
If the condition is not met, the code increments count by 1 and repeats the loop.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of count, which is 5.
<<<Output>>>
5

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N,K=map(int,input().split())
count=0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    if i%K==0:
        count+=1
print(count)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10 3```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
