Instruction: I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
For example:

Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
20 2 5
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84

What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
1 3 2

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The code imports the sys module, which is used to read input from stdin and write output to stdout.
The code then defines a class RollingHash. This class is used to calculate the hash of a substring of a string.
The constructor of RollingHash takes three arguments: a string s, a base b and a modulus m. The string s is the string to be hashed. The base b is the base of the hash. The modulus m is the modulus of the hash.
The constructor initializes the following two arrays:
pw: an array of length len(s)+1, which is used to calculate the hash of a substring of s.
h: an array of length len(s)+1, which is used to calculate the hash of a substring of s.
The constructor then calculates the hash of the empty string and stores it in h[0].
The constructor then calculates the hash of the first character of s and stores it in h[1].
The constructor then calculates the hash of the first two characters of s and stores it in h[2].
The constructor continues calculating the hash of the first i characters of s and stores it in h[i+1].
The constructor continues calculating the hash of the first i+1 characters of s and stores it in pw[i+1].
The get function of RollingHash takes two arguments: l and r, which are the left and right indices of the substring of s.
The get function returns the hash of the substring of s from index l to index r.
The solve function is the main function of the code.
The solve function reads three integers A, B and C from stdin.
The solve function then calculates the answer to the problem and stores it in ans.
The solve function then calculates the answer to the problem when A is decremented by 1 and stores it in ans.
The solve function then prints the
