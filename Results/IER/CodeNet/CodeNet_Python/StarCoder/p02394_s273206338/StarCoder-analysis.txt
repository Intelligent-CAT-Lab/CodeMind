Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable W, variable H, variable x, variable y and variable r are initialized to 5, 4, 2, 2 and 1, respectively.
The code checks if the following conditions are met:
left = x-r >= 0
right = x+r <= W
top = y+r <= H
bottom = y-r >= 0
The code checks if the product of these four conditions is equal to 1.
The code prints "Yes" if the condition is met, and "No" otherwise.
The code prints "Yes" because the product of the four conditions is equal to 1.
