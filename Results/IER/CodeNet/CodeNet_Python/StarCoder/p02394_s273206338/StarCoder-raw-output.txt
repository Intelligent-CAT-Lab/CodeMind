Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable W, variable H, variable x, variable y and variable r are initialized to 5, 4, 2, 2 and 1, respectively.
The code checks if the following conditions are met:
left = x-r >= 0
right = x+r <= W
top = y+r <= H
bottom = y-r >= 0
The code checks if the product of these four conditions is equal to 1.
The code prints "Yes" if the condition is met, and "No" otherwise.
The code prints "Yes" because the product of the four conditions is equal to 1.
<<<Output>>>
Yes

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())

for i in range(1,N+1):
    if i%2 == 0:
        print(i, end=" ")
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N is initialized to 10.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 10.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is even. If it is, it prints i and a space.
The code prints the following:
2 4 6 8 10
<<<Output>>>
2 4 6 8 10
