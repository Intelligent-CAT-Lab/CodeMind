Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable n is initialized to 2, and variable k is initialized to 3.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 2.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the product of k and ans, and stores it in ans.
The code then calculates the product of k and k, and stores it in k.
The code then divides n by 2, and stores the result in n.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 12.
