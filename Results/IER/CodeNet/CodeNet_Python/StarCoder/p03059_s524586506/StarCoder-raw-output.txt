The variable A, variable B and variable T are initialized to 3, 5 and 7, respectively.
The code calculates the number of times T can be divided by A, which is 2.
The code then multiplies this number by B, which is 5.
The code then prints the final value of this multiplication, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if sum_order % 3 == 0:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```100
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N is initialized to 100.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 100.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if
