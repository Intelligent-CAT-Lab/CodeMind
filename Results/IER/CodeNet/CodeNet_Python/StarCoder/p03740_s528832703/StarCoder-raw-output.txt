Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable X is initialized to 2, and variable Y is initialized to 1.
The code checks if the absolute value of X - Y is less than 2.
Since X - Y = 1, the absolute value of this is 1.
Since 1 < 2, the code prints "Brown".
<<<Output>>>
Brown

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())
for i in range(1,N+1):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        print(i)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N is initialized to 10.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 10.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is even.
Since i is even, the code prints i.
<<<Output>>>
