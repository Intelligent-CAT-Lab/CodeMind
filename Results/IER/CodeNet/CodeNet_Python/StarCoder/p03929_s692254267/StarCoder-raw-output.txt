The variable mod is initialized to 11.
The variable n and variable k are initialized to 7 and 7, respectively.
The variable last is initialized to 7*n-7*2-2, which is 10.
The variable idx is initialized to -1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to last (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 10.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the remainder of 3*(i+i+1+i+2)%mod, which is 7.
If the remainder is equal to k, it sets idx to i. The condition is met when i is 1,2,3,4,5,6,7.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if idx is equal to -1. If it is, it prints 0 and exits.
If idx is not equal to -1, it calculates r2idx and r1idx.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 7.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the remainder of (7*i-1-idx)%11, which is 0.
If the remainder is equal to 0, it sets r2idx to 7*i-1. The condition is met when i is 1,2,3,4,5,6,7.
After the loop finishes, the code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 7.

If the remainder is equal to 0, it sets r1idx to 7*i. The condition is met when i is 1,2,3,4,5,6,7.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if r1idx is equal to -1. If it is, it checks if r2idx is equal to -1. If it is, it prints (last-idx)/11+1.
If r2idx is not equal to -1, it prints (last-idx
