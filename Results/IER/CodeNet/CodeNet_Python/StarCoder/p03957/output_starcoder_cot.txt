Instruction: I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
For example:

Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
20 2 5
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
Consider the following code:

s = input()
ss = ""
p = 0
for i in range(len(s)):
    if p == 0 and s[i] == "C":
        p = 1
    elif p == 1 and s[i] == "F":
        p = 2
print("Yes" if p == 2 else "No")
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
CODEFESTIVAL

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable s is initialized to CODEFESTIVAL.
The variable ss is initialized to "", which will be used to store the final string.
The variable p is initialized to 0.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to len(s) (inclusive), meaning it will consider all characters in the string.
The code checks if p is equal to 0 and if the current character is equal to "C". If both conditions are met, it sets p to 1.
The code then checks if p is equal to 1 and if the current character is equal to "F". If both conditions are met, it sets p to 2.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if p is equal to 2. If it is, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".

The output of code execution is:
Yes
