Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable a is initialized to "1 5 2", which is a string.
The variable b is initialized to a list of integers, which is [1, 5, 2].
The code sorts the list b in ascending order.
The code prints the third element of the list b, which is 2.
The code multiplies the third element by 10, which is 20.
The code adds the second element of the list b to the result of the multiplication, which is 20+5=25.
The code adds the first element of the list b to the result of the addition, which is 25+1=26.
The code prints the final result, which is 26.
<<<Output>>>
26

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
a=input().strip().split(" ")
b=[int(i) for i in a]

b.sort()

print(b[2]*100+b[1]*10+b[0])

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 5 2
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
