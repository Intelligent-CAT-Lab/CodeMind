The variable a is initialized to "1 5 2", which is a string.
The variable b is initialized to a list of integers, which is [1, 5, 2].
The code sorts the list b in ascending order.
The code prints the third element of the list b, which is 2.
The code multiplies the third element by 10, which is 20.
The code adds the second element of the list b to the result of the multiplication, which is 20+5=25.
The code adds the first element of the list b to the result of the addition, which is 25+1=26.
The code prints the final result, which is 26.
