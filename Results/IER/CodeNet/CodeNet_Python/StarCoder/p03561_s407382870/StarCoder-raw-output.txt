The variable K, variable N are initialized to 3 and 2, respectively.
The code checks if K is equal to 1. If it is, it prints 1 N times, which is 1 1.
The code checks if K is even. If it is, it prints K/2, which is 1.
The code checks if K is odd. If it is, it initializes a list t with K/2+1, which is 2.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to N/2-1, meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 1.
Inside the loop, the code checks if t[j] is equal to 1. If it is, it decrements j by 1.
If t[j] is not equal to 1, it decrements t[j] by 1 and sets all the remaining elements of t to K, which is 3.
The code then increments j by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the first j+1 elements of t, which is 1 3.

        sys.exit(0)

if N == 2:
        print "1 1"
        sys.exit(0)

if N == 3:
        print "1 1 1"
