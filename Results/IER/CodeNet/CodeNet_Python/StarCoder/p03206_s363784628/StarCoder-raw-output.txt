Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable d is initialized to 25.
The variable s is initialized to " Eve"*(25-d), which is " Eve"*(25-25), which is an empty string.
The code then prints the string "Christmas" concatenated with s, which is "Christmas".
<<<Output>>>
Christmas

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
n=int(input())
s=0
for i in range(1,n+1):
    s+=i
print(s)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable n is initialized to 10.
The variable s is initialized to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 10.
For each number i in this range, it adds i to s.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of s, which is 55.
<<<Output>>>
55
