Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable a is initialized to 3, and variable b is initialized to 5.
The code calculates the floor division of b+a-1 by a, which is (5+3-1)//3, which is 2.
The code prints the final value of (b+a-1)//a, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
a, b = map(int, input().split())
print(a+b)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The variable a is initialized to 3, and variable b is initialized to 5.
The code adds a and b, which is 3+5, which is 8.
The code prints the final value of a+b, which is 8.
<<<Output>>>
8
