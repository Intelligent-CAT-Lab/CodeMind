Instruction: I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
For example:

Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
20 2 5
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
Consider the following code:

def resolve():
    (N, L) = list(map(int, input().split(" ")))
    Ts = []
    offset = L - 1
    absmin = float('inf')
    mini = float('inf')
    for i in range(1, N+1):
        Ts.append(i+offset)
        if abs(i + offset) < absmin:
            absmin = abs(i + offset)
            mini = i + offset
    print(sum(Ts)-mini)
        
    
if '__main__' == __name__:
    resolve()
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
5 2

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N is initialized to 5, and variable L is initialized to 2.
The code then initializes a list Ts with 5 elements, each of which is initialized to i+offset, where i ranges from 1 to 5.
The code then calculates the absolute value of the minimum element in Ts, which is 2.
The code then calculates the sum of Ts, which is 15.
The code then subtracts the minimum element from the sum of Ts, which is 13.
The output of code execution is:
13
