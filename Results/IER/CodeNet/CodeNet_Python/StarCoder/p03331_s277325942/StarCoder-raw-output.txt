rint the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N is initialized to 15.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 15.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum.
The code then calculates the sum of the digits of N-i and adds it to sum.
The code checks if sum is less than min_sum. If it is, it updates min_sum to the current value of sum.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of min_sum, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def DigitsSum(n):
    sum = 0
    while (n!= 0):
        sum += (n % 10)
        n = int(n / 10)
    return sum

N = int(input())

min_sum = 10**5
for i in range(1, N):
    sum
