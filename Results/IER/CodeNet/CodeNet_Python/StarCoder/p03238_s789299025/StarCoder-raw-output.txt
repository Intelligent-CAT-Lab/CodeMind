Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable age is initialized to 1.
The code checks if age is equal to 1. If it is, it prints "Hello World".
If age is not equal to 1, the code enters the else statement.
The code then prints the sum of the two inputs.
<<<Output>>>
Hello World

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())
for i in range(1,N+1):
    if(i%2 == 0):
        print(i)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N is initialized to 10.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 10.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is even. If it is, it prints i.
The code prints 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10.
<<<Output>>>
2
4
6
8
10
