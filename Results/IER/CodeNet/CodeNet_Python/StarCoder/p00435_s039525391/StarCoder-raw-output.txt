Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable a is initialized to "MRL", which is the input.
The variable line is initialized to "", which will be used to store the output.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to the length of a (exclusive), meaning it will consider characters from 0 to 3.
For each character i in this range, it checks if i is the last character in a. If it is, it checks if i is equal to "A", "B" or "C". If it is, it adds "X", "Y" or "Z" to line. If it is not, it subtracts 3 from the ASCII value of i and adds the result to line.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of line, which is "MXZ".
<<<Output>>>
MXZ

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
a = input()
line = ""
for i in range(len(a)):
    if i == len(a)-1:
        if a[-1]== "A":
            line +=
