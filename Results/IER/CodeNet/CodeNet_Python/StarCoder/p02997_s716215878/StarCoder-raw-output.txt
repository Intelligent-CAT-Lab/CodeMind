The variable N, variable K are initialized to 5 and 3, respectively.
The code calculates the number of edges in the graph, which is (N-1)*(N-2)//2 = 10.
The code checks if the number of edges is less than K, which is 3 in this case. If it is, it prints -1 and exits.
If the number of edges is greater than or equal to K, the code proceeds to generate the list of edges.
The code uses itertools.combinations to generate all possible pairs of numbers from 2 to N (inclusive).
The code then uses list slicing to remove the first K-1 pairs from the list.
The code then prints the number of edges in the graph, which is 10-3 = 7.
The code then prints the list of edges, which is:
1 2
1 3
1 4
1 5
2 3
2 4
2 5
3 4
3 5
4 5
<<<Output>>>
7
1 2
1 3
