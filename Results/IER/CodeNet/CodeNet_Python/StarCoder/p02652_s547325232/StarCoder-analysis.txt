The variable S is initialized to "0??".
The code enters a loop that iterates over the characters in S.
For each character c in S, it checks if c is "1" or "0".
If c is "1", it increments h1 by 1, and decrements h0 by 1.
If c is "0", it increments h0 by 1, and decrements h1 by 1.
If c is neither "1" nor "0", it does nothing.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if max0 < max1.
If so, it checks if the number of 1s in amax1 is odd or even.
If the number of 1s in amax1 is odd, it prints max1.
If the number of 1s in amax1 is even, it prints max1+1.
If max0 > max1, it checks if the number of 0s in amax0 is odd or even.
If the number of 0s in amax0 is odd, it prints max0.
If the number of 0s in amax0 is even, it prints max0+1.
If max0 == max1, it checks if the number of 1s in amax1 and the number of 0s in amax0 are odd or even.
If the number of 1s in amax1 and the number of 0s in amax0 are odd, it prints max0.
If the number of 1s in amax1 and the number of 0s in amax0 are even, it prints max0+1.
