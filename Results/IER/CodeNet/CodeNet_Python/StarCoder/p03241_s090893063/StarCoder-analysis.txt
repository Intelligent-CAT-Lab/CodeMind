The variable n is initialized to 3, and variable m is initialized to 14.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to m (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 14.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is a perfect square.
If it is, it checks if m//i is greater than or equal to n.
If it is, it updates ans to the maximum of ans and i.
If m//i is greater than or equal to n, it means that m is divisible by i.
If it is, it updates ans to the maximum of ans and m//i.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 3.
