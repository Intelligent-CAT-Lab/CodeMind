The variable S and variable K are initialized to 0101 and 1, respectively.
The code then calculates the minimum of K and 300, which is 1.
The code then calculates the modulus of 998244353.
The code then initializes an empty list a.
The code then initializes a variable val to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to the length of S (exclusive), which is 5 in this case.
If S[i] is equal to 0, it appends val to a. Then it sets val to 0.
Otherwise, it increments val by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if val is not equal to 0. If it is, it appends val to a.
The code then calculates the length of a, which is 3 in this case.
The code then calculates the minimum of the sum of a and K, which is 1.
The code then initializes a 2D list dp with 0s.
The code then initializes a list b with the first m elements of a.
The code then initializes a list c with the last m elements of a.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to m-1 (inclusive), which is 2 in this case.
It increments b[i] by b[i-1].
After the loop finishes, the code initializes a list b with 0 and the first m+1 elements of a.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from m-2 to 0 (inclusive), which is 1 in this case.
It increments c[i] by c[i+1].
After the loop finishes, the code enters a loop that iterates from m-1 to 0 (inclusive), which is 2 in this case.
The code then initializes a 2D list ndp with 0s.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from the minimum of b[i] and K (inclusive) to the minimum of K and c[i] (inclusive), which is 1 in this case.
The code then initializes a variable M to the maximum of k-j and -a[i], which
