Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The code first reads the input string s and stores it in a variable.
The code then enters a loop that continues until the input string s is not equal to the output of a regular expression substitution.
The regular expression substitution is performed by the re.sub() function, which takes two arguments: a pattern and a replacement string.
The pattern is a regular expression that matches the string'mmew' or'mew'. The replacement string is '\\1\\2', which means that the first group of the pattern is replaced by the second group of the pattern.
The code then updates the input string s to the output of the regular expression substitution.
The code then checks if the input string s is equal to'mew'. If it is, it prints 'Cat'. Otherwise, it prints 'Rabbit'.
