The variable n, variable h and variable d are initialized to 2, 2 and 1, respectively.
The code then initializes a list fac with the first element 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates until the length of fac reaches 1000001, which is the value of big.
The code appends the product of the current length of fac and the previous element of fac to fac.
The code then enters another loop that iterates until the length of fac reaches 1000001, which is the value of big.
The code appends the sum of the current element of fac and the previous element of fac to cumfac.
The code then initializes a list DP with the first element 0 and the rest of the elements 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to h (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 2.
The code initializes the variable s to 0.
The code then enters another loop that iterates from 1 to i (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to h.
The code adds the current element of DP to s.
The code then enters another loop that iterates from 1 to i (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to h.
The code subtracts the element of DP at index i-d-1 from s.
The code then modulos s by mod.
The code then multiplies s by multi.
The code then modulos the result by mod.
The code then assigns the result to the element of DP at index i.
The code then enters a special case for the last element of DP.
The code then adds the sum of elements of DP from index max(0,h-d) to h to s.
The code then modulos s by mod.
The code then prints the final value of DP at index h, which is 2.
