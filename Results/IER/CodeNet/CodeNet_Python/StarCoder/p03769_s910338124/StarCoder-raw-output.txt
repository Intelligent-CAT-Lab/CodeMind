The variable n is initialized to 7.
The function f is called with n as the argument.
The function f checks if n is equal to 1. If it is, the function returns an empty list.
The function f checks if n is even. If it is, the function calls itself recursively with n divided by 2 as the argument.
The function f checks if n is odd. If it is, the function calls itself recursively with n minus 1 as the argument.
The function f returns the result of the recursive calls.
