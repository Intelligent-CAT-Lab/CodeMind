Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable n is initialized to 54.
The variable ret is initialized to 1.
The variable i is initialized to 0.
The code enters a while loop that continues as long as ret is less than or equal to n.
The code calculates the value of ret by doubling i.
The code increments i by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ret, which is 1024.
<<<Output>>>
1024

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
n = int(input())
i = 1
while i <= n:
    if n % i == 0:
        print(i)
    i += 1
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable n is initialized to 10.
The variable i is initialized to 1.
The code enters a while loop that continues as long as i is less than or equal to n.
The code checks if n is divisible by i. If it is, it prints the current value of i.
The code increments i by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of i, which is 11.
<<<Output>>>
1 2 3 5 7 11
