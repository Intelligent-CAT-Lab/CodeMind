int the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N, variable M are initialized to 3 and 14, respectively.
The code then calculates the divisors of M, which is [1, 2, 7, 14].
The code then sorts the divisors in ascending order, which is [1, 2, 7, 14].
The code then finds the smallest divisor greater than or equal to N, which is 7.
The code then calculates the number of integers that are divisible by g, which is 14//7 = 2.
The code then prints the final value of g, which is 2.
