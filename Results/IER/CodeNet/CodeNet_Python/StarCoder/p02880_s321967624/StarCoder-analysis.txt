Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable n is initialized to 10.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 10 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 10.
For each number i in this range, it checks if n is divisible by i and if n/i is less than 10.
If the condition is met, the code prints "Yes" and exits the loop.
If the condition is not met, the code prints "No" and exits the loop.
After the loop finishes, the code prints "No" because 10 is not divisible by 1 and 10/1 is greater than 10.
