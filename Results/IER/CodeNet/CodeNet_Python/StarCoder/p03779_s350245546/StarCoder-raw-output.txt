The variable X is initialized to 6.
The function main() is called.
The variable t is initialized to 0.
The variable curr is initialized to 0.
The code enters a while loop that iterates as long as curr is less than X.
Inside the loop, the variable t is incremented by 1.
The variable curr is incremented by t.
The code exits the loop when curr is 6.
The code prints the final value of t, which is 3.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())

def main():
    t = 0
    curr = 0
    while curr < N:
        t += 1
        curr += t
    print(t)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
