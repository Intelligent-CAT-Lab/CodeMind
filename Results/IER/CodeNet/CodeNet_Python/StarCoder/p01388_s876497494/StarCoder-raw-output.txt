Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The code first reads the input and stores it in a variable L.
The code then initializes a list data with 4 elements.
The code then counts the number of occurrences of the letter "K" in L and stores the result in the first element of data.
The code then counts the number of occurrences of the letter "U" in L and stores the result in the second element of data.
The code then counts the number of occurrences of the letter "P" in L and stores the result in the third element of data.
The code then counts the number of occurrences of the letter "C" in L and stores the result in the fourth element of data.
The code then prints the minimum value of data, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>

import sys

def solve():
    L = raw_input()
    data = []
    data.append(L.count("K"))
    data.append(L.count("U"))
    data.append(L.count("P"))
    data.append(
