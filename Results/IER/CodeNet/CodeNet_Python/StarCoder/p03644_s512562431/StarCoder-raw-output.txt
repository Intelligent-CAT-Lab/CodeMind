Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N is initialized to 7.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to infinity, meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to infinity.
For each number n in this range, it calculates 2**n and stores it in n.
The code checks if 2**n is greater than or equal to N. If it is, it breaks out of the loop and prints the final value of n-1, which is 3.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = input()
N = int(N)
n = 0
while 2**n<=N:
    n=n+1
print(2**n)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```7
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
