Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable X is initialized to 3, and variable Y is initialized to 20.
variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the number of times the loop is executed.
variable seki is initialized to X, which is 3.
The code enters a loop that iterates while seki is less than or equal to Y, which is 20 in this case.
Inside the loop, seki is doubled and the value is stored in seki.
The code increments ans by 1 for each iteration of the loop.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 5.
