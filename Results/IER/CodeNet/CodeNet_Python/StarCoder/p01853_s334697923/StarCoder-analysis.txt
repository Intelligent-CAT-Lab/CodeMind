Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable n, variable m are initialized to 3, 100, respectively.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 2.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is less than or equal to n/2. If it is, it prints 0. If it is not, it prints m.
After the loop finishes, the code prints a blank line.
