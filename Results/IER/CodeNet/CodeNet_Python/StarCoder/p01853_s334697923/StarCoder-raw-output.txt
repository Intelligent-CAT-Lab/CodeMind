Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable n, variable m are initialized to 3, 100, respectively.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 2.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is less than or equal to n/2. If it is, it prints 0. If it is not, it prints m.
After the loop finishes, the code prints a blank line.
<<<Output>>>
0 0 0

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
(n,m)=[int(a) for a in input().split()]
for i in range(n):
    if i:print(" ",end="")
    if i<=n/2: print("0",end="")
    else: print("{}".format(m),end="")
print("")
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4 100
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
