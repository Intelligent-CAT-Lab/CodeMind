The variable inputStrings is initialized to "AIZUNYANPEROPERO".
The variable outputStrings is initialized to an empty list.
The variable isNextA is initialized to True.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the characters in inputStrings.
For each character i in inputStrings, it checks if isNextA is True and i is "A". If so, it appends i to outputStrings and sets isNextA to False.
If isNextA is False and i is "Z", it appends i to outputStrings and sets isNextA to True.
The code then checks if outputStrings is not empty. If it is not, it checks if the last element of outputStrings is "A". If it is, it removes the last element of outputStrings.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the characters in outputStrings. For each character i in outputStrings, it appends i to output.
The code then checks if the length of output is greater than 1. If it is, it prints output. Otherwise, it prints "-1".

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())
for i in range(1,N+1):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        print(i)
</Code>
