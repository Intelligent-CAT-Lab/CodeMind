The variable a and variable b are initialized to 8 and 13, respectively.
variable lis is initialized to a list of 1000 elements, each of which is initialized to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 999, meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 999.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of the first i+2 multiples of i+1, and stores it in lis[i].
The code checks if b-a is equal to lis[i]-lis[i-1], which is 13-8=5 in this case. If it is, it prints the difference between b and lis[i], which is 5.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of lis[i], which is 120.
<<<Output>>>
120

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
n=int(input())
lis=[0]*1000
for i in range(1000):
    lis[i]=(i+2)*(i+1)//2
    if i>=1:
        if n==lis[i]-lis[i-1]:
            print(i+1)
            break
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```13
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
