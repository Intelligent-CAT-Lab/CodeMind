Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable a and variable b are initialized to 8 and 13, respectively.
variable lis is initialized to a list of 1000 elements, each of which is initialized to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 999, meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 999.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of the first i+2 multiples of i+1, and stores it in lis[i].
The code checks if b-a is equal to lis[i]-lis[i-1], which is 13-8=5 in this case. If it is, it prints the difference between b and lis[i], which is 5.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of lis[i], which is 120.
