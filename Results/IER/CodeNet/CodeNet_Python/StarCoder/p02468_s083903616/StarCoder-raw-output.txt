Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The code first reads the input and initializes the variables m and n to 2 and 3, respectively.
The code then calls the function rep_pow(m, n) and prints the result.
The function rep_pow(a, k, p=10**9+7) is defined to calculate exponentiation: a^k mod p.
The function first initializes the variable ans to 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates while k is greater than 0.
If k is odd, it multiplies ans by a and stores the result in ans.
It then multiplies a by a and stores the result in a.
It then shifts k by 1 bit to the right and repeats the process.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the value of ans.
The code then prints the final value of ans, which is 8.
<<<Output>>>
8

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def rep_pow(a, k, p=10**9+7):
    # calculate exponentiation: a^k mod p
    ans = 1
    while k > 0:
        if k & 1:
            ans = ans * a % p
        a = a * a % p
        k >>= 1
    return ans

m, n = map(int, input().split())
print(rep_pow(m, n))

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 1000000000
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
