The variable a is initialized to 19, variable b is initialized to 30, and variable n is initialized to 3.
The code then calculates the minimum value of x, which is the minimum absolute difference between a and the sum of k * d and b, where k is a number from 1 to n and d is the largest divisor of b that is less than or equal to n.
The code then prints the final value of x, which is 1.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
#!/usr/bin/env python3

INF = 2 ** 63 - 1


def solve(a, b, n):
    # a + x = k * d, b = l * g
    # 1 <= k <= n, 1 <= l <= n
    x = INF
    for l in range(1, n + 1):
        d, m = divmod(b, l)
        if not m:
            for k in range(1, n + 1):
                x = min(x, abs(k * d - a))
    return x


def main():
    a, b, n = map(int, input().split())
    print(solve(a, b, n))


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```19 30 3
```
