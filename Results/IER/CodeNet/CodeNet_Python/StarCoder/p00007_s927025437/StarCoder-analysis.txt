Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable n is initialized to 5.
The variable rent is initialized to 100000.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 4.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the new rent and stores it in rent.
The code then prints the final value of rent, which is 100000.
