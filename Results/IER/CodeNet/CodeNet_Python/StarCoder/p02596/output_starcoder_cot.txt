Instruction: I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
For example:

Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
20 2 5
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84

Consider the following code:

#!/usr/bin/env python3
import sys

def main():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    k = int(input())
    if k % 10 in [0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8]:
        print(-1)
    elif k % 10 == 1:
        tmp = k * 7
        ans = 1
        while True:
            if str(tmp).count("7") == len(str(tmp)):
                print(ans + len(str(tmp)) - 1)
                break
            if tmp // 10 % 10 <= 7:
                num = 7 - tmp // 10 % 10
            elif tmp // 10 % 10 == 8:
                num = 9

                num = 8

                break

        ans = 1
        while True:

                print(ans + len(str(tmp)) - 1)
                break
            num = ((tmp // 10 % 10) * 3 - 1) % 10
            tmp2 = k * num

                print(ans + len(str(tmp)) - 1)
                break
            num = ((tmp // 10 % 10) * 7 + 1) % 10
            tmp2 = k * num
            tmp = tmp // 10 + tmp2
            ans += 1
            if ans > k:
                print(-1)
                break
    elif k % 10 == 9:

        ans = 1
        while True:

                print(ans + len(str(tmp)) - 1)
                break
            num = ((tmp // 10 % 10) + 3) % 10
            tmp2 = k * num
            tmp = tmp // 10 + tmp2
            ans += 1
            if ans > k:
                print(-1)
                break

What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
101

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable k is initialized to 101.
The code checks if k is divisible by 10, which is not the case.
The code checks if k is divisible by 10 and if its last digit is 0, 2, 4, 5, 6 or 8, which is not the case.
The code checks if k is divisible by 10 and if its last digit is 1, which is the case.
The code then initializes a temporary variable tmp to k * 7, which is 707.
The code initializes a variable ans to 1, which will be used to accumulate the number of iterations.
The code enters a loop that iterates until the condition is met.
The code checks if the string representation of tmp contains 7 as many times as the length of the string representation of tmp, which is the case.
The code then initializes a variable num to 7 - tmp // 10 % 10, which is 7 - 0 % 10, which is 7.
The code then initializes a temporary variable tmp2 to k * num, which is 707.
The code then updates tmp to tmp // 10 + tmp2, which is 707 // 10 + 707, which is 707 + 707, which is 1414.
The code then increments ans by 1, which is 2.
The code checks if ans is greater than k, which is not the case.
The code then prints -1, which is the answer.

The output of code execution is:
-1
