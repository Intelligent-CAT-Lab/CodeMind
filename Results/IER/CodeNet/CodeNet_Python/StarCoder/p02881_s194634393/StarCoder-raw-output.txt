Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable n is initialized to 10.
The variable ans is initialized to 10**12, which is 1000000000000.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to the square root of n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 10.
For each number k in this range, it checks if n is divisible by k. If it is, it calculates the value of m as n//k + k - 2.
If m is less than ans, it updates ans to m.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
n = int(input())
ans = 0

for k in range(1,n+1):
    if n%k == 0:
        ans += k
print(ans)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
