The variable n is initialized to 10.
The variable ans is initialized to 10**12, which is 1000000000000.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to the square root of n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 10.
For each number k in this range, it checks if n is divisible by k. If it is, it calculates the value of m as n//k + k - 2.
If m is less than ans, it updates ans to m.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 10.
