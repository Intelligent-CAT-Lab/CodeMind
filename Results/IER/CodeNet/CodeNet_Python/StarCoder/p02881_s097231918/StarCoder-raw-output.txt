Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N is initialized to 10.
The code enters a loop that iterates from the square root of N to 1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 3 to 10.
For each number i in this range, it checks if N is divisible by i. If it is, it stores the value of i-1 in answer and breaks the loop.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of answer, which is 4.
<<<Output>>>
4

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N=int(input())

answer=0

for i in range(1,N+1):
    if N%i==0:
        answer+=i
print(answer)

</Code>
<<<Question>>>

The variable N is initialized to 10.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 10.
For each number i in this range, it checks if N is divisible by i. If it is, it adds i to answer.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of answer, which is 21.
<<<Output>>>
