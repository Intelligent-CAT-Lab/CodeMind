The variable S is initialized to the string SENW.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to the length of S, which is 4 in this case.
For each index i in this range, it checks if the character at index i is equal to 'N', 'W', 'S' or 'E'.
If it is, it sets the corresponding variable to 1.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if the values of the variables n, w, s and e are equal to 1.
If they are, it prints 'Yes'.
If they are not, it prints 'No'.
