The variable S is initialized to the string SENW.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to the length of S, which is 4 in this case.
For each index i in this range, it checks if the character at index i is equal to 'N', 'W', 'S' or 'E'.
If it is, it sets the corresponding variable to 1.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if the values of the variables n, w, s and e are equal to 1.
If they are, it prints 'Yes'.
If they are not, it prints 'No'.
<<<Output>>>
Yes

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())

for i in range(1,N+1):
  if(i%2 == 0):
    print(i, end ='')
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N is initialized to 10.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 10.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is even.
If it is, it prints i and a space.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 2 4 6 8 10.
