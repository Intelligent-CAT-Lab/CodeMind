Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable n is initialized to 5, and variable k is initialized to 3.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to k (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 3.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the binomial coefficient b and the rising factorial r.
The code prints the final value of b*r, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
n,k=map(int,input().split())

for i in range(1,k+1):
    if n-k+1<i:
        print(0)
        continue
    b=1
    r=1
    for j in range(1,i):
        b*=j
        r*=n-k+1-j
    print(b//r)

</Code>
