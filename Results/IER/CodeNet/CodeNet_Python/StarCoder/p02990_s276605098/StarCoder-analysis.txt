The variable n is initialized to 5, and variable k is initialized to 3.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to k (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 3.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the binomial coefficient b and the rising factorial r.
The code prints the final value of b*r, which is 10.
