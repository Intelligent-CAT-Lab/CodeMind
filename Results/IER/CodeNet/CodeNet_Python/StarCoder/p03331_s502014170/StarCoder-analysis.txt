The variable N is initialized to 15.
The function Num_Each_Digit is called with N and limit as arguments.
The function checks if N is less than 10**(limit).
If it is, the function enters a loop that iterates from 1 to limit (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 10.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in ans.
After the loop finishes, the function returns ans.
The variable digit is initialized to the return value of Num_Each_Digit.
The code then checks if N is equal to 10**(len(digit)-1).
If it is, the code prints 10.
Otherwise, the code prints the sum of the digits in digit.
