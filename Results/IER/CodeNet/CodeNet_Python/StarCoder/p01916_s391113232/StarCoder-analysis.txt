The variable s is initialized to the string "hcpc".
The variable cnt is initialized to a list of 26 zeros.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the characters in the string s.
For each character x in the string, it adds 1 to the corresponding element of the list cnt.
The code then prints the sum of the elements of the list cnt, which is 10.
