Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable L is initialized to 4.
The code first calculates the number of bits needed to represent L, which is 2.
The code then calculates the number of vertices needed to represent the tree, which is 3.
The code then calculates the number of edges needed to represent the tree, which is 5.
The code then prints the number of vertices and edges in the tree, which is 3 and 5, respectively.
The code then prints the edges of the tree, which are (1, 2, 0), (1, 2, 2), (1, 3, 0), (1, 3, 4), and (1, 3, 6).
