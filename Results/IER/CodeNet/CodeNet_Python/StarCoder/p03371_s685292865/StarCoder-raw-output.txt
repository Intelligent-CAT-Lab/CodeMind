The variables a, b, c, x and y are initialized to 1500, 2000, 1600, 3 and 2, respectively.
The list l is initialized to an empty list.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 10**7 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 10**7.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the value of the expression s and stores it in l.
The code then prints the minimum value of l, which is 1500.
<<<Output>>>
1500

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
n=int(input())
l=[]
for i in range(n):
    l.append(int(input()))
print(sum(l))
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5
1
2
3
4
5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable n is initialized to 5.
The list l is initialized to an empty list.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 4.
For each number i in this range, it reads a line of input and appends it to l.
The code then prints the sum of the elements of l, which is 15.
<<<Output>>>
15
