Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N is initialized to 12.
The code calculates the sum of the digits of N, which is 3.
The code checks if the remainder of the division of N by the sum of its digits is 0.
Since the remainder is 0, the code prints 'Yes'.
<<<Output>>>
Yes

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())
sum_Ndig = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_Ndig += i
print(sum_Ndig)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```12
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
