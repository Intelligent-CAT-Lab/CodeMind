The variable a, variable b and variable x are initialized to 180, 100 and 2400, respectively.
variable c is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code enters a while loop that iterates as long as x is greater than 0.
Inside the loop, the code checks if x is greater than 500. If it is, it adds a to c and subtracts 1000 from x.
If x is less than or equal to 500, it adds b to c and subtracts 500 from x.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of c, which is 1000.
<<<Output>>>
1000

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
a, b, x = map(int, input().split())
c = 0
while x > 0:
    if x > 500:
        c += a if a < 2*b else 2*b
        x-=1000
    else:
        c += b if b < a else a
        x-=500
print(c)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```180 100 2400
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
