The variable a, variable b and variable x are initialized to 180, 100 and 2400, respectively.
variable c is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code enters a while loop that iterates as long as x is greater than 0.
Inside the loop, the code checks if x is greater than 500. If it is, it adds a to c and subtracts 1000 from x.
If x is less than or equal to 500, it adds b to c and subtracts 500 from x.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of c, which is 1000.
