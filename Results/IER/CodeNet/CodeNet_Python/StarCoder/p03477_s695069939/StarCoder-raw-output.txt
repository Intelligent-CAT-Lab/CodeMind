Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variables a, b, c and d are initialized to 3, 8, 7 and 1, respectively.
The code checks if the sum of a and b is greater than the sum of c and d.
Since 3 + 8 > 7 + 1, the code prints 'Left'.
<<<Output>>>
Left

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
a, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())

if (a + b) > (c + d):
    print('Left')
elif (a + b) < (c + d):
    print('Right')
else:
    print('Balanced')

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 2 3 4
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The variables a, b, c and d are initialized to 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively.
The code checks if the sum of a and b is greater than the sum of c and d.
Since 1 + 2 < 3 + 4, the code prints 'Right'.
