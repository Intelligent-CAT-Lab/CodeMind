Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable num_year is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the number of years.
The variable t_maney is initialized to 100, which will be used to store the total money.
The variable x is initialized to 103, which is the input.
The code enters a while loop that continues until t_maney is greater than or equal to x.
Inside the loop, num_year is incremented by 1, and t_maney is updated to the next year's money.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of num_year, which is 3.
