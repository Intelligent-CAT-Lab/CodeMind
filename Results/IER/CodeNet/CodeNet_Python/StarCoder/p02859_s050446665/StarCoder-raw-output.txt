Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable n is initialized to 2.
The code then prints the square of n, which is 4.
<<<Output>>>
4

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
n = int(input())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,n+1):
    sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable n is initialized to 20.
The variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers from 1 to n.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20
