rint the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable x is initialized to 90.
The variable n is initialized to 1.
The code enters a loop that iterates until the condition 360 * n % x == 0 is met.
The condition is met when 360 * n % x == 0 is met, which is 360 * 1 % 90 == 0.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of n, which is 18.
