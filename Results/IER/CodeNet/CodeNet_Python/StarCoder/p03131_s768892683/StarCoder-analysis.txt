The variable K, variable A and variable B are initialized to 4, 2 and 6, respectively.
The code then checks if the difference between B and A is greater than or equal to 2.
If it is, it calculates the number of steps it takes to hit the target, which is 1.
The code then calculates the number of steps it takes to reach the target, which is 4-1=3.
The code then calculates the remainder of the division of the number of steps it takes to reach the target by 2, which is 3%2=1.
The code then calculates the number of swaps it takes to reach the target, which is (3-1)/2=1.
The code then calculates the number of biscuits it takes to reach the target, which is 1*(6-2)=4.
The code then calculates the number of biscuits it takes to reach the target, which is 4+1=5.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 5.
