Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable S is initialized to 'Sunny'.
The code checks if S is equal to 'Sunny'. If it is, it prints 'Cloudy'.
The code checks if S is equal to 'Cloudy'. If it is, it prints 'Rainy'.
The code checks if S is equal to 'Rainy'. If it is, it prints 'Sunny'.
The code does not check if S is equal to 'Rainy' first, because it is the last condition.
The code does not check if S is equal to 'Cloudy' first, because it is the second last condition.
The code does not check if S is equal to 'Sunny' first, because it is the third last condition.
The code prints 'Sunny' as the output.
