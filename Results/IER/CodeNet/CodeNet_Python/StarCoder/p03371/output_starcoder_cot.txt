Instruction: I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
For example:

Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
20 2 5
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
Consider the following code:

A,B,C,X,Y = map(int,input().split())

mi = min(X,Y)
a = A*X+B*Y
b = mi*C*2+A*(X-mi)+B*(Y-mi)
c = max(X,Y)*C*2

print(min(a,b,c))
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
1500 2000 1600 3 2

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variables A, B, C, X and Y are initialized to 1500, 2000, 1600, 3 and 2, respectively.
The variable mi is initialized to the minimum of X and Y, which is 2.
The variable a is initialized to A*X+B*Y, which is 1500*3+2000*2=6000.
The variable b is initialized to mi*C*2+A*(X-mi)+B*(Y-mi), which is 2*1600*2+1500*(3-2)+2000*(2-2)=10000.
The variable c is initialized to the maximum of X and Y, which is 3.
The code then prints the minimum of a, b and c, which is 10000.

The output of code execution is:
10000
