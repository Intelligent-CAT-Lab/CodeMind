The function solve is defined to take three arguments: n, d and x.
The variable ans is initialized to 0.
The code enters a while loop that continues as long as n is not 0.
The code adds d + (2 * n - 1) * x / 2 to ans.
The code then calculates d = ((n + 1) * d + 5 * x / 2) / n.
The code then calculates x *= (n + 2) / n.
The code then decrements n by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 1.0000000000.
