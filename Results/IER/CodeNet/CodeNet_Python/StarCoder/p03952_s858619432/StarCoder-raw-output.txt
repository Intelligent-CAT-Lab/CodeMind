The variable n, variable x are initialized to 4 and 4, respectively.
The code checks if x is equal to 1 or 2 * n - 1. If it is, it prints "No" and exits.
If n is equal to 2, it prints "Yes", then prints 1, then prints 2, then prints 3, and exits.
If x is equal to 2, it initializes the list y to [3, 2, 1, 4].
Otherwise, it initializes the list y to [x - 1, x, x + 1, x - 2].
The list ANS is initialized to an empty list.
The variable i is initialized to 1.
The code enters a while loop that iterates while i is less than 2 * n.
Inside the loop, it checks if i is in y. If it is, it increments i by 4.
If the length of ANS is equal to n - 3, it appends the list y to ANS.
If the length of ANS is equal to 2 * n - 1, it breaks out of the loop.
Otherwise, it appends i to ANS.
It then increments i by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints "Yes", then prints each element of ANS.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

for i in range(n):
    if a[i] == 0:
        a[i] = 1
    else:
        a[i] = 0

print(sum(a))
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5
