The variable n is initialized to 20.
The code enters a loop that iterates until the condition is met.
Inside the loop, the code initializes a variable prime_dc to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 2 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it checks if n is divisible by i. If it is not, it adds 1 to prime_dc.
The code checks if prime_dc is equal to n-2, which is 18 in this case. If it is, it breaks out of the loop.
The code increments n by 1, which is 21 in this case.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of n, which is 21.
<<<Output>>>
21

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
n = int(input())

while 1:
    prime_dc = 0
    for i in range(2,n):
        if n % i!= 0:
            prime_dc += 1
            
    if n-2 == prime_dc:
        break
    
    n += 1

print(n)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
