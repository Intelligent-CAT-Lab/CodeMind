Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 4, 2 and 9, respectively.
The code checks if N * A > B. Since 4 * 2 > 9, the code prints 9.
<<<Output>>>
9
[END-OF-RESPONSE]



TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())

if (N * A > B):
  print(B)
else:
  print(N*A)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4 2 10
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
