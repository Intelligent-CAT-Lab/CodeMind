Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable x is initialized to "Thank you for your mail and your lectures".
The variable A is initialized to a list of the words in x, which is ["Thank", "you", "for", "your", "mail", "and", "your", "lectures"].
The variable S is initialized to a list of the number of times each word in A appears, which is [1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2].
The variable L is initialized to a list of the length of each word in A, which is [5, 2, 3, 4, 4, 3, 4, 9].
The code then calculates the maximum value of S, which is 2.
The code then calculates the maximum value of L, which is 9.
The code then calculates the index of the first occurrence of the maximum value of S, which is 3.
The code then calculates the index of the first occurrence of the maximum value of L, which is 6.
The code then prints the words at the indices calculated in the previous steps, which are "mail" and "lectures".
<<<Output>>>
mail lectures
