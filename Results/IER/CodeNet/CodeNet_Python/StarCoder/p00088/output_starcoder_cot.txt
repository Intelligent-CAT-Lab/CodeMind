Instruction: I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
For example:

Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
20 2 5
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84

Consider the following code:

    }
d2 = {n: chr(n+ord('A')) for n in range(26)}
d2.update(zip(range(26, 32), ".,-'?"))

for line in stdin:
    stream = io.StringIO()
    stream.write(''.join(d1[c] for c in line.rstrip('\r\n')))
    stream.seek(0)
    c = stream.read(5)
    while c:
        print(d2[int(c.ljust(5, '0'), 2)], end='')
        c = stream.read(5)
    print()
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
PETER POTTER

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The code reads the input line by line and converts each character to its binary representation.
The binary representation is padded with zeros to the left to make its length equal to 5.
The binary representation is then converted to an integer and looked up in the dictionary d2.
The corresponding character is printed.
The output of code execution is:
P E T E R P O T T E R
