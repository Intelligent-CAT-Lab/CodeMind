The variable MOD is initialized to 1000000007.
The variable H, W, A and variable B are initialized to 2, 3, 1 and 1, respectively.
The code checks if H - A > W - B. If it is, it swaps H and W, and A and B.
The code then initializes the list ans1 with 1.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to H - A - 1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 0.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the value of ans1[i + 1] and stores it in c.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to W - H + A - B (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 1.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the value of c * (W - B - 1 + A - i) * pow(i + 1, MOD - 2, MOD) and stores it in c.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to H - A - 1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 0.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the value of c * (H - 1 - i) * pow(W - H + A - B + 1 + i, MOD - 2, MOD) and stores it in c.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to H - A - 1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 0.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the value of ans + c * ans1[i + 1] and stores it in ans.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 1.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
MOD = 1000000007
N, K = map(int, input().split())
ans = 1
for i in range(1, N + 1):
    ans = (ans * i) % MOD
for i in range(1, K + 1):
    ans = (ans * pow(i, MOD - 2, MOD)) % MOD
print(ans)
