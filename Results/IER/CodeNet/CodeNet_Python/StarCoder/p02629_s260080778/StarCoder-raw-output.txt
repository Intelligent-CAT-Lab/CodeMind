The variable N is initialized to 2.
The function num2alpha is defined to convert a number to its corresponding alphabetic representation.
The function num2alpha first checks if the number is less than or equal to 26. If it is, it returns the corresponding alphabetic character.
If the number is greater than 26, it calculates the quotient and remainder of the division of the number by 26.
The function num2alpha then recursively calls itself to convert the quotient to its corresponding alphabetic representation and appends the corresponding alphabetic character of the remainder to the end of the string.
The function num2alpha returns the string after it finishes processing the input.
The code then prints the final value of the string, which is "b".
<<<Output>>>
b

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())
def num2alpha(num):
    if num<=26:
        return chr(64+num)
    elif num%26==0:
        return num2alpha(num//26-1)+chr(90)
    else:
        return num2alpha(num//26)+chr(64+num%26)
print(num2alpha(N).lower())
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```27
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
