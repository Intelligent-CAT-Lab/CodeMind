Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The code first reads the input and stores it in variables A, B, C and D.
The code then checks if A*B is greater than C*D. If it is, it prints A*B. Otherwise, it prints C*D.
The code prints 15, which is the answer.
<<<Output>>>

        if i % 2 == 0:
            print(i, end=' ')

if '__main__' == __name__:
    resolve()
