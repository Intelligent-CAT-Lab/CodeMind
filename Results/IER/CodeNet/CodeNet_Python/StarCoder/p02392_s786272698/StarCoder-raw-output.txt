Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The code reads the input line and splits it into three variables: a, b and c.
The code then checks if a is less than b and b is less than c.
If the condition is met, the code prints 'Yes'.
If the condition is not met, the code prints 'No'.
<<<Output>>>
Yes

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(raw_input())

for i in range(1,N+1):
    if i%2 == 0:
        print i
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The code reads the input line and stores it in variable N.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 10.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is even.
If it is, it prints the current number i.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 2,4,6,8,10.
<<<Output>>>
2
4
6
8
10
