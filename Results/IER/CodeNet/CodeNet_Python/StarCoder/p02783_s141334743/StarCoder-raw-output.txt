The variable H, variable A are initialized to 10 and 4, respectively.
The code checks if A is equal to 0. If it is, it prints 0 and ends.
The code then calculates the integer part of H/A. This is b.
The code checks if H/A is greater than b. If it is, it prints b+1, which is 5.
If H/A is not greater than b, it prints b, which is 4.
<<<Output>>>
5
