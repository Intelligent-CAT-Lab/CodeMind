Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable a is initialized to the input string "7 6 -1 1 -1 9 2 3 4".
The variable b is initialized to the set of strings "1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8","9".
The variable n is initialized to an empty list.
The variable c is initialized to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 8 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 8.
For each number i in this range, it checks if a[i] is in b. If it is, it removes a[i] from b. If it is not, it appends i to n.
The code then enters a nested loop that iterates over all possible permutations of b.
For each permutation, it iterates over n, which is an empty list in this case.
For each number j in this range, it assigns i-th element of permutation to a[n[j]].
The code then checks if the sum of the first 3 digits is equal to the sum of the last 3 digits. If it is, it increments c.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of c, which is 1.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import itertools
a = input().split()
b = set(map(str,range(1,10)))
n, c = [], 0
for i in range(9):
    if a[i] in b:b.remove(a[i])
    else:n.append(i)
for i in itertools.permutations(tuple(b)):
