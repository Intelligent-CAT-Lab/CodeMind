The code first reads the input and splits it into a list of strings.
The code then uses itertools.product to generate all possible combinations of operators.
For each combination, it concatenates the first string with the operators and the second string, and passes the result to the function check.
The function check first checks if the string contains any of the following characters: '(', ')', '+', '-', '*', '++', '+-', '-+', '--', '**', '*+', '*-'. If it does, it returns False.
If the string does not contain any of the above characters, it checks if the string is a valid expression. If it is, it returns the result of the expression. Otherwise, it returns -99999999.
The code then finds the maximum value of the results of the check function and prints it.
