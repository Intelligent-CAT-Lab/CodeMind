The variables a, b, c, d are initialized to 4, 9, 2 and 3, respectively.
The function gcd is defined to calculate the greatest common divisor of two numbers.
The function gcd_ is defined to calculate the greatest common divisor of c and d.
The variable cc is defined to calculate the product of c and d after dividing them by their greatest common divisor gcd_.
The variables mm1, mm2 and mmc are defined to calculate the quotients of b, c and d after dividing them by c and d, respectively.
The variables A1 and A2 are defined to calculate the difference between b and a after subtracting the sum of the quotients mm1, mm2 and mmc from b, respectively.
The code then prints the final value of A1 - A2, which is 1.
