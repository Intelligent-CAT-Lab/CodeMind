Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The code first reads the input string t.
The variable n is initialized to the length of t.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider all characters in t.
For each character i in t, it checks if i is '?', and if so, it appends 'D' to the list ans.
Otherwise, it appends i to the list ans.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is ['P', 'D', 'D', 'P', 'P', 'D', '?', 'D', '?', '?', 'P'].
