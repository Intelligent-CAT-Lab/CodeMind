Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable x is initialized to 7.
The variable s is initialized to x//11, which is 0.
The variable cnt is initialized to s*2, which is 0.
The variable x is subtracted by s*11, which is 0.
The code checks if x is equal to 0. If it is, the code does nothing.
The code checks if x is less than or equal to 6. If it is, the code adds 1 to cnt.
The code checks if x is less than 11. If it is, the code adds 2 to cnt.
The code checks if x is greater than or equal to 11. If it is, the code prints 'error'.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of cnt, which is 2.
