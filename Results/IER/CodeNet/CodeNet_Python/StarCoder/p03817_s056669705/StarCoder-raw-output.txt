The variable x is initialized to 7.
The variable s is initialized to x//11, which is 0.
The variable cnt is initialized to s*2, which is 0.
The variable x is subtracted by s*11, which is 0.
The code checks if x is equal to 0. If it is, the code does nothing.
The code checks if x is less than or equal to 6. If it is, the code adds 1 to cnt.
The code checks if x is less than 11. If it is, the code adds 2 to cnt.
The code checks if x is greater than or equal to 11. If it is, the code prints 'error'.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of cnt, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())

sum_1 = 0

for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if sum_order % 3 == 0:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```100
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
