Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable n, variable m are initialized to 3 and 9, respectively.
mod1 and mod2 are initialized to 10**9+7 and 998244353, respectively.
mod is initialized to mod1.
ans is initialized to (m+1)%mod, which is 1000000008.
The code then checks if n is equal to 1. If it is, the code prints the answer and ends.
If n is not equal to 1, the code calculates a.
ans is then updated to ((m+1)*(a+1)+(m+1)*a-(n-1)*a*(a+1))%mod, which is 1000000008.
The code then prints the final value of ans, which is 1000000008.
