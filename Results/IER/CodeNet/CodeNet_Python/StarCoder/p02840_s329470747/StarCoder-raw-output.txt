The variable N, variable X and variable D are initialized to 3, 4 and 2, respectively.
The code checks if D is less than 0. If it is, it swaps X and D.
The code checks if D is equal to 0. If it is, it prints the number of distinct values of X*i for i from 0 to N.
The code checks if D is greater than 0. If it is, it initializes the variable ans to 0.
The code initializes a dictionary Mode to store the values of X*i % D for i from 0 to N.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 2.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the values of L and R, which are the left and right boundaries of the range of values of X*i % D that are within the range [L, R].
The code then adds the number of distinct values of X*i % D that are within the range [L, R] to ans.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, M = map(int, input().split())

if N == 1:
    print(M)
    exit()

if M == 1:
    print(N)
    exit()

if N == 2:
    print(M+1)
    exit()

if M == 2:
    print(N+1)
    exit()

if N == 3:
    print(M+2)
    exit
