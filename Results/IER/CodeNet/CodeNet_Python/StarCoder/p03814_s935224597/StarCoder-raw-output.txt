The variable S is initialized to "QWERTYASDFZXCV".
The function AtoZ is called with the argument S.
The function AtoZ first iterates through the string S from the beginning to the end, and stops when it encounters the first character "A".
The function AtoZ then iterates through the string S from the end to the beginning, and stops when it encounters the first character "Z".
The function AtoZ returns the difference between the two indices, which is 10.
The code then prints the final value of ans, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())

def is_prime(n):
    if n == 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2,n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

ans = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    if is_prime(i):
        ans += i
print(ans)

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```100
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N is initialized to 100.
The function is_prime is called with the argument 100.
The function is_prime first checks if the argument is 1, which it is not.
The function is_prime then iterates through the range
