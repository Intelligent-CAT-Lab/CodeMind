Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The code first reads the input and stores it in a list s.
The code then calculates the length of the list s and stores it in variable n.
The code then initializes two variables, l and r, to 0 and n-1, respectively.
The code then enters a while loop that runs until l < r.
Inside the loop, the code checks if s[l] is equal to "x" or s[r] is equal to "x".
If both are true, the code increments l by 1 and decrements r by 1.
If s[l] is equal to "x" and s[r] is not equal to "x", the code increments l by 1 and adds 1 to the variable ans.
If s[l] is not equal to "x" and s[r] is equal to "x", the code decrements r by 1 and adds 1 to the variable ans.
If both are false, the code checks if s[l] is equal to s[r].
If they are, the code increments l by 1 and decrements r by 1.
If they are not, the code prints -1 and exits the program.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 2.
