rint the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable s is initialized to 'aabbaa', which is the input.
The variable t is initialized to '', which will be used to store the current substring.
The variable k is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of substrings.
The variable prev is initialized to '', which will be used to store the previous substring.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to the length of s (inclusive), meaning it will consider all characters in s.
For each character i in this range, it adds it to t.
The code checks if t is different from prev. If it is, it adds 1 to k and updates prev to t.
The code then resets t to '', which is necessary to avoid counting the same substring twice.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of k, which is 3.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
s = input()
t = ''
k = 0
prev = ''
for i in range(len(s)):
  t += s[i]
  if prev!= t:
    k += 1
    prev = t
    t = ''
print(k)

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```aaabbb
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
