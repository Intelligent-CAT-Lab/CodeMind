Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable r is initialized to 2.
The function mennseki is called with the argument r.
The function mennseki calculates the area of a circle with radius r and returns the result.
The function ennsyuu is called with the argument r.
The function ennsyuu calculates the circumference of a circle with radius r and returns the result.
The code then prints the results of the two function calls, which are 12.566370614359172 and 12.566370614359172.
<<<Output>>>
12.566370614359172 12.566370614359172

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import math


def mennseki(r):
    S = r ** 2 * math.pi
    return S


def ennsyuu(r):
    R = 2 * r * math.pi
    return R


r = float(input())
print(mennseki(r), ennsyuu(r))


</Code>
