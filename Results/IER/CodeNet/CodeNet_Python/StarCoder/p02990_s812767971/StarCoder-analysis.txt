The variable n is initialized to 5, and variable k is initialized to 3.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to k-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 2.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the value of nCr(k-1,i) and stores it in ans.
The code checks if i+1 is greater than n-k+1, which is 3-1+1=3. If it is, it sets ans to 0.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 10.
