Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable s is initialized to "3 9".
The code splits s into two variables n and m.
The code converts n to an integer and stores it in n.
The code converts m to an integer and stores it in m.
The code checks if n is equal to 1. If it is, it prints the remainder of (m+1) divided by 1000000007.
Otherwise, the code calculates d, which is the quotient of m divided by (n-1).
The code calculates A, which is m minus d times (n-1) plus 1.
The code calculates B, which is m minus (n-1) plus 1.
The code calculates ans, which is (A+B) times d plus (m+1).
The code prints the final value of ans, which is 1000000007.
