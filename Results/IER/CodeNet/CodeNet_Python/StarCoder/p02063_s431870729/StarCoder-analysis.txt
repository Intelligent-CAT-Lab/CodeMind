The function inpl() reads the input and returns a list of integers.
The variables A and B are initialized to 4 and 6, respectively.
The function calca() calculates the sum of digits of a number.
The variable X is initialized to -(-B//A)*A, which is -(-6//4)*4, which is -(-1)*4, which is -4.
The variable Y is initialized to calca(X - X//B*B) + X//B, which is calca(-4 - (-4//6)*6) + (-4//6), which is calca(-4 - (-1)*6) + (-4//6), which is calca(-4 - -4) + (-4//6), which is calca(-4 - 0) + (-4//6), which is calca(-4) + (-4//6), which is calca(-1) + (-4//6), which is -1.
The code checks if -(-B//A) < Y, which is -(-1) < -1, which is False.
The code prints -1.
