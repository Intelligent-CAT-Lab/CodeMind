Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable n is initialized to 12.
The code calculates the sum of the digits of n, which is 3.
The code checks if n is divisible by s_n, which is 3. Since 12 is divisible by 3, the code prints "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
n = int(input())

s_n = sum([int(i) for i in list(str(n))])

if n % s_n == 0:
    print("Yes")
else:
    print("No")

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```13
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable n is initialized to 13.
The code calculates the sum of the digits of n, which is 4.
The code checks if n is divisible by s_n, which is 4. Since 13 is not divisible by 4, the code prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
