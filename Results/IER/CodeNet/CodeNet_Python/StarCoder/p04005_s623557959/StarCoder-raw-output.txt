Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variables A, B and C are initialized to 3, 3 and 3, respectively.
The code checks if any of the variables is even. If it is, it prints 0 and ends.
If none of the variables is even, it calculates the product of the variables and stores it in AB, BC and CA.
The code then prints the minimum of the variables AB, BC and CA, which is 27.
<<<Output>>>
27

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import sys
input = sys.stdin.readline

N = int(input())

for i in range(1,N+1):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        print(i, end=' ')

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N is initialized to 10.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 10.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is even. If it is, it prints i and a space.
The code prints 2 4 6 8 10, which is the desired output.
<<<Output>>>
2 4 6 8 10
