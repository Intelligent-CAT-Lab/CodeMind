Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variables A, B and C are initialized to 3, 3 and 3, respectively.
The code checks if any of the variables is even. If it is, it prints 0 and ends.
If none of the variables is even, it calculates the product of the variables and stores it in AB, BC and CA.
The code then prints the minimum of the variables AB, BC and CA, which is 27.
