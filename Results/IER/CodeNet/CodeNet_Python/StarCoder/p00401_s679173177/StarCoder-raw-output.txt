The variable n is initialized to 54.
The code enters a while loop that continues as long as n is greater than 1.
The code shifts n to the right by 1 bit, which is equivalent to dividing n by 2.
The code increments c by 1.
The code exits the loop when n becomes 1.
The code prints the final value of c, which is 6.
<<<Output>>>
6

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
n = int(input())
c = 0
while n > 1 :
    n = n >> 1
    c = c + 1
print( 1<<c )


</Code>
