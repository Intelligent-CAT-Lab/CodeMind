Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The code first reads the input and stores it in a list s.
The variable f is initialized to 0.
The variable ans is initialized to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the list s.
For each element k in the list s, it calculates the number of consecutive elements k in the list s.
The code then checks if k is ">". If it is, it calculates the number of elements in the group of k and stores it in d.
The code then checks if f is greater than d. If it is, it adds the number of elements in the group of k to ans.
If f is not greater than d, it adds -1*f to ans.
The code then sets f to d.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 2.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>

def main():
  from itertools import groupby

  s = list(input())
  f = 0
  ans = 0

  for k,v in groupby(s):
    d = len(tuple(v))
    left = d if k==">" else 0
    right = d if k=="<" else 0
    if f>left:
      ans += d*(d+1)//2 - left
    else:
      ans += -1*f + d*(d+1)//2  
    f = right 

  print(ans) 

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```<<>><>
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input.
