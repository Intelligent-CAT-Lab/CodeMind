Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The code first reads the input and stores it in a list s.
The variable f is initialized to 0.
The variable ans is initialized to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the list s.
For each element k in the list s, it calculates the number of consecutive elements k in the list s.
The code then checks if k is ">". If it is, it calculates the number of elements in the group of k and stores it in d.
The code then checks if f is greater than d. If it is, it adds the number of elements in the group of k to ans.
If f is not greater than d, it adds -1*f to ans.
The code then sets f to d.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 2.
