Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable s is initialized to the string "oxo".
The variable ans is initialized to 700, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the characters in the string s.
For each character i in this range, it checks if i is equal to 'o'. If it is, it adds 100 to ans. The condition is met when i is 'o'.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 800.
<<<Output>>>
800
[END-OF-RESPONSE]



TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
# A
s = str(input())

ans = 0
for i in list(s):
    if i == 'o':
        ans += 100
print(ans)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```oxo
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
