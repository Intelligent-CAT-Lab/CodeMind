The variable s is initialized to the string "oxo".
The variable ans is initialized to 700, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the characters in the string s.
For each character i in this range, it checks if i is equal to 'o'. If it is, it adds 100 to ans. The condition is met when i is 'o'.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 800.
