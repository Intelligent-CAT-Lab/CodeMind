Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable S is initialized to 'abc'.
The code checks if the length of S is equal to 3. If it is, it prints the reversed string S[::-1].
If the length of S is not equal to 3, it prints the original string S.
<<<Output>>>
abc

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
S = input()
if S[0] == 'a':
    print(S[1:])
else:
    print(S)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```abc
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable S is initialized to 'abc'.
The code checks if the first character of S is equal to 'a'. If it is, it prints the string S[1:].
If the first character of S is not equal to 'a', it prints the original string S.
<<<Output>>>
bc
