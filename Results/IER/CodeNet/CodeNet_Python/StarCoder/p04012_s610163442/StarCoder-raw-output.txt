rint the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable w is initialized to 'abaccaba'.
The variable d is initialized to a defaultdict with default value 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the characters in w.
For each character key in this range, it adds 1 to the value of d[key].
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the values in d.
For each value value in this range, it checks if value is odd.
If it is, it prints 'No' and exits the program.
If the loop finishes without printing 'No', it prints 'Yes'.
<<<Output>>>
Yes

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())

for i in range(1,N+1):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        print(i, end=' ')

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N is initialized to 10.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 10.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is even.
If it is, it prints i and a space.
The loop finishes after 10 iterations, so the code prints 2 4 6 8 10.
<<<Output>>>
2 4 6 8 10
