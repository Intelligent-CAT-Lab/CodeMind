rint the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable w is initialized to 'abaccaba'.
The variable d is initialized to a defaultdict with default value 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the characters in w.
For each character key in this range, it adds 1 to the value of d[key].
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the values in d.
For each value value in this range, it checks if value is odd.
If it is, it prints 'No' and exits the program.
If the loop finishes without printing 'No', it prints 'Yes'.
