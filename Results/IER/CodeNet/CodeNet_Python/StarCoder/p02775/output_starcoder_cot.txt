Instruction: I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
For example:

Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
20 2 5
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
Consider the following code:

def main():
    n = list(map(int, input()[::-1])) + [0]
    s = 0
    res = 0
    for i, ni in enumerate(n[:-1]):
        k = ni + s
        if k < 5 or (k == 5 and int(n[i + 1]) < 5):
            res += k
            s = 0
        else:
            res += 10 - k
            s = 1
    res += s
    print(res)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
36

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The code first reads the input and stores it in a list n. The list n is [3, 6, 0].
The code then initializes a variable s to 0.
The code enters a loop that iterates over the list n. The loop starts with i = 0 and ni = 3.
The code calculates the value of k = ni + s, which is 3 + 0 = 3.
The code checks if k is less than 5 or if k is equal to 5 and n[i + 1] is less than 5.
The condition is met when k is 3 and n[i + 1] is 0.
The code adds k to the variable res, which is 3 + 0 = 3.
The code then sets s to 0.
The code then increments i to 1, which makes ni = 6.
The code calculates the value of k = ni + s, which is 6 + 0 = 6.
The code checks if k is less than 5 or if k is equal to 5 and n[i + 1] is less than 5.
The condition is met when k is 6 and n[i + 1] is 0.
The code adds k to the variable res, which is 3 + 6 = 9.
The code then sets s to 0.
The code then increments i to 2, which makes ni = 0.
The code calculates the value of k = ni + s, which is 0 + 0 = 0.
The code checks if k is less than 5 or if k is equal to 5 and n[i + 1] is less than 5.
The condition is met when k is 0 and n[i + 1] is
