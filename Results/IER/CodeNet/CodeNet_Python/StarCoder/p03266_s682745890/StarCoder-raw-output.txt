Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N, variable K are initialized to 3 and 2, respectively.
variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then calculates the value of a, which is 1.
The code then adds a cubed value of a to ans, which is 1.
The code then checks if K is even or odd.
If K is even, the code calculates the value of b, which is 1.
The code then adds a cubed value of b to ans, which is 1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N,K=map(int,input().split())
ans=0
a=int(N/K)
ans+=a**3
if K%2==0:
 b=int((N+int(K/2))/K)
 ans+=b**3
print(ans)

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 3
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
