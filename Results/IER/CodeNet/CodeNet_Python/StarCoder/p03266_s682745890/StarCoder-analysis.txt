Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N, variable K are initialized to 3 and 2, respectively.
variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then calculates the value of a, which is 1.
The code then adds a cubed value of a to ans, which is 1.
The code then checks if K is even or odd.
If K is even, the code calculates the value of b, which is 1.
The code then adds a cubed value of b to ans, which is 1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 2.
