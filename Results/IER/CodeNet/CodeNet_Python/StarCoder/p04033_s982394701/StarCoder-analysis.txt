Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The code first reads the input and stores it in variables a and b.
The code then checks if a and b are both positive or both negative.
If they are both positive, the code prints "Positive" and ends.
If they are both negative, the code checks if the absolute difference between them is even.
If it is, the code prints "Negative" and ends.
If it is not, the code prints "Positive" and ends.
