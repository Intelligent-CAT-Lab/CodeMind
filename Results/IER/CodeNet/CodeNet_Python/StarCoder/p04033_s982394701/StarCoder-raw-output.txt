Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The code first reads the input and stores it in variables a and b.
The code then checks if a and b are both positive or both negative.
If they are both positive, the code prints "Positive" and ends.
If they are both negative, the code checks if the absolute difference between them is even.
If it is, the code prints "Negative" and ends.
If it is not, the code prints "Positive" and ends.
<<<Output>>>
Positive
[END-OF-RESPONSE]



TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import sys
input=sys.stdin.readline

def main():
    a,b = map(int,input().split())
    if a<=0 and 0<=b:
        print("Zero")
        return
    elif a<0 and b<0:
        if (b-a)%2 == 0:
            print("Negative")
            return
    print("Positive")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```-1 3
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
