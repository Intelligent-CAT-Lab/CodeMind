Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable A and variable B are initialized to 2 and 16, respectively.
The code checks if the sum of A and B is even. If it is, it prints the integer division of the sum by 2. If it is not, it prints 'IMPOSSIBLE'.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N,K=map(int,input().split())
if N%K==0:
	print(N//K)
else:
	print(N//K+1)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10 3```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N and variable K are initialized to 10 and 3, respectively.
The code checks if N is divisible by K. If it is, it prints the integer division of N by K. If it is not, it prints the integer division of N by K plus 1.
