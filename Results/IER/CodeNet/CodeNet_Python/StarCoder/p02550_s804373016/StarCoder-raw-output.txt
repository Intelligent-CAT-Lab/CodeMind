The variable N, variable X and variable M are initialized to 6, 2 and 1001, respectively.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to N-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 5.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the square of X and stores it in X.
The code checks if X is in the list List. If it is, it breaks the loop and stores the current number i in num. It also stores the index of X in the list List in key.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of num, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N,M = map(int,input().split())

List = []

for i in range(N):
    List.append(int(input()))

List.sort()

ans = 0

for i in range(N):
    if List[i] % M == 0:
