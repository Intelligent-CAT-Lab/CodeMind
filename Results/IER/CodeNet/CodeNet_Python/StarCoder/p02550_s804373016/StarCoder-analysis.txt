The variable N, variable X and variable M are initialized to 6, 2 and 1001, respectively.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to N-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 5.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the square of X and stores it in X.
The code checks if X is in the list List. If it is, it breaks the loop and stores the current number i in num. It also stores the index of X in the list List in key.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of num, which is 3.
