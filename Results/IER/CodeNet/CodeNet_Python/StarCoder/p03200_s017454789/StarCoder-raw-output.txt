Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable s is initialized to "BBW", which is the input.
The variables a and b are initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of the number of black and white tiles.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the characters in s.
For each character x in s, it adds b to a if x is "W", and it adds 1 to b if x is "B".
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of a, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())
a = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    if i%3 == 0 or i%5 == 0:
        a += i
print(a)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```100
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print
