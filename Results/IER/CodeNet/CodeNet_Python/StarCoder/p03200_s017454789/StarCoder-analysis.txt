Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable s is initialized to "BBW", which is the input.
The variables a and b are initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of the number of black and white tiles.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the characters in s.
For each character x in s, it adds b to a if x is "W", and it adds 1 to b if x is "B".
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of a, which is 3.
