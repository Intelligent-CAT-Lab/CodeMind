The variable h and variable w are initialized to 3 and 5, respectively.
The code checks if h or w is divisible by 3. If it is, it prints 0 and quits.
The code then enters a function that calculates the minimum possible area of a rectangle with the given height and width.
The function first calculates the area of the rectangle with the given height and width.
Then it calculates the area of the rectangle with the given width and height.
The function then returns the minimum of these two areas.
The code then calls the function twice, once with the given height and width, and once with the given width and height.
The code then prints the minimum of the two areas returned by the function calls.
