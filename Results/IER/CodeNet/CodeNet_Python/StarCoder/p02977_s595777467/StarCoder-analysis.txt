Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N is initialized to 3.
The code checks if N is a power of 2.
If it is, it prints "No" and ends the program.
If it is not, it prints "Yes" and then proceeds to print the output.
The code first calculates the value of k, which is 1.
Then it enters a loop that iterates from 1 to k (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 1.
For each number i in this range, it prints the numbers 2i, 2i+1, 2i+N, 2i+1+N, 1+N, 2.
The code then prints the numbers 1+N, 2.
The code then prints the numbers N, a+N, 2*N, b.
