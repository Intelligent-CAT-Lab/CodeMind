The variable S is initialized to 125.
The variable I_MAX is initialized to the length of S, which is 4.
The variable values is initialized to an empty list.
The function calc is defined to calculate the sum of all possible combinations of the digits of S.
The function solve is defined to call calc with the initial values of val, add and i.
The code then calls solve.
The function calc is called with the initial values of val, add and i.
The function calc is called with the values of val, 10*add+int(S[i]), i+1.
The function calc is called with the values of val, add, i+1.
After the function calls, the code prints the sum of the values list, which is 125.
