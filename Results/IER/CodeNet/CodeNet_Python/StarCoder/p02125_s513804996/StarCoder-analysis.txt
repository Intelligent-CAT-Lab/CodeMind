Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable n is initialized to 2.
The variable ans is initialized to 0.
The variable tmp is initialized to 1.
The code enters a while loop that continues as long as tmp is less than or equal to n+1.
Inside the loop, tmp is multiplied by 2, which results in tmp becoming 4.
The code increments ans by 1, which results in ans becoming 1.
The code exits the loop and prints the final value of ans, which is 1.
