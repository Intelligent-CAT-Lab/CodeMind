int the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable S is initialized to "serval".
The code then initializes a list alphabet that contains all the lowercase letters of the English alphabet.
The code then initializes a variable ans that is initialized to 10**9, which is the maximum possible value.
The code then initializes a set hoge that contains all the characters in S.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over all the characters in alphabet.
For each character, the code checks if it is in hoge. If it is not, the code skips the current iteration and goes to the next character.
If it is in hoge, the code initializes a variable tmp that is initialized to 0.
The code then initializes a copy of S in a list copy_s.
The code then enters a while loop that iterates until the set of copy_s is equal to the set of character.
In the while loop, the code initializes a list copy_s_dash that is initialized to an empty list.
The code then enters a for loop that iterates over all the elements of copy_s.
For each element i in this range, the code checks if copy_s[i] is equal to character or copy_s[i+1] is equal to character. If it is, the code appends character to copy_s_dash. Otherwise, the code appends "?" to copy_s_dash.
The code then updates copy_s to be equal to copy_s_dash.
The code then updates ans to be the minimum of ans and the length of S minus the length of copy_s.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 3.
