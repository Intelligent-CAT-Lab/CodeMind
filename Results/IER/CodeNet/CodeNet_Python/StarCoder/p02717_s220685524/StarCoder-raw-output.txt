TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b,c = map(int, input().strip().split())
print(a+b+c)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 2 3
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The code reads the input and assigns the values to variables a, b and c.
The code then prints the sum of the values of variables a, b and c.
