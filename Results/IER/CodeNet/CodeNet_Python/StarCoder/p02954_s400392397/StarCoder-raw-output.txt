Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable s is initialized to 'RRLRLR'.
The variable l is initialized to 6.
The variable ans is initialized to [0,0,0,0,0,0].
The variable rcnt is initialized to 0.
The variable lcnt is initialized to 0.
The variable rpos is initialized to 0.
The variable lpos is initialized to 0.
The variable flag is initialized to 0.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to l-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider all the positions of the string.
The code checks if the current position is 'R'. If it is, it increments rcnt by 1 and rpos by the current position.
The code checks if the current position is 'L'. If it is, it increments lcnt by 1 and lpos by the current position.
The code checks if flag is 1. If it is, it means that the string is 'RL' and the code needs to calculate the answer.
The code checks if rcnt is even. If it is, it means that the number of 'R' is even and the code needs to calculate the answer.
The code checks if lcnt is even. If it is, it means that the number of 'L' is even and the code needs to calculate the answer.
The code checks if rcnt is odd. If it is, it means that the number of 'R' is odd and the code needs to calculate the answer.
The code checks if lcnt is odd. If it is, it means that the number of 'L' is odd and the code needs to calculate the answer.
The code then prints the final value of ans, which is [1,1,1,1,1,1].

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, M = map(int, input().split())
ans = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    for j in range(1,M+1):
        if i%2==0 and j%2==0:
            ans += 1
        elif i%2==1 and j%2==1:
            ans += 1
print(ans)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 3```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N is initialized to 3.
The variable M is initialized to 3.
The variable ans is initialized to 0.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 3.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to M (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 3.
The code checks if i is even. If it is, it means that the number i is even and the code needs to calculate the answer.
The code checks if j is even. If it is, it means that the number j is even and the code needs to calculate the answer.
The code then adds 1 to ans.
The code then prints the final value of ans, which is 6.
<<<Output>>>
6
