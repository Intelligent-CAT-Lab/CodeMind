The variable w, variable h, variable x and variable y are initialized to 2, 3, 1 and 2, respectively.
The code calculates the area of the rectangle and stores it in the variable ans.
The code checks if the point (x,y) is the center of the rectangle. If it is, it prints the area of the rectangle and 1, otherwise it prints the area of the rectangle and 0.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import sys
read = sys.stdin.buffer.read
readline = sys.stdin.buffer.readline
readlines = sys.stdin.buffer.readlines

n = int(readline())
a = list(map(int, readline().split()))

a.sort()

if a[0] == a[1] == a[2]:
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3
1 1 1
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable n is initialized to 3.
The variable a is initialized to [1, 1, 1].
The code sorts the list a in ascending order.
The code checks if the first three elements of the list a are equal. If they are, it prints YES, otherwise it prints NO.
<<<Output>>>
YES
