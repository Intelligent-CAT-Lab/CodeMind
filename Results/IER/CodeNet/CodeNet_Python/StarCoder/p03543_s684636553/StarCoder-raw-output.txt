Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable n is initialized to 1118.
The code checks if the first three digits are equal, which is true.
The code checks if the fourth and fifth digits are equal, which is false.
The code prints "No" because the condition is not met.
<<<Output>>>
No
[END-OF-RESPONSE]



TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
n=input()

if n[0]==n[1]==n[2] or n[3]==n[1]==n[2]:
  print("Yes")
else:
  print("No")
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1111
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
