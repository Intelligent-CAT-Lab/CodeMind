The variable n is initialized to 2.
The variables a, b, c and p are initialized to 1, 1, 2 and 1, respectively.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n-2 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 1.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the value of p by adding a-1 to it.
Then it assigns the values of b, c and p to the values of c, a, b and p, respectively.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of c, which is 1.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
n=int(input());a,b,c,p=1,1,n,n-1
for i in range(n-1):
 p+=a-1;a,b,c=b,c,((n-1)**2+p+c)%(10**9+7)
print(c)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
