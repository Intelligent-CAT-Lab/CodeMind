Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable n is initialized to 2.
The variables a, b, c and p are initialized to 1, 1, 2 and 1, respectively.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n-2 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 1.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the value of p by adding a-1 to it.
Then it assigns the values of b, c and p to the values of c, a, b and p, respectively.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of c, which is 1.
