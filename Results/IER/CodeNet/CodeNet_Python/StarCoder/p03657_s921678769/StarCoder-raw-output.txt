Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable A and variable B are initialized to 4 and 5, respectively.
The code checks if A or B is divisible by 3. If it is, it prints "Possible".
If neither A nor B is divisible by 3, the code checks if the sum of A and B is divisible by 3. If it is, it prints "Possible".
If neither A nor B is divisible by 3 and the sum of A and B is not divisible by 3, it prints "Impossible".
<<<Output>>>
