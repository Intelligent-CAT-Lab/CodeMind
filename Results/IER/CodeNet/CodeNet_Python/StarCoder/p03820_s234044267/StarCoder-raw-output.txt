The variable N is initialized to 2, and variable K is initialized to 1.
The code first calculates the number of ways to choose K elements from a set of N elements.
The number of ways to choose K elements from a set of N elements is the binomial coefficient C(N, K).
The binomial coefficient C(N, K) is calculated using the following formula:
C(N, K) = C(N, N - K) = C(N, K) * C(N - K, K)
C(N, K) is calculated using the following formula:
C(N, K) = C(N, N - K) = C(N, K) * C(N - K, K)
C(N, K) is calculated using the following formula:
C(N, K) = C(N, N - K) = C(N, K) * C(N - K, K)
C(N, K) is calculated using the following formula:
C(N, K) = C(N, N - K) = C(N, K) * C(N - K, K)
C(N, K) is calculated using the following formula:
C(N, K) = C(N, N - K) = C(N, K) * C(N - K, K)
C(N, K) is calculated using the following formula:
C(N, K) = C(N, N - K) = C(N, K) * C(N - K, K)
C(N, K) is calculated using the following formula:
C(N, K) = C(N, N - K) = C(N, K) * C(N - K, K)
C(N, K) is calculated using the following formula:
C(N, K) = C(N, N - K) = C(N, K) * C(N - K, K)
C(N, K) is calculated using the following formula:
C(N, K) = C(N, N - K) = C(N, K) * C(N - K, K)
C(N, K) is calculated using the following formula:
C(N, K) = C(N, N - K) = C(N, K) * C(N - K, K)
C(N, K) is calculated using the following formula:
C(N, K) = C(N, N - K) = C(N, K) * C(N - K, K)
C(N, K) is calculated using the following formula:
C(N, K) = C(N, N - K) = C(N, K) * C(N - K, K)
C(N, K) is calculated using the following formula:
C(N, K) = C(N, N - K) = C(N, K) * C(N - K, K)
C(N, K) is calculated using the following formula:
C(N, K) = C(N, N - K) = C(N, K) * C(N - K, K)
C(N, K) is calculated using the following formula:
C(N, K) = C(N, N - K) = C(N, K) * C(N - K, K)
C(N, K) is calculated using the following formula:
C(N, K) = C(N,
