Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The code first reads the input and stores it in variables a and b.
The code then calculates the sum of a and b and stores it in variable x.
The code then defines a function judge() that returns True if x is a perfect square, and False otherwise.
The code then checks if x is a perfect square by calling the function judge().
If x is a perfect square, the code prints "Yes" and ends the response with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
If x is not a perfect square, the code prints "No" and ends the response with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
