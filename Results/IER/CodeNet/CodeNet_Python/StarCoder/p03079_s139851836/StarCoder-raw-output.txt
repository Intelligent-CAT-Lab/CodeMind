TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())

if N % 2 == 0:
    print("Even")
else:
    print("Odd")

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N is initialized to 10.
The code checks if N is even. Since it is, the code prints "Even" and ends.
