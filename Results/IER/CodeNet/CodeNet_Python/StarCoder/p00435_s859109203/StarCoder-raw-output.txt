Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable S is initialized to "MRL", which is the input.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to the length of S, which is 3 in this case.
For each index i in this range, it calculates the new character by subtracting 3 from the ASCII value of the character at index i, then modding the result by 26, then adding 65 to the result.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of A, which is ['Z', 'Y', 'X'].
<<<Output>>>
ZYX

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())
A = []
for i in range(N):
    A.append(input())

for i in A:
    print(i,end="")
print("")
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3
1
2
3
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The variable N is initialized to 3, which is the input.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to N-1, which is 2 in this case.
For each index i in this range, it reads a line of input and appends it to the list A.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of A, which is ['1', '2', '3'].
<<<Output>>>
123
