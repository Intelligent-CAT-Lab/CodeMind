Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable L is initialized to 3.
The code imports the sys module and defines the input function to read input from stdin.
The code then imports the decimal module and defines the Decimal class.
The code then defines a variable d to hold the value of L as a Decimal object.
The code then calculates the cube root of d and prints the result.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import sys
input = lambda: sys.stdin.readline().rstrip()

N = int(input())

for i in range(1,N+1):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        print(i)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N is initialized to 10.
The code imports the sys module and defines the input function to read input from stdin.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 10.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is even. If it is, it prints the current number i.
