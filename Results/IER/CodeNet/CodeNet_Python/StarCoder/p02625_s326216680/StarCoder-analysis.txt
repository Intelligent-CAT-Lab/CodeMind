int the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The code first initializes the MOD variable to 10**9+7.
The code then initializes two variables, fac and inv, to lists of length k+1, where k is the larger of N and M.
The code then initializes a variable t to 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to k+1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to k+1.
For each number i in this range, it multiplies t by i and stores the result in t.
The code then sets t to the remainder of t divided by MOD.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from k+1 to 1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from k+1 to 1.
For each number i in this range, it multiplies t by i and stores the result in t.
The code then sets t to the remainder of t divided by MOD.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N+1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to N+1.
For each number k in this range, it multiplies fac[M-k] by inv[k] and stores the result in t.
The code then sets t to the remainder of t divided by MOD.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from N+1 to 1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from N+1 to 1.
For each number k in this range, it multiplies fac[M-k] by inv[k] and stores the result in t.
The code then sets t to the remainder of t divided by MOD.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to M-N+1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to M-N+1.
For each number k in this range, it multiplies fac[M-N-k] by inv[M-N-k] and stores the result in t.
The code then sets t to the remainder of t divided by MOD.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from M-N+1 to 1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from M-N+1 to 1.
For each number k in this range, it multiplies fac[M-N-k] by inv[M-N-k] and stores the result in t.
The code then sets t to the remainder of t divided by MOD.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N+1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to N+1.
For each number k in this range, it multiplies fac[N] by fac[M] by inv[M-N]**2 and stores the result in t.
The code then sets t to the remainder of t divided by MOD.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from N+1 to 1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from N+1 to 1.
For each number k in this range, it multiplies fac[N] by fac[M] by inv[M-N]**2 and stores the result in t.
The code then sets t to the remainder of t divided by MOD.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to M-N+1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to M-N+1.
For each number k in this range, it multiplies fac[N] by fac[M] by inv[M-N]**2 and stores the result in t.
The code then
