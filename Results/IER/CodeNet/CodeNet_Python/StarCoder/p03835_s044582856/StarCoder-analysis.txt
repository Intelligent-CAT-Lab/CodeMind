The variable k, variable s are initialized to 2 and 2, respectively.
variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the number of triplets meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to k (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 2.
For each number x in this range, it enters another loop that iterates from 0 to k (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 2.
For each number y in this range, it calculates the value of z = s - x - y.
The code checks if z is within the range [0, k], which is [0, 2] in this case. If it is, it adds 1 to ans. The condition is met when z is 0,1,2.
After the inner loop finishes, the code enters the next iteration of the outer loop, which will consider numbers from 0 to 2.
After the outer loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 6.
