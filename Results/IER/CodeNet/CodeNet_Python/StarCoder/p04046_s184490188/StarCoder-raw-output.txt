The variable h, variable w, variable a, variable b are initialized to 2, 3, 1, 1, respectively.
The code calculates the value of MOD, which is 10^9+7.
The code initializes a list named fact, which will be used to store the values of the cumulative product of 1 to N.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to h+w-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 5.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the cumulative product of 1 to i and stores it in fact.
The code initializes a list named inv_fact, which will be used to store the values of the inverse cumulative product of 1 to N.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from h+w-2 to 0 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 4 to 0.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the inverse cumulative product of 1 to i and stores it in inv_fact.
The code initializes a list named inv, which will be used to store the values of the inverse cumulative product of 1 to N in reverse order.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to h+w-2 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 4.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the inverse cumulative product of 1 to i and stores it in inv.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from b to w (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 3.
For each number x in this range, it calculates the value of the following expression and adds it to ans:
```
((comb((h-a-1 + x), x)) * (comb((a-1 + w-x-1), a-1)) % MOD)
```
The code then prints the final value of ans, which is 1.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())

ans = 0
for i in range(1, N+1):
    if N % i == 0:
        ans += i
