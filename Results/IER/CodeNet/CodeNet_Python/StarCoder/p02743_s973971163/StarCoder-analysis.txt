Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variables a, b and c are initialized to 2, 3 and 9, respectively.
The code checks if c-a-b is greater than 0 and if (c-a-b)**2-4*a*b is greater than 0.
If both conditions are met, the code prints 'Yes'.
If either condition is not met, the code prints 'No'.
