Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N is initialized to 10.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 10.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is even. If it is, it prints the current number i.
After the loop finishes, the code prints a newline.
<<<Output>>>
2 4 6 8 10
