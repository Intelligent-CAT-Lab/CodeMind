Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N is initialized to 3.
The code calls the function prime_decomposition(math.factorial(N)) to calculate the prime decomposition of N.
The function prime_decomposition(math.factorial(N)) returns a list of prime numbers that are factors of N.
The code then creates a Counter object from the list of prime numbers.
The Counter object counts the number of occurrences of each prime number in the list.
The code then calculates the answer by multiplying the number of occurrences of each prime number by (the number of occurrences of that prime number + 1).
The code then prints the answer, which is 12.
