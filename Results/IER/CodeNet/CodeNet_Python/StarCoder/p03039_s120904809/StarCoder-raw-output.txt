Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable n, variable m and variable k are initialized to 2, 2 and 2, respectively.
variable num is initialized to n*m, which is 4.
The code then calculates the value of the following expression:
```
1*2*3*4*5*6*7*8*9*10*11*12*13*14*15*16*17*18*19*20
```
and stores it in the variable N.
The code then calculates the value of the following expression:
```
1*2*3*4*5*6*7*8*9*10*11*12*13*14*15*16*17*18*19*20
```
and stores it in the variable M.
The code then calculates the value of the following expression:
```
(N*(m**2)%MOD+M*(n**2)%MOD)*comb_mod(n*m-2,k-2)%MOD
```
and stores it in the variable N.
The code then prints the final value of N, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
n,m=map(int,input().split())
MOD = 10**9+7

def inv_mod(a, p=MOD):
    def inv_mod_sub(a, p):
        if a == 1:
            return 1, 0
        else:
            d, r = p//a, p%a
            x, y = inv_mod_sub(r,
