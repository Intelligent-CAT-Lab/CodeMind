rint the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable a is initialized to [4, 12], which is the input.
The code checks if a[1] is divisible by a[0]. If it is, it adds a[0] and a[1] and stores the result in variable b. If it is not, it subtracts a[0] from a[1] and stores the result in variable b.
After the code finishes, it prints the value of b, which is 16.
<<<Output>>>
16

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
b = a[0]
c = a[1]
if a[0] > a[1]:
  b = a[1]
  c = a[0]
if a[0] == a[1]:
  b = a[0]
  c = a[1]
print(b, c)
</Code>
