rint the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable a is initialized to [4, 12], which is the input.
The code checks if a[1] is divisible by a[0]. If it is, it adds a[0] and a[1] and stores the result in variable b. If it is not, it subtracts a[0] from a[1] and stores the result in variable b.
After the code finishes, it prints the value of b, which is 16.
