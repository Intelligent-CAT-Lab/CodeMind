Instruction: I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
For example:

Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
20 2 5
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
Consider the following code:

from itertools import *
from bisect import *
from math import *
from collections import *
from heapq import *
from random import *
import sys

sys.setrecursionlimit(10 ** 6)
int1 = lambda x: int(x) - 1
p2D = lambda x: print(*x, sep="\n")
def II(): return int(sys.stdin.readline())
def MI(): return map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
def MI1(): return map(int1, sys.stdin.readline().split())
def MF(): return map(float, sys.stdin.readline().split())
def LI(): return list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))
def LI1(): return list(map(int1, sys.stdin.readline().split()))
def LF(): return list(map(float, sys.stdin.readline().split()))
def LLI(rows_number): return [LI() for _ in range(rows_number)]
dij = [(1, 0), (0, 1), (-1, 0), (0, -1)]

def main():
    def ok(m):
        s=0
        cnt=0
        while m:
            s+=m
            cnt+=1
            if s>k:return False
            if cnt==n:break
            m>>=1
        return True

    n,k=MI()
    l=0
    r=k+1
    while l+1<r:
        m=(l+r)//2
        if ok(m):l=m
        else:r=m
    print(l)

main()


What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
1 1

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
