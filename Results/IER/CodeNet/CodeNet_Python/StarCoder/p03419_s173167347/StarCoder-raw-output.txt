Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable n and variable m are initialized to 2 and 2, respectively.
The code checks if n and m are equal to 1. If they are, it prints 1 and ends the program.
If n is equal to 1 or m is equal to 1, it prints the maximum of n and m minus 2, which is 0 in this case.
If neither n nor m is equal to 1, it prints the product of n minus 2 and m minus 2, which is 0 in this case.
<<<Output>>>
