Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable n is initialized to the length of the input string s, which is 3.
The variable cnt is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of "B"s.
The variable total is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the total number of "B"s.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider all the characters in the input string.
For each character in the string, it checks if it is "B". If it is, it adds 1 to cnt.
Otherwise, it adds cnt to total.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of total, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
