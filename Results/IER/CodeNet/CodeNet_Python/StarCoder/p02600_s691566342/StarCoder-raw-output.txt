The variable x is initialized to 725.
The variable result is initialized to 0.
The code checks if x is less than or equal to 599. If it is, it sets result to 8.
The code checks if x is less than or equal to 799. If it is, it sets result to 7.
The code checks if x is less than or equal to 999. If it is, it sets result to 6.
The code checks if x is less than or equal to 1199. If it is, it sets result to 5.
The code checks if x is less than or equal to 1399. If it is, it sets result to 4.
The code checks if x is less than or equal to 1599. If it is, it sets result to 3.
The code checks if x is less than or equal to 1799. If it is, it sets result to 2.
The code checks if x is greater than or equal to 1799. If it is, it sets result to 1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of result, which is 7.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
x = int(input())
result = 0

if x <= 599:
    result = 8
elif x <= 799:
    result = 7
elif x <= 999:
    result = 6
elif x <= 1199:
    result = 5
elif x <= 1399:
    result = 4
