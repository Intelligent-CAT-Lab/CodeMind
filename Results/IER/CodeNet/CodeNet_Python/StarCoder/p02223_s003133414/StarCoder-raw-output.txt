The variable n is initialized to 2.
The code checks if n is equal to 1. If it is, it prints 1 and 1 and ends.
The code checks if n is equal to 2. If it is, it prints 2 and 0 and ends.
The code checks if n is equal to 3. If it is, it prints 2 and 0 and ends.
The code checks if n is greater than 3. If it is, it prints n-1 and 11 and ends.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 1.
For each number i in this range, it prints 1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
