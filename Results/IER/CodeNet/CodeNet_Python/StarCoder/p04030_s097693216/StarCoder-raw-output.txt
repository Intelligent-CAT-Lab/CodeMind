Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable S is initialized to 01B0.
The variable w is initialized to an empty string.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the characters in S.
For each character c in S, it checks if c is equal to "B". If it is, it checks if w is not empty. If it is not empty, it removes the last character from w.
Otherwise, it adds c to w.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of w, which is 01.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(raw_input())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if sum_order % 3 == 0:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N is initialized to 20.
The variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning
