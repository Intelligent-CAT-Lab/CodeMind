The variable S is initialized to 01B0.
The variable w is initialized to an empty string.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the characters in S.
For each character c in S, it checks if c is equal to "B". If it is, it checks if w is not empty. If it is not empty, it removes the last character from w.
Otherwise, it adds c to w.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of w, which is 01.
