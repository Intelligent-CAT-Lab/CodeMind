Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable A and variable B are initialized to 4 and 10, respectively.
The code then calculates the quotient q and the remainder mod of B divided by A-1.
If A is 2, the code prints B-1 and exits.
If mod is greater than 1, the code prints q+1.
If mod is 1, the code prints q.
