Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable A, variable B and variable X are initialized to 180, 100 and 2400, respectively.
The code then calculates the values of ans1, ans2 and ans3.
ans1 is calculated by multiplying A by the ceiling of X/1000, which is 2.
ans2 is calculated by multiplying B by the ceiling of X/500, which is 4.
ans3 is calculated by multiplying A by the ceiling of X/1000, which is 2, and adding B to the ceiling of X/500, which is 4.
The code then prints the minimum of ans1, ans2 and ans3, which is 180.
