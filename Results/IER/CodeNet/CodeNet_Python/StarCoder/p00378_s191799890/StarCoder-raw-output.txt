Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable A, variable B and variable X are initialized to 180, 100 and 2400, respectively.
The code then calculates the values of ans1, ans2 and ans3.
ans1 is calculated by multiplying A by the ceiling of X/1000, which is 2.
ans2 is calculated by multiplying B by the ceiling of X/500, which is 4.
ans3 is calculated by multiplying A by the ceiling of X/1000, which is 2, and adding B to the ceiling of X/500, which is 4.
The code then prints the minimum of ans1, ans2 and ans3, which is 180.
<<<Output>>>
180

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>

N = int(input())

for i in range(1,N+1):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        print(i, end = " ")

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N is initialized to 10.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 10.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is even. If it is, it prints i.
