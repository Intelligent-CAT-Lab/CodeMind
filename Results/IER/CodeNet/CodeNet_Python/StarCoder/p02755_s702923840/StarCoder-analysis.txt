The variable a and variable b are initialized to 2 and 2, respectively.
The variable x is initialized to a list of 10 elements, each of which is initialized to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 9 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 9.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the value of b*10 + i and stores it in x[i].
The code then enters another loop that iterates from 0 to 9 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 9.
For each number i in this range, it checks if a is equal to the integer part of x[i]*0.08. If it is, it prints the value of x[i] and breaks out of the loop.
If the loop finishes without breaking out, it prints -1.
