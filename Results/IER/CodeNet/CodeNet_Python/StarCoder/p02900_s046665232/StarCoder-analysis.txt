Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The code first defines a function gcd(a, b) that calculates the greatest common divisor of a and b.
The function then defines a function lcm(a, b) that calculates the least common multiple of a and b.
The function factorization(n) calculates the factorization of a number n.
The code then reads two numbers n and m from the input.
The code then calculates the greatest common divisor of n and m and stores it in g.
If g is equal to 1, the code prints 1 and ends the execution.
Otherwise, the code calculates the factorization of g and stores it in arr.
The code then calculates the length of arr and stores it in cnt.
The code then prints cnt+1 and ends the execution.
