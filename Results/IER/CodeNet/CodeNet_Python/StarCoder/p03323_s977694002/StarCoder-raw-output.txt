Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable a is initialized to 5, and variable b is initialized to 4.
The code checks if a is less than or equal to 8 and b is less than or equal to 8.
If both conditions are met, the code prints 'Yay!'
If either condition is not met, the code prints ':('
<<<Output>>>
Yay!
[END-OF-RESPONSE]



TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
a, b = list(map(int, input().split()))
print('Yay!') if a<=8 and b<=8 else print(':(')
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 9
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
