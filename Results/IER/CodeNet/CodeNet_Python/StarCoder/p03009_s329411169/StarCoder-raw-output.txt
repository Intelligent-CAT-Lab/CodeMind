The variable N, variable H and variable D are initialized to 2, 2 and 1, respectively.
The variable MOD is initialized to 10 ** 9 + 7.
The code then calculates the factorial of N and stores it in fact.
The code then calculates the sum of the factorials of the numbers from 1 to N (inclusive), which is 1! + 2! +... + N! and stores it in s.
The code then initializes an array dp of size H, which is 2 in this case.
dp[0] is initialized to 1.
The code then initializes a variable ret to 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to H (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 2.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the value of dp[i] as follows:
dp[i] = ret * s % MOD
ret = (ret + ret * s) % MOD
If i is greater than or equal to D, it subtracts the value of dp[i - D] from ret.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of dp[H - 1], which is 1.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, M = map(int, input().split())
MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7

dp = [[0] * (M + 1) for _ in range(N + 1)]
dp[0][0] = 1

for i in range(1, N + 1) :
    for j in range(1, M + 1) :
        dp[i][j] = (dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i][j - 1]) % MOD

print(dp[N][M])
