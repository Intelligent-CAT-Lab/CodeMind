Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The code reads the input and stores it in a variable.
The code checks if the input is less than 1200. If it is, it prints 'ABC'. Otherwise, it prints 'ARC'.
The input is 1000, which is less than 1200, so the code prints 'ABC'.
<<<Output>>>
ABC

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())
for i in range(1,N+1):
    if i%3==0 or i%5==0:
        print(i)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The code reads the input and stores it in a variable.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 10.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is divisible by 3 or 5. If it is, it prints the current number i.
The input is 10, which is less than 1200, so the code prints 3, 5, 6 and 9.
<<<Output>>>
3
5
6
9
