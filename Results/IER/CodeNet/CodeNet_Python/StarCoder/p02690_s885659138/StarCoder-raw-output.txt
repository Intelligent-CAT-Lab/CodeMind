The variable n is initialized to 33.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 100, meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 100.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the value of a and b.
The value of a is i.
The value of b is -1*(n-pow(a,5)).
The value of c is int(pow(abs(b),1/5)).
The code checks if c*c*c*c*c==b.
The condition is met when i is 10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final values of a and c, which are 10 and 3.
