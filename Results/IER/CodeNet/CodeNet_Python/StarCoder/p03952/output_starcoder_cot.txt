Instruction: I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
For example:

Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
20 2 5
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
Consider the following code:

N, x = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
import sys

if x == 1 or x == 2*N-1:
    if N!= 1:
        print('No')
        sys.exit()
    else:
        print('Yes')
        print(1)
        sys.exit()

smaller = True
if x > N:
    smaller = False
    x = 2*N-x

ans = list(range(2*N-1,N+x-1,-1))+list(range(1,N+x))
if not smaller:
    ans =[2*N - ans[i] for i in range(2*N-1)]

print('Yes')
for i in range(2*N-1):
    print(ans[i])
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
4 4

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N is initialized to 4, and variable x is initialized to 4.
The code checks if x is equal to 1 or 2*N-1. If it is, it checks if N is equal to 1. If it is, it prints "Yes" and 1, and exits the program.
Otherwise, it sets smaller to True.
If x is greater than N, it sets smaller to False and x to 2*N-x.
The code then initializes ans to a list of length 2*N-1, which is [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20].
If smaller is False, it reverses the list.
The code then prints "Yes" and then prints the list ans.
The output of code execution is:
Yes
