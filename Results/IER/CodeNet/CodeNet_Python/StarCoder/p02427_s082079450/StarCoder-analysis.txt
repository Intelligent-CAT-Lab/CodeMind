The variable n is initialized to 4.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 16 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 16.
For each number i in this range, it appends the string f'{i}:' to the list s.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 3.
For each number j in this range, it checks if i has a 1 at the j-th position. If it does, it appends the string f' {j}' to the list s.
The code then appends the string '\n' to the list s.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the list s, which is:
```
1: 0
2: 1
3: 2
4: 3
5: 0 1
6: 0 2
7: 0 3
8: 1 2
9: 1 3
10: 2 3
11: 0 1 2
12: 0 1 3
13: 0 2 3
14: 1 2 3
15: 0 1 2 3
```
