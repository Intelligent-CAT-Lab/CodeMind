Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N, variable D1 and variable D2 are initialized to 2, 1 and 2, respectively.
The variable NN is initialized to 2 * N, which is 4 in this case.
The code then calculates the degree of D1 and D2, which is 1 and 2, respectively.
The code then calculates the parity of p1 and p2, which is 0 and 0, respectively.
The code then generates all possible points (x, y) such that x and y are both even, and x and y have the same parity as D1 and D2.
The code then prints the first N**2 points in the list of points.
<<<Output>>>
0 0
0 2
2 0
2 2
