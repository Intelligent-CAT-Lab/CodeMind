Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variables a, b, c and d are initialized to 4, 7, 9 and 3, respectively.
The code checks if the absolute difference between a and c is less than or equal to d.
The absolute difference between a and c is 5, which is greater than d, so the code prints 'No'.
The code then checks if the absolute difference between a and b is less than or equal to d and the absolute difference between b and c is less than or equal to d.
The absolute difference between a and b is 3, which is less than or equal to d, but the absolute difference between b and c is 4, which is greater than d, so the code prints 'No'.
The code then prints 'No' because the absolute difference between a and c is greater than d, and the absolute difference between a and b is greater than d.
