Instruction: I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
For example:

Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
20 2 5
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
Consider the following code:

from sys import stdin

a = stdin.readline().rstrip()

week = {'SUN':0,'MON':1,'TUE':2,'WED':3,'THU':4,'FRI':5,'SAT':6}

print(7-int(week.get(a)))
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
SAT

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The code reads a line of input from stdin and stores it in a.
The code then creates a dictionary week with the following key-value pairs:

'SUN':0
'MON':1
'TUE':2
'WED':3
'THU':4
'FRI':5
'SAT':6
The code then reads a line of input from stdin and stores it in a.
The code then uses the dictionary week to find the value corresponding to the key a.
The code then subtracts 7 from the value of a and prints the result.

The output of code execution is:
5
END-OF-OUTPUT

Question 2

Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

For example, the longest substring without repeating letters for "abcabcbb" is "abc", which the length is 3. For "bbbbb" the longest substring is "b", with the length of 1.

Question 3

Given a string, find the length of the longest substring with no more than K distinct characters.

For example, the longest substring with K = 2 is "abac", which has length 4.
