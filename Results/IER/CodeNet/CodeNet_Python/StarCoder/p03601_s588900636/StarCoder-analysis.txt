rint the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The code first reads the input and stores it in variables a, b, c, d, e, f.
The code then initializes best_sugar to 0 and best_total to 100 * a.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 30, which means it will consider all possible values of i and j.
For each value of i and j, it calculates water as i * 100 * a + j * 100 * b.
For each value of k, it calculates l1 and l2.
l1 is calculated as (f - water - k * c) / d, where f is 200, water is the current value of water, k is the current value of k and c is 10.
l2 is calculated as (water * e // 100 - k * c) / d, where water is the current value of water, k is the current value of k, e is 15 and c is 10.
l is the minimum of l1 and l2.
If i, j, k and l are not equal to 0, it calculates sugar as k * c + l * d, where k is the current value of k, c is 10 and d is 20.
It then calculates total as water + sugar, where water is the current value of water and sugar is the current value of sugar.
It then calculates density as sugar / total, where sugar is the current value of sugar and total is the current value of total.
It then calculates best_density as best_sugar / best_total, where best_sugar is 0 and best_total is 100 * a.
If density is greater than best_density, it updates best_sugar to the current value of sugar and best_total to the current value of total.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final values of best_total and best_sugar, which are 1000 and 10000.
