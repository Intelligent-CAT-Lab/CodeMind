Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable s is initialized to 1817181712114.
The variable n is initialized to the length of s, which is 18.
The variable memo is initialized to an array of 2019 elements, all of which are initialized to 0.
The variable num is initialized to 0.
The variable t is initialized to 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 18 to 0 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 18 to 0.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in num.
The code then calculates the next value of t by multiplying t by 10 and then taking the remainder of this value by 2019.
The code then adds 1 to the element of memo at index num.
After the loop finishes, the code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 2018 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 2018.
For each number p in this range, it calculates the sum of all the numbers in memo that are less than or equal to p.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 1000000000000000000.
