The variable mod is initialized to 10**9 + 7.
The variable fac is initialized to an empty list.
The variable pw is initialized to an empty list.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 2000, meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 2000.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the product of all numbers from 1 to i and stores it in fac.
