The variable s is initialized to 'gpg'.
The code calculates the length of s, which is 4.
The code then counts the number of occurrences of the letter 'p' in s, which is 1.
The code subtracts the number of occurrences of 'p' from the length of s, which is 4 - 1 = 3.
The code prints the final value of the expression, which is 3.
