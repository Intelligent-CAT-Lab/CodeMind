The variable n, variable a, variable b and variable k are initialized to 4, 1, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable m is initialized to n // 2 + 1, which is 3.
variable mod is initialized to 998244353.
variable comb is initialized to [1, 1, 1], which will be used to store the values of the binomial coefficients.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to m (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 3.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the binomial coefficient and stores it in comb[i].
The code then enters another loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 4.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the binomial coefficient and stores it in comb[i].
