The variable n is initialized to 5.
The variable sum is initialized to 1.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 5.
For each number i in this range, it multiplies sum by i.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum, which is 120.
