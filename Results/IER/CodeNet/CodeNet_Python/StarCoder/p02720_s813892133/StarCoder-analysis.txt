int the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable K is initialized to 15.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 9 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 9.
For each number i in this range, it puts i into the queue.
The code checks if K is less than or equal to 9. If it is, it prints the value of K and exits the loop.
If K is greater than 9, the code enters a while loop that iterates until the condition is met.
The code then gets the first element from the queue and stores it in j.
It then increments count by 1.
If count is equal to K, it prints the value of j and exits the loop.
If count is less than K, the code enters a if statement that checks if j is divisible by 10.
If it is not, it puts 10*j+(j%10)-1 into the queue.
If j is divisible by 10, it puts 10*j+(j%10) into the queue.
If j is not divisible by 10, it puts 10*j+(j%10)+1 into the queue.
After the while loop finishes, the code prints the final value of j, which is 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425.
