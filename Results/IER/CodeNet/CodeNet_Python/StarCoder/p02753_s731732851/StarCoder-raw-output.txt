Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable s is initialized to the list of characters in the input, which is ['A', 'B', 'A'].
The code checks if the first, second and third characters of s are equal. Since they are, the code prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
[END-OF-RESPONSE]



TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
s = list(input())

if s[0] == s[1] == s[2]:
    print("No")
else:
    print("Yes")


</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```ABA
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
