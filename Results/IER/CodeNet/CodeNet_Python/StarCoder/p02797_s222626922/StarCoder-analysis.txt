Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable n, variable k and variable s are initialized to 4, 2 and 3, respectively.
variable num is initialized to 998245637.
variable arr is initialized to [3,3], which is a list of 2 elements.
variable arr2 is initialized to [998245637,998245637,998245637,998245637], which is a list of 4 elements.
The code then prints the list [3,3,998245637,998245637,998245637,998245637].
