The variable n, variable k and variable s are initialized to 4, 2 and 3, respectively.
variable num is initialized to 998245637.
variable arr is initialized to [3,3], which is a list of 2 elements.
variable arr2 is initialized to [998245637,998245637,998245637,998245637], which is a list of 4 elements.
The code then prints the list [3,3,998245637,998245637,998245637,998245637].
<<<Output>>>
3 3 998245637 998245637 998245637 998245637

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
n = int(input())
arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
arr.sort()
print(arr[n//2])
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5
1 2 3 4 5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
