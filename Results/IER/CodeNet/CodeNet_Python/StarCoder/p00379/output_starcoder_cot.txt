Instruction: I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
For example:

Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
20 2 5
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
Consider the following code:

a, n, m = map(int, input().split())
ans = 0
for y in range(1, 50):
    x = (y + a)**n
    if 1 <= x <= m and y == sum(map(int, str(x))):
        ans += 1
print(ans)

What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
16 2 1000

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable a, n and m are initialized to 16, 2 and 1000, respectively.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the number of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 50 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 50.
For each number y in this range, it calculates the value of x = (y + a)**n.
The code checks if 1 <= x <= m and if y == sum(map(int, str(x))). If the condition is met, it adds 1 to ans. The condition is met when y is 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 10.

The output of code execution is:
10
