Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variables a, b and c are initialized to 2, 3 and 3, respectively.
The code checks if a is greater than c. If it is, it prints the difference between a and c and b.
If a is not greater than c, the code checks if a + b is less than c. If it is, it prints 0,0.
If a + b is not less than c, the code prints 0, a + b - c.
After the code finishes, the output is 0, 0.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
a, b, c = map(int,input().split())
if a > b:
  if a > c:
    print(a)
  else:
    print(c)
elif b > c:
  print(b)
else:
  print(c)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 3 3
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The variables a, b and c are initialized to 2, 3 and 3, respectively.
The code checks if a is greater than b. If it is, it checks if a is greater than c. If it is, it prints a.
If a is not greater than c, the code prints c.
If a is not greater than b, the code checks if b is greater than c. If it is, it prints b.
