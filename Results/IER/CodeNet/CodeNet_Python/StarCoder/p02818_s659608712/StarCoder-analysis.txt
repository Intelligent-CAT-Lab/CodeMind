Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variables a, b and c are initialized to 2, 3 and 3, respectively.
The code checks if a is greater than c. If it is, it prints the difference between a and c and b.
If a is not greater than c, the code checks if a + b is less than c. If it is, it prints 0,0.
If a + b is not less than c, the code prints 0, a + b - c.
After the code finishes, the output is 0, 0.
