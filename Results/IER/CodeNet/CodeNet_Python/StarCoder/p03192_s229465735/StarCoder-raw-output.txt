Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable n is initialized to 1222.
The code then prints the number of times the digit 2 appears in n, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>
3

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
n = int(input())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,n+1):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable n is initialized to 10.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 10.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is even. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,4,6,8 and 10.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 20.
<<<Output>>>
20
