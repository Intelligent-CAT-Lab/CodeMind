Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variables a, b, c and d are initialized to 1, 2, 1 and 1, respectively.
The code calculates the maximum of the following expressions:
a*c = 1*1 = 1
a*d = 1*1 = 1
b*c = 2*1 = 2
b*d = 2*1 = 2
The maximum of these expressions is 2, so the code prints 2.
<<<Output>>>
2

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b,c,d = map(int,input().split())

print(min(a*c,a*d,b*c,b*d))
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 2 1 1
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
