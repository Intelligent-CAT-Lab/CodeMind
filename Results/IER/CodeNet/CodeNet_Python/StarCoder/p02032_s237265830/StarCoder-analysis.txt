rint the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N is initialized to 18.
The code calls the function make_divisors(N) to generate a list of divisors of N.
The function make_divisors(N) returns a list of divisors of N, which is [1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18].
The code then creates two variables, max_times and min_times, which are initialized to 0.
The code then creates a list, result, which is initialized to an empty list.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from the last element of yakusu to the second element of yakusu (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 9 to 1.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is in result. If it is, it skips the current iteration and goes to the next iteration.
If i is not in result, it extends result with the list of divisors of i, which is [1, 2, 3, 6, 9].
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of min_times, which is 3.
