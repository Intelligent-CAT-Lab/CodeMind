Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable list is initialized to [3, 8, 1], which is the input.
The code sorts the list in ascending order, which means it will change the list to [1, 3, 8].
The code then prints the first three elements of the list, which are 1, 3 and 8.
<<<Output>>>
