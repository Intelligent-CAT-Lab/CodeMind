Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable a is initialized to 12, and variable b is initialized to 4.
The variable c is initialized to b+b, which is 8.
The code checks if a-c is not equal to 0 and is greater than or equal to 0.
Since a-c is 8-8=0 and 8>=0, the condition is met and the code prints 0.
<<<Output>>>
0

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b=[int(a)for a in input().split()]

c=b+b
if(a-c!=0)and(a-c>=0):
    print(a-c)
else:
    print(0)

#print(type(c))
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```12 4
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
