Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable a is initialized to 12, and variable b is initialized to 4.
The variable c is initialized to b+b, which is 8.
The code checks if a-c is not equal to 0 and is greater than or equal to 0.
Since a-c is 8-8=0 and 8>=0, the condition is met and the code prints 0.
