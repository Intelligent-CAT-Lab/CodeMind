Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable n is initialized to 3.
The variable a is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 3.
For each number i in this range, it adds the current number i to a. The condition is met when i is 1,2 and 3.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of a, which is 6.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
n = int(input())
a = 0
for i in range(1,n+1):
	a+=i
print a	
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
