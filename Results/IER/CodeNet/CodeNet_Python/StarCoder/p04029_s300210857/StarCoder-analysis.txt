The variable n is initialized to 3.
The variable a is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 3.
For each number i in this range, it adds the current number i to a. The condition is met when i is 1,2 and 3.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of a, which is 6.
