The variable A, variable B and variable DEGREE are initialized to 4, 3 and 90, respectively.
The code calculates the length of the side of a right triangle with side lengths A and B, and angle DEGREE.
The code calculates the length of the hypotenuse of the right triangle, which is the length of the side of a right triangle with side lengths A and B, and angle 90.
The code calculates the area of the triangle, which is the area of a right triangle with side lengths A and B, and angle 90.
The code calculates the perimeter of the triangle, which is the perimeter of a right triangle with side lengths A and B, and angle 90.
The code prints the values of S, A+B+C, and h, which are 12.000000000, 9.000000000 and 3.000000000, respectively.
<<<Output>>>
12.000000000 9.000000000 3.000000000
