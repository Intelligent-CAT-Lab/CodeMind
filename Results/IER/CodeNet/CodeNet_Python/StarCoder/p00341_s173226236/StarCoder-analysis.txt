Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable l is initialized to a list of the input, which is [1, 1, 3, 4, 8, 9, 7, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5].
The code sorts the list l in ascending order.
The code checks if the first four elements of the list are equal to the next four elements, and so on.
The first four elements are 1, 1, 3, 4, which are equal to the next four elements, which are 3, 4, 8, 9, which are equal to the next four elements, which are 7, 3, 4, 5, which are equal to the next four elements, which are 5, 5, 5, 5.
The code prints 'yes' because all the elements are equal.
