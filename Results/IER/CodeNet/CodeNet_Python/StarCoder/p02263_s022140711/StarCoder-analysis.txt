The variable N is initialized to 1 2 +, which is a list of strings.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the list N.
For each string a in the list, it checks if a is a digit. If it is, it pushes it to the stack.
If a is not a digit, it pops two numbers from the stack, performs the operation specified by a, and pushes the result back to the stack.
After the loop finishes, the code pops the last number from the stack and prints it.
