The variables a, b and c are initialized to 4, 12 and 20, respectively.
The code checks if a, b and c are equal to each other and if a is even.
If the condition is met, the code prints -1 and ends.
Otherwise, the code enters a while loop that will run until the condition is met.
Inside the loop, the code divides a, b and c by 2, which means that a becomes 6, b becomes 6 and c becomes 6.
The code increments res by 1, which means that res becomes 1.
The loop ends when the condition is met, which is when a, b and c are all even.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of res, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if sum_order%3 == 0:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
