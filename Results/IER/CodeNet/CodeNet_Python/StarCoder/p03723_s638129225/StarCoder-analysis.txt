nt the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variables a, b and c are initialized to 4, 12 and 20, respectively.
The code checks if a, b and c are equal to each other and if a is even.
If the condition is met, the code prints -1 and ends.
Otherwise, the code enters a while loop that will run until the condition is met.
Inside the loop, the code divides a, b and c by 2, which means that a becomes 6, b becomes 6 and c becomes 6.
The code increments res by 1, which means that res becomes 1.
The loop ends when the condition is met, which is when a, b and c are all even.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of res, which is 2.
