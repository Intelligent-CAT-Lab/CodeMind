Instruction: I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
For example:

Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
20 2 5
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
Consider the following code:

A = list(input())
N = len(A)

C0 = A.count("0")
C1 = A.count("1")

print(2 * min(C0, C1))

What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
0011

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable A is initialized to the list [0, 0, 1, 1], which is the list of characters in the input.
The variable N is initialized to 4, which is the length of the list A.
The code then counts the number of occurrences of the character 0 and stores the result in the variable C0. The code also counts the number of occurrences of the character 1 and stores the result in the variable C1.
The code then prints the value of 2 * min(C0, C1), which is 2 * min(1, 2) = 2.

The output of code execution is:
2
