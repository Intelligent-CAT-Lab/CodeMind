Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable n is initialized to 5, and variable k is initialized to 2.
The code calculates the answer by iterating from 2 to n (inclusive), which is 2,3,4,5.
For each number b in this range, it calculates the floor of n/b, which is 2,2,2,2.
Then it calculates the number of ways to choose k elements from b, which is 2,1,0,0.
Then it adds the number of ways to choose k elements from b to the answer, which is 4,3,2,2.
The code also calculates the number of ways to choose k elements from n-b, which is 1,1,1,0.
Then it adds the number of ways to choose k elements from n-b to the answer, which is 5,4,3,2.
The code also calculates the number of ways to choose k elements from n-b+1, which is 0,0,0,1.
Then it adds the number of ways to choose k elements from n-b+1 to the answer, which is 5,4,3,3.
The code prints the final value of ans, which is 15.
