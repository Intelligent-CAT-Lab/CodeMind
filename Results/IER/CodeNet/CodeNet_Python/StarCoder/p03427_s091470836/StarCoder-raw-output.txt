Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable n is initialized to [1,0,0], which is the list of integers in the input.
The variable l is initialized to 3, which is the length of the list n.
The code checks if l is equal to 1. If it is, it prints the first element of the list n, which is 1.
Otherwise, the code checks if the first element of the list n is not equal to 9. If it is, it checks if the length of the list n minus 1 is equal to the number of distinct elements in the list n minus 1. If it is, it prints the sum of the first element of the list n and 9 times the length of the list n minus 1. Otherwise, it prints the sum of the first element of the list n minus 1 and 9 times the length of the list n minus 1.
After the code finishes, it prints the final value of n, which is 99.
<<<Output>>>
99

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
n=int(input())
if n%2==0:
    print(n//2)
else:
    print(3*n+1)

The variable n is initialized to 100, which is the integer in the input.
The code checks if n is even. If it is, it
