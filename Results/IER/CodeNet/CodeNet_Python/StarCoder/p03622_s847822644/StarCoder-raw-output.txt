The variable m is initialized to 998244353, and variable M is initialized to 1000001.
The variables f, g and h are initialized to arrays of length M, each element of which is initialized to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to M (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 2 to 1000000.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the following:
f[i] = f[i-1] * i % m
h[i] = m - h[m%i] * (m//i) % m
g[i] = g[i-1] * h[i] % m
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to B (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to B.
For each number j in this range, it calculates the following:
ans += b * f[A+B-j] * g[B-j] * g[A] % m
b = b * 2 % m
The code then calculates the final value of ans, which is 10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
