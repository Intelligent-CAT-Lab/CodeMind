Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable s is initialized to the list of characters in the input, which is ["a", "b", "a", "c"].
The variable c is initialized to the Counter object of the list s, which is Counter({"a": 2, "b": 1, "c": 1}).
The code then calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values of c, which is 1-1=0.
The code checks if the difference is less than 2, which is not the case.
The code prints "NO" as the output.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

def is_prime(n):
    if n == 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

n = int(input())

if is_prime(n):
    print("YES")
else:
    print("NO")

</Code>
