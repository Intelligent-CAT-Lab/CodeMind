Instruction: I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
For example:

Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
20 2 5
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
Consider the following code:

S = input()
L = len(S)

cur = 0
P = [0]*6
def expr():
    global cur
    op = "+"
    while 1:
        term(op)
        if cur == L:
            break
        op = S[cur]
        cur += 1 # "+"/"-"

def num():
    global cur
    v = 0
    while cur < L and S[cur] in "0123456789":
        v = 10*v + int(S[cur])
        cur += 1
    return v

def term(op):
    global cur
    k = 1
    if S[cur]!= 'x':
        k = num()
    d = 0
    if cur < L and S[cur] == "x":
        cur += 1 # "x"
        d = 1
        if cur < L and S[cur] == '^':
            cur += 1 # "^"
            d = num()
    P[d] = k if op == '+' else -k
expr()

def f(P, x):
    res = 0
    for i in range(6):
        res += P[i]*(x**i)
    return res

d = 5
while P[d] == 0:
    d -= 1

R = []
for x in range(2000, -2001, -1):
    if f(P, x) == 0:
        R.append(x)

print("".join("(x%+d)" % -x for x in R))


What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
x^2+3x+2

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The code first reads the input string S and calculates its length L.

The code then initializes a list P of length 6, which will be used to store the coefficients of the polynomial.

The function expr() is called to evaluate the polynomial.

The function num() is called to read a number from the input string S.

The function term() is called to read a term from the input string S.

The function f() is called to evaluate the polynomial at a given point x.

The code then iterates from d = 5 to 0, meaning it will consider powers of x from 5 to 0 (inclusive).

For each power d, it checks if the coefficient of x^d is non-zero. If it is, it adds the current value of x to the list R.

The code then prints the list R, which is [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2].

The output of code execution is:
(x-2)(x-1)(x+0)(x+1)(x+2)
