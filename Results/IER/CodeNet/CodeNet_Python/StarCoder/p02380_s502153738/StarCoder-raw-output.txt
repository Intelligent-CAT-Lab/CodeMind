Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable a, variable b and variable C are initialized to 4, 3 and 90, respectively.
The code then calculates the length of the triangle's third side using the cosine law.
The code then calculates the height of the triangle using the sine law.
The code then calculates the size of the triangle using the area of a triangle.
The code then calculates the length of the triangle using the sum of the three sides.
The code then prints the final values of size, length and height, which are 10.00000000, 12.00000000 and 3.00000000, respectively.
<<<Output>>>
10.00000000
12.00000000
3.00000000

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())

#Nが偶数ならば
if N % 2 == 0:
    #Nを2で割った余りが0ならば
    if N % 4 == 0:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
#Nが奇数ならば
else:
    print('No')
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
