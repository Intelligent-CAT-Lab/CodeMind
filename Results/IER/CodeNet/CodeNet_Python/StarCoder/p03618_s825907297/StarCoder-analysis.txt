The code first reads the input and stores it in the variable s.
The code then calculates the number of possible substrings of s.
The code then initializes a dictionary dic to store the indices of each character in s.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the characters in s.
For each character, the code tries to access the key s[i] in the dictionary dic. If the key is not present, the code adds the key s[i] to the dictionary dic and assigns it a value of [i]. If the key is present, the code appends the current index i to the value of the key s[i].
The code then enters a second loop that iterates over the values of the dictionary dic.
For each value, the code calculates the number of possible substrings of the value.
The code then subtracts this number from the total number of possible substrings of s.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of count, which is 3.
