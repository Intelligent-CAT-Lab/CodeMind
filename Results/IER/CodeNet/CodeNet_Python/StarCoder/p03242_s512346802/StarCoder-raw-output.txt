Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable n is initialized to the input string "119".
The code then replaces all occurrences of "1" with "x", all occurrences of "9" with "1" and all occurrences of "x" with "9".
The code prints the final value of n, which is "991".
<<<Output>>>
