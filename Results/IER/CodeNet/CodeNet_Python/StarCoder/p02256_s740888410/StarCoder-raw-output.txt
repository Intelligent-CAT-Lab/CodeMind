rint the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable a is initialized to 54, and variable b is initialized to 20.
The function gcp is defined to take two integers as input and return the greatest common divisor of the two numbers.
The function is called with the input a and b, and the output is stored in the variable gcp_output.
The code then prints the value of gcp_output, which is 6.
<<<Output>>>
6

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
a, b = map(int,input().split())

def gcp(x, y):
    while min(x, y)!= 0:
        if x < y:
            x, y = y, x
        x = x % y
    return max(x, y)

print(a*b//gcp(a,b))

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```54 20
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
