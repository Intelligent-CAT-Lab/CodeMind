The variable M is initialized to 10**9+7, which is 1000000007.
The variable D is initialized to an empty list.
The variable i is initialized to 1.
The variable r is initialized to 0.
The variable N and variable K are initialized to 4 and 2, respectively.
The code enters a while loop that continues as long as i*i is less than or equal to N.
If N is divisible by i, i is appended to the list D.
If i*i is less than N and N is not divisible by i, N/i is appended to the list D.
The code increments i by 1.
The code then sorts the list D in ascending order.
The code then initializes the list N to an empty list.
The code enters a for loop that iterates from 0 to the length of the list D.
The code then appends to the list N the value of the expression pow(K,-~D[i]/2,M).
The code then enters a for loop that iterates from 0 to i-1.
If D[i] is divisible by D[j], the value of N[i] is set to the value of the expression (N[i]-N[j])%M.
The code then adds to r the value of the expression (N[i]*D[i]*pow(2,M-2+D[i]%2,M))%M.
The code then prints the final value of r, which is 1.
