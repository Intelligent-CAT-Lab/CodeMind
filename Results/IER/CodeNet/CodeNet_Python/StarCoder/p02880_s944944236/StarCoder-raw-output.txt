Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable n is initialized to 10.
The code checks if n is less than or equal to 10. Since it is, the code prints "Yes" and ends.
The code then checks if n is less than or equal to 81. Since it is not, the code enters the else clause.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the list primesand10.
For each prime in this list, it checks if n is divisible by the current prime. If it is, the code sets yes to False and breaks out of the loop.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if yes is True. Since it is, the code prints "Yes" and ends.
Since yes is False, the code prints "No" and ends.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
n = int(input())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,n+1):
    sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The variable n is initialized to 10.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 10.
For each number i in this range, it adds i to sum_1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of
