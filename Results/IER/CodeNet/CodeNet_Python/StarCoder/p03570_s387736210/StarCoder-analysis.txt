The code first imports the itertools module, which contains a number of useful functions for working with iterators.
The variable L is initialized to 9 raised to the power of 9, which is 99,999,999.
The variable dp is initialized to a dictionary with a single key-value pair, 0:0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the input string, which is 'aabxyyzz'.
For each character c in the input string, it calculates the value of v by XORing the current value of v with 1 shifted left by the ASCII value of c.
The code then checks if v is already a key in the dictionary dp. If it is, it checks if the value of dp[v] is less than the value of dp[v^1<<i], where i is the ASCII value of c. If it is, it updates the value of dp[v] to the minimum of the current value of dp[v] and dp[v^1<<i]+1.
If v is not a key in the dictionary dp, it adds a new key-value pair to dp, with key v and value L.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of dp[v]+(v==0), which is 10.
