Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable a is initialized to 1000, and variable b is initialized to 3000.
The code calculates the value of x by dividing a+b by 2, which is 4000//2=2000.
The code prints the final value of x, which is 2000.
<<<Output>>>
2000

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
a, b=map(int,input().split())
x=a+b
print(x)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1000 3000
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The variable a is initialized to 1000, and variable b is initialized to 3000.
The code calculates the value of x by adding a+b, which is 1000+3000=4000.
The code prints the final value of x, which is 4000.
<<<Output>>>
4000
