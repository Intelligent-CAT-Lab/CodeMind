The function gcd is defined to calculate the greatest common divisor of two numbers.
The variables a, b and k are initialized to 8, 12 and 2, respectively.
The code calculates the greatest common divisor of a and b, which is 4.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to k (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 2.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the greatest common divisor of a and b, which is 4.
The code checks if a and b are divisible by ans, which is 4. If they are, it adds 1 to cnt. The condition is met when i is 1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 4.
