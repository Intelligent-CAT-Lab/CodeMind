Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N is initialized to 4.
The code checks if N is equal to 1 or 2. If it is, it prints 0 and ends.
Otherwise, the code checks if N is even. If it is, it prints N//2-1 and ends.
Otherwise, it prints N//2 and ends.
After the code finishes, the output is 2.
