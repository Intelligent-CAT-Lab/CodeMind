int the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable S is initialized to "erasedream".
The variable N is initialized to the length of S, which is 10.
The variable i is initialized to 0.
The code enters a while loop that iterates while i is less than N.
The variable sig is initialized to 0.
The variable S5 is initialized to the substring of S starting at index i and ending at index i+5, which is "erased".
The code checks if S5 is equal to "dream". If it is, it sets sig to 1.
The code then checks if the substring of S starting at index i+5 and ending at index i+7 is equal to "er" and if the substring of S starting at index i+7 and ending at index i+8 is not equal to "a". If both conditions are met, it sets i to i+2.
The code then checks if the substring of S starting at index i+5 and ending at index i+6 is equal to "r". If it is, it sets i to i+1.
The code then checks if sig is equal to 0. If it is, it sets sig to 2 and breaks out of the loop.
The code then checks if sig is not equal to 2. If it is, it sets Answer to "YES".
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of Answer, which is "YES".
