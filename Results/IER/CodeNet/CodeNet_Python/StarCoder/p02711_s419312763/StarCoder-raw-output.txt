Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The code first reads the input and stores it in a variable called s.
The code then checks if the string "7" is contained in the list of characters in s.
If it is, the code prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
Yes

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())
for i in range(1,N+1):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        print(i, end=" ")
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The code first reads the input and stores it in a variable called N.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 10.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is even. If it is, it prints i and a space.
After the loop finishes, the code prints nothing.
<<<Output>>>
2 4 6 8 10
