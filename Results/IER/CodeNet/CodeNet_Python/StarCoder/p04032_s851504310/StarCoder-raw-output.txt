The variable s is initialized to the string "needed".
The function solve(s) is defined.
The function first calculates the length of the string s and stores it in the variable n.
The function then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider all pairs of consecutive characters in the string.
For each pair of consecutive characters, it checks if the first character is equal to the second character. If it is, it prints the indices of the characters.
The function then enters a second loop that iterates from 2 to n-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider all pairs of consecutive characters in the string.
For each pair of consecutive characters, it checks if the second character is equal to the third character. If it is, it prints the indices of the characters.
The function then prints -1,-1, which is the indices of the characters that do not meet the condition.
After the function finishes, the code prints the final value of s, which is "needed".
