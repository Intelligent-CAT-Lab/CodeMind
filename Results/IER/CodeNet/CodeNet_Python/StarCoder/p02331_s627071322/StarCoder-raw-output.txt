The variable N is initialized to 2, and variable K is initialized to 3.
The code then calculates the value of K^N mod 10^9+7, which is 3^2 mod 10^9+7, which is 9 mod 10^9+7, which is 9.
The code prints the final value of K^N mod 10^9+7, which is 9.
<<<Output>>>
9

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if sum_order % 3 == 0:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N is initialized to 10.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 10.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is divisible by 3, which is
