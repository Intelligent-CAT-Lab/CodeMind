The variable x is initialized to 33.
The code checks if x**0.2 is an integer. If it is, it prints the integer part of x**0.2 and 0, and exits the program.
Otherwise, it enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 10**5 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 10**5.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the values of b and c.
The code calculates the values of x1 and x2.
If x1 is positive and x1**0.2 is an integer, it prints the integer part of x1**0.2 and b, and exits the program.
If x2 is positive and x2**0.2 is an integer, it prints the integer part of x2**0.2 and c, and exits the program.
If x2 is negative, it enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 10**3 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 10**3.
For each number j in this range, it calculates the value of v.
If v**5 is equal to x2, it prints v and c, and exits the program.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 33.
