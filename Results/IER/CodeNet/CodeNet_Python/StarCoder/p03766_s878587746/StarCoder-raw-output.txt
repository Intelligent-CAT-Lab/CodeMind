Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N is initialized to 2.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 2.
The code calculates the value of the first term of the sequence, which is 1.
The code calculates the value of the second term of the sequence, which is 2.
The code calculates the value of the third term of the sequence, which is 3.
The code calculates the value of the fourth term of the sequence, which is 5.
The code calculates the value of the fifth term of the sequence, which is 8.
The code calculates the value of the sixth term of the sequence, which is 13.
The code calculates the value of the seventh term of the sequence, which is 21.
The code prints the final value of the sequence, which is 34.
<<<Output>>>
34

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import sys
readline = sys.stdin.readline
MOD = 10**9+7
N = int(readline())

dp = [0]*(N+1)
dp[0] = 1
dp[1] = 1
for i in range(2, N+1):
    dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]) % MOD
print(dp[N])                 

</Code>
