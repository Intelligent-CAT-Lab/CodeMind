Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variables a, b and c are initialized to 5, 2 and 7, respectively.
The code checks if the absolute value of the difference between a and b is less than the absolute value of the difference between c and a.
Since the absolute value of the difference between 5 and 2 is less than the absolute value of the difference between 7 and 5, the code prints A.
<<<Output>>>
A

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b,c=map(int,input().split())
if a+b>c and a+c>b and b+c>a:
  print('YES')
else:
  print('NO')
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 2 3
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variables a, b and c are initialized to 1, 2 and 3, respectively.
The code checks if a+b>c, a+c>b and b+c>a.
Since 1+2>3, 1+3>2 and 2+3>1, the code prints YES.
<<<Output>>>
YES
