Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variables a, b and c are initialized to 5, 2 and 7, respectively.
The code checks if the absolute value of the difference between a and b is less than the absolute value of the difference between c and a.
Since the absolute value of the difference between 5 and 2 is less than the absolute value of the difference between 7 and 5, the code prints A.
