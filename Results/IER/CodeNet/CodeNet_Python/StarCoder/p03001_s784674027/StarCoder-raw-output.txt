int the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variables a, b, x and y are initialized to 2, 3, 1 and 2, respectively.
The code checks if a/2 is equal to x and b/2 is equal to y. If so, it sets h to 1.
The code then prints the value of a*b/2 and h, which is 3.0 1.
<<<Output>>>
3.0 1

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b,c = map(int,input().split())
if a==b==c:
    print('Equilateral')
elif a==b or b==c or a==c:
    print('Isosceles')
else:
    print('Scalene')
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 1 1```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variables a, b and c are initialized to 1, 1 and 1, respectively.
The code checks if a, b and c are equal. If so, it prints Equilateral.
The code then checks if a, b or c are equal. If so, it prints Isosceles.
The code then checks if a, b and c are equal. If so, it prints Scalene.
The code then prints the value of a, b and c, which is 1 1 1.
<<<Output>>>
Equilateral
