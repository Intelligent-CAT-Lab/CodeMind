Instruction: I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
For example:

Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
20 2 5
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
Consider the following code:

a,b,x = map(int, input().split())
print('YES' if a<=x and a+b>=x else 'NO')
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
3 5 4

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable a, variable b and variable x are initialized to 3, 5 and 4, respectively.
The code checks if a<=x and a+b>=x, which is true in this case.
The code prints 'YES' if the condition is met, and 'NO' otherwise.

The output of code execution is:
YES
END-OF-OUTPUT

Input:
The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains three space-separated integers N, A and B.

Output:
For each test case, print a single line containing the answer to the problem.

Constraints:
1≤T≤100
1≤N≤100
1≤A≤B≤100

Subtasks:
Subtask #1 (100 points): original constraints

Example Input:
2
20 2 5
3 5 4

Example Output:
84
YES

Explanation:
Example case 1:
The sum of numbers meeting the condition is 84.

Example case 2:
The condition is met when x is 4.
