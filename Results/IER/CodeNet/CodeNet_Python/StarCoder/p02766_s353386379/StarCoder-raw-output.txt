The variable N is initialized to 11, and variable K is initialized to 2.
The code then calls the function Base_10_to_n with the arguments 11 and 2.
The function Base_10_to_n first checks if the quotient of X/n is nonzero. If it is, it calls itself again with the arguments int(X/n) and n. The function returns the string obtained by concatenating the return value of the recursive call with the remainder of X%n.
The function Base_10_to_n returns the string obtained by concatenating the return value of the recursive call with the remainder of X%n.
The code then prints the length of the string returned by the function Base_10_to_n, which is 5.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def Base_10_to_n(X, n):
    if (int(X/n)):
        return Base_10_to_n(int(X/n), n)+str(X%n)
    return str(X%n)

N,K = input().split()
print(Base_10_to_n(int(N), int(K)))
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```11 2
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
