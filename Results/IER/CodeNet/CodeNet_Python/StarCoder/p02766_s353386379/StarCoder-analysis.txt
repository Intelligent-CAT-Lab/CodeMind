The variable N is initialized to 11, and variable K is initialized to 2.
The code then calls the function Base_10_to_n with the arguments 11 and 2.
The function Base_10_to_n first checks if the quotient of X/n is nonzero. If it is, it calls itself again with the arguments int(X/n) and n. The function returns the string obtained by concatenating the return value of the recursive call with the remainder of X%n.
The function Base_10_to_n returns the string obtained by concatenating the return value of the recursive call with the remainder of X%n.
The code then prints the length of the string returned by the function Base_10_to_n, which is 5.
