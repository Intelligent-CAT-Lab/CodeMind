Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N is initialized to 4.
The code calculates the value of 1-(N//2)/N, which is 0.25.
The code prints the final value of 1-(N//2)/N, which is 0.25.
<<<Output>>>
0.25

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N=int(input())
sum_1=0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_1+=i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
