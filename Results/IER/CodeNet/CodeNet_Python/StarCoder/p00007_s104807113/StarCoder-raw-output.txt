The variable n is initialized to 5.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 4.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the debt of the company.
The code calculates the debt of the company by adding 1000 to the current debt, then multiplying the debt by 0.05, then multiplying the result by 0.001, then rounding the result to the nearest integer, and finally adding 1000 to the result.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of the debt, which is 100000 + 1000 + 1000 + 1000 + 1000 + 1000 + 1000 + 1000 + 1000 + 1000 = 110000.
<<<Output>>>
110000
