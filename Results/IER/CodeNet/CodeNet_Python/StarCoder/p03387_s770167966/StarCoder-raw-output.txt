The variables A, B and C are initialized to 2, 5 and 4, respectively.
The variable m is initialized to the maximum of A, B and C, which is 5.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the number of moves.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to m-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 4.
For each number i in this range, it adds i to ans.

For each number i in this range, it adds i to C.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 2 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 2.
For each number i in this range, it checks if A, B and C are equal to m. If they are, the condition is met when i is 0,1 and 2.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 3.
