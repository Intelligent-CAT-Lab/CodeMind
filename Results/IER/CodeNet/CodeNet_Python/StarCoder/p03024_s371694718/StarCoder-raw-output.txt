The variable s is initialized to the string "oxoxoxoxoxoxox".
The code counts the number of occurrences of the character "x" in the string s and stores it in the variable batu.
The code counts the number of occurrences of the character "o" in the string s and stores it in the variable maru.
The code calculates the length of the string s and stores it in the variable leng.
The code checks if 15-batu is greater than or equal to 8. If it is, it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".
<<<Output>>>
YES

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
s=str(input())

batu=s.count("x")
maru=s.count("o")
leng=len(s)

if 15-batu>=8:
    print("YES")
else:
    print("NO")
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
