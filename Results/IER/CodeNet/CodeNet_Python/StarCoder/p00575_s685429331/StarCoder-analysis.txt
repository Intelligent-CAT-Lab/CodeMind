Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variables a, b and c are initialized to 3, 0 and 10, respectively.
The variable d is initialized to 0.
The variable i is initialized to 1.
The code enters a while loop that will continue until the condition is met.
The code checks if i is divisible by 7. If it is, it adds a+b to d. If it is not, it adds a to d.
The code checks if d is greater than or equal to c. If it is, it breaks out of the loop.
The code increments i by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of i, which is 11.
