The variable s is initialized to 1234567876.
The variable a is initialized to the length of s, which is 10.
The variable c is initialized to 10000.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to a-2 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 8.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the absolute difference between 753 and the number represented by the substring s[i:i+3]. The substring s[i:i+3] represents the number 123, 234, 345, 456, 567, 678, 787 and 876, respectively.
The code updates c to the minimum of the current value of c and the absolute difference between 753 and the number represented by the substring s[i:i+3].
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of c, which is 1.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if sum_order % 3 == 0:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
