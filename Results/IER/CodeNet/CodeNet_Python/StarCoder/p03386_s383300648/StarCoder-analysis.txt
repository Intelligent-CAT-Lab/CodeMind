Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable A, variable B and variable K are initialized to 3, 8 and 2, respectively.
The code checks if A+K-1 is greater than or equal to B-K+1.
If it is, the code enters a loop that iterates from A to B (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 3 to 8.
For each number i in this range, it prints the current number i.
If it is not, the code enters two loops, one that iterates from A to A+K-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 3 to 4.
For each number i in this range, it prints the current number i.
The other loop iterates from B-K+1 to B (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 7 to 8.
For each number i in this range, it prints the current number i.
