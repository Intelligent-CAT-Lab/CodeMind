Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable A, variable B and variable K are initialized to 3, 8 and 2, respectively.
The code checks if A+K-1 is greater than or equal to B-K+1.
If it is, the code enters a loop that iterates from A to B (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 3 to 8.
For each number i in this range, it prints the current number i.
If it is not, the code enters two loops, one that iterates from A to A+K-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 3 to 4.
For each number i in this range, it prints the current number i.
The other loop iterates from B-K+1 to B (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 7 to 8.
For each number i in this range, it prints the current number i.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())

for i in range(1, N+1):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        print(i)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The variable N is initialized to 10.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to
