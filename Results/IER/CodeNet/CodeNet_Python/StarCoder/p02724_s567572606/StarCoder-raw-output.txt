The variable X is initialized to 1024.
variable s is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the number of 500s.
variable p is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the number of 5s.
The code enters a while loop that iterates as long as X is greater than or equal to 500.
Inside the loop, X is decremented by 500.
The code enters another while loop that iterates as long as X is greater than or equal to 5.
Inside the loop, X is decremented by 5.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of 1000*s+5*p, which is 1024.
<<<Output>>>
1024

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if sum_order % 3 == 0:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
