Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable X is initialized to 1024.
variable s is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the number of 500s.
variable p is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the number of 5s.
The code enters a while loop that iterates as long as X is greater than or equal to 500.
Inside the loop, X is decremented by 500.
The code enters another while loop that iterates as long as X is greater than or equal to 5.
Inside the loop, X is decremented by 5.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of 1000*s+5*p, which is 1024.
