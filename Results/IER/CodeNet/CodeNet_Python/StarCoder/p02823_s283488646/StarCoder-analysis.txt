Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 5, 2 and 4, respectively.
The code checks if the absolute difference between A and B is even. If it is, it prints the answer (abs(A-B)//2).
If it is not, it checks if (A-1) < (N-B). If it is, it prints the answer ((A-1)+1+(B-A-1)//2).
If it is not, it prints the answer ((N-B)+1+(B-A-1)//2).
