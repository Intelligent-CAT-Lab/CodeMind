rint the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable n is initialized to 24.
The code then calculates the factorization of n, which is [2, 2, 2, 3].
The code then initializes a variable r to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the list of factors nfac.
For each factor nfe in this list, the code initializes a variable c to 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to nfe[1] (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to nfe[1].
For each number c in this range, it adds 1 to r. The condition is met when c is 1,2,3,4.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of r, which is 4.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:

    def factorization(n):
        arr = []
        temp = n
        for i in range(2, int(-(-n ** 0.5 // 1)) + 1):
            if temp % i == 0:
                cnt = 0
                while temp % i == 0:
                    cnt += 1
                    temp //= i
                arr.append([i, cnt])
        if temp!= 1:
            arr.append([temp, 1])
        if arr == []:
            arr.append([n, 1])
        return arr

    n = int(input())
    if n == 1:
        print(0)
        sys.exit()
    nfac = factorization(n)
    r = 0
    for nfe in nfac:
