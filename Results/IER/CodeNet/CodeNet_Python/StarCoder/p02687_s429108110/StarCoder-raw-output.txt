Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The code first reads the input and stores it in the variable s.
The code then checks if s is equal to 'ABC'. If it is, it prints 'ARC' and exits the program.
If s is not equal to 'ABC', the code prints 'ABC' and exits the program.
<<<Output>>>
ARC
