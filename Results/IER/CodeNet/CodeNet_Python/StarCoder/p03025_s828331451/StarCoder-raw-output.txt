The variable n, variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized to 1, 25, 25 and 50, respectively.
The code calls the function init(2*n) to initialize the variables f and invf.
The code initializes the variable m to 0.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 1.
For each number k in this range, it calculates the value of m as follows:
m = (m+comb(n+k,n)*(pow(a,n,mod)*pow(b,k,mod)+pow(a,k,mod)*pow(b,n,mod))*inv(pow(100-c,n+k+1,mod)))%mod
The value of m is then updated to the new value of m.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of m, which is 1000000005.
<<<Output>>>
1000000005

def is_prime(n):
    if n == 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2,n):
        if n%i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def prime_factors(n):
    factors = []
    while n%2 == 0:
        factors.append(2)
        n = n//2
    for i in range(3,int(n**0.5)+1,2):
        while n%i == 0:
            factors.append(i)
            n = n//i
    if n >
