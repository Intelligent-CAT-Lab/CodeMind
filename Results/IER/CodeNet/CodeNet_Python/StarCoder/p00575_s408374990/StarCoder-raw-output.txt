Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable s is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The variable d is initialized to 1, which will be used to count the number of iterations.
The code then enters a loop that iterates until the condition is met.
The code adds A to s, which is 3 in this case.
The code checks if d is divisible by 7, which is true for 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63, 70, 77, 84, 91, 98, 105, 112, 119, 126, 133, 140, 147, 154, 161, 168, 175, 182, 189, 196, 203, 210, 217, 224, 231, 238, 245, 252, 259, 266, 273, 280, 287, 294, 301, 308, 315, 322, 329, 336, 343, 350, 357, 364, 371, 378, 385, 392, 399, 406, 413, 420, 427, 434, 441, 448, 455, 462, 469, 476, 483, 490, 497, 504, 511, 518, 525, 532, 539, 546, 553, 560, 567, 574, 581, 588, 595, 602, 609, 616, 623, 630, 637, 644, 651, 658, 665, 672, 679, 686, 693, 700, 707, 714, 721, 728, 735, 742, 749, 756, 763, 770, 777, 784, 791, 798, 805, 812, 819, 826, 833, 840, 847, 854, 861, 868, 875, 882, 889, 896, 903, 910, 917, 924, 931, 938, 945, 952, 959, 966, 973, 980,
