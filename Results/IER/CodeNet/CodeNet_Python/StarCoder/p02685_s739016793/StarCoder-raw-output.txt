The variable n, variable m, variable k are initialized to 3, 2 and 1, respectively.
variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a function that calculates the combination of nCk, where n is the number of objects, Ck is the number of combinations, and k is the number of objects to be chosen.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 2 to 20.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to kk (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 2 to 1.
