The code first defines two lists, nouruu and uruu, which contain the number of days in each month in a leap year and a non-leap year, respectively.
The code then defines four variables, Y1, M1, D1, Y2, M2, D2, which are the year, month, day, year, month, day of the first and second dates, respectively.
The code then defines a list L, which is initialized to 2800*366 elements, and an index variable idx, which is initialized to 0.
The code then defines two variables, di and Y1, which are the quotient and remainder of dividing Y1 by 2800.
The code then calculates the number of days between the first and second dates, and stores it in ans1.
The code then defines two variables, di and Y2, which are the quotient and remainder of dividing Y2 by 2800.
The code then calculates the number of days between the first and second dates, and stores it in ans2.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 2800 (inclusive), meaning it will consider years from 0 to 2800.
The code then checks if the current year y is a leap year, and assigns the list l to uruu if it is, and assigns the list l to nouruu if it is not.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 12 (inclusive), meaning it will consider months from 1 to 12.
The code then defines a variable d_13, which is the sum of idx and 12.
The code then checks if d_13 is divisible by 7, and if it is, it sets the element of L at index d_13 to 1.
The code then checks if Y1 is equal to y and if M1 is equal to m, and if it is, it calculates the number of days between the first and second dates, and adds it to ans1.
The code then checks if Y2 is equal to y and if M2 is equal to m, and if it is, it calculates the number of days between the first and second dates, and adds it to ans2.
The code then increments idx by the number of days in the current month.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans2-ans1, which is 0.
