Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable n is initialized to 5.
The code checks if n is equal to 1. If it is, it prints 1 and ends the program.
Otherwise, the code initializes a list named ans with the first two terms of the sequence.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n-2 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 3.
For each number i in this range, it adds the previous two terms of the sequence and appends the result to the list ans.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 13.
<<<Output>>>
13

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
n = int(input())
if n == 1:
    print(1)
else:
    ans = [1,1]
    for i in range(n-1):
        ans.append(ans[-1]+ans[-2])
    print(ans[-1])
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
