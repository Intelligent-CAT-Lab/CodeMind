The variable n is initialized to 2, and variable k is initialized to 3.
The code then checks if n is greater than k. If it is, it prints 0 and exits the program.
If n is not greater than k, the code calculates the factorial of k and stores it in the list facts.
The code then calculates the factorial of k-n and stores it in the list facts.
The code then calculates the product of the two numbers and prints the result.
