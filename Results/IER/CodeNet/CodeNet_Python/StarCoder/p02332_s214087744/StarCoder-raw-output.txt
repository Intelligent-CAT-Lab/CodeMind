Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable n is initialized to 2, and variable k is initialized to 3.
The code then checks if n is greater than k. If it is, it prints 0 and exits the program.
If n is not greater than k, the code calculates the factorial of k and stores it in the list facts.
The code then calculates the factorial of k-n and stores it in the list facts.
The code then calculates the product of the two numbers and prints the result.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
from functools import lru_cache
import sys
mod=1000000007

n,k=[int(i) for i in input().split(" ")]

facts=[1 for i in range(k+1)]

for i in range(1,k+1):
    facts[i]=i*facts[i-1]



if n>k:
    print(0)
    sys.exit()

print((facts[k]
