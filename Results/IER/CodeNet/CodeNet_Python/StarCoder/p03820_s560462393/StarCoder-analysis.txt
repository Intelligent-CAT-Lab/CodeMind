The code first defines a function cmb(n, r, mod) that calculates the number of combinations of n objects taken r at a time.
The function is called with the following parameters:
n = 5000
r = 1
mod = 10**9+7
The function returns the number of combinations of 5000 objects taken 1 at a time.
The code then defines the following variables:
mod = 10**9+7 #出力の制限
N = 5000
g1 = [1, 1] # 元テーブル
g2 = [1, 1] #逆元テーブル
inverse = [0, 1] #逆元テーブル計算用テーブル
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 2 to 5000.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the following:
g1.append( ( g1[-1] * i ) % mod )
inverse.append( ( -inverse[mod % i] * (mod//i) ) % mod )
g2.append( (g2[-1] * inverse[-1]) % mod )
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to K (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 1.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the following:
dp=[[0 for i in range(K+1)] for j in range(K)]
imos=[0]*(K+1)
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to K (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 1.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the following:
dp=[[0 for i in range(K+1)] for j in range(K)]
imos=[0]*(K+1)
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to K (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 1.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the following:
dp=[[0 for i in range(K+1)] for j in range(K)]
imos=[0]*(K+1)
