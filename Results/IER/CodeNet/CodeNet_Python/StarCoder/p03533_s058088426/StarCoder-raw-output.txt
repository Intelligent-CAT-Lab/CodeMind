The code uses regular expressions to match the input string with the regular expression 'A?KIHA?BA?RA?$'.
The regular expression is a pattern that matches a string.
The pattern is composed of the following parts:
A? - matches the string 'A' zero or one times
KIHA? - matches the string 'KIHA' zero or one times
BA? - matches the string 'BA' zero or one times
RA? - matches the string 'RA' zero or one times
$ - matches the end of the string
The pattern matches the string 'KIHBR' because it matches all the parts of the pattern.
The code then prints 'YES' because the pattern matches the input string.
<<<Output>>>
