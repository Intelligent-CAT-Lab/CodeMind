Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variables A, B and C are initialized to 50, 100 and 120, respectively.
The code checks if A+B is greater than or equal to C. Since 50+100=150 is greater than or equal to 120, the code prints 'Yes'.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N,K=map(int,input().split())
sum_1=0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order=0
    i_str=str(i)
    n=len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order+=int(i_str[j])
    if sum_order%K==0:
        sum_1+=i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
