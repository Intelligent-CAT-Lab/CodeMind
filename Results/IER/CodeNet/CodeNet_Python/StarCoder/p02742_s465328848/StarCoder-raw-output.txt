Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable H and variable W are initialized to 4 and 5, respectively.
The code checks if H or W is equal to 1. If so, it prints 1 and exits the program.
Otherwise, it calculates the number of cells in the grid and stores it in ans.
The code then prints the final value of ans, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import sys
 
input = sys.stdin.readline
N = int(input())

if N == 1:
    print(1)
    exit(0)

ans = 1
for i in range(2,N+1):
    ans *= i
print(ans)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N is initialized to 4.
The code checks if N is equal to 1. If so, it prints 1 and exits the program.
Otherwise, it calculates the factorial of N and stores it in ans.
The code then prints the final value of ans, which is 24.
<<<Output>>>
24
