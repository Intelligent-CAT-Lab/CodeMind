The variable n is initialized to 7.
The code checks if n is equal to 2. If it is, it prints -1 and exits.
Otherwise, it initializes the variable r to the range [0, 6].
The variable s is initialized to the list [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6].
The variable A is initialized to a list of lists. The first dimension of A is the same as s, and the second dimension of A is the same as r.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 6 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 6.
For each number i in this range, it enters another loop that iterates from 0 to 6 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 6.
For each number j in this range, it calculates the value of A[j][i] and stores it in the variable a.
The code then checks if a is equal to j+1. If it is, it swaps the values of A[j][i] and A[j][i-n].
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of A, which is:
```
1 2 3 4 5 6 0
2 3 4 5 6 0 1
3 4 5 6 0 1 2
4 5 6 0 1 2 3
5 6 0 1 2 3 4
6 0 1 2 3 4 5
0 1 2 3 4 5 6
```
<<<Output>>>
1 2 3 4 5 6 0
2 3 4 5 6 0 1
3 4 5 6 0 1 2
4 5 6 0 1 2 3
5 6 0 1 2 3 4
6 0 1 2 3 4 5
0 1 2 3 4 5 6
