The variable N, variable K are initialized to 3 and 2, respectively.
The variable M is initialized to the square root of N, which is 1.5811388300841898.
The variable T is initialized to a list of length M, which is [1, 1, 1].
The variable A is initialized to a list of length N, which is [1, 1, 1, 0, 0].
The variable dp is initialized to a list of length N, which is [1, 1, 1, 0, 0].
The code then enters a loop that iterates K times, meaning it will consider 2 times.
The code calculates the cumulative sum of dp, which is [1, 2, 3, 3, 3].
The code then multiplies A and dp, which is [1, 2, 3, 0, 0] * [1, 2, 3, 3, 3] = [1, 4, 9, 0, 0].
The code then calculates the cumulative sum of the result, which is [1, 5, 14, 14, 14].
The code then prints the final value of the cumulative sum, which is 14.
