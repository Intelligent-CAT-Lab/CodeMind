Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable W, variable A and variable B are initialized to 3, 2 and 6, respectively.
The code then calculates the values of x, y and z.
x is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the minimum of the three values.
y is initialized to the absolute value of A - (B + W), which is 1.
z is initialized to the absolute value of B - (A + W), which is 3.
The code then prints the final value of min(x, y, z), which is 1.
