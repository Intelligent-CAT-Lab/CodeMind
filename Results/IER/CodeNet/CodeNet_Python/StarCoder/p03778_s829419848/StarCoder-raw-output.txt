The variable W, variable A and variable B are initialized to 3, 2 and 6, respectively.
The code then calculates the values of x, y and z.
x is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the minimum of the three values.
y is initialized to the absolute value of A - (B + W), which is 1.
z is initialized to the absolute value of B - (A + W), which is 3.
The code then prints the final value of min(x, y, z), which is 1.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, M = map(int, input().split())

def f(n, m):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    if m == 0:
        return 1
    if m == 1:
        return n
    return f(n-1, m) + f(n-1, m-1)

print(f(N, M))
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:

The variable N, variable M are initialized to 3 and 2, respectively.
The function f is defined to calculate the number of ways to choose m elements from a set of n elements.
The function f is called with the arguments N and M.
The function f returns
