Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable H1, variable M1, variable H2, variable M2 and variable K are initialized to 10, 0, 15, 0 and 30, respectively.
The code calculates the difference between the total number of minutes in the time interval [H1, M1] and [H2, M2] and subtracts K from it.
The code then prints the final value of the difference, which is 150.
<<<Output>>>
150
