Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable a is initialized to 3, and variable b is initialized to 2.
The code then divides a by b and stores the quotient in variable d and the remainder in variable r.
The code then calculates the floating point number f by dividing a by b.
The code then prints the values of d, r and f, separated by spaces.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b = tuple(int(n) for n in input().split())

d,r = divmod(a,b)
f = a / b

print("{} {} {:.5f}".format(d,r,f))

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10 3
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
