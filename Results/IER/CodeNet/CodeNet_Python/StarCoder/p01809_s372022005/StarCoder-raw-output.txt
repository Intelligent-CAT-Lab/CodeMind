The code first initializes two variables, p and q, to 1 and 2, respectively.
The code then checks if q is divisible by p. If it is, then q is divided by p and p is set to 1.
The code then calls the function set(), which initializes the list prime to [2].
The function set() then enters a loop that iterates from 3 to 100000 (exclusive) in steps of 2.
For each number i in this range, it calls the function check(i), which checks if i is a prime number.
If it is, it appends i to the list prime.
The function set() then exits the loop.
