The variable x is initialized to "TSTTSS", which is the input.
The variable n is initialized to the length of x, which is 7.
The variable st is initialized to an empty deque.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider the first 7 characters of x.
For each character i in this range, it checks if i is "S". If it is, it appends "S" to the deque st.
If i is not "S", it checks if st is empty. If it is, it appends "T" to the deque st.
If st is not empty, it pops the last element of the deque st and stores it in a.
If a is "T", it appends "T" to the deque st twice.
If a is not "T", it continues to the next iteration of the loop.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the length of the deque st, which is 4.
