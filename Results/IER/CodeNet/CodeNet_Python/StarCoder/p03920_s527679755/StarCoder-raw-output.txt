The function getN() reads the input and returns the integer value of N.
The function getNM() reads the input and returns the integer values of N and M, respectively.
The function getList() reads the input and returns the list of integers.
The variable N is initialized to the return value of getN().
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 10**4 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 10**4.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of all the integers from 1 to i.
The code checks if the sum is greater than or equal to N. If it is, it breaks out of the loop and stores the value of i in M.
The code then calculates the sum of all the integers from 1 to M.
The code calculates the difference between the two sums, which is the number of integers in the list.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to M-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to M-1.
For each number j in this range, it calculates the sum of all the integers from 1 to j.
The code checks if the sum is equal to the difference between the two sums. If it is, it breaks out of the loop and stores the value of j in diff.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to diff-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to diff-1.
For each number k in this range, it prints the value of k.
The code then prints the sum of the numbers in the list, which is 1628.
The code then prints the value of M, which is 10000.
The code then prints the value of upper, which is 50005000.
The code then prints the value of diff, which is 1627.
