The variable n is initialized to 5700.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of the coins.
The list l is initialized to [10000, 5000, 1000, 500], which contains the denominations of the coins.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 3 (inclusive), meaning it will consider the denominations from 10000 to 500.
For each denomination l[i] in this range, it calculates the number of coins of that denomination and stores it in ans.
The code then calculates the remainder of n divided by l[i], which is 0 in this case.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 5700.
