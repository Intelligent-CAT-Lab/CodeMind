The variable n is initialized to 5700.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of the coins.
The list l is initialized to [10000, 5000, 1000, 500], which contains the denominations of the coins.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 3 (inclusive), meaning it will consider the denominations from 10000 to 500.
For each denomination l[i] in this range, it calculates the number of coins of that denomination and stores it in ans.
The code then calculates the remainder of n divided by l[i], which is 0 in this case.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 5700.
<<<Output>>>
5700

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
n = int(input())
ans = 0
l = [10000, 5000, 1000, 500]
for i in range(4) :
    ans += (n // l[i]) * l[i]
    n = n % l[i]
print(ans)
</Code>
