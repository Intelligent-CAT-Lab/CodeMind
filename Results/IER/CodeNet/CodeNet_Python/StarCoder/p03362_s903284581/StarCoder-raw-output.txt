The variable n is initialized to 5.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 2 to 55556 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 2 to 55556.
For each number i in this range, it enters a nested loop that iterates from 2 to i (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 2 to i.
For each number j in this range, it checks if i is divisible by j. If it is, it breaks out of the loop and moves on to the next number i.
If the loop does not break out of the nested loop, it means that i is prime. It appends i to the list p.
The code then enters another loop that iterates from 2 to 55556 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 2 to 55556.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is divisible by 5. If it is, it appends i to the list l.
The code then enters another loop that iterates from 0 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to n.
For each number i in this range, it converts i to a string and appends it to the list ans_list.
The code then prints the final value of ans_list, which is 1 3 7 9 13.
<<<Output>>>
1 3 7 9 13

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def main():
    n = int(input())
    l = []
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        if i%3 == 0 or i%5
