Instruction: I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
For example:

Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
20 2 5
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
Consider the following code:

K, A, B = [int(elem) for elem in input().split()]

if B - A <= 2:
    print(K + 1)
else:
    first_num_exchanges = A + 1
    rest_num_exchanges = K - first_num_exchanges
    gain_per_two_manipulation = B - A
    num_cookies = rest_num_exchanges // 2 * gain_per_two_manipulation + B
    if rest_num_exchanges % 2 == 1:
        num_cookies += 1
    print(num_cookies)

What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
4 2 6

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable K, variable A and variable B are initialized to 4, 2 and 6, respectively.
The code checks if B - A <= 2, which is true in this case.
If it is, the code prints K + 1, which is 5.
If it is not, the code calculates the number of exchanges needed to get from A + 1 to K.
The code calculates the gain per two exchanges, which is B - A = 6 - 2 = 4.
The code calculates the number of cookies after the first exchange, which is 4.
The code calculates the number of exchanges needed to get from K to K - 1.
The code calculates the gain per two exchanges, which is B - A = 6 - 5 = 1.
The code calculates the number of cookies after the second exchange, which is 1.
The code adds the number of cookies after the second exchange to the number of cookies after the first exchange, which is 5 + 1 = 6.
The code prints the final value of num_cookies, which is 6.

The output of code execution is:
6

Question 2:

You are given a list of integers. You need to find the maximum sum of a sublist of non-adjacent elements.

For example, given the list [3, 5, -9, 1, 3, -2, 3, 4, 7, 2, -9, 6, 3, 1, -5, 4], the maximum sum would be 29.

Given the list [3, 5, -9, 1, 3, -2, 3, 4, 7, 2, -
