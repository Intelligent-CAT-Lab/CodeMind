The variable n is initialized to 1199.
The code checks if n is less than 1200. If it is, it prints "ABC".
If n is not less than 1200, it checks if n is less than 2800. If it is, it prints "ARC".
If n is not less than 2800, it checks if n is less than 3000. If it is, it prints "AGC".
After the code finishes, it prints "ABC".
