Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable n is initialized to 1199.
The code checks if n is less than 1200. If it is, it prints "ABC".
If n is not less than 1200, it checks if n is less than 2800. If it is, it prints "ARC".
If n is not less than 2800, it checks if n is less than 3000. If it is, it prints "AGC".
After the code finishes, it prints "ABC".
<<<Output>>>
ABC
[END-OF-RESPONSE]



TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
n=int(input());print("ABC"if n<1200 else"ARC"if n<2800 else"AGC"if n<3000 else"OTHER")
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1199
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
