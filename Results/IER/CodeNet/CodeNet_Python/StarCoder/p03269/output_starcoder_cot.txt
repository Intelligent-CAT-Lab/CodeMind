Instruction: I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
For example:

Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
20 2 5
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
Consider the following code:

l = int(input())

d = max([d for d in range(30) if 2**d <= l])
n = d+1
m = 2*d
ans = []
for i in range(1, n):
    ans.append((i, i+1, 0))
    ans.append((i, i+1, 2**(i-1)))

while l > 2**d:
    for i in range(n-1, 0, -1):
        if l-2**(i-1) > 2**d-1:
            ans.append((i, n, l-2**(i-1)))
            m += 1
            l -= 2**(i-1)
            break

print(n, m)
for a in ans:
    print(*a)
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
4

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable l is initialized to 4.
The code calculates the maximum value of d such that 2**d <= l, which is 2.
The code initializes the variable n to d+1, which is 3.
The code initializes the variable m to 2*d, which is 6.
The code initializes the variable ans to the empty list.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 3.
For each number i in this range, it appends the tuple (i, i+1, 0) to ans.
For each number i in this range, it appends the tuple (i, i+1, 2**(i-1)) to ans.
The code enters a while loop that iterates while l > 2**d, which is true in this case.
The code enters a for loop that iterates from n-1 to 1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 2 to 3.
If l-2**(i-1) > 2**d-1, the code appends the tuple (i, n, l-2**(i-1)) to ans.
The code increments m by 1.
The code decrements l by 2**(i-1).
The code breaks out of the for loop.
The code prints the values of n and m, which are 3 and 6, respectively.
The code enters a for loop that iterates over the list ans.
For each element a in ans, it prints the values of the elements of a, which are 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3,
