Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variables A, B and C are initialized to 6, 4 and 3, respectively.
The variable ans is initialized to C-(A-B), which is 3-(-2), which is 3+2, which is 5.
The code checks if ans is greater than or equal to 0. Since 5 is greater than or equal to 0, the code prints 5.
