The code first imports the deque class from the collections module.
The function calc is defined. It takes one parameter, k, which is the number to be factored.
The function first checks if k is equal to 1. If it is, it returns 1.
Otherwise, it initializes a dictionary d with a single entry, 1:1.
It then initializes a queue q with a single element, [1, 1].
The code then enters a while loop that continues as long as q is not empty.
Inside the loop, it extracts the first element from q, which is [1, 1].
The code then extracts the first and second elements from the list, which are 1 and 1, respectively.
The code then calculates the first digit of the product of n and 10, which is n * 10 % k.
If a is not in d, or if c is less than the value of d[a], then the code adds [a, c] to the queue.
The code then calculates the second digit of the product of n and 10, which is (n * 10 + 1) % k.
If b is not in d, or if c + 1 is less than the value of d[b], then the code adds [b, c + 1] to the queue.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the value of d[0], which is 1.
