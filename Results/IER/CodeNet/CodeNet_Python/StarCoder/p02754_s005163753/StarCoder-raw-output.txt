The variable n, variable a and variable b are initialized to 8, 3 and 4, respectively.
The code checks if n is divisible by a + b. If it is, it prints the result of the division of n by a + b multiplied by a plus the remainder of the division.
If n is not divisible by a + b, it prints the result of the division of n by a + b multiplied by a plus a.
The result of the division of 8 by 7 is 1, so the code prints 1 * 3 + 2 = 5.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
if n % (a + b) <= a:
    print((n // (a + b)) * a + n % (a + b))
else:
    print((n // (a + b)) * a + a)

</Code>
