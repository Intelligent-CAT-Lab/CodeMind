The variable n, variable a and variable b are initialized to 8, 3 and 4, respectively.
The code checks if n is divisible by a + b. If it is, it prints the result of the division of n by a + b multiplied by a plus the remainder of the division.
If n is not divisible by a + b, it prints the result of the division of n by a + b multiplied by a plus a.
The result of the division of 8 by 7 is 1, so the code prints 1 * 3 + 2 = 5.
