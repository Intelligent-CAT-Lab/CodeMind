The variable s is initialized to "abaababaab", which is the input.
The code checks if the length of s is odd. If it is, it removes the last character from s.
The variable N is initialized to the length of s.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to N-1, meaning it will consider all substrings of s.
The variable h is initialized to the integer part of N/2.
The code checks if the first h-1 characters of s are equal to the last h-1 characters of s. If it is, it prints the length of s and quits.
The code then removes the last two characters from s and repeats the loop.
The code exits the loop and quits.
