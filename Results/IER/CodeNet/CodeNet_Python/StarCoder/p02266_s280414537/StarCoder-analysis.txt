The variable data is initialized to "\\//".
The variable xmax is initialized to the length of data, which is 4.
The variable data_list is initialized to a list of characters in data, which is ["\\", "/", "/", "\\"].
The variable reverse_data is initialized to an empty list.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the characters in data_list.
For each character sig in data_list, it checks if sig is "\\" or "/". If it is, it appends "/" to reverse_data. If it is not, it appends sig to reverse_data.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the characters in reverse_data.
For each character sig in reverse_data, it checks if sig is "\\" or "/". If it is, it appends "\\" to reverse_data. If it is not, it appends sig to reverse_data.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the characters in data.
For each character sig in data, it checks if sw is 0 and sig is "\\". If it is, it sets sw to 1.
If sw is 1, it calculates the partial square of h and adds it to totalSqu.
If h is 0, it adds the current x to x_squ_dict, which is 1.
After the loop finishes, the code enters a loop that iterates over the characters in reverse_data.
For each character sig in reverse_data, it checks if sw is 0 and sig is "\\". If it is, it sets sw to 1.
If sw is 1, it calculates the partial square of h and adds it to totalSqu.
If h is 0, it adds the current x to x_squ_dict, which is 4.
After the loop finishes, the code enters a loop that iterates over the keys in x_squ_dict.
For each key in x_squ_dict, it appends the value of the key to squ_list.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the elements in squ_list.
For each element in squ_list, it calculates the sum of squ_list and stores it in a.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the elements in squ_list.
For each element in squ_list, it converts the element to an integer and appends it to squ_list.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the elements in squ_list.
For each element in squ_list, it converts the element to a string and appends it to squ_list.
The code then prints the final value of a, which is 10.
The code then prints the final value of squ_list, which is "4 1 1 1".
