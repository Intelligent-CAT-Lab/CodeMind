Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N is initialized to 1118.
The code checks if the first, second and third characters of N are equal. If they are, it prints 'Yes'.
If the first, second and third characters of N are not equal, it checks if the second and third characters of N are equal. If they are, it prints 'Yes'.
If the second and third characters of N are not equal, it checks if the third character of N is equal. If it is, it prints 'Yes'.
If none of the conditions are met, it prints 'No'.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
[END-OF-RESPONSE]



TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N=input()
if N[0]==N[1]==N[2] or N[1]==N[2]==N[3]:
  print('Yes')
else:
  print('No')
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1119
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
