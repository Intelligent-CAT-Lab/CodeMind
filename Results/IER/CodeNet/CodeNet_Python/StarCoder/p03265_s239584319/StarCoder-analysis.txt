The code first imports the numpy library.
The code then reads the input and converts it to a list of integers.
The code then creates two numpy arrays, p1 and p2, which are the coordinates of the two points.
The code then creates a numpy array v1, which is the vector from p1 to p2.
The code then creates a numpy array v2, which is the vector perpendicular to v1.
The code then creates two numpy arrays, p3 and p4, which are the coordinates of the two points.
The code then prints the coordinates of p3 and p4, which are [0,1] and [1,0], respectively.
