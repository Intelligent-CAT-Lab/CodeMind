Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N is initialized to 3, and variable K is initialized to 2.
The code first checks if K is even or odd.
If K is even, the code counts the number of multiples of K in the range [1, N] and stores the result in cnt1.
The code also counts the number of multiples of K/2 in the range [1, N] and stores the result in cnt2.
The code then prints the sum of the cubes of cnt1 and cnt2, which is 12.
