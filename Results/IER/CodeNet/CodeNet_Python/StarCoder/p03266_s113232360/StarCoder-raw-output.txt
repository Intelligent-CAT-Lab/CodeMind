Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N is initialized to 3, and variable K is initialized to 2.
The code first checks if K is even or odd.
If K is even, the code counts the number of multiples of K in the range [1, N] and stores the result in cnt1.
The code also counts the number of multiples of K/2 in the range [1, N] and stores the result in cnt2.
The code then prints the sum of the cubes of cnt1 and cnt2, which is 12.
<<<Output>>>
12

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())

for i in range(1,N+1):
    if i%2==0:
        print(i, end=' ')

print()

for i in range(1,N+1):
    if i%2!=0:
        print(i, end=' ')

print()

for i in range(1,N+1):
    if i%2==0 and i%3==0:
        print(i, end=' ')

print()

for i in range(1,N+1):
    if i%2!=0 and i%3!=0:
        print(i, end=' ')

print()

for i in range(1,N+1):
    if i%2==0 or i%3==0:
        print(i, end=' ')

print()

for i in range(1,N+1):
    if i%2!=0 or i%3!=0:
        print(i, end=' ')

print()

for i in range(1,N
