Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable n is initialized to 100.
The variable coin is initialized to [25,10,5,1], which is the denominations of the coins.
The variable sum_s is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of coins.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the coin denominations.
For each denomination i in this range, it calculates the number of coins that can be exchanged for the current denomination.
The code adds the number of coins to sum_s.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_s, which is 29.
<<<Output>>>
29

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
n = int(input())
sum_s = 0
for i in range(1,n+1):
    if n % i == 0:
        sum_s += i
print(sum_s)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```100
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable n is initialized to 100.
The variable sum_s is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of factors.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 100.
