Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable n is initialized to 100.
The variable coin is initialized to [25,10,5,1], which is the denominations of the coins.
The variable sum_s is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of coins.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the coin denominations.
For each denomination i in this range, it calculates the number of coins that can be exchanged for the current denomination.
The code adds the number of coins to sum_s.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_s, which is 29.
