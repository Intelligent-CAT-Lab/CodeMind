The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 4, 2 and 3, respectively.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 3.
For each number n in this range, it calculates the number of ways to place 1s in the range [0, n] and stores it in dp1.
