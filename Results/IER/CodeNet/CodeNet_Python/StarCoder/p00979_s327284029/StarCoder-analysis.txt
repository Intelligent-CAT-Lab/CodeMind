The variable n is initialized to 19.
The code enters a loop that will run until the condition reserved + maxspeed * 3 > n is met.
The condition is met when reserved = 1 and maxspeed = 1.
The code then increases maxspeed by 3 and increases reserved by 2.
The code then enters another loop that will run until the condition reserved + maxspeed * 3 > n is met.
The condition is met when reserved = 3 and maxspeed = 3.
The code then increases maxspeed by 9 and increases reserved by 6.
The code then enters another loop that will run until the condition reserved + maxspeed * 3 > n is met.
The condition is met when reserved = 15 and maxspeed = 27.
The code then increases maxspeed by 81 and increases reserved by 144.
The code then enters another loop that will run until the condition reserved + maxspeed * 3 > n is met.
The condition is met when reserved = 19 and maxspeed = 51.
The code then increases maxspeed by 243 and increases reserved by 432.
