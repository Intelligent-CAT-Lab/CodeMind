Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variables T1, T2, R1 and R2 are initialized to 9, 8, 1000 and 999, respectively.
The code checks if R1 and R2 are both -1. If they are, the code checks if T1 is less than T2. If it is, the code prints "Alice". If T1 is greater than T2, the code prints "Bob". If T1 is equal to T2, the code prints "Draw".
If R1 and R2 are not both -1, the code checks if R1 is greater than R2. If it is, the code prints "Alice". If R1 is less than R2, the code prints "Bob". If R1 is equal to R2, the code prints "Draw".
