rint the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N, variable K are initialized to 3 and 2, respectively.
variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 3.
For each number a in this range, it checks if 2 * a % K is not equal to 0. If it is, it skips the current iteration and moves on to the next number. The condition is met when a is 1 and 3.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 1.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, K = map(int, input().split())

ans = 0
for a in range(1, N + 1):
    if 2 * a % K!= 0:
        continue
    ans += (floor((N + a) / K) - ceil((a +
