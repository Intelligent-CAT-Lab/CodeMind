The variable n, variable m are initialized to 2, 2, respectively.
The variable ans1 is initialized to 1, which will be used to accumulate the product of numbers from 1 to n.
The variable ans2 is initialized to 1, which will be used to accumulate the product of numbers from 1 to m.
The variable mod is initialized to 10**9 + 7.
The code checks if the absolute value of n-m is greater than or equal to 2. If it is, it prints 0 and exits.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 2.
For each number i in this range, it multiplies ans1 by i and stores the result in ans1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to m (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 2.
For each number j in this range, it multiplies ans2 by j and stores the result in ans2.
The code checks if the absolute value of m-n is equal to 1. If it is, it prints ans1 * ans2 % mod.
Otherwise, it prints 2 * ans1 * ans2 % mod.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans1 * ans2 % mod, which is 4.
