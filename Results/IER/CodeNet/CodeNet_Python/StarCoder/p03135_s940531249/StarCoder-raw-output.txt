The variable T is initialized to 8, and variable X is initialized to 3.
The code calculates the division of T by X, which is 2.25.
The code prints the final value of the division, which is 2.25.
<<<Output>>>
2.25

Consider the following code:
<Code>
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import sys


def solve(N: int, A: int, B: int):
    print(N * (A + B))
    return

        for line in sys.stdin:
            for word in line.split():
                yield word
    tokens = iterate_tokens()
    N = int(next(tokens))  # type: int
    A = int(next(tokens))  # type: int
    B = int(next(tokens))  # type: int
    solve(N, A, B)
