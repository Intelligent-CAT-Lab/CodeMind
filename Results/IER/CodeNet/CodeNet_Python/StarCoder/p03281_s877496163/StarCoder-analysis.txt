The variable n is initialized to 105.
The code checks if n is less than 105. If it is, it prints 0 and ends.
Otherwise, the code initializes variable ans to 0.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 105 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 105 to n.
For each number i in this range, it initializes variable cnt to 0.
The code enters another loop that iterates from 1 to i (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to i.
For each number j in this range, it checks if i is divisible by j. If it is, it adds 1 to cnt.
After the inner loop finishes, the code checks if cnt is equal to 8. If it is, it adds 1 to ans.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 1.
