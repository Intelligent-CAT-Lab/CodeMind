Instruction: I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
For example:

Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
20 2 5
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
Consider the following code:

# coding: utf-8

MOD = 998244353

def getInv(N):
    inv = [0] * (N + 1)
    inv[1] = 1
    inv[1] = 1
    for i in range(2, N + 1):
        inv[i] = (-(MOD // i) * inv[MOD % i]) % MOD

    return inv

def getCmb(N):
    inv = getInv(N)
    nCr = [0] * (N + 1)
    nCr[0] = 1
    nCr[0] = 1
    
    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        nCr[i] = (nCr[i - 1] * (N - i + 1) * inv[i]) % MOD
    
    return nCr

def solve(N, A, B, K):
    ans = 0
    nCr = getCmb(N)
    for a in range(N + 1):
        b = (K - A * a) // B
        if (A * a + B * b == K) and (0 <= b <= N):
            ans += (nCr[a] * nCr[b]) % MOD
            ans %= MOD
    return ans
    

if __name__ == "__main__":
    N, A, B, K = map(int, input().split())
    print(solve(N,A,B,K))

What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
4 1 2 5

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N, variable A, variable B and variable K are initialized to 4, 1, 2 and 5, respectively.
The code then calls the function getCmb(N) to get the list of combinations of N.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 4.
For each number a in this range, it calculates the value of b as (K - A * a) // B.
The code checks if (A * a + B * b == K) and (0 <= b <= N), which is true when a is 0,1,2,3 and b is 0,1,2,3.
If the condition is met, it adds the value of nCr[a] * nCr[b] to ans.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 10.

The output of code execution is:
10
