The variable n, variable k are initialized to 4 and 3, respectively.
The code then calculates the number of ways to choose k elements from n elements.
The number of ways to choose k elements from n elements is calculated by the following formula:
```
C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!)
```
The code then calculates the number of ways to choose k elements from n elements.
