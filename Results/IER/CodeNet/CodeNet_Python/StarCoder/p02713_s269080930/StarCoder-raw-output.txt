The variable K is initialized to 2.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to K (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 2.
For each number i in this range, it enters another loop that iterates from 1 to K (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 2.
For each number j in this range, it enters another loop that iterates from 1 to K (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 2.
For each number k in this range, it calculates the greatest common divisor of i, j and k and adds it to ans.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())
ans = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    for j in range(1,N+1):
        ans += i*j
print(ans)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
