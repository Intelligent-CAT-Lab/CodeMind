The variable K is initialized to 2.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to K (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 2.
For each number i in this range, it enters another loop that iterates from 1 to K (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 2.
For each number j in this range, it enters another loop that iterates from 1 to K (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 2.
For each number k in this range, it calculates the greatest common divisor of i, j and k and adds it to ans.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 10.
