The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 5, 1 and 3, respectively.
The code checks if B is equal to 0. If it is, it prints 1 and exits.
Otherwise, the code initializes the variable MOD to 998244353.
The code initializes the array F with 1000000 elements, which will be used to store the values of the factorial function.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 5.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the factorial of i and stores it in f.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 5.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the factorial inverse of i and stores it in fi.
The code initializes the variable z to 0, which will be used to accumulate the answer.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to min(A + 1, N - B) if N - B - A is non-negative, meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to min(1 + 1, 5 - 3) = 1, which is 1.
For each number k in this range, it calculates the following:
x = (B - k) * F[B + k - 1] * FI[B] * FI[k] % MOD
y = F[N + A - B - 2 * k - 1] * FI[N - B - k - 1] * FI[A - k] % MOD
z = (z + x * y) % MOD
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of z, which is 10.
