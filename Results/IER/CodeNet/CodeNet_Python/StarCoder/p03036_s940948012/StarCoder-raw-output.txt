The variable r, variable d and variable x are initialized to 2, 10 and 20, respectively.
The code enters a loop that iterates 10 times.
Inside the loop, the code calculates the new value of x by multiplying r by x and subtracting d from it.
The code prints the new value of x.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of x, which is 100.
<<<Output>>>
