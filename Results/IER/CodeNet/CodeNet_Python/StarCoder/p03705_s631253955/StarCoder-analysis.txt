Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable n, variable a and variable b are initialized to 4, 4 and 6, respectively.
The code checks if b - a < 0 or n == 1 and b - a > 0.
If it is, it prints 0 and ends.
If it is not, it checks if n == 1.
If it is, it prints 1 and ends.
If it is not, it calculates the answer as (n-2)*(b-a)+1 and prints it.
