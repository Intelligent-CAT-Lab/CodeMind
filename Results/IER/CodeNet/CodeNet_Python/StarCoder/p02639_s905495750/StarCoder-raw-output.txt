The variable x is initialized to a list of integers, which is [0, 2, 3, 4, 5].
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to the length of x (inclusive), which is 5 in this case.
For each number i in this range, it checks if x[i] is equal to 0. If it is, it prints the index of the current number i plus 1, which is 1 for i=0, 2 for i=1, 3 for i=2, 4 for i=3 and 5 for i=4.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 1 2 3 4 5.
<<<Output>>>
1 2 3 4 5

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
x = list(map(int, input().split()))

for i in range(len(x)):
    if x[i] == 0:
        print(i+1)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```0 2 3 4 5 0
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
