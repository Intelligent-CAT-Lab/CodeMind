The function examC() is called.
The variable St is initialized to the function S().
The variable t is initialized to the list ["dream", "dreamer", "erase", "eraser"].
The variable i is initialized to the length of St, which is 10.
The variable cur is initialized to the empty string.
The code enters a while loop that iterates from i to 0 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 10 to 0.
The variable cur is initialized to the concatenation of the current character of St and cur.
The variable i is decremented by 1.
The code checks if cur is in t. If it is, it sets cur to the empty string.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if the length of cur is 0. If it is, it sets ans to "YES". Otherwise, it sets ans to "NO".
The code prints the final value of ans, which is "YES".
<<<Output>>>
YES

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def examD():
    N = I()
    A = LI()
    B = LI()
    C = LI()
    D = LI()
    E = LI()
    F = LI()
    G = LI()
    H = LI()
    ans = 0
    for i in range(N):
        if A[i] == 1:
            ans += B[i]
        elif A[i] == 2:
            ans += C[i]
        elif A[i] == 3:
            ans += D[i]
        elif A[i] == 4:
            ans += E[i]
        elif A[i] == 5:
            ans += F[i]
