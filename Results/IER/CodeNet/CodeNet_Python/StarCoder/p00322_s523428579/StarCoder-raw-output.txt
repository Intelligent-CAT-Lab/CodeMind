The code first initializes a list lst with the values 7, 6, -1, 1, -1, 9, 2, 3, 4.
The code then initializes a set rest with the values 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over all possible permutations of rest.
For each permutation, it creates a temporary list tmp by copying the values of lst.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the indices of the permutation.
For each index, it replaces the value of the temporary list tmp at that index with the value of the permutation.
The code then calls the function judge to check if the temporary list tmp is a valid solution.
If it is, it adds 1 to ans.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 1.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def solve(n):
  if n == 1:
    return 1
  if n == 2:
    return 2
  if n == 3:
    return 4
  return solve(n-1) + solve(n-2) + solve(n-3)

n = int(input())
print(solve(n))
