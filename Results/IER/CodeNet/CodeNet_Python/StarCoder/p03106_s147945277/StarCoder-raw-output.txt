Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable a, variable b and variable k are initialized to 8, 12 and 2, respectively.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to min(a,b) (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 8.
For each number val in this range, it checks if a is divisible by val and b is divisible by val. If it is, it adds the current number val to the list ans.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is [2, 4, 8].

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
n = int(input())

ans = 0
for i in range(1,n+1):
    if n % i == 0:
        ans += i

print(ans)
</Code>
