Instruction: I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
For example:

Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
20 2 5
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
Consider the following code:

import bisect
s = input()
if s[-1] == "1" or s[0] == "0":
    print(-1)
    exit()

for i in range((len(s) - 1) // 2):
    # print(i,len(s)- i - 2)
    if s[i]!= s[len(s) - i -2]:
        print(-1)
        exit()

sd = s[:-1] + '1'
plist = [i for i, v in enumerate(sd) if v == '1']
# print(plist)
for i,v in enumerate(s[:-1]):
    r = bisect.bisect(plist,i)
    print(i+1,plist[r] + 1)


What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
1111

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The code first checks if the last digit of the input is 1 or the first digit is 0. If either of these is true, the code prints -1 and exits.
Otherwise, the code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to half of the length of the input string minus 2.
For each iteration, it checks if the i-th and the length of the input string minus 1 minus i-th characters are equal. If they are not, the code prints -1 and exits.
Otherwise, it calculates the prefix sum of the input string.
The prefix sum is a list of indices where the value of the input string changes from 0 to 1.
For example, the prefix sum of the string 1111 is [0, 1, 2, 3, 4].
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to the length of the input string minus 1.
For each iteration, it calculates the index of the first element in the prefix sum list that is greater than or equal to i.
The code then prints the value of i+1 and the value of the index of the first element in the prefix sum list that is greater than or equal to i.

The output of code execution is:
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
