Instruction: I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
For example:

Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
20 2 5
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
Consider the following code:

N=int(input())
X=P=0
for i in range(10) :
  P=i*111
  if X < N and N <= P :
    print(P)
  X=P
    
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
111

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N is initialized to 111.
The variable X is initialized to 0.
The variable P is initialized to 0.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 9 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 9.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the product of i and 111 and stores it in P.
The code checks if N is less than P and if P is less than or equal to N. If both conditions are met, it prints the current value of P. The condition is met when i is 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 and 9.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of P, which is 1110.

The output of code execution is:
1110
END-OF-OUTPUT

Question 2:

You are given a list of integers. You need to find the maximum sum of a sublist of non-adjacent numbers.

For example, given the list [3, 4, -8, 6, 2, -1, 7, 9], the maximum sum would be 29, which is the sum of the sublist [6, 2, -1, 7, 9].

Given the list [-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4], the maximum sum would be 6, which is the sum of the sublist [4, -1, 2, 1].
