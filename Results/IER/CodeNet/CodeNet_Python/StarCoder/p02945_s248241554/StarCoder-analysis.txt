Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable a is initialized to -13, and variable b is initialized to 3.
The code checks if a+b is greater than or equal to a-b and a+b is greater than or equal to a*b.
Since a+b is -10 and a-b is -10, a+b is greater than or equal to a-b, and a+b is greater than or equal to a*b.
The code then prints the value of a+b, which is -10.
