Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable a is initialized to -13, and variable b is initialized to 3.
The code checks if a+b is greater than or equal to a-b and a+b is greater than or equal to a*b.
Since a+b is -10 and a-b is -10, a+b is greater than or equal to a-b, and a+b is greater than or equal to a*b.
The code then prints the value of a+b, which is -10.
<<<Output>>>
-10

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b=map(int,input().split())
if a+b>=a-b and a+b>=a*b:
    print(a+b)
elif a-b>=a+b and a-b>=a*b:
    print(a-b)
else:
    print(a*b)
</Code>
