Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable S is initialized to 1222.
The code enters a loop that iterates over all possible combinations of the three characters "+", "-", and "".
For each combination, it calculates the sum of the digits of S and the current combination, and checks if the result is 7.
If it is, it prints the sum and the result, and breaks the loop.
After the loop finishes, the code does not print anything.
