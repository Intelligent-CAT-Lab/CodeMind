Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable n is initialized to [3, 5], which is the input.
The code prints the product of the first two numbers in n, which is 15.
The code prints the sum of the first two numbers in n, which is 8.
<<<Output>>>
15 8
[END-OF-RESPONSE]



TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
# coding: utf-8
n = list(map(int,input().split()))
print(n[0]*n[1],(n[0]+n[1])*2)

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
