Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N, variable A, variable B, variable C and variable D are initialized to 5, 1, 5, 2 and 4, respectively.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to N-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 4.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the left and right boundaries of the answer.
The code checks if B is within the range [l, r], which is [1, 6] in this case. If it is, it prints "YES" and breaks the loop. The condition is met when i is 0.
After the loop finishes, the code prints "NO".
