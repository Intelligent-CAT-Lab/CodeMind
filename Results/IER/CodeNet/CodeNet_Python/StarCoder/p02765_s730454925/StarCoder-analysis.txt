The variable n is initialized to 2, and variable r is initialized to 2919.
The code checks if n is less than 10. If it is, it calculates the value of z as r plus 100 times 10 minus n. In this case, n is 2, so z is 2919 plus 100 times 10 minus 2, which is 2919 plus 100 times 8, which is 2919 plus 800, which is 3719.
If n is not less than 10, the code calculates the value of z as r. In this case, n is 2, so z is 2919.
After the code finishes, it prints the final value of z, which is 3719.
