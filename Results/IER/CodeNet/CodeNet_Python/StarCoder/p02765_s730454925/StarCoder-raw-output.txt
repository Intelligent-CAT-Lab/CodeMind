The variable n is initialized to 2, and variable r is initialized to 2919.
The code checks if n is less than 10. If it is, it calculates the value of z as r plus 100 times 10 minus n. In this case, n is 2, so z is 2919 plus 100 times 10 minus 2, which is 2919 plus 100 times 8, which is 2919 plus 800, which is 3719.
If n is not less than 10, the code calculates the value of z as r. In this case, n is 2, so z is 2919.
After the code finishes, it prints the final value of z, which is 3719.
<<<Output>>>
3719

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
n,k=[int(x) for x in input().split()]
if n<10:
    z=k+(100*(10-n))
else:
    z=k
print(z)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 2919
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
