Instruction: I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
For example:

Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
20 2 5
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
Consider the following code:

import sys
N=int(input())
for h in range(1,3501):
    for n in range(h,3501):
        if 4*n*h-N*h-N*n >0:
            if (N*h*n)%(4*n*h-N*h-N*n)==0:
                w=int((N*h*n)/(4*n*h-N*h-N*n))
                print(h,n,w)
                sys.exit()
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
2

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N is initialized to 2.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 3500 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 3500.
For each number h in this range, it enters another loop that iterates from h to 3500 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from h to 3500.
For each number n in this range, it calculates the value of 4*n*h-N*h-N*n.
The code checks if 4*n*h-N*h-N*n is positive.
If it is, it calculates the value of (N*h*n)/(4*n*h-N*h-N*n).
The code prints the values of h, n and w, which are 1, 1, 2.

The output of code execution is:
1 1 2
