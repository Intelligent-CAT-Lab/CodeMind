Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variables a, b, c and d are initialized to 1, 1, 2 and 2, respectively.
The variable mod is initialized to 998244353.
The variable dp is initialized to a 2-dimensional array of size (c+1) x (d+1) with all elements initialized to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from a+1 to c+1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 2 to 2.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the value of dp[i][b] as dp[i-1][b]*b.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from b+1 to d+1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 2 to 2.
For each number j in this range, it calculates the value of dp[i][j] as dp[i][j-1]*i+dp[i-1][j]*j-dp[i-1][j-1]*(i-1)*(j-1).
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of dp[c][d], which is 1.
