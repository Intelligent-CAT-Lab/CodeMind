Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N is initialized to 16.
The code calculates the last digit of N, which is 6.
The code checks if the last digit is in the list [2, 4, 5, 7, 9], which is true.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())

if N % 2 == 0:
    print('even')
else:
    print('odd')

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```16
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
