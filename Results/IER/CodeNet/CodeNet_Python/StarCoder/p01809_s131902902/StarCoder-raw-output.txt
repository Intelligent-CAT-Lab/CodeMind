Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The code reads the input and initializes the variables p and q to 1 and 2, respectively.
The code then calculates the greatest common divisor of p and q, which is 1.
The code then calculates the least common multiple of p and q, which is 2.
The code then prints the least common multiple of p and q, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, M = map(int, input().split())
v = [[] for i in range(N)]
for i in range(M):
    a,b = map(int, input().split())
    a -= 1
    b -= 1
    v[a].append(b)
    v[b].append(a)

def dfs(x, p):
    for y in v[x]:
        if y == p:continue
        dfs(y, x)

ans = 0
for i in range(N):
    if not v[i]:
        ans += 1
        dfs(i, -1)
print(ans)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3 3
1 2
2 3
3 1
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The code reads the input and initializes the variables N and M to 3 and 3, respectively.
The code then initializes a list v with N empty lists.
The code then reads the input and
