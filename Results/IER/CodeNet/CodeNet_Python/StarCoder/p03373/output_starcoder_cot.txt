Instruction: I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
For example:

Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
20 2 5
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
Consider the following code:

from sys import stdin, stdout


a, b, c, x, y = map(int, stdin.readline().split())

ans = 0
if 2 * c <= a + b:
    ans += min(x, y) * 2 * c
    q = min(x, y)
    x -= q
    y -= q
    
    if x and 2 * c <= a:
        ans += 2 * c * x
    elif x:
        ans += a * x
    elif y and 2 * c <= b:
        ans += 2 * c * y
    else:
        ans += b * y
    
else:
    ans = x * a + y * b

stdout.write(str(ans))
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
1500 2000 1600 3 2

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The code first reads the input and initializes the variables a, b, c, x and y to the values 1500, 2000, 1600, 3 and 2, respectively.
The code then initializes the variable ans to 0.
The code checks if 2 * c is less than or equal to a + b. If it is, it adds min(x, y) * 2 * c to ans.
The code then initializes the variable q to min(x, y).
The code then subtracts q from x and y.
The code then checks if x is non-zero and 2 * c is less than or equal to a. If it is, it adds 2 * c * x to ans.
The code then checks if y is non-zero and 2 * c is less than or equal to b. If it is, it adds 2 * c * y to ans.
The code then checks if x is non-zero. If it is, it adds a * x to ans.
The code then checks if y is non-zero. If it is, it adds b * y to ans.
The code then prints the final value of ans, which is 10000.

The output of code execution is:
10000
