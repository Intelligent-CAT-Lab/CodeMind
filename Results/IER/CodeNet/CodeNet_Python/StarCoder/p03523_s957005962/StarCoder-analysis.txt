Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable S is initialized to "KIHBR".
The code checks if "AA" is in S. Since it is not, it proceeds to the next line.
The code checks if S.replace("KIH", "").replace("A", "") == "BR". Since it is, it prints "YES" and ends the program.
Since it is not, it prints "NO" and ends the program.
