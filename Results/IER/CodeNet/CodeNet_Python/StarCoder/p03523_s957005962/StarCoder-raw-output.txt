Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable S is initialized to "KIHBR".
The code checks if "AA" is in S. Since it is not, it proceeds to the next line.
The code checks if S.replace("KIH", "").replace("A", "") == "BR". Since it is, it prints "YES" and ends the program.
Since it is not, it prints "NO" and ends the program.
<<<Output>>>
NO

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())
for i in range(1,N+1):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        print(i)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N is initialized to 10.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 10.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is even. Since it is, it prints i and ends the program.
Since it is not, it ends the program without printing anything.
