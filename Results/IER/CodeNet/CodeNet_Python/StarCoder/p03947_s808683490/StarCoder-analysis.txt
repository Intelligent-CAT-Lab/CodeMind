The code first imports the itertools module, which contains the groupby function.
The groupby function takes an iterable as an argument and returns an iterator that returns consecutive keys and groups from the iterable.
The code then prints the sum of the length of each group, minus 1.
The groupby function returns an iterator that returns consecutive keys and groups from the iterable.
The length of each group is the number of consecutive times that key is encountered.
The sum of the length of each group is the total number of times that key is encountered.
The -1 is to account for the fact that the first group is empty.
The code prints 3, which is the sum of the length of each group, minus 1.
