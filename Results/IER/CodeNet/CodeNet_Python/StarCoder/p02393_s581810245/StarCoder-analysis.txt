Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable m is initialized to [3, 8, 1], which is the input.
The code then checks if the following conditions are met:
m[0] < m[1] < m[2] or m[0] == m[1] == m[2] or m[0] < m[1] == m[2] or m[0] == m[1] < m[2]
The first condition is met when m[0] = 3, m[1] = 8 and m[2] = 1.
The second condition is met when m[0] = 3, m[1] = 8 and m[2] = 1.
The third condition is met when m[0] = 3, m[1] = 8 and m[2] = 1.
The fourth condition is met when m[0] = 3, m[1] = 8 and m[2] = 1.
The code then prints the values of m[0], m[1] and m[2] in the order they appear in the code.
