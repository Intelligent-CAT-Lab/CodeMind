The variable A is initialized to the list of characters in the input, which is ['a', 'a', 't', 't'].
The variable a is initialized to the length of A, which is 4.
The variable A is initialized to a Counter object, which counts the number of occurrences of each character in A.
The variable cnt is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the number of pairs of characters that are not adjacent.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the values of the Counter object A.
For each value i in this range, it checks if i is not equal to 1. If it is not, it adds the current value of i multiplied by (i - 1) to cnt. The condition is met when i is 2 and 3.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of cnt, which is 2.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())
A = list(map(int, input().split()))
B = list(map(int, input().split()))

for i in range(N):
    if A[i] == B[i]:
        print(A[i])
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3
1 2 3
