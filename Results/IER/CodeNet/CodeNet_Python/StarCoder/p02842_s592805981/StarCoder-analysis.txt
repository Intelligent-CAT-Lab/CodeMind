Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N is initialized to 432.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 50000 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 50000.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the product of i and 1.08 and stores it in product.
The code checks if N is equal to product. If it is, it prints the current number i and exits the loop. The condition is met when i is 432.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the message ':(' because the condition is not met.
