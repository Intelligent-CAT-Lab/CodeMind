The variable N is initialized to 432.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 50000 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 50000.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the product of i and 1.08 and stores it in product.
The code checks if N is equal to product. If it is, it prints the current number i and exits the loop. The condition is met when i is 432.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the message ':(' because the condition is not met.
<<<Output>>>
432

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())

for i in range(1,N+1):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        print(i)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The variable N is initialized to 10.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 10.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is even. If it is, it prints the current number i. The condition is met when i is 2,4,6,8 and 10.
After the loop finishes, the code prints nothing because the condition is not met.
