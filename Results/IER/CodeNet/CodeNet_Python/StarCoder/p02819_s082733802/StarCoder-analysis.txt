The code first defines a function isPrime that takes a single parameter n.
The function checks if n is a prime number by iterating from 2 to n (inclusive) and checking if n is divisible by div.
If n is divisible by div, the function returns False.
If the loop finishes without returning False, the function returns True.
The code then enters a loop that iterates until isPrime returns True.
The loop increments X by 1 until isPrime returns True.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of X, which is 23.
