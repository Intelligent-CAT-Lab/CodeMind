The code first defines a function isPrime that takes a single parameter n.
The function checks if n is a prime number by iterating from 2 to n (inclusive) and checking if n is divisible by div.
If n is divisible by div, the function returns False.
If the loop finishes without returning False, the function returns True.
The code then enters a loop that iterates until isPrime returns True.
The loop increments X by 1 until isPrime returns True.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of X, which is 23.
<<<Output>>>
23

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def isPrime(n):
    div = 2
    while div * div <= n:
        if n % div == 0: return False
        div += 1
    return True

X = int(input())
while not isPrime(X): X+=1
print(X)

</Code>
