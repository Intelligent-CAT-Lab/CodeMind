Instruction: I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
For example:

Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
20 2 5
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
Consider the following code:

n,p=map(int,input().split())

def factorization(n):
    arr = []
    temp = n
    for i in range(2, int(-(-n**0.5//1))+1):
        if temp%i==0:
            cnt=0
            while temp%i==0:
                cnt+=1
                temp //= i
            arr.append([i, cnt])

    if temp!=1:
        arr.append([temp, 1])

    if arr==[]:
        arr.append([n, 1])

    return arr

l=factorization(p)
ans=1
for i in range(len(l)):
    if l[i][1]>=n:
        ans*=l[i][0]**(l[i][1]//n)
print(ans)

What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
3 24

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable n is initialized to 3, and variable p is initialized to 24.
The function factorization is called with parameter p=24.
The function factorization calculates the factorization of p=24, which is [2, 2, 2, 3].
The function factorization returns the list [2, 2, 2, 3].
The variable l is initialized to [2, 2, 2, 3].
The variable ans is initialized to 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to len(l)-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 3 (inclusive).
For each number i in this range, it checks if l[i][1] is greater than or equal to n. If it is, it multiplies ans by l[i][0] to the power of l[i][1]//n.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 24.

The output of code execution is:
24
