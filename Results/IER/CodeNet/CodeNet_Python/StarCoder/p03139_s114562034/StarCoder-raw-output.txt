Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable n, variable a and variable b are initialized to 10, 3 and 5, respectively.
The code then calculates the minimum of a and b, which is 3.
The code then calculates the difference between a+b and n, which is 8.
The code then checks if mi is less than 0. If it is, it sets mi to 0.
The code then prints the values of ma and mi, which are 3 and 0, respectively.
<<<Output>>>
3 0
