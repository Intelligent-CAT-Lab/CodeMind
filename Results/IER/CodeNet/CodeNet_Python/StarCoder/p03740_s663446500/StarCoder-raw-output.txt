Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable X, variable Y are initialized to 2 and 1, respectively.
The code checks if the absolute value of X - Y is less than or equal to 1.
Since X - Y = 1, the absolute value of X - Y is 1.
Since 1 is less than or equal to 1, the code prints 'Brown'.
<<<Output>>>
Brown

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())
for i in range(1,N+1):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        print(i, end=' ')
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N is initialized to 10.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 10.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is even.
Since i is even, the code prints i and a space.
After the loop finishes, the code prints a new line.
<<<Output>>>
2 4 6 8 10
