Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable X, variable Y are initialized to 2 and 1, respectively.
The code checks if the absolute value of X - Y is less than or equal to 1.
Since X - Y = 1, the absolute value of X - Y is 1.
Since 1 is less than or equal to 1, the code prints 'Brown'.
