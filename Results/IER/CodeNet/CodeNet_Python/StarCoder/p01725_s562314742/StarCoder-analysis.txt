The variable S is initialized to "3-2*3", which is the input.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the characters in the string "()+*-".
For each character x in this string, it replaces x with " {} ".format(x), which is " {} ".format(x) where x is the current character.
The code then splits the string S into a list of strings, which is ["3", "-", "2", "*", "3"].
The function parse(pri, cur) is called, which returns the maximum value of the expression.
The function parse(pri, cur) first defines a helper function number() that returns the value of the current number in the list S.
The function parse(pri, cur) then defines a helper function expr(level) that returns the value of the expression.
The function parse(pri, cur) then enters a loop that iterates over the characters in the list S.
For each character in this list, it checks if the character is a digit. If it is, it converts the character to an integer and adds 1 to the variable cur.
If the character is not a digit, it calls the helper function expr(level) with level set to 0.
The helper function expr(level) then enters a loop that iterates over the characters in the list S.
For each character in this list, it checks if the character is a digit. If it is, it converts the character to an integer and adds 1 to the variable cur.
If the character is not a digit, it calls the helper function expr(level) with level set to level+1.
The helper function expr(level) then enters a loop that iterates
