NO-ANSWER
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable n is initialized to 2.
The variable ans is initialized to 1.
The variable sub is initialized to 1.
The variable sub2 is initialized to 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 1.
For each number i in this range, it multiplies ans by 10, and then modulos it by 10**9+7.
It also multiplies sub by 9, and then modulos it by 10**9+7.
It also multiplies sub2 by 8, and then modulos it by 10**9+7.
After the loop finishes, the code subtracts 2*sub-sub2 from ans.
The code then prints the final value of ans, which is 10**9+7-2*10**9+7-10**9+7-10**9+7-2*10**9+7-10**9+7-10**9+7-2*10**9+7-10**9+7-10**9+7-2*10**9+7-10**9+7-10**9+7-2*10**9+7-10**9+7-10**9+7-2*10**9+7-10**9+7-10**9+7-2*10**9+7-10**9+7-10**9+7-2*10**9+7-10**9+7-10**9+7-2*10**9+7-10**9+7-10**9+7-2*10**9+7-10**9+7-10**9+7-2*10**9+7-10**9+7-10**9+7-2*10**9+7-10**9+7-10**9+7-2*10**9+7-10**9+7-10**9+7-2*
