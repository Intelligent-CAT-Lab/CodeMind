int the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable n is initialized to 3, and variable p is initialized to 24.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 3.
The code calculates the prime factorization of p, which is 2^2 * 3^1.
The code checks if the number of occurrences of each prime factor is greater than or equal to n.
Since 2 occurs 2 times and 3 occurs 1 time, the condition is met.
The code then calculates the product of all the prime factors that occur more than or equal to n.
Since 2 occurs 2 times and 3 occurs 1 time, the product is 2^2 * 3^1 = 24.
<<<Output>>>
24

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>

def getprime(n):
    if not isinstance(n, int):
        raise TypeError("Input int")
    prime = []
    # 約数はsqrt(N)まで調べればOK
    data = [i+1 for i in range(1,n)]
    while True:
        p = data[0]
        if p >= int(n**0.5):
            return prime+data
        prime.append(p)
        # pで割り切れないものだけを残す
        data = [d for d in data if d%p!= 0]

from collections import defaultdict
def factorization(n):
    # n >= 1を想定
    factors = defaultdict(int)
    if n == 1:
        return {}
    if int(n**0.5) == 1:
        return {n:1}
