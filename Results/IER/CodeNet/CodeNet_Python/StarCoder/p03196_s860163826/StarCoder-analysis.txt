int the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable n is initialized to 3, and variable p is initialized to 24.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 3.
The code calculates the prime factorization of p, which is 2^2 * 3^1.
The code checks if the number of occurrences of each prime factor is greater than or equal to n.
Since 2 occurs 2 times and 3 occurs 1 time, the condition is met.
The code then calculates the product of all the prime factors that occur more than or equal to n.
Since 2 occurs 2 times and 3 occurs 1 time, the product is 2^2 * 3^1 = 24.
