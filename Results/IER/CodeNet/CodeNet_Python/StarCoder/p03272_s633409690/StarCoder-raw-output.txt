Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable n is initialized to 4, and variable i is initialized to 2.
The code then prints the difference between n and i, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
n,k=map(int,input().split())
print(n//k)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10 3
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable n is initialized to 10, and variable k is initialized to 3.
The code then prints the quotient of n and k, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>
3

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10 3
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable n is initialized to 10, and variable k is initialized to 3.
The code then prints the remainder of n and k, which is 1.
