Instruction: I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
For example:

Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
20 2 5
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
Consider the following code:

S = int(input())

X1 = 0
Y1 = 0

tmp = int(S**0.5)
if tmp**2 >= S:
    X2 = Y3 = tmp
else:
    X2 = Y3 = tmp+1

rest = X2**2 - S

if rest == 0:
    X3 = Y2 = 0
else:
    if rest < 10**9:
        X3 = 1
        Y2 = rest
    else:
        for i in range(2, int(rest**0.5)+2):
            if rest % i == 0:
                X3 = i
                Y2 = rest // i

print(X1, Y1, X2, Y2, X3, Y3)
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
3

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable S is initialized to 3, which is the input.
The code calculates the square root of S and stores it in tmp.
If tmp is an integer, it means that S is a perfect square, so X2 and Y3 are both initialized to tmp.
Otherwise, X2 is initialized to tmp+1 and Y3 is initialized to tmp.
The code then calculates the rest of the equation X2^2 - S.
If the rest is 0, it means that X3 and Y2 are both initialized to 0.
Otherwise, the code enters a loop that iterates from 2 to the square root of the rest.
For each number i in this range, it checks if the rest is divisible by i. If it is, it initializes X3 to i and Y2 to the rest divided by i.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the values of X1, Y1, X2, Y2, X3 and Y3, which are 0 0 1 3 1 3.

The output of code execution is:
0 0 1 3 1 3
