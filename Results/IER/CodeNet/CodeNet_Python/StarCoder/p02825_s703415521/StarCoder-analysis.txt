The variable n is initialized to 6.
The code checks if n is equal to 2. If it is, it prints -1 and exits.
The code checks if n is equal to 3. If it is, it prints the first domino in the list and exits.
The code checks if n is greater than 3. If it is, it prints the dominoes in the list.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n % 4 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 2.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n - col - (ix + 4) (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 2.
