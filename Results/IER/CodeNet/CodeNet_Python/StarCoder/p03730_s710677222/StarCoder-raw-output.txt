The variables a, b and c are initialized to 7, 5 and 1, respectively.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 100, meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 100.
For each number n in this range, it calculates the remainder of a*n divided by b.
If the remainder is equal to c, the code prints "YES" and exits the loop.
If the remainder is not equal to c, the code continues to the next iteration of the loop.
After the loop finishes, the code prints "NO".
<<<Output>>>
NO

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
n=int(input())
for i in range(1,n+1):
    if i%2==0:
        print(i,end=" ")
</Code>
