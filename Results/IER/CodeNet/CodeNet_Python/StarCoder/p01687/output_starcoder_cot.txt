Instruction: I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
For example:

Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
20 2 5
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
Consider the following code:

ref = list("AADINNUY")
aizu = "AIZUNYAN"
inp = raw_input()
if len(inp) < 8:
	print inp
else:
	ans = ""
	l = len(inp)
	i = 0
	while i < l:
		if i <= l - 8 and sorted(inp[i:i+8]) == ref:
			ans += aizu
			i += 8
		else:
			ans += inp[i]
			i += 1
	print ans
	
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
AIDUNYAN

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The code first initializes a list ref with the string "AADINNUY".
The code then initializes a string aizu with the string "AIZUNYAN".
The code then reads a string from the input and stores it in the variable inp.
The code checks if the length of the string inp is less than 8. If it is, it prints the string inp.
Otherwise, it initializes a string ans with the empty string.
The code then initializes a variable l to the length of the string inp.
The code then initializes a variable i to 0.
The code enters a while loop that iterates while i is less than l.
The code checks if i is less than or equal to l - 8 and if the sorted string inp[i:i+8] is equal to ref. If it is, it appends aizu to ans and increments i by 8.
Otherwise, it appends inp[i] to ans and increments i by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the string ans.

The output of code execution is:
AIZUNYAN
