Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable n is initialized to 5, and variable k is initialized to 2.
The code enters a loop that iterates from k+1 to n+1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 3 to 5.
For each number b in this range, it calculates the value of the expression (b-k) * (n//b) + max(0, (n%b)-k+1).
The expression is evaluated for b=3,4,5, which results in 1,1,1.
The code then prints the final value of ans, which is 3.
