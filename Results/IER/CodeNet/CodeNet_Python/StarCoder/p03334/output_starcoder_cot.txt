Instruction: I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
For example:

Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
20 2 5
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
Consider the following code:

from math import sqrt
from itertools import product

import numpy as np

def judge(D):
  n = 1
  while D%4==0:
    n *= 2
    D //= 4

  def h1(x,y):
    return ~(x//n+y//n)%2
  def h2(x,y):
    return ~(x//n)%2

  return h1 if D%2==1 else h2

N,D1,D2 = map(int,input().split())
j1,j2 = judge(D1),judge(D2)
cnt = 0
for x,y in product(range(N*2),repeat=2):
  if j1(x,y) and j2(x,y):
    print(x,y)
    cnt += 1
    if cnt >= N*N:
      break

What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
2 1 2

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The code first imports the sqrt function from the math module.
The code then imports the product function from the itertools module.
The code then imports the numpy module.
The code then defines a function judge that takes a single parameter D.
The function judge first initializes the variable n to 1.
The function then enters a while loop that continues as long as D is divisible by 4.
The loop body multiplies n by 2 and divides D by 4.
The function then defines two functions h1 and h2.
The function h1 takes two parameters x and y and returns the bitwise NOT of the bitwise OR of the floor division of x by n plus the floor division of y by n, modulo 2.
The function h2 takes two parameters x and y and returns the bitwise NOT of the bitwise OR of the floor division of x by n, modulo 2.
The function judge then returns the function h1 if D is odd, and the function h2 otherwise.
The code then initializes the variable cnt to 0.
The code then enters a for loop that iterates over the Cartesian product of the range [0, 2N) and [0, 2N).
The loop body prints the pair (x,y) and increments cnt by 1.
The loop exits when cnt is greater than or equal to N2.
The code then prints the final value of cnt, which is 4.

The output of code execution is:
0 0
0 1
0 2
1 0
1 1
1 2
2 0
2 1
2 2
