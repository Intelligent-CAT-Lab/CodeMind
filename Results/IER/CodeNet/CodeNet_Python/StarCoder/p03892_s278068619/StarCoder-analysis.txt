The variables a, b, c and d are initialized to 1, 1, 3 and 4, respectively.
The code calculates the absolute difference between c and a and stores it in c.
The code calculates the absolute difference between d and b and stores it in d.
The code calculates the greatest common divisor of c and d and stores it in g.
The code calculates the quotient of c divided by g and stores it in j.
The code calculates the quotient of d divided by g and stores it in k.
The code prints the final value of j+k-1 multiplied by g, which is 12.
