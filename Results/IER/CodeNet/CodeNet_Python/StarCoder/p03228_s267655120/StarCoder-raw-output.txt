Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable a, variable b and variable k are initialized to 5, 4 and 2, respectively.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to k (exclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 1.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is even or odd.
If i is even, it subtracts 1 from a and adds a to b.
If i is odd, it subtracts 1 from b and adds b to a.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final values of a and b, which are 1 and 1.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
n = int(input())

for i in range(n):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        print(i, end=' ')
print()

for i in range(n):
    if i % 2 == 1:
        print(i, end=' ')
print()
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The variable n is initialized to 10.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n (exclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 9.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is even or odd.
If i is even, it prints i.
If i is
