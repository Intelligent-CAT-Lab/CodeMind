Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable a and variable b are initialized to 2 and 5, respectively.
The code checks if max(a,b) is greater than 9. Since max(a,b) is 5, it is not greater than 9.
The code then prints the product of a and b, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
a, b = map(int, input().split())
if a>b:
  print(a)
else:
  print(b)
</Code>
