Instruction: I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
For example:

Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
20 2 5
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
Consider the following code:

total = int(input())
num_500 = total // 500

remain = total - num_500 * 500
num_5 = remain // 5

print(num_500 * 1000 + num_5 * 5)

What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
1024

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable total is initialized to 1024.
The variable num_500 is initialized to 2, which is the integer division of total by 500.
The variable remain is initialized to 4, which is the remainder of the division of total by 500.
The variable num_5 is initialized to 8, which is the integer division of remain by 5.
The code then prints the final value of num_500 * 1000 + num_5 * 5, which is 2000 + 8 * 5 = 2080.

The output of code execution is:
2080
