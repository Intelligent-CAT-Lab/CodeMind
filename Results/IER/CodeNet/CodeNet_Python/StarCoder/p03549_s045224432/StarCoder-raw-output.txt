Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N, variable M are initialized to 1, 1, respectively.
The code then prints the final value of the expression (((N-M)*100+M*1900)*2**M), which is 3900.
<<<Output>>>
3900

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N,M=map(int,input().split())
print(N*M)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 1
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The variable N, variable M are initialized to 1, 1, respectively.
The code then prints the final value of the expression (N*M), which is 1.
<<<Output>>>
