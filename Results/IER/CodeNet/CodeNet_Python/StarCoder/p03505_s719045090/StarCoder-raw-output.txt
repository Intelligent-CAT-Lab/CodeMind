Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable K, variable A and variable B are initialized to 4000, 2000 and 500, respectively.
The code checks if A is greater than or equal to K. If it is, it prints 1 and exits.
The code then calculates the value of p, which is A - B, which is 2000 - 500, which is -300.
The code checks if p is less than or equal to 0. If it is, it prints -1 and exits.
The code then initializes the variable ans to 1.
The code then adds 2 to ans, because the first part of the answer is 2.
The code then adds ceil(K - A, A - B) * 2 to ans, which is ceil(-3000, -300) * 2, which is ceil(-1000, -300) * 2, which is ceil(-1000, -300) * 2, which is 0.
The code then prints the final value of ans, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())

ans = 0
for i in range(1, N + 1):
    if A <= i <= B:
        ans += i
print(ans)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
