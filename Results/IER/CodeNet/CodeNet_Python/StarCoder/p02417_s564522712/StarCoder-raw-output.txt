Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The code reads the input and stores it in the variable s.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 97 to 123 (inclusive), meaning it will consider characters from a to z.
For each character i in this range, it prints the character and the number of times it appears in the input.
The code prints the following:
```
a: 1
b: 0
c: 0
d: 0
e: 1
f: 0
g: 0
h: 0
i: 2
j: 0
k: 0
l: 0
m: 0
n: 0
o: 2
p: 0
q: 0
r: 0
s: 1
t: 1
u: 1
v: 0
w: 0
x: 0
y: 0
z: 0
```
