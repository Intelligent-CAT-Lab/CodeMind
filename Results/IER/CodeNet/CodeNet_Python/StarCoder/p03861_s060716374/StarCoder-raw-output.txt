TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
a, b, x = map(int, input().split())
print(b // x - (a - 1) // x)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 10 3
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
