Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable a and variable b are initialized to 2 and 2, respectively.
variable ans is initialized to -1, which will be used to store the answer.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 1000 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 1000.
For each number tax in this range, it calculates the taxes for each person and stores it in tax_person.
The code checks if tax_person is equal to a and b, which is 2 and 2 in this case. If it is, it stores the current tax in ans and breaks the loop.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 84.
