Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variables A, B, C and D are initialized to 0, 75, 25 and 100, respectively.
The code checks if the difference between the minimum of B and D and the maximum of A and C is greater than or equal to 0.
Since the minimum of B and D is 25 and the maximum of A and C is 75, the difference is 50.
Since 50 is greater than or equal to 0, the code prints 50.
