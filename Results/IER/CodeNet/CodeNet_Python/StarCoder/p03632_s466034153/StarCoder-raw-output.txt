Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variables A, B, C and D are initialized to 0, 75, 25 and 100, respectively.
The code checks if the difference between the minimum of B and D and the maximum of A and C is greater than or equal to 0.
Since the minimum of B and D is 25 and the maximum of A and C is 75, the difference is 50.
Since 50 is greater than or equal to 0, the code prints 50.
<<<Output>>>
50

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())
for i in range(1,N+1):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        print(i, end=' ')
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N is initialized to 10.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 10.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is even. If it is, it prints i and a space.
After the loop finishes, the code prints nothing.
<<<Output>>>
2 4 6 8 10
