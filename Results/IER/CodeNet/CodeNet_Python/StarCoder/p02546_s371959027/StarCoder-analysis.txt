Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable S is initialized to "apple".
The code checks if the last character of S is "s". If it is, it appends "es" to S and stores the result in ans. Otherwise, it appends "s" to S and stores the result in ans.
The code prints the final value of ans, which is "apples".
