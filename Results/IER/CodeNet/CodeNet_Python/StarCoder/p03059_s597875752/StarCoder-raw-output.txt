The variable A, variable B and variable T are initialized to 3, 5 and 7, respectively.
The code calculates the quotient of T//A and B, which is 7//3*5=10.
The code prints the final value of the quotient, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N,K=map(int,input().split())
sum_1=0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order=0
    i_str=str(i)
    n=len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order+=int(i_str[j])
    if sum_order%K==0:
        sum_1+=i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20 2```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The variable N and variable K are initialized to 20 and 2, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_
