Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable a, variable b and variable k are initialized to 2, 3 and 3, respectively.
The code checks if a is greater than or equal to k. If it is, it prints the difference between a and k and b.
If a is less than k, the code checks if a+b is greater than or equal to k. If it is, it prints 0 and the difference between a+b and k.
If a+b is less than k, the code prints 0 and 0.
