The code first initializes two dictionaries, d1 and d2.
The dictionary d1 maps each character to its binary representation.
The dictionary d2 maps each binary representation to its character.
The code then enters a loop that continues until an exception is raised.
The code reads a string from the input and stores it in the variable n.
The code then iterates over each character in the string n and maps it to its binary representation.
The code then checks if the length of the binary representation is not divisible by 5. If it is not, the code adds 0s to the end of the binary representation until it is divisible by 5.
The code then iterates over the binary representation in steps of 5. For each step, it maps the current 5-bit binary representation to its character representation.
The code then prints the final value of dc, which is "POTTER".
<<<Output>>>
POTTER

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def is_prime(n):
    if n == 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2,n):
        if n%i == 0:
            return False
    return True

while 1:
    try:
        n = int(raw_input())
        if is_prime(n):
            print "Prime"
        else:
            print "Not prime"
    except:
        break
</Code>
