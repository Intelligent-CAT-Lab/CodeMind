The variable n, variable x are initialized to 2 and 7, respectively.
The function f is defined to calculate the number of ways to arrange n queens on an n x n chessboard such that no two queens are attacking each other.
The function f is called with the parameters n and x.
The function f first checks if n is 0. If it is, it checks if x is less than or equal to 0. If it is, it returns 0. If it is not, it returns 1.
If n is not 0, it checks if x is less than or equal to 4*(2**(n-1))-2. If it is, it calls f again with parameters n-1 and x-1. If it is not, it checks if x is equal to 4*(2**(n-1))-1. If it is, it returns 2**n. If it is not, it checks if x is less than or equal to 4*2**n - 3. If it is, it returns 2**n + f(n-1,x - 4*(2**(n-1)) + 1). If it is not, it returns 2**(n+1) - 1.
After the function f returns, the code prints the final value of f(n,x), which is 2.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
n = int(input())

def f(N):
    if N == 0:
        return 0
    elif N == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return f(N-1) + f(N-2)

print(f(n))
