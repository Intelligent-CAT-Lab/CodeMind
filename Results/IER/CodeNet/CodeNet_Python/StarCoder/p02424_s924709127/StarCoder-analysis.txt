Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable a and variable b are initialized to 8 and 10, respectively.
The variable MASK is initialized to 4294967295, which is 11111111111111111111111111111111 in binary.
The code then prints the binary representation of a & b, which is 00000000000000000000000000001000 in binary.
The code then prints the binary representation of a | b, which is 00000000000000000000000000001110 in binary.
The code then prints the binary representation of a ^ b, which is 00000000000000000000000000001110 in binary.
