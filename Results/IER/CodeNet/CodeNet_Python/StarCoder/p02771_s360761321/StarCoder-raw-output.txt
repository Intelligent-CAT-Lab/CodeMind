Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The code first reads the input and splits it into a list of integers.
Then it checks if the length of the set of the list is equal to 2.
Since the length of the set is 2, the code prints 'Yes'.
<<<Output>>>
Yes

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())
for i in range(1,N+1):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        print(i, end=' ')
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The code first reads the input and stores it in the variable N.
Then it enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 10.
