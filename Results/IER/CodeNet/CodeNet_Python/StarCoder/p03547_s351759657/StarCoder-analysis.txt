The variable dic is initialized to {"A":1,"B":2,"C":3,"D":4,"E":5,"F":6}.
The variables X and Y are initialized to "A" and "B", respectively.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the keys of dic.
For each key, it checks if the key is equal to X or Y. If it is, it assigns the corresponding value to the variable x or y, respectively.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if x is greater than y. If it is, it prints ">". If x is less than y, it prints "<". If x is equal to y, it prints "=".
