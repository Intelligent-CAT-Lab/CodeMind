The variable dic is initialized to {"A":1,"B":2,"C":3,"D":4,"E":5,"F":6}.
The variables X and Y are initialized to "A" and "B", respectively.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the keys of dic.
For each key, it checks if the key is equal to X or Y. If it is, it assigns the corresponding value to the variable x or y, respectively.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if x is greater than y. If it is, it prints ">". If x is less than y, it prints "<". If x is equal to y, it prints "=".

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())
for i in range(1,N+1):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        print(i, end=' ')
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The variable N is initialized to 10.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 10.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is even. If it is, it prints i.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the numbers 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10,
