Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable A and variable B are initialized to 6 and 3, respectively.
The code checks if A + B is greater than or equal to 10. Since it is not, the code prints the sum of A and B, which is 9.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())
for i in range(1,N+1):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        print(i)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N is initialized to 10.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 10.
