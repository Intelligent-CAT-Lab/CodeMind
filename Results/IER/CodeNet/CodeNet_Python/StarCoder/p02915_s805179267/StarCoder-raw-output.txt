rint the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The code first imports the sys module, which is used to modify the recursion limit.
The code then defines the INTMAX and INTMIN constants, which are used to represent the maximum and minimum values of an integer.
The code then defines the DVSR constant, which is used to represent the divisor.
The code then defines the POW, INV, DIV and LI functions, which are used to calculate the power, inverse, division and input list functions, respectively.
The code then defines the II function, which is used to read an integer from the input.
The code then defines the FLIST function, which is used to calculate the factorial list.
The code then prints the answer to the question and ends the response with "END-OF-RESPONSE".
