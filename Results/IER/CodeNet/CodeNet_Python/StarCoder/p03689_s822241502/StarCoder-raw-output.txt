The variable H, variable W, variable a and variable b are initialized to 3, 3, 2 and 2, respectively.
The code checks if H is divisible by a or W is divisible by b. If either of the conditions is met, the code prints "Yes" and proceeds to calculate the number of tiles.
The number of tiles is calculated as follows:
k = (H//a) * (W//b)
x = k+2
The variable k is initialized to the number of tiles, and x is initialized to the number of tiles plus 2.
The variable ansss is initialized to a list of lists of length H, where each list is of length W.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to H//a-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 1.
For each number i in this range, it enters another loop that iterates from 0 to W//b-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 1.
For each number j in this range, it sets the value of ansss at position (i+1)*a-1, (j+1)*b-1 to -x.
The code then enters another loop that iterates from -(-H//a) to -1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from -1 to -2.
For each number i in this range, it enters another loop that iterates from -(-W//b) to -1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from -1 to -2.
For each number j in this range, it sets the value of ansss at position i*a, j*b to x-1.
The code then prints the final value of ansss, which is a list of lists of length H, where each list is of length W.
