Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable s is initialized to the string "abaababaab".
The variable n is initialized to the length of the string s, which is 12.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n/2-1, meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 6.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the value of d, which is n/2-i.
The code then removes the last two characters of the string s, which is "ab".
The code then checks if the string s is equal to the string s[:d]*2, which is "ababab" and "ababab" in this case. If it is, it prints the value of 2*d, which is 8.
The loop finishes after the first iteration, so the code does not enter the second iteration.
<<<Output>>>
8

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
s=input()
n=len(s)
for i in range(1,int(n/2)):
  d=int(n/2)-i
  s=s[:-2]
  if s==s[:d]*2:
    print(2*d)
    break
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```abaababaab
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
