Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable a is initialized to 5, and variable b is initialized to 8.
The code calculates the remainder of a divided by b, which is 1.
The code prints the final value of the remainder, which is 1.
<<<Output>>>
1

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
a, b = map(int, input().split())
print(a // b)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 8
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable a is initialized to 5, and variable b is initialized to 8.
The code calculates the quotient of a divided by b, which is 0.
The code prints the final value of the quotient, which is 0.
