Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable n is initialized to 6, and variable d is initialized to 2.
The code checks if n is divisible by 2*d+1, which is 6%11=1.
Since it is not, the code calculates n//(2*d+1) +1, which is 6//11+1=1.
The code then prints the final value of ans, which is 1.
