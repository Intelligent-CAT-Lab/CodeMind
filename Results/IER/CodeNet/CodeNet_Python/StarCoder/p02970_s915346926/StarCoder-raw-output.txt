Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable n is initialized to 6, and variable d is initialized to 2.
The code checks if n is divisible by 2*d+1, which is 6%11=1.
Since it is not, the code calculates n//(2*d+1) +1, which is 6//11+1=1.
The code then prints the final value of ans, which is 1.
<<<Output>>>
1

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
n = int(input())
if n%2==0:
    print("even")
else:
    print("odd")
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable n is initialized to 10.
The code checks if n is even, which is true.
Since it is, the code prints "even".
<<<Output>>>
