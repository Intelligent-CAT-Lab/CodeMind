The variable N, variable K are initialized to 5 and 3, respectively.
The code then calculates the number of ways to choose K elements from N elements.
The number of ways to choose K elements from N elements is calculated by the following formula:
```
N! / (K! * (N-K)!)
```
The code calculates this value using the ModTools class, which is a class that implements the factorial and modular division functions.
The code then prints the final value of ans, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
