The variable x is initialized to 7.
The code calculates the value of ans by dividing x by 11 and multiplying the result by 2.
The code calculates the value of sub by taking the remainder of x divided by 11.
The code checks if sub is greater than or equal to 7. If it is, it adds 2 to ans.
The code checks if sub is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 6. If it is, it adds 1 to ans.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
