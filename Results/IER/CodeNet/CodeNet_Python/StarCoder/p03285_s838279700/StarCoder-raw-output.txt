The variable n is initialized to 11.
The variable cnt is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of times the condition is met.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 10.
For each number k in this range, it enters another loop that iterates from 0 to n-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 10.
For each number j in this range, it checks if 4k+7j is equal to n. If it is, it adds 1 to cnt. The condition is met when k is 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 and j is 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.
After the inner loop finishes, the code checks if the condition is met. If it is, it prints "Yes" and ends the program. Otherwise, it prints "No" and ends the program.
