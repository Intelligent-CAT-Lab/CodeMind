The variable MOD is initialized to 10**9+7.
The variable kaijo_memo is initialized to an empty list.
The function kaijo is defined to return the value of the kth element of the sequence defined by the recurrence relation:
kaijo(0) = 1
kaijo(n) = kaijo(n-1) * n
The variable gyaku_kaijo_memo is initialized to an empty list.
The function gyaku_kaijo is defined to return the value of the kth element of the sequence defined by the recurrence relation:
gyaku_kaijo(0) = 1
gyaku_kaijo(n) = gyaku_kaijo(n-1) * (n**MOD-2) % MOD
