The variable H, variable W and variable K are initialized to 2, 1 and 2, respectively.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from H+W-1 to H+W-K (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 1.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the product of i and const, and stores it in const.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from K to 1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 2 to 1.
For each number j in this range, it calculates the product of j and const, and stores it in const.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to K-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 1.
For each number k in this range, it calculates the product of k and const, and stores it in const.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to K-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 1.
For each number l in this range, it calculates the product of l and const, and stores it in const.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to K-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 1.
For each number m in this range, it calculates the product of m and const, and stores it in const.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to K-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 1.
For each number n in this range, it calculates the product of n and const, and stores it in const.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to K-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 1.
For each number o in this range, it calculates the product of o and const, and stores it in const.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to K-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 1.
For each number p in this range, it calculates the product of p and const, and stores it in const.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0
