Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable a is initialized to 5, and variable b is initialized to 8.
The code subtracts b from a, which is 5-8= -3.
The code prints the final value of a-b, which is -3.
<<<Output>>>
-3

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b = map(int,input().split())
print(a+b)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 8
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable a is initialized to 5, and variable b is initialized to 8.
The code adds b to a, which is 5+8= 13.
