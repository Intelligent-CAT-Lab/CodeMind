Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable a, variable b and variable x are initialized to 3, 1 and 5, respectively.
The code then calculates the value of k, which is (x-b) // (a-b).
The code then calculates the value of res, which is (x + b*k).
The code then prints the final value of res, which is 10.
