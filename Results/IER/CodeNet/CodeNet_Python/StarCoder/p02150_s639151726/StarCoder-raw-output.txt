Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable a, variable b and variable x are initialized to 3, 1 and 5, respectively.
The code then calculates the value of k, which is (x-b) // (a-b).
The code then calculates the value of res, which is (x + b*k).
The code then prints the final value of res, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())

if N % 2 == 0:
    print("even")
else:
    print("odd")
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N is initialized to 10.
The code then checks if N is even or odd.
If N is even, the code prints "even".
If N is odd, the code prints "odd".
<<<Output>>>
odd
