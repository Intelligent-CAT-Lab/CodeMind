Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N, variable M are initialized to 1, 1, respectively.
The variable t is initialized to 1900*M + 100*(N-M), which is 1900*1 + 100*(1-1) = 1900.
The variable p is initialized to 2**M, which is 2**1 = 2.
The code then prints the final value of t*p, which is 3800.
<<<Output>>>
3800

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def main():
    N, M = (int(i) for i in input().split())
    t = 1900*M + 100*(N-M)
    p = 2**M
    print(t*p)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 2
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
