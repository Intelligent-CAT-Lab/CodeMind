Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N, variable M are initialized to 1, 1, respectively.
The variable t is initialized to 1900*M + 100*(N-M), which is 1900*1 + 100*(1-1) = 1900.
The variable p is initialized to 2**M, which is 2**1 = 2.
The code then prints the final value of t*p, which is 3800.
