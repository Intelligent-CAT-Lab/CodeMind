Instruction: I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
For example:

Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
20 2 5
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
Consider the following code:

s=input()
count=0
for member in s:
    count=0
    for member2 in s:
        if member2==member:
            count+=1
    if count>=2:
        print("no")
        break
if count==1:
    print("yes")

What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
uncopyrightable

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The code reads the string s and stores it in the variable s.
The code initializes the variable count to 0.
The code enters a loop that iterates over the characters in the string s.
For each character member in the string s, the code initializes the variable count to 0.
The code enters a loop that iterates over the characters in the string s.
For each character member2 in the string s, the code checks if member2 is equal to member. If it is, it increments count by 1.
The code checks if count is greater than or equal to 2. If it is, it prints "no" and breaks out of the loop.
If count is not greater than or equal to 2, the code enters a second loop that iterates over the characters in the string s.
For each character member2 in the string s, the code checks if member2 is equal to member. If it is, it increments count by 1.
The code checks if count is equal to 1. If it is, it prints "yes".

The output of code execution is:
yes
