Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variables a, b, c and k are initialized to 2, 1, 1 and 3, respectively.
variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the answer.
The code checks if k is less than or equal to a. If it is, it sets ans to k.
The code checks if k is less than or equal to a + b. If it is, it sets ans to a.
The code checks if k is less than or equal to a + b + c. If it is, it sets ans to a - (k - (a+b+c)).
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 0.
