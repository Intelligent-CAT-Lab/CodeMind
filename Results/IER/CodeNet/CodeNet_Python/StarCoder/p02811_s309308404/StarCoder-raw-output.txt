Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable a is initialized to 2, and variable b is initialized to 900.
The code checks if 500 * a is greater than or equal to b.
Since 500 * 2 is 1000, which is greater than or equal to 900, the code prints 'Yes'.
<<<Output>>>
Yes

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
a, b = map(int, input().split())

if a == b:
  print('a = b')
elif a > b:
  print('a > b')
else:
  print('a < b')
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 3
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable a is initialized to 2, and variable b is initialized to 3.
The code checks if a is equal to b. Since a is 2 and b is 3, they are not equal, so the code prints 'a < b'.
<<<Output>>>
a < b
