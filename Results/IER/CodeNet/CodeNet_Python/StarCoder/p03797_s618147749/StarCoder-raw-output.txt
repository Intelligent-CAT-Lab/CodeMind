Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable n is initialized to 1, and variable m is initialized to 6.
The code checks if n * 2 is greater than or equal to m.
If it is, the code prints m//2, which is 3.
If it is not, the code calculates the difference between m and n*2, which is 4.
The code then calculates amari//4 + n, which is 1 + 1, which is 2.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
n = int(input())
for i in range(1,n+1):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        print(i)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable n is initialized to 10.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 10.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is even.
If it is, it prints i.
The code prints 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10.
