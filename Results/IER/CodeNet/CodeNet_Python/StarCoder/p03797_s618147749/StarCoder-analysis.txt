Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable n is initialized to 1, and variable m is initialized to 6.
The code checks if n * 2 is greater than or equal to m.
If it is, the code prints m//2, which is 3.
If it is not, the code calculates the difference between m and n*2, which is 4.
The code then calculates amari//4 + n, which is 1 + 1, which is 2.
