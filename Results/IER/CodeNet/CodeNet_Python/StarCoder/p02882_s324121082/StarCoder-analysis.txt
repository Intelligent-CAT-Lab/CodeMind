Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable a, variable b and variable x are initialized to 2, 2 and 4, respectively.
The variable c is initialized to x/a, which is 2.
The code checks if c is greater than a*b/2, which is 2*2/2, which is 1.
If c is greater than a*b/2, the code calculates c = a*b - c, which is 2*2 - 2, which is 0.
The code then calculates d = c*2 / a, which is 0*2 / 2, which is 0.
The code then calculates e = math.atan(d/a), which is math.atan(0/2), which is 0.
After the calculations, the code prints the final value of e, which is 0.
