The variable N is initialized to 6.
The function make_divisors is defined to return a list of divisors of a given number.
The function make_divisors is called to calculate the divisors of N-1, which is 5.
The function make_divisors is called to calculate the divisors of N, which is 6.
The list of divisors of N-1 is stored in the variable Nod.
The list of divisors of N is stored in the variable divs.
The code enters a loop that iterates over the list of divisors of N.
For each divisor d in this list, the code enters a loop that iterates over the list of divisors of N-1.
The code checks if d is equal to 1. If it is, the loop breaks.
If d is not equal to 1, the code checks if c%d is equal to 1. If it is, the divisor d is added to the list of divisors of N-1. The loop breaks.
If c%d is not equal to 1, the code checks if c%d is equal to 0. If it is, the code divides c by d and continues the loop.
If c%d is not equal to 0, the code breaks the loop.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of the list of divisors of N-1, which is 4.
<<<Output>>>
4
