rint the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable n is initialized to 12.
The code checks if n is odd. Since n is 12, it is not odd, so the code enters the else statement.
The code initializes variable i to 1.
The code initializes variable cnt to 0.
The code initializes variable n1 to n.
The code enters a while loop that iterates until n1 is 0.
The code divides n1 by 2*(5**i), which is 2*(5**1), which is 2*5, which is 10.
The code increments i by 1, which is 2.
The code adds n1 to cnt, which is 10.
The code enters the while loop again, and n1 is 10.
The code divides n1 by 2*(5**i), which is 10//(2*(5**2)), which is 10//(2*25), which is 10//50, which is 2.
The code increments i by 1, which is 3.
The code adds n1 to cnt, which is 22.
The code enters the while loop again, and n1 is 2.
The code divides n1 by 2*(5**i), which is 2//(2*(5**3)), which is 2//(2*125), which is 2//625, which is 0.
The code increments i by 1, which is 4.
The code adds n1 to cnt, which is 22.
The code enters the while loop again, and n1 is 0.
The code exits the while loop, and the code prints the final value of cnt, which is 22.
<<<Output>>>
22

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
n=int(input())

if n%2==1:
    print(0)
else:
    i = 1
    cnt = 0
    n1 = n
    while n1!= 0:
        n1 = n
        n1 = n1//(2*(3**i))
        cnt +=
