Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variables A, B and C are initialized to 'rng', 'gorilla' and 'apple', respectively.
The code checks if the last character of A is equal to the first character of B and if the last character of B is equal to the first character of C.
Since the last character of A is 'n' and the first character of B is 'g', the first condition is met.
Since the last character of B is 'a' and the first character of C is 'r', the second condition is met.
Since both conditions are met, the code prints 'YES'.
