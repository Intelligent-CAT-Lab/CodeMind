Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variables A, B and C are initialized to 'rng', 'gorilla' and 'apple', respectively.
The code checks if the last character of A is equal to the first character of B and if the last character of B is equal to the first character of C.
Since the last character of A is 'n' and the first character of B is 'g', the first condition is met.
Since the last character of B is 'a' and the first character of C is 'r', the second condition is met.
Since both conditions are met, the code prints 'YES'.
<<<Output>>>
YES

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())

for i in range(1,N+1):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        print(i, end=' ')
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N is initialized to 10.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 10.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is even. Since i is even, the code prints i and a space.
After the loop finishes, the code prints a new line.
<<<Output>>>
2 4 6 8 10
