Instruction: I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
For example:

Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
20 2 5
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
Consider the following code:

n = int(input())

def cnt_divisor(n):
    cnt = 0
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        if n % i == 0:
            cnt += 1
    return cnt

cnt = 0
for j in range(1, n+1):
    if j % 2 == 0:
        continue
    if cnt_divisor(j) == 8:
        cnt += 1

print(cnt)

What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
105

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable n is initialized to 105.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 105.
For each number j in this range, it checks if j is even. If it is, it skips the current iteration and moves on to the next number.
If j is odd, it calls the function cnt_divisor(j) to count the number of divisors of j.
The function returns 10, which is the number of divisors of 105.
The code checks if the number of divisors of j is equal to 8. If it is, it adds 1 to the variable cnt. The condition is met when j is 10,12,14,16,18,20,22,24,25,28,30,32,34,36,38,40,42,44,45,48,50,52,54,55,56,58,60,62,64,65,66,68,70,72,74,75,76,78,80,82,84,85,86,88,90,92,94,95,96,98,100,102,104.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of cnt, which is 10.

The output of code execution is:
10
