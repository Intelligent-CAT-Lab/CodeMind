The variable N is initialized to 3.
The code initializes a list P with N + 3 elements, where the first two elements are False and the rest are True.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to the square root of N + 3 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 2 to 5.
If P[i] is True, then the code enters another loop that iterates from i * 2 to N + 3 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from i * 2 to 11.
For each number j in this range, it sets P[j] to False.
After the loop finishes, the code enters another loop that iterates from 3 to N + 1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 3 to 12.
For each number q in this range, it checks if P[q] is True and if P[2 + q] is True. If both conditions are met, it adds 2 to count.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of count, which is 10.
