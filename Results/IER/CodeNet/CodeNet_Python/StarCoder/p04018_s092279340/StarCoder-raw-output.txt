The code reads the input and stores it in a list W.
The code calculates the length of the list W and stores it in variable N.
The code defines a function Z_Algorithm that takes a string S as input and returns an array arr.
The code initializes the first element of arr to N, which is the length of the string S.
The code initializes two variables i and j to 1 and 0, respectively.
The code enters a while loop that iterates while i is less than N.
The code enters a while loop that iterates while i+j is less than N and S[j] equals S[i+j].
The code increments j by 1.
The code exits the while loop if j is 0.
The code exits the while loop if i+j is greater than N.
The code exits the while loop if i+j is less than N and S[j] does not equal S[i+j].
The code exits the while loop if j is 0.
The code exits the while loop if i+k is greater than N and k+arr[k] is less than j.
The code increments i by k.
The code decrements j by k.
The code exits the while loop if i+k is greater than N.
The code exits the while loop if i+k is less than N and k+arr[k] is greater than j.
The code exits the while loop if i is less than N.
The code defines a function find_good_substr that takes a list W as input and returns an array G1.
The code calls the function Z_Algorithm to calculate the Z-array of W and stores the result in Z.
The code initializes an array is_good that has the same length as W and is initialized to True.
The code enters a for loop that iterates from 1 to N//2+1.
The code exits the for loop if n is greater than N//2+1.
The code exits the for loop if n is greater than N//2+1.
The code enters a for loop that iterates from n+n to Z[n]+n+1 in steps of n.
