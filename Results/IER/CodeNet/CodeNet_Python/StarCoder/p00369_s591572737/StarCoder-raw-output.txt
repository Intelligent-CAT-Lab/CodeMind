The variable n is initialized to 11121314.
The variable length is initialized to the length of n, which is 10.
The variable ans is initialized to 10.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to length (exclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 9.
If the current number is 1 and the next number is also 1, the code appends the current number and the next number to lst.
If the current number is not 1, the code appends the current number to lst.
The code then checks if the length of lst is greater than or equal to 2. If it is, it calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values of lst and stores it in ans.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to length // 2 + 1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 5.
If the length of n is divisible by i, the code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to length (exclusive) in steps of i, meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 9 in steps of 2.
The code appends the current number to lst.
The code then calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values of lst and stores it in ans.
The code then prints the final value of ans, which is 1.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
n = int(input())
ans = 0
for i in range(1, n + 1):
  if n % i == 0:
    ans += i
print(ans)
</Code>
