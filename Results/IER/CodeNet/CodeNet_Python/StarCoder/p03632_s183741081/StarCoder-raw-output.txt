Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variables a, b, c and d are initialized to 0, 75, 25 and 100, respectively.
The code calculates the minimum of b and d, which is 25.
The code calculates the maximum of a and c, which is 0.
The code calculates the maximum of the two values, which is 25-0=25.
The code prints the final value of the maximum, which is 25.
<<<Output>>>
25

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b,c,d=map(int,input().split())
print(max([min(b,d)-max(a,c),0]))
</Code>
