Instruction: I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
For example:

Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
20 2 5
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
Consider the following code:

from collections import deque
R,C,ay,ax,by,bx = map(int,input().split())

MOD = INF = 10**9+7
dists = [[INF]*C for i in range(R)]
dists[ay][ax] = 0
ptns = [[0]*C for i in range(R)]
ptns[ay][ax] = 1
q = deque([(0,ax,ay)])
dxs = [1,0,-1,0]
dys = [0,1,0,-1]
ans_d = None
while q:
    d,x,y = q.popleft()
    if ans_d is not None and d > ans_d:
        break
    if (x,y) == (bx,by):
        ans_d = d
    if d > dists[y][x]: continue
    dists[y][x] = d
    for dx,dy in zip(dxs,dys):
        nx,ny = x+dx, y+dy
        if not(0 <= nx < C) or not(0 <= ny < R): continue
        if d+1 > dists[ny][nx]: continue
        if dists[ny][nx] == INF:
            q.append((d+1,nx,ny))
            dists[ny][nx] = d+1
        ptns[ny][nx] += ptns[y][x]
        ptns[ny][nx] %= MOD
    for nx,ny in ((x,0),(x,R-1),(0,y),(C-1,y)):
        if d+1 > dists[ny][nx]: continue
        if dists[ny][nx] == INF:
            q.append((d+1,nx,ny))
            dists[ny][nx] = d+1
        ptns[ny][nx] += ptns[y][x]
        ptns[ny][nx] %= MOD

print(ans_d, ptns[by][bx] % MOD)


What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
2 2 0 0 1 1

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable R, variable C, variable ay, variable ax, variable by and variable bx are initialized to 2, 2, 0, 0, 1, 1, respectively.
The variable MOD is initialized to 1000000007, which is the modulo value.
The variable INF is initialized to 1000000000, which is the maximum value of the variable dists.
The variable dists is initialized to [[1000000000, 1000000000], [1000000000, 1000000000]], which is a 2x2 matrix with all values set to 1000000000.
The variable ptns is initialized to [[0, 0], [0, 0]], which is a 2x2 matrix with all values set to 0.
The variable q is initialized to [(0, 0, 0)], which is a deque with a single element (0, 0, 0).
The variable dxs is initialized to [1, 0, -1, 0], which is a list with four elements: 1, 0, -1 and 0.
The variable dys is initialized to [0, 1, 0, -1], which is a list with four elements: 0, 1, 0 and -1.
The variable ans_d is initialized to None.
The code then enters a loop that iterates until the deque q is empty.
The code pops the first element from the deque q and assigns it to the variables d, x and y.
The code checks if the variable ans_d is not None and if d is greater than ans_
