The code checks if A, B and C are equal. If they are, it prints "No".
If they are not equal, the code checks if A, B and C are not equal. If they are not, it prints "No".
If they are not equal, the code checks if A, B and C are not equal. If they are not, it prints "No".
The code prints "Yes" if none of the conditions are met.
