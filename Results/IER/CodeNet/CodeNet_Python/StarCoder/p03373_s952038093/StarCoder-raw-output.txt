Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The code first reads the input and stores it in variables A, B, C, X and Y.
The code then checks if the sum of A and B is less than or equal to 2 times C.
If it is, the code calculates the answer as A times X plus B times Y.
If it is not, the code enters a loop that iterates from 2 to 200000, meaning it will consider numbers from 2 to 200000.
For each number Z in this range, it calculates the answer as the minimum of the following:
(1) 0, if X minus Z divided by 2 is less than 0.
(2) 0, if Y minus Z divided by 2 is less than 0.
(3) Z times C.
The code then prints the final value of the minimum, which is 150000.
<<<Output>>>
150000
