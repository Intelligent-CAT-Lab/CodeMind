Instruction: I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
For example:

Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
20 2 5
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
Consider the following code:

import sys


def solve():
    readline = sys.stdin.buffer.readline
    mod = 10 ** 9 + 7
    s = str(readline().rstrip().decode('utf-8'))
    if s == "RRR":
        print(3)
    elif s == "RRS" or s == "SRR":
        print(2)
    elif s.count("R") == 0:
        print(0)
    else:
        print(1)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    solve()

What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
RRS

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The code first imports the sys module.
The function solve() is defined.
The function first reads a line from the standard input and strips the newline character. The readline() method returns a bytes object, so the decode() method is used to convert it to a string.
The code then checks if the string is equal to "RRR". If it is, it prints 3 and exits.
The code then checks if the string is equal to "RRS" or "SRR". If it is, it prints 2 and exits.
The code then checks if the string contains the character "R" at least once. If it does not, it prints 0 and exits.
The code then prints 1.

The output of code execution is:
2
