Instruction: I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
For example:

Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
20 2 5
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
Consider the following code:

import sys
import math
from collections import deque
from decimal import Decimal

sys.setrecursionlimit(1000000)
MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7
input = lambda: sys.stdin.readline().strip()
NI = lambda: int(input())
NMI = lambda: map(float, input().split())
NLI = lambda: list(NMI())
SI = lambda: input()


def make_grid(h, w, num): return [[int(num)] * w for _ in range(h)]


#隣接リスト 1-order
def make_adjlist_d(n, edges):
    res = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for edge in edges:
        res[edge[0]].append(edge[1])
        res[edge[1]].append(edge[0])
    return res


def make_adjlist_nond(n, edges):
    res = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for edge in edges:
        res[edge[0]].append(edge[1])
    return res


#nCr
def cmb(n, r):
    return math.factorial(n) // math.factorial(r) // math.factorial(n - r)


def main():
    A, B = input().split()
    print(int(Decimal(A) * Decimal(B)))


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
198 1.10

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The code imports the following modules: sys, math, collections, decimal.
The code then defines the following functions:

make_grid(h, w, num): returns a grid of size h x w, where each cell is initialized to num.
make_adjlist_d(n, edges): returns a list of adjacency lists, where the i-th element is the list of nodes adjacent to the i-th node.
make_adjlist_nond(n, edges): returns a list of adjacency lists, where the i-th element is the list of nodes adjacent to the i-th node.
cmb(n, r): returns the number of combinations of n things taken r at a time.
The code then defines the following variables:

MOD: 10 ** 9 + 7
input: a function that reads a line of input from stdin and returns it as a string.
NI: a function that reads a line of input from stdin, converts it to an integer, and returns it.
NMI: a function that reads a line of input from stdin, converts it to a list of integers, and returns it.
NLI: a function that reads a line of input from stdin, converts it to a list of integers, and returns it.
SI: a function that reads a line of input from stdin, and returns it.
The code then defines the following function:

def main():
The code then defines the following variables:

A and B are initialized to the strings "198" and "1.10", respectively.
The code then prints the product of A and B, which is 198 * 1.10 = 198.1.
The output of code execution is:
198.1
