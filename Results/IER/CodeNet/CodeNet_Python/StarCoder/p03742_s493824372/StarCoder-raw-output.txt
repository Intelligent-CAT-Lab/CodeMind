Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable X is initialized to 2, and variable Y is initialized to 1.
The code checks if the absolute value of X-Y is greater than or equal to 2.
Since X-Y is 1, the absolute value of X-Y is 1.
Since 1 is not greater than or equal to 2, the code prints 'Brown'.
