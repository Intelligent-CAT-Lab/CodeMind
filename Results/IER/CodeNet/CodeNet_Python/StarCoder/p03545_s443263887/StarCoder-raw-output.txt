The variable n is initialized to 1222.
The variable op_cnt is initialized to 4.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 15 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 15.
For each number i in this range, it initializes a list op with 4 elements, which is ['-', '-', '-', '-'].
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to op_cnt (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 3.
For each number j in this range, it checks if the j-th bit of i is 1. If it is, it replaces the last element of op with '+'.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to op_cnt (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 3.
For each number p_n in the list n, it checks if the p_n-th element of n is 1. If it is, it replaces the last element of op with '+'.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to op_cnt (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 3.
For each number p_o in the list op, it checks if the p_o-th element of op is 1. If it is, it replaces the p_o-th element of op with '+'.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to op_cnt (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 3.
For each number p_n, p_o in the list n and op, it concatenates p_n and p_o to form a string formula.
The code then evaluates the formula and checks if it is equal to 7. If it is, it prints the formula and ends the loop.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of formula, which is 1222+222+22+2.
<<<Output>>>
1222+222+22+2=7
