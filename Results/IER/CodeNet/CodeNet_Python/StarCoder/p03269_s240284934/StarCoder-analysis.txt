The variable L is initialized to 4.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 21 to 20 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 21 to 20.
For each number m in this range, it checks if 2 << m is greater than L. If it is, it breaks out of the loop.
The code then initializes a list xs to store the results.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 21 to 0 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 21 to 1.
For each number m in this range, it appends a tuple (m+1, m+2, 0) to xs.
For each number m in this range, it appends a tuple (m+1, m+2, 1 << m) to xs.
The code then initializes a variable b to 1 << m, which is 2 << 20, which is 1048576.
The code then initializes a variable x to L - b, which is 4 - 1048576, which is -1048572.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 20 to 1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 20 to 1.
For each number i in this range, it initializes a variable c to 1 << i, which is 2 << 19, which is 524288.
If x is greater than or equal to c, it appends a tuple (i+1, m+1, b) to xs.
The code then subtracts c from x and adds c to b.
The code then prints the final value of m + 1, which is 21.
The code then prints the length of xs, which is 21.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 20 to 1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 20 to 1.
For each number i in this range, it prints the tuple xs[i].
