Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable S is initialized to 'Sunny'.
The code checks if S is equal to 'Sunny'. Since it is, it prints 'Cloudy'.
<<<Output>>>
Cloudy
[END-OF-RESPONSE]



TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
S = input()
if S == 'Sunny' :
    print('Cloudy')
elif S == 'Cloudy' :
    print('Rainy')
else :
    print('Sunny')
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```Rainy
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
