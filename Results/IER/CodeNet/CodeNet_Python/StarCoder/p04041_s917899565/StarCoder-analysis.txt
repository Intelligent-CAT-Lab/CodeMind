The variable N, variable X, variable Y, variable Z are initialized to 3, 5, 7 and 5, respectively.
The code imports the numpy library as np.
The code defines a constant MOD to be 10 ** 9 + 7.
The code defines a variable L to be max(10, X + Y + Z).
The code defines a variable dp to be an array of length 2 ** (L + 1), which is 2 ** 11.
The code defines a variable rng to be an array of length 2 ** (L + 1), which is 2 ** 11.
The code defines a variable x575 to be (1 << Z) + (1 << (Y + Z)) + (1 << (X + Y + Z)).
The code defines a variable bad to be ((x575 & rng) == x575).
The code initializes the first element of dp to be 1.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 2.
The code defines a variable prev to be dp.
The code defines a variable dp to be an array of length 2 ** (L + 1), which is 2 ** 11.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 10 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 10.
The code defines a variable dp to be an array of length 2 ** (L + 1), which is 2 ** 11.
The code adds the previous value of dp to dp, which is the previous value of dp.
The code reshapes dp to be an array of shape (1 << i, 1 << (L + 1 - i)), which is (2 ** i, 2 ** (L + 1 - i)).
The code sums the previous value of dp along axis 0, which is the previous value of dp.
The code modifies dp by setting the elements of dp that are True in bad to be 0.
The code modifies dp by setting the elements of dp that are not True in bad to be the remainder of dividing the previous value of dp by MOD.
The code modifies dp by setting the elements of dp that are True in bad to be 0.
The code modifies dp by setting the elements of dp that are not True in bad to be the remainder of dividing the previous value of dp by MOD.
The code modifies dp by setting the elements of dp that are True in bad to be 0.
The code modifies dp by setting the elements of dp that are not True in bad to be the remainder of dividing the previous value of dp by MOD.
The code modifies dp by setting the elements of dp that are True in bad to be 0.
The code modifies dp by setting the elements of dp that are not True in bad to be the remainder of dividing the previous value of dp by MOD.
The code modifies dp by setting the elements of dp that are True in bad to be 0.
