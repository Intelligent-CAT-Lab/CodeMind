The variable N is initialized to 10000.
The code then calculates the square root of N, which is 100.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 100 to 1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 100 to 1.
For each number i in this range, it checks if N is divisible by i. If it is, it prints the length of the quotient of N divided by i. The condition is met when i is 100.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the length of the quotient of N divided by 100, which is 10.
