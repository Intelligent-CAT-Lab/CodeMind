The variable n is initialized to 9, and variable y is initialized to 45000.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 9.
For each number i in this range, it enters another loop that iterates from 0 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 9.
For each number j in this range, it calculates the value of y1000 as follows:
y1000 = (y - 10000 * i - 5000 * j)//1000
The code checks if i + j + y1000 == n. If it is, it prints the values of i, j and y1000 and exits the loop.
After the loop finishes, the code prints -1, -1, -1, which is the correct answer.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def readInts():
  return list(map(int,input().split()))

def main():
    n,k = readInts()
    a = readInts()
    a.sort()
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] == k:
            print(i)
            exit()
    print(-1)
    exit()

if __name__ == '__main__':
  main()
