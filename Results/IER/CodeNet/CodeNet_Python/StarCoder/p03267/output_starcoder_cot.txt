Instruction: I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
For example:

Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
20 2 5
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
Consider the following code:

# coding: utf-8
import sys

sr = lambda: sys.stdin.readline().rstrip()
ir = lambda: int(sr())
lr = lambda: list(map(int, sr().split()))

L = ir()
edges = []
length = L.bit_length()
for i in range(1, length):
    edges.append((i, i+1, 2**(i-1)))
    edges.append((i, i+1, 0))

# 2**(length-1)-1までの数は完了
# Lに近い切れ端から処理していく
for i in range(length-1):
    if L >> i & 1:
        L -= 2 ** i
        edges.append((i+1, length, L))

print(length, len(edges))
for x in edges:
    print(*x)

What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
4

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable L is initialized to 4, which is the number of vertices in the tree.
The code then initializes a list edges to store the edges of the tree.
The code calculates the length of the binary representation of L, which is 2.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to length-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 1.
For each number i in this range, it adds two edges to the list edges. The first edge connects the parent of the current node to the current node, and the second edge connects the current node to the child of the current node. The weight of the first edge is 2**(i-1), and the weight of the second edge is 0.
The code then adds an edge to the list edges. The edge connects the parent of the current node to the child of the current node. The weight of the edge is L.
The code prints the length of the tree, which is 2.
The code prints the number of edges in the tree, which is 3.
The code prints the edges of the tree, which is:
1 2 2
1 2 0
2 3 4
