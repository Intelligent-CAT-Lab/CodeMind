The variables W, H, w, h, x, y are initialized to 6000, 5000, 20, 10, 400, 300, respectively.
The variables X1, X2, Y1 and Y2 are initialized to -W/2, W/2, -H/2 and H/2, respectively.
The variables x1, y1, x2 and y2 are initialized to the maximum and minimum values of x and y, respectively.
The variables mx and my are initialized to the average of x1 and x2 and y1 and y2, respectively.
The code then calculates the ratio of my and mx, which is 0.0000000003.
The code then prints the final value of the ratio, which is 0.0000000003.
<<<Output>>>
0.0000000003

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(raw_input())
for i in range(1,N+1):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        print i
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N is initialized to 10.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from
