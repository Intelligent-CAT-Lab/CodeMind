Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variables W, H, w, h, x, y are initialized to 6000, 5000, 20, 10, 400, 300, respectively.
The variables X1, X2, Y1 and Y2 are initialized to -W/2, W/2, -H/2 and H/2, respectively.
The variables x1, y1, x2 and y2 are initialized to the maximum and minimum values of x and y, respectively.
The variables mx and my are initialized to the average of x1 and x2 and y1 and y2, respectively.
The code then calculates the ratio of my and mx, which is 0.0000000003.
The code then prints the final value of the ratio, which is 0.0000000003.
