Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable x, variable y and variable z are initialized to 2, 2 and 0, respectively.
The variable a is initialized to a list of 2 'a' strings, followed by a list of 2 'b' strings, followed by a list of 0 'c' strings.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to the length of a (exclusive), meaning it will consider 0,1,2.
The code sorts the list a in ascending order.
The code then concatenates the first and last elements of the list a, which is 'ac' in this case.
The code then removes the last element of the list a, which is 'c' in this case.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of a, which is 'ac'.
<<<Output>>>
ac

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())
A = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
B = [int(x) for x in input().split()]

for i in range(N):
    if A[i] == B[i]:
        print(A[i])
    else:
        print(A[i], B[i])
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```3
1 2 3
4 5 6
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
