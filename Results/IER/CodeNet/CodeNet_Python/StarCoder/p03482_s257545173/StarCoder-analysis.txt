rint the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable S is initialized to 010.
The variable N is initialized to the length of S, which is 4.
The variable ans is initialized to N, which is 4.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to N - 1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 3.
For each number i in this range, it checks if S[i] is equal to S[i + 1]. If it is not, it calculates the maximum of the following two values:
i + 1, which is 1, and N - i - 1, which is 3.
The minimum of these two values is stored in ans.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 1.
