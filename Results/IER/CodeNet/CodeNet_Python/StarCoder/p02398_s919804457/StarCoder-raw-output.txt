Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized to 5, 14 and 80, respectively.
variable d is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the number of divisors.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from a to b (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 5 to 14.
For each number i in this range, it checks if c is divisible by i. If it is, it adds 1 to d. The condition is met when i is 5,10,14.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of d, which is 3.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if sum_order % 3 == 0:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```100
