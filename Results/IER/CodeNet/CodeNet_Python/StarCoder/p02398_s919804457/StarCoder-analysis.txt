Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized to 5, 14 and 80, respectively.
variable d is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the number of divisors.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from a to b (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 5 to 14.
For each number i in this range, it checks if c is divisible by i. If it is, it adds 1 to d. The condition is met when i is 5,10,14.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of d, which is 3.
