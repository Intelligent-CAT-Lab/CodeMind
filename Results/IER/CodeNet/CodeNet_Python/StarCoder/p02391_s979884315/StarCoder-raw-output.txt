Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable a is initialized to 1, and variable b is initialized to 2.
The code checks if a is less than b. Since 1 < 2, the code prints 'a < b'.
<<<Output>>>
a < b

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
a, b = map(int, input().split())

if(a < b):
    print('a < b')
elif(a > b):
    print('a > b')
else:
    print('a == b')
    
    

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 1
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
