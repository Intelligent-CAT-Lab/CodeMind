The variable k is initialized to 6.
The variable g is initialized to a list of length 6, where each element is initialized to an empty list.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to k-1, meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 5.
For each number i in this range, it appends the tuple ((i+1)%k,1) to the list g[i].
The code also appends the tuple (10*i%k,0) to the list g[i].
