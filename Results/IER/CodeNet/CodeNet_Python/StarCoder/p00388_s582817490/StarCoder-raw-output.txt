Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable H, variable A and variable B are initialized to 100, 2 and 4, respectively.
variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the number of divisors.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from A to B (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 2 to 4.
For each number i in this range, it checks if H is divisible by i. If it is, it adds 1 to ans. The condition is met when i is 2 and 4.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
ans = 0
for i in range(A, B+1) :
    if N % i == 0 :
        ans += 1
print(ans)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```100 2 4
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
