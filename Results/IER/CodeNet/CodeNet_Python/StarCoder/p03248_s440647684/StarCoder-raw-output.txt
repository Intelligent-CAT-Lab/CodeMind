int the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable s is initialized to 1111.
The variable n is initialized to the length of s, which is 4.
The code checks if s[0] is equal to "0" or if s[-1] is equal to "1". If either of these conditions is met, the code prints -1 and exits.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n // 2, meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 2.
For each number i in this range, it checks if s[i] is equal to s[n - i - 2]. If it is not, the code prints -1 and exits.
If i is greater than 0 and s[i] is equal to "1", the code appends i + 1 to the list possible.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the list possible, which is [1, 2].
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to the length of possible, which is 1.
For each number i in this range, it appends the list edges the pair [i + 1, possible[i]].
If i is not equal to the length of possible, it appends the pair [possible[i], possible[i+1]].
If i is equal to the length of possible, it appends the pair [possible[i], possible[i] + 1].
After the loop finishes, the code enters a loop that iterates from cnt + 2 to n + 1, meaning it will consider numbers from 3 to 4.
For each number i in this range, it appends the list edges the pair [cnt + 1, i].
After the loop finishes, the code prints the list edges, which is [[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4]].
