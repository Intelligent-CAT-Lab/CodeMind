rint the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable S is initialized to 1111.
The variable N is initialized to the length of S, which is 4.
The variable S is initialized to '0' + S, which is '01111'.
The code checks if S[1] == '0' or S[N] == '1' or S!= S[::-1].
S[1] == '0' is true, so the code prints -1 and exits.
S[N] == '1' is false, so the code continues.
S!= S[::-1] is true, so the code prints -1 and exits.
<<<Output>>>
-1
