nt the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The code first reads the input and stores it in the variable S.
The code then replaces each character 'a', 'b' and 'c' with '0', '1' and '2', respectively.
The code then converts the string to a list of integers and stores it in the variable arr.
The code then checks if all elements of arr are the same. If so, it prints 1 and exits.
Otherwise, the code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to len(S)-1, meaning it will consider all substrings of S.
For each substring S[i:j], the code calculates the number of distinct substrings of S[i:j] and stores it in the variable answer.
The code then checks if the length of S is less than 6. If so, it calls the function solve_naive(S) and prints the answer.
Otherwise, the code calculates the answer using the following formula:
answer = pow(3,len(S)-1,MOD)
The code then checks if the length of S is divisible by 3. If so, it calculates the following two values:
x = (3+MOD)//2
y = 0
For each iteration of the loop, it calculates the following two values:
x = 4*x+4*y
y = 2*x+6*y
The code then modifies the values of x and y to be within the range [0, MOD-1].
The code then checks if the sum of the elements of arr is divisible by 3. If so, it subtracts x from answer. Otherwise, it subtracts y from answer.
The code then modifies the value of answer to be within the range [0, MOD-1].
The code then prints the final value of answer.
