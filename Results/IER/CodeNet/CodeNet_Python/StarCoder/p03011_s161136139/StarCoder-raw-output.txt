Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variables P, Q and R are initialized to 1, 3 and 4, respectively.
The code then calculates the sum of P+Q and P+R and Q+R and stores them in a list named res.
The code then sorts the list res in ascending order and prints the first element of the sorted list, which is 4.
<<<Output>>>
4

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())

for i in range(1,N+1):
    if i%2==0:
        print(i)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N is initialized to 10.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 10.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is even. If it is, it prints the current number i. The condition is met when i is 2,4,6,8 and 10.
After the loop finishes, no output is printed.
