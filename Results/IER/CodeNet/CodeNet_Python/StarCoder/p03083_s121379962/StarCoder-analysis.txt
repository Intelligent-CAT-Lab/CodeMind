The variable U is initialized to 2*10**5, which is 2*100000.
The variable MOD is initialized to 10**9+7, which is 1000000007.
The variables fact, fact_inv, two and two_inv are initialized to arrays of length U+1, each element initialized to 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to U (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 2*100000.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the following:
fact[i] = (fact[i-1]*i)%MOD
two[i] = (two[i-1]*2)%MOD
fact_inv[U] = pow(fact[U], MOD-2, MOD)
two_inv[U] = pow(two[U], MOD-2, MOD)
For each number i in this range, it calculates the following:
fact_inv[i-1] = (fact_inv[i]*i)%MOD
two_inv[i-1] = (two_inv[i]*2)%MOD
The code then enters a loop that iterates from B+W to 1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from B+W to 1.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the following:
ans = 1 - p + q
ans %= MOD
ans *= two_inv[1]
ans %= MOD
print(ans)
p += comb(i-1, B-1) * two_inv[i] % MOD
p %= MOD
q += comb(i-1, W-1) * two_inv[i] % MOD
q %= MOD
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 1.
