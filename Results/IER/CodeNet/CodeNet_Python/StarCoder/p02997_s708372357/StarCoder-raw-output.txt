The variable n is initialized to 5, and variable k is initialized to 3.
The code then initializes a list edges with the first two elements [1,2] and [1,3].
The code then calculates the number of possible edges, which is (n-1)*(n-2)/2, which is 3.
The code then checks if the number of possible edges is less than k. If it is, the code prints -1 and ends.
Otherwise, the code enters a loop that iterates from 2 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 2 to 5.
For each number i in this range, it enters another loop that iterates from i+1 to n+1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from i+1 to n.
For each number j in this range, it checks if the number of possible edges is greater than k. If it is, it subtracts 1 from the number of possible edges and adds 1 to the number of edges. It also appends the pair [i,j] to the list edges. The condition is met when i is 2 and j is 3.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the number of edges and the list of edges.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
#132_E
n,k=map(int,input().split())
edges=[[1,i] for i in range(2,n+1)]
cnt=(n-1)*(n-2)//2
ans=n-1
if cnt<k:
    print(-1)
else:
