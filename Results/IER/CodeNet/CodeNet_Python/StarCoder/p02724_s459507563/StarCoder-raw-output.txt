Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable X is initialized to 1024.
The code calculates the quotient of X divided by 500 and multiplies it by 1000. The remainder of this division is calculated by taking the remainder of X divided by 500 and dividing it by 5. The quotient and remainder are then added together to produce the final answer.
<<<Output>>>
1500
