Instruction: I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
For example:

Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
20 2 5
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
Consider the following code:

a,b,c,d,e,f=map(int,input().split())
maxsugar=0
maxwater=100*a
for i in range(31):
    for j in range(31):
        for k in range(3001):
            water=100*a*i+100*b*j
            sugar=c*k
            if water+sugar>f:
                continue
            if sugar>(a*i+b*j)*e:
                continue
            sugar+=min((f-(water+sugar))//d*d,((a*i+b*j)*e-c*k)//d*d)
            if 100*maxsugar*(water+sugar)<100*sugar*(maxsugar+maxwater):
                maxsugar=sugar
                maxwater=water
print(maxsugar+maxwater,maxsugar)
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
1 2 10 20 15 200

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable a, variable b, variable c, variable d, variable e and variable f are initialized to 1, 2, 10, 20, 15 and 200, respectively.
variable maxsugar is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the maximum amount of sugar.
variable maxwater is initialized to 100*a, which will be used to accumulate the maximum amount of water.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 30 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 30.
For each number i in this range, it enters another loop that iterates from 0 to 30 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 30.
For each number j in this range, it enters another loop that iterates from 0 to 3000 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 3000.
For each number k in this range, it calculates the amount of water and sugar needed to make the drink, and stores it in water and sugar, respectively.
The code checks if the amount of water plus the amount of sugar is greater than the amount of sugar available. If it is, it skips the current iteration of the innermost loop and goes to the next iteration of the innermost loop.
The code also checks if the amount of sugar is greater than the amount of sugar available for the drink. If it is, it skips the current iteration of the innermost loop and goes to the next iteration of the innermost loop.
The code also calculates the amount of sugar that can be added to the drink, and stores it in sugar.
The code checks if the amount of sugar plus the amount of water is greater than the amount of
