Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable a is initialized to [2, 5, 4], which is the input.
The code sorts the list a in descending order.
The code calculates the difference between the first and second elements of a, which is 3.
The code calculates the difference between the first and third elements of a, which is 1.
The code calculates the difference between the second and third elements of a, which is -1.
The code checks if the sum of the differences is even.
If it is, it prints the average of the two middle elements, which is 3.
If it is not, it prints the average of the two middle elements plus 1, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
a=[int(i) for i in input().split()]
a.sort(reverse=True)

n1=a[0]-a[1]
n2=a[0]-a[2]
n0=a[1]-a[2]
if (n
