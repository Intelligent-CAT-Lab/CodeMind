Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable str1 is initialized to "oxoxoxoxoxoxox".
The variable count1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of occurrences of the letter "o".
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 14 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 14.
For each number i in this range, it checks if the letter at index i is "o". If it is, it adds 1 to count1. The condition is met when i is 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13 and 14.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if count1 is greater than or equal to 8. If it is, it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".
