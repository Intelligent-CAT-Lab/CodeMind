Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable str1 is initialized to "oxoxoxoxoxoxox".
The variable count1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of occurrences of the letter "o".
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 14 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 14.
For each number i in this range, it checks if the letter at index i is "o". If it is, it adds 1 to count1. The condition is met when i is 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13 and 14.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if count1 is greater than or equal to 8. If it is, it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".
<<<Output>>>
YES

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>

str1 = input()

count1 = 0

for i in range(len(str1)):
    if str1[i] == "o":
        count1 +=1

if count1 >= 8:
    print("YES")
else:
    print("NO")
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```oxoxoxoxoxoxox
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
