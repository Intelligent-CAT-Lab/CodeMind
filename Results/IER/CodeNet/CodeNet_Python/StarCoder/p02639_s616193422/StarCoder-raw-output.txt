Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable a is initialized to the input, which is "0 2 3 4 5".
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 4 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 4.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is equal to the number in the ith position of the input, which is 0, 2, 3, 4 and 5, respectively.
If the condition is met, the code skips to the next iteration of the loop.
If the condition is not met, the code prints the current value of i+1, which is 1, 3, 4 and 5, respectively.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of i+1, which is 5.
<<<Output>>>
5

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
a = input().split()
for i in range(5):
  if i == int(a[i])-1:
    continue
  else:
    print(i+1)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```0 2 3 4 5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
