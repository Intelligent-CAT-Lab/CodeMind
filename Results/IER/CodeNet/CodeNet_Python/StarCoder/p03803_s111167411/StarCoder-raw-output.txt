Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable A and variable B are initialized to 8 and 6, respectively.
The code checks if A is equal to 1. If it is, it sets A to 14.
The code checks if B is equal to 1. If it is, it sets B to 14.
The code checks if A is greater than B. If it is, it prints 'Alice'.
The code checks if B is greater than A. If it is, it prints 'Bob'.
The code checks if A is equal to B. If it is, it prints 'Draw'.
After the code finishes, the output is 'Draw'.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())

for i in range(1,N+1):
    if i%2 == 0:
        print(i, end=' ')
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N is initialized to 10.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 10.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is even. If it is, it prints i.
After the loop finishes, the output is 2 4 6 8 10.
<<<Output>>>
2 4 6 8 10
