Instruction: I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
For example:

Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
20 2 5
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
Consider the following code:

m,n = map(int, input().split())
mod = 10**9+7
print(pow(m,n,mod))

What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
2 3

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable m is initialized to 2, and variable n is initialized to 3.
The code then calculates the value of m^n mod 10^9+7, which is 8.
The code prints the final value of m^n mod 10^9+7, which is 8.

The output of code execution is:
8
END-OF-OUTPUT

Input:
The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and M.
The second line contains a single integer A.
The third line contains a single integer B.

Output:
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the answer to the problem.

Constraints:
1≤T≤100
1≤N≤100
1≤M≤100
1≤A≤B≤100

Subtasks:
Subtask #1 (100 points): original constraints

Example Input:
2
20 2 5
2 3

Example Output:
84
8

Explanation:
Example case 1: The numbers meeting the condition are 2, 3, 4, 5, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 20. Their sum is 84.
Example case 2: The value of 2^3 mod 10^9+7 is 8.
