Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable n is initialized to 111.
The variable x is initialized to 111.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 8 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 8.
For each number i in this range, it checks if x is greater than or equal to n. If it is, it prints x and breaks out of the loop.
If x is not greater than or equal to n, it adds 111 to x and repeats the loop.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of x, which is 111.
<<<Output>>>
111

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
n = int(input())
x = 111

for i in range(9):
    if x >= n:
        print(x)
        break
    else:
        x += 111

for i in range(9):
    if x <= n:
        print(x)
        break
    else:
        x += 111

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```111
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
