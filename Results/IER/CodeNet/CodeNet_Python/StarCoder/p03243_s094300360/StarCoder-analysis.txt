The variable n is initialized to 111.
The variable x is initialized to 111.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 8 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 8.
For each number i in this range, it checks if x is greater than or equal to n. If it is, it prints x and breaks out of the loop.
If x is not greater than or equal to n, it adds 111 to x and repeats the loop.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of x, which is 111.
