Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable k is initialized to 7.
The variable n is initialized to 512.
The variable a is initialized to an empty string.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from n-1 to 0 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 511 to 0.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the value of the factorial of 7+i, then divides it by the factorial of i and finally by the factorial of 7.
The code then appends the string "L" to a the number of times equal to the quotient of k and v.
The code then calculates the remainder of k divided by v.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of a, which is "FESTIVA".
