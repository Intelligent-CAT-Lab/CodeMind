The variable W, variable a and variable b are initialized to 3, 2 and 6, respectively.
The code checks if W, a and b are within the range [0, 100000]. If any of them is not, the code exits with an error message.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 100000 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 100000.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
