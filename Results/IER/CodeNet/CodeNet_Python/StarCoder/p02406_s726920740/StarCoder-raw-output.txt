The variable n is initialized to 30.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 30.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is divisible by 3. If it is, it prints the number i.
If i is not divisible by 3, it calculates the last digit of i.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to x (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to the last digit of i.
For each number j in this range, it checks if j is equal to 3. If it is, it prints the number i.
If j is not equal to 3, it divides x by 10.
After the loop finishes, the code prints a newline.
