Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable A and variable B are initialized to 5 and 5, respectively.
The code checks if B is greater than or equal to A. If it is, it prints A.
If B is less than A, it prints A-1.
The code prints 4.
<<<Output>>>
4

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())
for i in range(1,N+1):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        print(i)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N is initialized to 10.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 10.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is even. If it is, it prints i.
The code prints 2,4,6,8 and 10.
<<<Output>>>
2
4
