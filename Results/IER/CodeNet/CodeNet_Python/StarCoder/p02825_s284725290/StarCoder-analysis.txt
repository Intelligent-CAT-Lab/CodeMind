The variable n is initialized to 6.
The code checks if n is equal to 2. If it is, it prints -1 and ends the program.
Otherwise, the code initializes a 2D array ans to a 6x6 array of "." characters.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 5.
For each number i in this range, it initializes a 2D array ans to a 6x6 array of "." characters.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 5.
For each number j in this range, it initializes a 2D array ans to a 6x6 array of "." characters.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 1.
For each number k in this range, it initializes a 2D array ans to a 6x6 array of "." characters.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 1.
For each number l in this range, it initializes a 2D array ans to a 6x6 array of "." characters.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 5.
