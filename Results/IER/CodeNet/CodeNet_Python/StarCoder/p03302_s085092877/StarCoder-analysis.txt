Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable a is initialized to 4, and variable b is initialized to 11.
The code checks if a+b is equal to 15. Since it is not, the code checks if a*b is equal to 15. Since it is, the code prints * and ends.
If a+b is not equal to 15, then a*b must be not equal to 15, so the code prints x and ends.
