Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable a is initialized to 4, and variable b is initialized to 11.
The code checks if a+b is equal to 15. Since it is not, the code checks if a*b is equal to 15. Since it is, the code prints * and ends.
If a+b is not equal to 15, then a*b must be not equal to 15, so the code prints x and ends.
<<<Output>>>
x

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b = map(int,input().split())
if a+b == 15:
	print('+')
elif a*b == 15:
	print('*')
else:
	print('x')
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```11 4
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
