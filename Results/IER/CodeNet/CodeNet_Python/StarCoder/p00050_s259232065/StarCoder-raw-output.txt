The variable s is initialized to "the cost of one peach is higher than that of one apple."
The code replaces the word "apple" with "X".
The code replaces the word "peach" with "apple".
The code replaces the word "X" with "peach".
The code prints the final value of s, which is "the cost of one X is higher than that of one peach."
<<<Output>>>
the cost of one X is higher than that of one peach.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
s = input()
s = s.replace("apple", "X")
s = s.replace("peach", "apple")
s = s.replace("X", "peach")
print(s)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
