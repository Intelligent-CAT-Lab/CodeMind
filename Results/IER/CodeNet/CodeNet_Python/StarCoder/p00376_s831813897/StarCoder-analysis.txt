Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable a is initialized to 20, and variable b is initialized to 30.
The code checks if a-b is equal to 0. If it is, it prints 0 and ends.
If a-b is not equal to 0, the code checks if a is greater than b. If it is, it prints a-b and ends.
If a is not greater than b, the code checks if b is greater than a. If it is, it prints b-a and ends.
The code does not reach the end of the if-else statement, so it prints the last value of b-a, which is 10.
