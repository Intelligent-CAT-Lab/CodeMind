The variable N is initialized to 25.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 25.
For each number i in this range, it converts it to a string s and extracts the first and last digits of s.
The code then increments the count[int(s[0])][int(s[-1])] by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code calculates the sum of all the possible pairs of numbers that satisfy the condition.
