Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N is initialized to 25.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 25.
For each number i in this range, it converts it to a string s and extracts the first and last digits of s.
The code then increments the count[int(s[0])][int(s[-1])] by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code calculates the sum of all the possible pairs of numbers that satisfy the condition.
<<<Output>>>
120

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())
count = [0] * 10
for i in range(1, N + 1):
    s = str(i)
    count[int(s[0])] += 1
ans = sum(count[i] * count[i] for i in range(1, 10))
print(ans)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```25
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
