Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variables a, b and c are initialized to 2, 4 and 6, respectively.
The code checks if (b - a) == (c - b), which is true in this case.
The code prints "YES" and ends the response.
<<<Output>>>
YES
[END-OF-RESPONSE]



TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b,c = map(int, input().split())
if (a + b) > c and (a + c) > b and (b + c) > a:
    print("YES")
else:
    print("NO")
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```2 4 6
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
