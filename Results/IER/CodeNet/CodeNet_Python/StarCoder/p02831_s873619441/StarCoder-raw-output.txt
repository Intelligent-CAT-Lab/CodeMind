Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The code first reads the input and stores it in a list.
The code then calculates the greatest common divisor of the two numbers in the list.
The code then calculates the product of the two numbers and divides it by the greatest common divisor.
The code then prints the final value of the product divided by the greatest common divisor, which is 1.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def gcd(a, b):
    return b if a == 0 else gcd(b%a, a)
num = [int(x) for x in input().split(" ")]
print(int(num[0]*num[1]/gcd(num[0], num[1])))
</Code>
