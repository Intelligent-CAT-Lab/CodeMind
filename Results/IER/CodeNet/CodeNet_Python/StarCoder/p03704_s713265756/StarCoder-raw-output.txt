int the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable D is initialized to 63.
memo_F is initialized to an array of 30 elements, which will be used to store the number of ways to make change for each amount of money.
memo_T is initialized to an array of 30 elements, which will be used to store the number of ways to make change for each amount of money.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 9, meaning it will consider amounts of money from 0 to 99.
For each amount of money x in this range, it calculates the number of ways to make change for each amount of money y, and stores it in memo_T.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 9, meaning it will consider amounts of money from 0 to 99.
For each amount of money x in this range, it calculates the number of ways to make change for each amount of money y, and stores it in memo_F.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 19, meaning it will consider amounts of change from 1 to 199.
For each amount of change K in this range, it calculates the number of ways to make change for each amount of money D, and adds it to the answer.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of answer, which is 1264.
<<<Output>>>
1264

<Code>
import sys
input = sys.stdin.readline

N = int(input())

memo = [0] * 1000000
memo[0] = 1
