Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable n and variable m are initialized to 2 and 2, respectively.
The code checks if n and m are equal. If they are, it prints 1 and ends.
If n and m are not equal, the code checks if either n or m is equal to 1. If they are, it prints the maximum of n and m minus 2.
If neither n nor m is equal to 1, it prints the product of n minus 2 and m minus 2.
After the code finishes, the output is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
n = int(input())
if n%2==0:
  print(n//2)
else:
  print(3*n+1)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable n is initialized to 10.
The code checks if n is even. If it is, it prints n divided by 2.
If n is odd, it prints 3 times n plus 1.
After the code finishes, the output is 17.
<<<Output>>>
17
