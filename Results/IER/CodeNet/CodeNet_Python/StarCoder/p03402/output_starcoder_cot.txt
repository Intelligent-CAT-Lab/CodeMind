Instruction: I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
For example:

Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
20 2 5
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
Consider the following code:

A,B = map(int,input().split())
X = []
for i in range(100):
    defC = "." if i<50 else "#"
    line = [defC for _ in range(100)]
    X.append(line)

h,w = (B-1)//50,(B-1)%50
for i in range(h):
    for j in range(50):
        X[i*2][j*2] = "#"
for i in range(w):
    X[h*2][i*2] = "#"

h,w = (A-1)//50,(A-1)%50
for i in range(h):
    for j in range(50):
        X[i*2+51][j*2] = "."
for i in range(w):
    X[h*2+51][i*2] = "."

print(100,100)
for i in range(100):
    print("".join(X[i]))
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
2 3

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The code first initializes the variables A and B to 2 and 3, respectively.
The code then initializes the variable X to an empty list.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 99, meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 99.
For each number i in this range, it defines a function defC that returns "." if i is less than 50, and "#" otherwise.
It then defines a list line that contains 100 elements, each of which is "." (the default value).
It then appends line to X.
The code then defines two variables h and w, which are the quotient and remainder of the division of B-1 by 50, respectively.
It then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to h-1, meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to h-1.
For each number i in this range, it enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 49, meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 49.
For each number j in this range, it assigns the value "#" to X[i*2][j*2].
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to w-1, meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to w-1.
For each number i in this range, it assigns the value "#" to X[h*2][i*2].
The code then defines two variables h and w, which are the quotient and remainder of the division of A-1 by 50, respectively.
It then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to h-1, meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to h-1.
For each number i in this range, it enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 49, meaning
