The variable S is initialized to the string "atcoder".
The code then converts each character in S to its corresponding ASCII code and subtracts 97 to get the corresponding index of the character in the alphabet.
The code then initializes a list alpha with 26 elements, which will be used to store the number of times each letter appears in S.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 25 (inclusive), meaning it will consider letters from a to z.
For each letter s in this range, it adds 1 to the corresponding element in alpha.
The code checks if the length of S is not equal to 26. If it is not, the code enters another loop that iterates from 0 to 25 (inclusive), meaning it will consider letters from a to z.
For each index i in this range, it checks if the corresponding element in alpha is 0. If it is, it adds the current index i to S and stores the result in ans. The code then converts each element in ans to its corresponding ASCII code and adds 97 to get the corresponding character. The code then prints the final value of ans, which is "atcoder".
If the length of S is equal to 26, the code enters another loop that iterates from 25 to 0 (inclusive), meaning it will consider letters from z to a.
For each index i in this range, it checks if the number of 0s in the range [S[i], 26) is greater than 0. If it is, it enters another loop that iterates from S[i] to 25 (inclusive), meaning it will consider letters from S[i] to z.
For each index j in this range, it checks if the corresponding element in alpha is 0. If it is, it adds the current index j to S and stores the result in ans. The code then converts each element in ans to its corresponding ASCII code and adds 97 to get the corresponding character. The code then prints the final value of ans, which is "atcoder".
If the code reaches this point, it means that the string S is already sorted. The code then prints -1.
