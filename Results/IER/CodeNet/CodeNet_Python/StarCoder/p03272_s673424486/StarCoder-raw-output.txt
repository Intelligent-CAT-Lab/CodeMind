The variable n is initialized to 4, and i is initialized to 2.
The code subtracts i from n, which is 4 - 2 = 2.
The code adds 1 to the result, which is 2 + 1 = 3.
The code prints the final value of n - i + 1, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import sys


stdin = sys.stdin
def ns(): return stdin.readline().rstrip()
def ni(): return int(stdin.readline().rstrip())
def nm(): return map(int, stdin.readline().split())
def nl(): return list(map(int, stdin.readline().split()))


def main():
    n, k = nm()
    a = nl()
    a.sort()
    print(a[k - 1])


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 3
1 2 3 4 5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable n is initialized to 5, and k is initialized to 3.
The code reads the next line of input, which is "1 2 3 4 5", and stores it in a.
The code sorts a in ascending order, which results in a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
