Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variables a, b and c are initialized to "rng", "gorilla" and "apple", respectively.
The code checks if the last character of a is equal to the first character of b and if the last character of b is equal to the first character of c.
Since the last character of a is "n" and the first character of b is "g", the first condition is not met.
Since the last character of b is "a" and the first character of c is "a", the second condition is not met.
Since the first condition is not met and the second condition is not met, the code prints "NO".
<<<Output>>>
NO

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b,c=map(str,input().split())
if a[-1]==b[0] and b[-1]==c[0]:
    print("YES")
else:
    print("NO")
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```rng gorilla apple
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
