Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variables a, b and c are initialized to "rng", "gorilla" and "apple", respectively.
The code checks if the last character of a is equal to the first character of b and if the last character of b is equal to the first character of c.
Since the last character of a is "n" and the first character of b is "g", the first condition is not met.
Since the last character of b is "a" and the first character of c is "a", the second condition is not met.
Since the first condition is not met and the second condition is not met, the code prints "NO".
