Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variables A, B, C, X and Y are initialized to 1500, 2000, 1600, 3 and 2, respectively.
The code calculates the value of v1 by multiplying A and X, adding B and Y, and then dividing the result by 1000.
The code calculates the value of v2 by multiplying C by 2, multiplying Y by 2000, adding A and B, and then dividing the result by 1000.
The code calculates the value of v3 by multiplying C by 2, multiplying X by 2000, adding A and B, and then dividing the result by 1000.
The code then prints the minimum of v1, v2 and v3, which is 1500.
