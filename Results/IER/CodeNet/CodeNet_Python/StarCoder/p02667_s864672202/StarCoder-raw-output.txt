The variable s is initialized to 1101.
The variable n is initialized to the length of s, which is 5.
The variable n2 is initialized to n//2, which is 2.
The variable ans is initialized to n2*(n2+1)+n%2*(n2+1), which is 2*(2+1)+1*(2+1)=10.
The variable rem is initialized to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 4.
For each number i in this range, it checks if the character at position i in s is 1. If it is, it skips the current iteration.
Otherwise, it decrements ans by (rem+1)//2, which is 0//2=0.
Then it checks if rem is even and i is even. If it is, it decrements ans by 1, which is 0-1=1.
Then it checks if (i-rem) is even. If it is, it increments rem by 1, which is 0+1=1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
