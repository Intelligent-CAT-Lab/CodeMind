Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable n is initialized to 12.
variable s is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of digits of n.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to the length of n (inclusive), meaning it will consider digits from 0 to 1.
For each digit i in this range, it adds the current digit to s.
The code checks if n is divisible by s. If it is, it prints 'Yes'. Otherwise, it prints 'No'.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of s, which is 3.
