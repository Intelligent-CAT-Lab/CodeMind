The variable A and variable B are initialized to 11009 and 11332, respectively.
variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the number of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from A to B (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 11009 to 11332.
For each number x in this range, it converts x to a string and checks if the first two characters of the string are equal to the last two characters of the string, in reverse order.
If the condition is met, it adds 1 to ans. The condition is met when x is 11009, 11010, 11011, 11012, 11013, 11014, 11015, 11016, 11017, 11018, 11019, 11020, 11021, 11022, 11023, 11024, 11025, 11026, 11027, 11028, 11029, 11030, 11031, 11032, 11033, 11034, 11035, 11036, 11037, 11038, 11039, 11040, 11041, 11042, 11043, 11044, 11045, 11046, 11047, 11048, 11049, 11050, 11051, 11052, 11053, 11054, 11055, 11056, 11057, 11058, 11059, 11060, 11061, 11062, 11063, 11064, 11065, 11066, 11067, 11068, 11069, 11070, 11071, 11072, 11073, 11074, 11075, 11076, 11077, 11078, 11079, 11080, 11081, 11082, 11083, 11084, 11085, 11086, 11087, 11088, 11089, 11090, 11091, 11092, 11093, 11094, 11095, 11096, 11097, 11098, 11099
