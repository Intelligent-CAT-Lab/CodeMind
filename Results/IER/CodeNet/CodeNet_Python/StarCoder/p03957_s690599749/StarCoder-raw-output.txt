Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable s is initialized to "CODEFESTIVAL".
The variable f is initialized to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to the length of s (inclusive), meaning it will consider characters from 0 to 11.
For each character i in this range, it checks if the character is "C" and if f is 0. If both conditions are met, it increments f by 1.
The code then checks if f is 1 and if the character is "F". If both conditions are met, it prints "Yes" and exits the loop.
After the loop finishes, the code prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
[END-OF-RESPONSE]



TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
s=raw_input()
f=0
for i in xrange(len(s)):
    if "C"==s[i] and f==0:
        f+=1
    if f==1 and "F"==s[i]:
        print("Yes")
        exit()
print("No")
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```CODEFESTIVAL
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
