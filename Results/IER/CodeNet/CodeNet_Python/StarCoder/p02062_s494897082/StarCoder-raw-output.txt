rint the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The code first initializes a dictionary tr that maps each character to a number.
The question variable is initialized to 1, which is the number that represents the question mark.
AND, OR, left and right are initialized to -1, -2, -3 and -4, respectively.
The code then initializes a list S that contains the numbers corresponding to the characters in the input.
The code then initializes a list f that will be used to store the intermediate results.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the list S.
For each character s in S, the code checks if s is equal to question. If it is, it calls the push function with s and s as arguments.
If s is equal to AND or left, it appends s to f.
If s is equal to right, it enters a while loop that iterates until f[-1] is equal to left.
Inside the while loop, it pops the last element from f and stores it in sp.
It then asserts that sp[0] is greater than 0 and sp[1] is greater than 0.
It then appends sp to stack.
It then asserts that f.pop() is equal to left.
It then calls the push function with evalor(stack[::-1]) as its argument.
After the loop finishes, it calls the evalor function with f as its argument.
It then prints the first element of the tuple returned by evalor, which is the minimum of the first two elements of f.
