The code first initializes a dictionary cnt to store the frequency of each letter.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each line in the input.
For each line, it enters another loop that iterates over each character in the line.
For each character, it converts it to lowercase and stores the count of the lowercase letter in cnt.
The code then enters another loop that iterates over the letters a to z.
For each letter, it prints the letter and the count of the letter in cnt.
