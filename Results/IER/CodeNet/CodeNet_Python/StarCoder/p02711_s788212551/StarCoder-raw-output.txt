Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable n is initialized to 117.
The code checks if the string "7" is contained in the string n. Since it is, the code prints "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
[END-OF-RESPONSE]



TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
n=input()
if n.count("7")>0:
  print("Yes")
else:
  print("No")
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```117
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable n is initialized to 117.
The code checks if the string "7" occurs more than once in the string n. Since it does, the code prints "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
