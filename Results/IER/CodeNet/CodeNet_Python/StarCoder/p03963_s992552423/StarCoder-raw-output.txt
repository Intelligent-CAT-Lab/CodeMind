The variable N, variable K are initialized to 2 and 2, respectively.
variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code checks if N is equal to 1. If it is, it prints K and ends the program.
Otherwise, the code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 2.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N,K = map(int,input().split())
ans = 0
if N==1:
  print(K)
else:
  print(K*(K-1)**(N-1))
</Code>
