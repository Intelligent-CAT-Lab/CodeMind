NO-ANSWER
rint the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable n is initialized to 3.
The variable MOD is initialized to 10 ** 9 + 7.
The variable factorial is initialized to an array of length n+1, which is [0, 0, 0].
The variable factorial[0] is initialized to 1.
The variable factorial[1] is initialized to 1.
The variable factorial[2] is initialized to 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 3.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the product of the previous values of factorial[i-1] and i.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to the square root of n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 2 to the square root of 3.
For each number i in this range, it checks if n is divisible by i. If it is, it divides n by i and increases the value of the corresponding factorial[i] by 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to the square root of n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 2 to the square root of 3.
For each number i in this range, it checks if n is divisible by i. If it is, it divides n by i and increases the value of the corresponding factorial[i] by 1.
