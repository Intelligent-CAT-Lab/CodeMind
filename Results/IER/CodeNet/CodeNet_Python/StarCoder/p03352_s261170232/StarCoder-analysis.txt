Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable X is initialized to 10.
variable answer is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the maximum value of the powers of i.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to the ceiling of X to the power of 0.5 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 3.
For each number i in this range, it enters another loop that iterates from 2 to 10 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 2 to 10.
For each number j in this range, it calculates the power of i to the jth power and stores it in power_ij.
The code checks if power_ij is less than or equal to X. If it is, it updates answer to the maximum of power_ij and answer. The condition is met when i is 1,2 and 3, and j is 2,3,4,5,6,7,8 and 9.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of answer, which is 9.
