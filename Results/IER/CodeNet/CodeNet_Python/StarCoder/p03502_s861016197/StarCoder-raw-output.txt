Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable n is initialized to 12.
The variable _sum is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of the digits of n.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to the length of n (inclusive), meaning it will consider digits from 0 to 1.
For each digit i in this range, it adds it to _sum.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if n is divisible by _sum. If it is, it prints 'Yes'. Otherwise, it prints 'No'.
<<<Output>>>
Yes

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
n=input()
_sum=0
for i in range(len(n)):
    _sum+=int(n[i])
print('Yes') if int(n)%_sum==0 else print('No')
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```123
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
