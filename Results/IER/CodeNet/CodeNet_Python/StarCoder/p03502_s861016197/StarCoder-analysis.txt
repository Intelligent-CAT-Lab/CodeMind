The variable n is initialized to 12.
The variable _sum is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of the digits of n.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to the length of n (inclusive), meaning it will consider digits from 0 to 1.
For each digit i in this range, it adds it to _sum.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if n is divisible by _sum. If it is, it prints 'Yes'. Otherwise, it prints 'No'.
