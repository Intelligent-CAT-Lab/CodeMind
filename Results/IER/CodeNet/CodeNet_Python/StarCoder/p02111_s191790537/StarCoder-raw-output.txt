Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable t is initialized to 0.
The code then multiplies t by 2, which results in 0.
The code then divides t by 60, which results in 0.
The code then prints the quotient and the remainder of t, which is 0 and 0.
<<<Output>>>
0 0

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if sum_order%2 == 0:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output
