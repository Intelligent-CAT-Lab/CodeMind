Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable r, variable g and variable b are initialized to 4, 3 and 2, respectively.
The code calculates the answer by multiplying r, g and b and adding them together.
The code checks if answer is divisible by 4. If it is, it prints "YES", otherwise it prints "NO".
The answer is 432, which is divisible by 4.
<<<Output>>>
YES

<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N is initialized to 10.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 10.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is even. If it is, it prints i.
The answer is 2 4 6 8 10, which is the even numbers from 1 to 10.
<<<Output>>>
2 4 6 8 10
