The function ex_euclid is defined to take two integers as input and return the greatest common divisor of the two integers, along with the coefficients of Bézout's identity.
The function is called with the input 4 and 12.
The function first initializes two variables c0 and c1 to 4 and 12, respectively.
The function then initializes two more variables a0 and a1 to 1 and 0, respectively.
The function then initializes two more variables b0 and b1 to 0 and 1, respectively.
The function then enters a while loop that continues as long as c1 is not 0.
Inside the loop, the function calculates the coefficients of Bézout's identity, using the following formula:
a0 = a1 - c0//c1*a1
b0 = b1 - c0//c1*b1
c0 = c1
c1 = c0 % c1
The function then exits the loop and returns the coefficients a0 and b0.
The function is called with the input 4 and 12.
The function returns the greatest common divisor of 4 and 12, which is 4, along with the coefficients a0 and b0, which are 1 and -1, respectively.
The function prints the coefficients a0 and b0, which are 1 and -1, and ends with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
