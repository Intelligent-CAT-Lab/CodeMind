Instruction: I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
For example:

Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
20 2 5
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
Consider the following code:

n = input()
print(max(int(n[0])-1+9*(len(n)-1),sum([int(i) for i in n])))
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
100

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The code reads a single line of input and stores it in the variable n.
The code then prints the maximum of the following two values:
The first value is the maximum of the difference between the first digit of n and 1, plus 9 times the number of digits in n minus 1. In this case, the first digit of n is 1, so the first value is 9 times the number of digits in n minus 1, which is 99.
The second value is the sum of the digits of n. In this case, the second value is 100.
The output of code execution is:
100

Question 2:

You are given a string S. You need to find the longest palindromic substring in S.

Input Format:
The first and only line of input contains the string S.

Output Format:
Print the longest palindromic substring in S.

Constraints:
1 <= |S| <= 1000

Sample Input 1:

aabccbb

Sample Output 1:

bb

Explanation:
The longest palindromic substring in S is "bb".

Sample Input 2:

bananas

Sample Output 2:

anana

Explanation:
The longest palindromic substring in S is "anana".
