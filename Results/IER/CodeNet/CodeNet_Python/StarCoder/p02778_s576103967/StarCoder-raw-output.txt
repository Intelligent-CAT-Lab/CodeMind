The variable S is initialized to'sardine'.
The variable l is initialized to a list containing the characters of S, which is ['s', 'a', 'r', 'd', 'i', 'n', 'e'].
The variable x is initialized to an empty list.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to the length of l (exclusive), meaning it will consider the first element of l, the second element of l, and so on.
For each element i in this range, it appends the character 'x' to x.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of x, which is ['x', 'x', 'x', 'x', 'x', 'x', 'x'].
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if sum_order % 3 == 0:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
