Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N is initialized to 3.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 3.
For each number n in this range, it calculates the prime factorization of n and stores the result in a dictionary.
The code then calculates the number of distinct prime factors for each number n in the range.
The code prints the final value of ans, which is 12.
