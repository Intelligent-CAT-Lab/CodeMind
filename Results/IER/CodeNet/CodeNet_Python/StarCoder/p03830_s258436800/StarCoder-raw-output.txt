The variable N is initialized to 3.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 3.
For each number n in this range, it calculates the prime factorization of n and stores the result in a dictionary.
The code then calculates the number of distinct prime factors for each number n in the range.
The code prints the final value of ans, which is 12.
<<<Output>>>
12

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import sys
from collections import defaultdict

read = sys.stdin.buffer.read
readline = sys.stdin.buffer.readline

in_n = lambda: int(readline())
in_nn = lambda: map(int, readline().split())
in_nl = lambda: list(map(int, readline().split()))
in_na = lambda: map(int, read().split())
in_s = lambda: readline().rstrip().decode('utf-8')


mod = 10**9 + 7


def factorize_dict(n):
    b = 2
    fct = defaultdict(lambda: 0)
    while b ** 2 <= n:
        while n % b == 0:
            n //= b
            fct[b] += 1
        b += 1
    if n > 1:
        fct[n] += 1
    return fct

    for n in range(1, N + 1):
        d = factorize_dict(n)
        for k, v in d.items():
