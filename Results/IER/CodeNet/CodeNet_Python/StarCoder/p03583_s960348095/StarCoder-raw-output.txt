The variable N is initialized to 2.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 3500, meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 3500.
For each number h in this range, it enters another loop that iterates from 1 to 3500, meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 3500.
For each number w in this range, it calculates the value of N * h * w / (4 * h * w - N * w - N * h), which is 2 * h * w / (4 * h * w - N * w - N * h).
The code checks if n is an integer and if it is greater than 0. If it is, it prints h, w and n, which is 1, 1, 2.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
