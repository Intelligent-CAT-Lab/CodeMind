The variable x, variable y are initialized to 0, 0, respectively.
The variables left, right, up, down are initialized to 0, 0, 0, 0, respectively.
The variables fiv1 and fiv2 are initialized to 0 and 1, respectively.
The variable color is initialized to [1,2,3].
The variable ans is initialized to 0.
The code enters a while loop that will be exited when the condition is met.
The code calculates the value of num, which is fiv1 + fiv2.
The code adds num to right, which is 0 + 1 = 1.
The code reassigns fiv1 to fiv2, which is 0 to 1.
The code reassigns fiv2 to num, which is 1 to 2.
The code adds 1 to ans, which is 0 + 1 = 1.
The code checks if the condition is met. The condition is met when x is 0 and y is 0.
The code enters a while loop that will be exited when the condition is met.
The code calculates the value of num, which is fiv1 + fiv2.
The code adds num to up, which is 1 + 2 = 3.
The code reassigns fiv1 to fiv2, which is 1 to 2.
The code reassigns fiv2 to num, which is 2 to 3.
The code adds 1 to ans, which is 1 + 1 = 2.
The code checks if the condition is met. The condition is met when x is 0 and y is 0.
The code enters a while loop that will be exited when the condition is met.
The code calculates the value of num, which is fiv1 + fiv2.
The code subtracts num from left, which is 2 - 3 = -1.
The code reassigns fiv1 to fiv2, which is 2 to 3.
The code reassigns fiv2 to num, which is 3 to 5.
The code adds 1 to ans, which is 2 + 1 = 3.
The code checks if the condition is met. The condition is met when x is 0 and y is 0.
The code enters a while loop that will be exited when the condition is met.
The code calculates the value of num, which is fiv1 + fiv2.
The code subtracts num from down, which is 3 - 5 = -2.
The code reassigns fiv1 to fiv2, which is 3 to 5.
The code reassigns fiv2 to num, which is 5 to 8.
The code adds 1 to ans, which is 3 + 1 = 4.
The code checks if the condition is met. The condition is met when x is 0 and y is 0.
The code exits the while loop.
The code prints the final value of ans, which is 4.
The code calculates the value of ans%3, which is 4%3 = 1.
The code prints the final value of color[ans%3], which is 3.
