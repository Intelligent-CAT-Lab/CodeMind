Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable n is initialized to 3, and variable m is initialized to 8.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 3.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the value of the function f, which is 2i+4(n-i).
The code checks if f is equal to m. If it is, it prints 'Yes' and breaks out of the loop.
If the loop finishes without breaking out, it prints 'No'.
<<<Output>>>
Yes

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
n = int(input())

for i in range(1, n+1):
    if n % i == 0:
        print(i)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
