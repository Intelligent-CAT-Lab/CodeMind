The variable n is initialized to 3, and variable m is initialized to 8.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 3.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the value of the function f, which is 2i+4(n-i).
The code checks if f is equal to m. If it is, it prints 'Yes' and breaks out of the loop.
If the loop finishes without breaking out, it prints 'No'.
