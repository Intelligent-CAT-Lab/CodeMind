Instruction: I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
For example:

Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
20 2 5
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84

Consider the following code:


def bisect(ng, ok, judge):
    while abs(ng-ok) > 1:
        m = (ng+ok)//2
        if judge(m):
            ok = m
        else:
            ng = m
    return ok

def solve(S):
    d = {'0':0,'1':1,'?':2}
    S = tuple(d[c] for c in S)
    lookup = ((-1,-1),(1,1), (-1,1))

    def judge(target_lo, target_hi):
        lo,hi = 0,0
        pl = target_lo%2 == 0
        ph = target_hi%2 == 0
        for s in S:
            a,b = lookup[s]
            lo = max(lo+a, target_lo+pl)
            hi = min(hi+b, target_hi-ph)
            if hi < lo:
                return False
            pl = not pl
            ph = not ph
        return True

    best = 10**6*2
    n0,n1,n2 = S.count(0), S.count(1), S.count(2)
    lo = -n0-n2
    hi = n1+n2
    while True:
        hi = bisect(-1, hi, lambda x: judge(lo, x))
        lo = bisect(1, lo, lambda x: judge(x, hi))
        if hi-lo >= best:
            break
        else:
            best = hi-lo
    hi += 1
    lo = bisect(1, lo, lambda x: judge(x, hi))
    return min(best, hi-lo)

# from itertools import product, accumulate
# from random import shuffle

# def naive(S):
#     d = {'0':(-1,), '1':(1,), '?': (-1,1)}
#     return min(max(0,max(accumulate(X)))-min(0,min(accumulate(X))) for X in product(*(d[c] for c in S)))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    S = input()
    print(solve(S))

    # for _ in range(50):
    #     S = ['0']*15+['1']*15+['?']*14
    #     shuffle(S)
    #     S = ''.join(S)
    #     print(S, naive(S), solve(S))
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
0??

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The code first initializes a dictionary d that maps each character to a tuple of integers. The character '0' maps to the tuple (-1,), the character '1' maps to the tuple (1,), and the character '?' maps to the tuple (-1,1).
The code then initializes a variable best to 10^6*2, which is 20,000,000.
The code then initializes three variables n0, n1 and n2 to the number of occurrences of '0', '1' and '?' in the input string S, which is 1, 15 and 14, respectively.
The code then initializes two variables lo and hi to -n0-n2 and n1+n2, respectively.
The code then enters a loop that iterates until the value of hi-lo is at least as small as best.
The code then calls the function bisect with the arguments (-1, hi, judge). The function bisect is defined as follows:

def bisect(ng, ok, judge):
    while abs(ng-ok) > 1:
        m = (ng+ok)//2
        if judge(m):
            ok = m
        else:
            ng = m
    return ok

The function bisect repeatedly calculates the midpoint of the range [ng, ok] and checks if the midpoint meets the condition. If it does, it updates ok to the midpoint. If it does not, it updates ng to the midpoint. The function bisect returns the final value of ok.
The code then calls the function bisect with the arguments (1, lo, judge). The function bisect is defined as follows:

def bisect(ng, ok, judge):
    while abs(ng-ok) > 1:
        m = (ng+ok)//2
        if judge
