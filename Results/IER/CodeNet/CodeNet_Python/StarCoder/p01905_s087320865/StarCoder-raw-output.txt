TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import math,string,itertools,fractions,heapq,collections,re,array,bisect,sys,random,time

sys.setrecursionlimit(10**7)
inf = 10**20
mod = 10**9 + 7

def LI(): return list(map(int, input().split()))
def LF(): return list(map(float, input().split()))
def II(): return int(input())
def LS(): return input().split()
def S(): return input()


def main():
    n,m = LI()
    return n-m-1

print(main())
