The code first imports the sys module, which contains the sys.stdin.readline function.
The code then reads the input and stores it in the variables A, B, C, D, E and F.
The code then initializes two arrays wdp and sdp, which are used to store the number of ways to get to the current position from the previous position.
The code then initializes the variables resa and resb, which are used to store the maximum number of ways to get to the current position from the previous position.
The code then initializes the first element of wdp to 1, which is the number of ways to get to the first position from the previous position.
The code then initializes the first element of sdp to 1, which is the number of ways to get to the first position from the previous position.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to F (inclusive), meaning it will consider positions from 0 to 200.
