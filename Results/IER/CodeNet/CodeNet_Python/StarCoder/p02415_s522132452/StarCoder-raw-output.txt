Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable target is initialized to "fAIR, LATER, OCCASIONALLY CLOUDY."
The code then swaps the case of each character in the string target and stores the result in variable Ans.
The code then prints the final value of Ans, which is "Fair, later, occasionally cloudy."
<<<Output>>>
Fair, later, occasionally cloudy.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N=int(input())
for i in range(1,N+1):
    if i%2==0:
        print(i)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N is initialized to 10.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 10.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is even. If it is, it prints the current number i. The condition is met when i is 2,4,6,8 and 10.
After the loop finishes, no output is printed.
<<<Output>>>
