The variable s is initialized to 0011.
The variable n is initialized to the length of s, which is 4.
The variable ok is initialized to 0.
The code enters a while loop that will run until ok is 1.
The code enters a while loop that will run until i is equal to the length of s minus 1.
The code enters a while loop that will run until j is equal to the length of s minus 1.
The code checks if the substring s[i-j:i+2-j] is equal to "01" or "10". If it is, the code removes the substring s[i-j:i+2-j] from s and sets ok to 0.
The code increments j by 1.
The code checks if i is greater than j plus 1. If it is, the code sets str to s[i-j] + s[i-j+1].
The code increments i by 1.
After the while loop finishes, the code checks if ok is 0. If it is, the code enters a while loop that will run until ok is 1.
