Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable x is initialized to the ASCII value of the input character B.
The code checks if x is greater than or equal to 97, which is true for the ASCII value of a.
If x is greater than or equal to 97, the code prints the character a.
If x is less than 97, the code prints the character A.
<<<Output>>>
a

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
x = ord(input())
if x >= 97:
    print('a')
elif x >= 65:
    print('A')
else:
    print('0')
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
