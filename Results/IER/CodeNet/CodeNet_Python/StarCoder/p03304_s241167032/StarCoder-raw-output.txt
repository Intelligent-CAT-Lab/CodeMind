The variable n, variable m and variable d are initialized to 2, 3 and 1, respectively.
variable ans is initialized to 2, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 2.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
n,m,d=map(int,input().split())
ans=2*(n-d)*(m-1)/pow(n,2)
if d==0:
    ans=(m-1)/n
print(ans)
</Code>
