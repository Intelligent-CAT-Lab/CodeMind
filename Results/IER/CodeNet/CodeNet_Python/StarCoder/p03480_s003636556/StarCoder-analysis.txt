rint the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable S is initialized to 010.
The variable ans is initialized to the length of S, which is 4.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to len(S)-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 3.
For each number i in this range, it checks if S[i] is equal to S[i+1]. If it is not, it calculates the length of the longest substring that starts at i and ends at i+1.
The code then updates ans to be the minimum of the current value of ans and the length of the longest substring that starts at i and ends at i+1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 2.
