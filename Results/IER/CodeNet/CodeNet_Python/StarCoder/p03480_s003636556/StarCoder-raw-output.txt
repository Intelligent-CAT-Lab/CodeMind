The variable S is initialized to 010.
The variable ans is initialized to the length of S, which is 4.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to len(S)-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 3.
For each number i in this range, it checks if S[i] is equal to S[i+1]. If it is not, it calculates the length of the longest substring that starts at i and ends at i+1.
The code then updates ans to be the minimum of the current value of ans and the length of the longest substring that starts at i and ends at i+1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 2.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if sum_order % 3 == 0:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
