Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable a is initialized to 1, and variable b is initialized to 3.
The code checks if a is greater than 0. Since it is, it prints 'Positive'.
The code checks if a is less than 0 and b is greater than 0. Since it is not, it prints 'Zero'.
The code checks if (b-a)%2 is equal to 0. Since it is, it prints 'Negative'.
The code checks if (b-a)%2 is not equal to 0. Since it is not, it prints 'Positive'.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
a,b = [int(i) for i in input().split()]

if a>0:
    print('Positive')

elif a<0 and b>0:
    print('Zero')

elif (b-a)%2 == 0:
    print('Negative')
else:
    print('Positive')

</Code>
