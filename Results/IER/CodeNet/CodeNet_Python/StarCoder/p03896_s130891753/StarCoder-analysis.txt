The variable N is initialized to 7.
The code checks if N is equal to 2. If it is, it prints -1 and exits the program.
Otherwise, the code initializes a 2-dimensional array ans with N rows and N-1 columns.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to N-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 6.
For each number i in this range, it enters another loop that iterates from 0 to N-2 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 5.
For each number j in this range, it calculates the value of ans[i][j] as (i+j+1)%N + 1, which is the next number in the sequence.
The code then enters another loop that iterates from N to N-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 6 to 6.
For each number i in this range, it swaps the values of ans[i][N-2] and ans[i][N-1].
The code then enters another loop that iterates from N/2 to N-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 3 to 6.
For each number i in this range, it swaps the values of ans[i][N/2-1] and ans[i][N/2].
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to N-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 6.
For each number i in this range, it prints the values of ans[i] separated by spaces.
