Instruction: I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
For example:

Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
20 2 5
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
Consider the following code:

def getN():
    return int(input())
def getNM():
    return map(int, input().split())
def getList():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
def getArray(intn):
    return [int(input()) for i in range(intn)]
def input():
    return sys.stdin.readline().rstrip()

from collections import defaultdict, deque, Counter
from sys import exit

from itertools import permutations
from operator import mul
from functools import reduce
from bisect import bisect_left, bisect_right

import sys
sys.setrecursionlimit(1000000000)
mod = 10 ** 9 + 7

from itertools import permutations
from math import factorial, hypot

N, M = getNM()
total = 1900 * M + 100 * (N - M)
print(total * (2 ** M))
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
1 1

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The code first calls the function getNM() to get the values of N and M.
The code then calculates the total value of the problem, which is 1900 * M + 100 * (N - M).
The code then prints the final value of total, which is 1900 * 1 + 100 * (1 - 1) = 1900.

The output of code execution is:
1900

Question 2:

You are given a list of integers. You need to find the maximum sum of a sublist of non-adjacent numbers.

For example, given the list [3, 4, -8, 6, 2, -1, 7, 9], the maximum sum would be 29, which is the sum of the sublist [6, 2, -1, 7, 9].

Given the list [-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4], the maximum sum would be 6, which is the sum of the sublist [4, -1, 2, 1].
