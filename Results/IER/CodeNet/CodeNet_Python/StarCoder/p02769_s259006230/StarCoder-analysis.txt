The variable n is initialized to 3, and variable k is initialized to 2.
The code then initializes an array p with n elements, which is [0,0,0].
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 2.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the value of p[i] and stores it in p[i].
