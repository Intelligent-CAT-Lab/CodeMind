Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable x, variable y are initialized to 10 and 20, respectively.
The code checks if x*y is greater than 0. If it is, it sets the variable k to 2. Otherwise, it sets the variable k to 1.
The code checks if x is equal to y. If it is, it prints 0 and ends the program.
The code checks if x is equal to 0 and y is less than 0. If it is, it prints the absolute value of y plus 1 and ends the program.
The code checks if x is less than y. If it is, it checks if k is equal to 2 or x is equal to 0. If it is, it prints the difference between y and x. Otherwise, it checks if y is equal to 0. If it is, it prints the absolute value of x. Otherwise, it prints the absolute value of the difference between y and x plus k.
After the code finishes, the output is 10.
