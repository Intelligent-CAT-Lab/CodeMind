Instruction: I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
For example:

Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
20 2 5
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
Consider the following code:

def make_divisors(n):
    divisors = []
    for i in range(1, int(n**0.5)+1):
        if n % i == 0:
            divisors.append(i)
            if i!= n // i:
                divisors.append(n//i)

    # divisors.sort()
    return divisors

def main():
    N, M = map(int, input().split())
    MN = M/N
    divisor = make_divisors(M)
    max_gcd = 0
    for d in divisor:
        if (d<=MN) and (d>=max_gcd):
            max_gcd = d
    print(max_gcd)
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
3 14

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The function make_divisors is defined to return a list of divisors of a given number n.
The function main is defined to read two numbers N and M from the input, and then call make_divisors to get a list of divisors of M.
The list of divisors is then traversed to find the largest divisor d such that d<=M/N and d>=max_gcd.
The code then prints the final value of max_gcd, which is 3.

The output of code execution is:
3
