The variable a is initialized to 3, and variable b is initialized to 7.
The code enters a loop that iterates from b-a+1 to b+a, meaning it will consider numbers from 4 to 10.
For each number i in this range, it prints the current number i.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 4 5 6 7 8 9 10.
