The code first reads the input and stores it in a list w.
The code then calculates the length of the list w and stores it in variable n.
The code then initializes variable per to -1.
The code then defines a function good(s) that takes a string s as input and returns a list g.
The function good(s) first calculates the length of the string s and stores it in variable m.
The function good(s) then initializes a list z with m elements, each of which is initialized to 0.
The function good(s) then initializes variable c to 0.
The function good(s) then initializes a list g with m elements, each of which is initialized to True.
The function good(s) then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to m-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider all substrings of length 1 to m-1.
For each substring s[i:j], the function good(s) calculates the length of the longest prefix of s[i:j] that is also a suffix of s[i:j]. This is stored in z[i].
The function good(s) then calculates the length of the longest prefix of s[i:j] that is also a suffix of s[i:j]. This is stored in z[i].
The function good(s) then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to m-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider all substrings of length 2 to m-1.
For each substring s[i:j], the function good(s) calculates the length of the longest prefix of s[i:j] that is also a suffix of s[i:j]. This is stored in z[i].
The function good(s) then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to m-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider all substrings of length 0 to m-1.
