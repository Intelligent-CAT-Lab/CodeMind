Instruction: I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
For example:

Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
20 2 5
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
Consider the following code:

#!usr/bin/env python3
from collections import defaultdict,deque
from heapq import heappush, heappop
import sys
import math
import bisect
import random
def LI(): return [int(x) for x in sys.stdin.readline().split()]
def I(): return int(sys.stdin.readline())
def LS():return [list(x) for x in sys.stdin.readline().split()]
def S():
    res = list(sys.stdin.readline())
    if res[-1] == "\n":
        return res[:-1]
    return res
def IR(n):
    return [I() for i in range(n)]
def LIR(n):
    return [LI() for i in range(n)]
def SR(n):
    return [S() for i in range(n)]
def LSR(n):
    return [LS() for i in range(n)]

sys.setrecursionlimit(1000000)
mod = 998244353


def solve():
    m,n,k = LI()
    if n < k:
        print(0)
        return
    if m < k:
        print(0)
        return
    ans = pow(m,n,mod)
    p = [pow(i,n,mod) for i in range(k+1)]
    c = m
    comb = [[0 for i in range(i+1)] for i in range(k+1)]
    comb[0][0] = 1
    for i in range(k):
        for j in range(i+1):
            comb[i+1][j] += comb[i][j]
            comb[i+1][j+1] += comb[i][j]
    for i in range(1,k):
        k = 0
        for j in range(1,i+1)[::-1]:
            if (i+j)&1:
                k -= comb[i][j]*p[j]
            else:
                k += comb[i][j]*p[j]
        k *= c
        c *= (m-i)
        c *= pow(i+1,mod-2,mod)
        c %= mod
        ans -= k
        ans %= mod
    print(ans)
    return


if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve()


What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
2 10 1

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The code execution prints the answer 1024, which is the 10th Fibonacci number.

The output of code execution is:
1024
