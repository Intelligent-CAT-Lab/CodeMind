Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable a is initialized to 3, and variable b is initialized to 5.
The code checks if a is greater than or equal to b.
If it is, it prints 1 and ends the program.
If it is not, it checks if b is divisible by a.
If it is, it prints b // a and ends the program.
If it is not, it prints b // a + 1 and ends the program.
