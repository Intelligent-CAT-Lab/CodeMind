The code first imports the sys module.
The sys module provides access to some variables and functions used or maintained by the interpreter and to functions that interact strongly with the interpreter.
The sys.setrecursionlimit() function sets the maximum depth of the Python interpreter stack to limit the number of frames that can be allocated.
The sys.stdin.readline() function reads a line from standard input and returns it as a string object without the trailing newline character.
The code then initializes four variables A, B, C and K to 1, 2, 3 and 1, respectively.
The code then calculates the value of ans by subtracting B from A.
The code then checks if K is even or odd. If K is even, the code prints the value of ans. If K is odd, the code prints the negative of ans.
