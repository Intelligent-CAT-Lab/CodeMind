Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable n is initialized to 20.
The code calculates the value of x by multiplying n by 800, which is 16000.
The code calculates the value of y by dividing n by 15, which is 13.
The code calculates the value of y by multiplying y by 200, which is 2600.
The code subtracts y from x, which is 13400.
The code prints the final value of x - y, which is 12000.
<<<Output>>>
12000

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
n = int(input())

x = n * 800
y = n // 15
y = y*200

print(x - y)
</Code>
