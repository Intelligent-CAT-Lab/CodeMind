Instruction: I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
For example:

Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
20 2 5
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
Consider the following code:

def prepare(n, MOD):
    factorials = [1] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        factorials[i] = factorials[i - 1] * i % MOD
    finvs = [1] * (n + 1)
    finvs[n] = pow(factorials[n], MOD - 2, MOD)
    for i in range(n, 1, -1):
        finvs[i - 1] = finvs[i] * i % MOD
    return factorials, finvs


def solve(n, a):
    MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7
    facts, finvs = prepare(n, MOD)
    invs = [facts[i - 1] * finvs[i] % MOD for i in range(n + 1)]  # invs[0]: undefined
    r = n - a

    ans = 0
    # a個がいずれも自己ループを持たないパターン
    for l in range(a):
        tmp1 = facts[a] * finvs[l] % MOD * finvs[a - l] % MOD
        tmp2 = facts[n - l - 1] * (a - l) % MOD
        ans = (ans + (-1) ** (l & 1) * tmp1 * tmp2) % MOD

    # a個中k+1個目ではじめて自己ループを持つが、それまでのk個で全点灯できるパターン
    for k in range(1, a):
        for l in range(k):
            tmp1 = facts[k] * finvs[l] % MOD * finvs[k - l] % MOD
            tmp2 = facts[n - l - 1] * (k - l) % MOD * invs[r + k - l] % MOD
            ans = (ans + (-1) ** (l & 1) * tmp1 * tmp2) % MOD

    return ans


n, a = map(int, input().split())
print(solve(n, a))

What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
3 1

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The code first defines a function prepare(n, MOD). This function prepares the factorials and inverses of numbers from 1 to n.
The function then defines a function solve(n, a). This function calculates the number of ways to light all the bulbs in the room.
The function first calls prepare(n, MOD) to prepare the factorials and inverses of numbers from 1 to n.
The function then calculates the inverses of numbers from 1 to n.
The function then calculates the number of ways to light all the bulbs in the room.
The number of ways to light all the bulbs in the room is 1.

The output of code execution is:
1
