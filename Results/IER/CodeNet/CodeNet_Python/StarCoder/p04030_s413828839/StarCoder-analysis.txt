Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable s is initialized to the list of characters in the input, which is ['0', '1', 'B', '0'].
The variable ans is initialized to an empty deque.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the characters in s.
For each character i in s, it checks if i is "B".
If it is, it checks if ans is empty.
If it is, it does nothing.
If it is not, it pops the last element from ans.
Otherwise, it appends i to ans.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is deque(['0', '1']).
