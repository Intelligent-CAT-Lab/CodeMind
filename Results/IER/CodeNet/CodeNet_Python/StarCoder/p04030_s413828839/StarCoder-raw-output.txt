Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable s is initialized to the list of characters in the input, which is ['0', '1', 'B', '0'].
The variable ans is initialized to an empty deque.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the characters in s.
For each character i in s, it checks if i is "B".
If it is, it checks if ans is empty.
If it is, it does nothing.
If it is not, it pops the last element from ans.
Otherwise, it appends i to ans.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is deque(['0', '1']).

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())
s = list(str(input()))
ans = deque()
for i in s:
  if i == "B":
    if ans == deque([]):
      continue
    else:
      ans.pop()
  else:
    ans.append(i)
print("".join(ans))
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```01B0
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

The variable N is initialized to the integer in the input, which is 01B0.
The variable s is initialized to the list of characters in the input, which is ['0', '1', 'B', '0'].
