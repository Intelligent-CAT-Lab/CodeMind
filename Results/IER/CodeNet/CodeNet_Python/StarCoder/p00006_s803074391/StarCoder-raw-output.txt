Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The code first reads the input and stores it in a variable called s.
The code then creates a list of characters from s, which is ['w', '3', '2', 'n', 'i','m', 'd', 'a'].
The code then uses the list method reversed() to reverse the list, which is ['a', 'd','m', 'i', 'n', '2', '3', 'w'].
The code then uses the list method join() to join the list of characters into a string, which is 'admind32w'.
The code then prints the final value of the string, which is 'admind32w'.
<<<Output>>>
admind32w
