Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variables a, b and c are initialized to 2, 3 and 9, respectively.
The code checks if the following condition is met:
4*a*b<(c-a-b)**2 and c-a-b>0
The condition is met when a=2, b=3 and c=9.
The code prints "Yes" if the condition is met, and "No" otherwise.
<<<Output>>>
Yes

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, M = map(int, input().split())

if N%2==0:
    if M%2==0:
        print("Even")
    else:
        print("Odd")
else:
    if M%2==0:
        print("Odd")
    else:
        print("Even")
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```1 1```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variables N and M are initialized to 1 and 1, respectively.
The code checks if the following condition is met:
N%2==0
The condition is met when N=1.
The code checks if the following condition is met:
M%2==0
The condition is met when M=1.
The code prints "Even" if the condition is met, and "Odd" otherwise.
<<<Output>>>
Odd
