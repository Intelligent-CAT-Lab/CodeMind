Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variables a, b and c are initialized to 2, 3 and 9, respectively.
The code checks if the following condition is met:
4*a*b<(c-a-b)**2 and c-a-b>0
The condition is met when a=2, b=3 and c=9.
The code prints "Yes" if the condition is met, and "No" otherwise.
