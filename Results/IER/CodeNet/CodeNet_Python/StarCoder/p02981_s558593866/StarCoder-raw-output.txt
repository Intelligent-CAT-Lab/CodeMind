Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable n, variable a and variable b are initialized to 4, 2 and 9, respectively.
The code then prints the minimum of a*n and b, which is 8.
<<<Output>>>
8

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
n,a,b=map(int,input().split())
print(max(a*n,b))
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```4 2 9
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
