Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The code first reads the input and stores it in the variable s.
The code then creates a new list s2, which is a copy of s.
The code then iterates through the list s2, and for each element i in s2, it takes the first character of i and stores it in s.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of s, which is "ABC".
