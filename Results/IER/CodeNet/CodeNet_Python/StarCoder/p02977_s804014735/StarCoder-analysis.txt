Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N is initialized to 3.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 3 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 3.
For each number k in this range, it calculates the value of 2 to the power of k + 1.
The code checks if N is less than or equal to this value. If it is, it adds 1 to k. The condition is met when k is 0,1 and 2.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of k, which is 2.
