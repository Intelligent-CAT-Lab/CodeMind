Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N is initialized to 3.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 3 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 3.
For each number k in this range, it calculates the value of 2 to the power of k + 1.
The code checks if N is less than or equal to this value. If it is, it adds 1 to k. The condition is met when k is 0,1 and 2.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of k, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())

res = 'Yes'

k = 0

while 2 ** (k + 1) - 1 <= N:
    k += 1

K = 2 ** k - 1


if N == 1:
    res = 'No'
if N == K +
