The variable s is initialized to '2019/04/30'.
The variable year is initialized to 2019, which is the first four digits of s.
The variable month is initialized to 4, which is the fifth and sixth digits of s.
The variable date is initialized to 30, which is the eighth and ninth digits of s.
The code checks if year is less than or equal to 2019. If it is, it checks if month is less than or equal to 4. If it is, it prints 'Heisei'. If it is not, it prints 'TBD'.
If year is greater than 2019, it prints 'TBD'.
