Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable d, variable t and variable s are initialized to 1000, 15 and 80, respectively.
The code checks if d/t is less than or equal to s.
Since d is 1000 and t is 15, d/t is 66.66666666666667.
Since 66.66666666666667 is less than or equal to 80, the code prints 'Yes'.
