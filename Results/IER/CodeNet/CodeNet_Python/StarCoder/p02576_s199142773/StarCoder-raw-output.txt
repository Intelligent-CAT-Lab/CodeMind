Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The function MI() is defined to read the input and return a list of integers.
The variables N, X and T are initialized to 20, 12 and 6, respectively.
The code checks if N is divisible by X. If it is not, the code calculates the answer as (N//X+1)*T, which is 13*6=78.
If N is divisible by X, the code calculates the answer as N//X*T, which is 12//12*6=6.
After the code finishes, it prints the final value of ans, which is 78.
<<<Output>>>
78

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def MI(): return map(int, input().split())
N,X,T=MI()
if N%X!=0:
  ans=(N//X+1)*T
else:
  ans=N//X*T
print(ans)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20 12 6
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
