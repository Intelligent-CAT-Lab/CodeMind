The function MI() is defined to read the input and return a list of integers.
The variables N, X and T are initialized to 20, 12 and 6, respectively.
The code checks if N is divisible by X. If it is not, the code calculates the answer as (N//X+1)*T, which is 13*6=78.
If N is divisible by X, the code calculates the answer as N//X*T, which is 12//12*6=6.
After the code finishes, it prints the final value of ans, which is 78.
