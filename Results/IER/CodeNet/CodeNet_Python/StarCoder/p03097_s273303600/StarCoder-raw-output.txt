nt the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable n, variable a and variable b are initialized to 2, 1 and 3, respectively.
The function doit is defined to take 3 arguments: a, b and mask.
The function first checks if the number of 1s in the binary representation of a XOR b is odd. If it is, the function returns "NO" and ends.
Otherwise, the function proceeds to calculate the index of the bit that differs between a and b.
The function then calculates the index of the bit that is the same between a and b.
If the same index is not found, the function returns [a, b] and ends.
Otherwise, the function calls itself recursively with the following arguments:
a, a XOR (1 << same), mask OR (1 << differ)
a XOR (1 << same) XOR (1 << differ), b, mask OR (1 << differ)
The function returns the sum of the two lists returned by the recursive calls.
The function then prints "YES" and the list returned by the recursive calls.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
n = int(input())

def doit(n):
    if n == 1:
        return [1]
    if n == 2:
        return [1, 2]
    if n == 3:
        return [1, 3, 2]
    if n == 4:
        return [1, 4, 3, 2]
    if n == 5:
        return [1, 5, 4, 3, 2]
    if n == 6:
        return [1, 6, 5, 4,
