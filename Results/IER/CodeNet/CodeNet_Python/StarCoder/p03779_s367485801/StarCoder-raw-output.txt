The variable x is initialized to 6.
The variable t is initialized to 0.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to infinity, meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to infinity.
For each number t in this range, it calculates the sum of the first t natural numbers, which is t*(t+1)/2.
The code checks if the sum is less than or equal to x. If it is, it breaks out of the loop and prints the current value of t, which is 2.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
x = int(input())
t = 0
while t*(t+1)/2 < x:
    t += 1

print(t)

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
