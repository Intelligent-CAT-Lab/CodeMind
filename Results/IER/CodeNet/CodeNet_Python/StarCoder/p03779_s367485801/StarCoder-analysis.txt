The variable x is initialized to 6.
The variable t is initialized to 0.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to infinity, meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to infinity.
For each number t in this range, it calculates the sum of the first t natural numbers, which is t*(t+1)/2.
The code checks if the sum is less than or equal to x. If it is, it breaks out of the loop and prints the current value of t, which is 2.
