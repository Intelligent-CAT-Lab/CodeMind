Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable b1, b2 and b3 are initialized to 0, 0 and 1, respectively.
The code first checks if b1 is equal to 1. Since it is, the code enters the first if statement.
The code then checks if b2 is equal to 1. Since it is, the code enters the second if statement.
The code then prints "Open".
The code then exits the if statement.
The code then checks if b2 is equal to 1. Since it is not, the code enters the third if statement.
The code then checks if b3 is equal to 1. Since it is, the code enters the fourth if statement.
The code then prints "Open".
The code then exits the if statement.
The code then exits the if statement.
The code then exits the if statement.
The code then prints "Close".
<<<Output>>>
Open

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())

if N % 2 == 0:
    print("Even")
else:
    print("Odd")

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N is initialized to 10.
The code checks if N is even. Since it is, the code prints "Even".
The code then exits the if statement.
The code then prints "Odd".
<<<Output>>>
Odd
