Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable a is initialized to 2, and variable b is initialized to 16.
The code calculates the sum of a and b, which is 18.
The code checks if the sum is even. Since it is, the code divides the sum by 2 and prints the result.
Since the sum is odd, the code prints "IMPOSSIBLE".
<<<Output>>>
IMPOSSIBLE

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())

for i in range(1, N+1):
	if i % 2 == 0:
		print(i)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N is initialized to 10.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 10.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is even. Since it is, it prints the current number i.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the numbers 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10.
<<<Output>>>
2
4
6
8
10
