Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable a is initialized to 2, and variable b is initialized to 16.
The code calculates the sum of a and b, which is 18.
The code checks if the sum is even. Since it is, the code divides the sum by 2 and prints the result.
Since the sum is odd, the code prints "IMPOSSIBLE".
