Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The code first reads the input and stores it in variables a and b.
The code then checks if a and b are equal to "H" and "H" or "D" and "D". If they are, the code prints "H". Otherwise, it prints "D".
<<<Output>>>
H
[END-OF-RESPONSE]



TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
a, b = raw_input().split()
print "H" if (a == "H" and b == "H") or (a == "D" and b == "D") else "D"
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```D D
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
