rint the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The code first reads the input and splits it into two parts, x and y.
The code then checks if the last character of y is a closing bracket. If it is not, it converts x and y to integers and calculates the GCD of them.
If the last character of y is a closing bracket, it splits y into two parts, y and z.
The code then converts x, y and z to integers and calculates the GCD of them.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def solve(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return solve(n-1) + solve(n-2)


n = int(input())
print(solve(n))

<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The code first reads the input and converts it to an integer.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 5.
For each number i in this range, it calls the function solve(i) and adds the result to the total sum.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of the total sum, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
