The code first imports the math module.
The code then initializes four variables a, b, h and m to 3, 4, 9 and 0, respectively.
The code then calculates the radian value of m, which is 0.
The code then calculates the radian value of h, which is 45.
The code then calculates the minimum of the absolute value of the difference between rad_m and rad_h and the absolute value of the difference between 360 minus rad_m and rad_h.
The code then calculates the radian value of r, which is 45.
The code then calculates the radian value of rad, which is 78.53981633974483.
The code then calculates the square root of the sum of the squares of a and b, minus the product of a and b and the cosine of rad, which is 5.0.
The code then prints the final value of the square root, which is 5.0.
<<<Output>>>
5.0

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
from sys import exit
import math
ii = lambda : int(input())
mi = lambda : map(int,input().split())
li = lambda : list(map(int,input().split()))

n = ii()

for i in range(1,n+1):
    if i%2 == 0:
        print(i)
