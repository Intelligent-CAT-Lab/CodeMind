The function p(x) is defined to check if x is prime.
The function f() is defined to find the smallest positive integer that is not a prime number.
The function f() first reads two integers n and c from the input.
The variable s is initialized to '9' repeated n times.
If c is less than 0, the function returns the string '11' repeated n times.
Otherwise, the function enters a loop that iterates over the string '9731'.
For each character h in this string, the function enters a loop that iterates from 10**~-n to 1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 10**~-n.
For each number m in this range, it converts m to a string and stores it in m.
The code then calculates the sum of the digits of h and m, multiplies it by 2 and adds c. The result is stored in a.
The code then calculates the sum of the digits of a, multiplies it by 2 and adds c. The result is stored in a.
The code then calculates the sum of the digits of a, multiplies it by 2 and adds c. The result is stored in a.
The code then calculates the sum of the digits of a, multiplies it by 2 and adds c. The result is stored in a.
