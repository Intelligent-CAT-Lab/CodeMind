The variable n is initialized to 3.
The function fib is called with n=3.
The function fib checks if n is equal to 0 or 1. Since n is not equal to 0 or 1, the function fib calls itself with n-1, which is 2.
The function fib checks if n is equal to 0 or 1. Since n is not equal to 0 or 1, the function fib calls itself with n-1, which is 1.
The function fib checks if n is equal to 0 or 1. Since n is equal to 1, the function fib returns 1.
The function fib returns 1.
The function fib returns 2.
The function fib returns 3.
The function fib returns 5.
The code prints the final value of n, which is 5.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
def fib(n):
    if n==0 or n==1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fib(n-1)+fib(n-2)
n=int(input())
print(fib(n))

</Code>
<<<Question>>>
