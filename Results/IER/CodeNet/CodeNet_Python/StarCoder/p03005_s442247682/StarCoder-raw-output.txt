Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable x, variable y are initialized to 3 and 2, respectively.
The variable N is initialized to 3.
The variable K is initialized to 2.
The code checks if K is equal to 1. If it is, it prints 0 and ends the program.
If K is not equal to 1, the code calculates the value of N-K and prints it.
The value of N-K is 1, which is printed.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N = int(input())
for i in range(1,N+1):
    if i%2 == 0:
        print(i)
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N is initialized to 10.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 10.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is even. If it is, it prints i.
The loop ends after the code prints 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10.
<<<Output>>>
2
4
6
8
10
