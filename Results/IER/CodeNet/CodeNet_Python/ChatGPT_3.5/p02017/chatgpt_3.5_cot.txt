<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four inputs: H, W, X, and Y. These inputs are mapped to the variables H, W, X, and Y using the map() function.
The code then checks if the expression ((H * W) * (X + Y)) % 2 is equal to 0 or not. If it is not equal to 0, it means the expression is odd and the code prints 'No'. Otherwise, it prints 'Yes'.
In this case, the values of H, W, X, and Y are 3, 5, 1, and 4 respectively. So, the expression evaluates to ((3 * 5) * (1 + 4)) % 2 = 75 % 2 = 1. Since 1 is not equal to 0, the code will print 'No'.
<<<Output>>>
No
