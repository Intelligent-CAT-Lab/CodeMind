<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called main that takes two arguments, N and k.
Inside the main function, three variables are initialized: p, p2, and memo, all set to 0.
Then, a for loop is used to iterate from 0 to N-2 (inclusive). This loop will run N-1 times.
Inside the loop, the values of p and p2 are updated using a formula.
The formula is: p, p2 = p2, k*(p2+1)//(k-1) - 2
After the loop finishes, the function returns the value of p2.
Outside the main function, the code checks if the current script is being run as the main program. If it is, it reads two inputs, N and k, and passes them to the main function. The result is then printed.
In this case, the input is "4 2". So, N is 4 and k is 2.
Inside the main function, the for loop runs 3 times (N-1 = 4-1 = 3).
In each iteration, the values of p and p2 are updated using the formula.
After the loop finishes, the function returns the value of p2, which is the final output.
