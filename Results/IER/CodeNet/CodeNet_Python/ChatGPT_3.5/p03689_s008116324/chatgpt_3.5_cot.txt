<<<Analysis>>>
The variable H, W, h, and w are initialized to 3, 3, 2, and 2, respectively.
The code first checks if H is divisible by h and W is divisible by w. If both conditions are true, it prints 'No' and exits the program. In this case, 3 is not divisible by 2, so the condition is not met and the code continues.
The code then prints 'Yes'.
Next, the code initializes the variable n to 1000.
If W is not divisible by w, it calculates the value of m as -((w-1)*n + 1). This value will be used to fill the row when the column index is w-1.
The code then creates a list called row, where each element is m if the column index is w-1, and n otherwise. The length of the row is equal to W.
The code then enters a loop that iterates H times. For each iteration, it prints the elements of the row separated by spaces.
If W is divisible by w, it calculates the value of m as -((h-1)*n + 1). This value will be used to fill the entire row when the row index is h-1.
The code then enters another loop that iterates H times. For each iteration, it checks if the row index is h-1. If it is, it prints m repeated W times. Otherwise, it prints n repeated W times.
