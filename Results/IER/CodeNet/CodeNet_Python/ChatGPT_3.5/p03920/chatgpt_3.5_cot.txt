The variable N is initialized to 4.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 10^5 (exclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 99999.
For each number i in this range, it checks if the condition i * (i + 1) // 2 < N <= (i + 1) * (i + 2) // 2 is true.
This condition checks if N is greater than the sum of the first i natural numbers and less than or equal to the sum of the first (i+1) natural numbers.
In other words, it checks if N is in the range of the sum of the first i+1 natural numbers.
When this condition is true, it assigns the value of i+1 to the variable w and breaks out of the loop.
In this case, the condition is true when i is 2, so w is assigned the value of 3.
Then, the code enters another loop that iterates from w to 0 (exclusive) in reverse order, meaning it will consider numbers from 3 to 1.
For each number i in this range, it checks if N is greater than or equal to i.
If this condition is true, it prints the value of i and subtracts i from N.
In this case, N is 4 and the condition is true when i is 3, so it prints 3 and subtracts 3 from N, resulting in N being 1.
Since N is no longer greater than or equal to 2, the loop ends.
The final output is 3.
