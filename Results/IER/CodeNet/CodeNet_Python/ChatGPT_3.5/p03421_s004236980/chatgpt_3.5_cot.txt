<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input: N, A, and B.
It first checks if the condition N > A*B or N < A+B-1 is true. If it is, it prints -1 and exits the program.
If the condition is not true, it proceeds to create a list of lists called P. The outer list has B empty lists.
Then, it enters a loop that iterates N times. In each iteration, it appends the current number i+1 to the sublist P[i//A].
After the loop, it reverses the order of the sublists in P.
Next, it enters another loop that iterates B times. In each iteration, it checks if the current sublist P[i] is empty. If it is, it appends the last element of the sublist P[-((N-i-1)//A+1)] to P[i] and removes that element from the sublist P[-((N-i-1)//A+1)]. If the sublist P[i] is not empty, it breaks out of the loop.
Finally, it creates an empty list called Q. It then enters a nested loop that iterates through each sublist in P. In each iteration, it appends each element of the sublist to Q.
Finally, it prints the elements of Q separated by a space.
