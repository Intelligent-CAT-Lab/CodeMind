<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input N.
Then it enters a nested loop that iterates through the numbers from 1 to 9 for both i and j.
For each combination of i and j, it checks if their product is equal to N.
If it finds a pair of numbers whose product is equal to N, it prints 'Yes' and exits the program.
If it doesn't find any such pair after checking all combinations, it prints 'No'.
In this case, the code will not find any pair whose product is equal to 10, so it will print 'No'.
<<<Output>>>
No
