<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four inputs: N, X, Y, and Z. These inputs are used to calculate the final output.
The code initializes a list S with length 2^(X+Y+Z) and sets all elements to 0.
The code then creates two empty sets, ss and tt.
Next, the code calculates the values of Z0, Y0, and X0 using bitwise shift operations.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to m-1, where m is 2^(X+Y+Z).
Inside the loop, the code checks if the bitwise AND of i with Z0, Y0, and X0 is non-zero. If all three conditions are true, i is added to the set ss.
The code then sets MASK to 2^(X+Y+Z)-1 and MOD to 10^9 + 7.
The first element of S is set to 1.
The code enters another loop that iterates N times.
Inside this loop, a new list T is created with length m and all elements set to 0.
The code then enters another loop that iterates over all elements in S.
If the current element is in ss, the code continues to the next iteration.
Otherwise, the code performs bitwise shift and bitwise AND operations to calculate a new value t.
The code then updates the element T[t] by adding the current element of S[s] modulo MOD.
The code then enters another loop that iterates from L+1 to 11, where L is the maximum value among X, Y, and Z.
Inside this loop, the code updates the element T[0] by adding the current element of S[s] modulo MOD.
After the inner loop finishes, the code sets S to T.
After the outer loop finishes, the code initializes ans to 0.
The code then enters another loop that iterates over all elements in S.
If the current element is in ss, the code continues to the next iteration.
Otherwise, the code updates ans by adding the current element of S[s] modulo MOD.
Finally, the code calculates the final value of ans by subtracting ans from 10^N modulo MOD.
The code then prints the final value of ans.
