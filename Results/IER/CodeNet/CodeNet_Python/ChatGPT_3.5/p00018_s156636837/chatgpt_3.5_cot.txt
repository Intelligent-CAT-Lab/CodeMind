<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes input as a string of numbers separated by spaces. It then splits the string into a list of strings using the split() function. The map() function is used to convert each string element in the list to an integer. The sorted() function is then used to sort the list of integers in descending order. 

The code then enters a loop that iterates over each element in the sorted list. For each element, it prints the element followed by a comma. 

In this case, the input is "3 6 9 7 5". After splitting and converting to integers, the list becomes [3, 6, 9, 7, 5]. After sorting in descending order, the list becomes [9, 7, 6, 5, 3]. The loop then prints each element in the list followed by a comma. 

<<<Output>>>
9, 7, 6, 5, 3,
