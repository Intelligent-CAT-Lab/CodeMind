<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three inputs: W, H, and c. W and H are converted to integers. The code then enters a nested loop, with the outer loop iterating from 0 to H-1 and the inner loop iterating from 0 to W-1. 
Inside the nested loop, the code checks various conditions to determine what character to print. 
- If both i and j are 0 or if both i and j are equal to W-1 and H-1, it prints '+'. 
- If only i is 0 or H-1, it prints '-'. 
- If only j is 0 or W-1, it prints '|'. 
- If i is equal to (H-1)//2 and j is equal to (W-1)//2, it prints the character c. 
- For all other cases, it prints '.'. 
After printing the characters for each row, it moves to the next line using the print() function.
