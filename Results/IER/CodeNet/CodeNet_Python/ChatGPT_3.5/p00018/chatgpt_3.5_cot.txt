<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes the input numbers as a string and splits it into a list of strings using the split() function. Then it converts each string element into an integer using the map() function. The resulting list of integers is then sorted in ascending order using the sorted() function. The sorted list is then reversed using the reversed() function. Finally, the code iterates over each element in the reversed and sorted list and prints it followed by a comma.

In this case, the input numbers are [3, 6, 9, 7, 5]. After sorting in ascending order, the list becomes [3, 5, 6, 7, 9]. After reversing the list, it becomes [9, 7, 6, 5, 3]. The code then prints each element of the list followed by a comma, resulting in the output "9, 7, 6, 5, 3,".

<<<Output>>>
9, 7, 6, 5, 3,
