<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four integers as input: a, b, c, and k.
It then checks if k is divisible by 2 (i.e., k % 2 == 0). If it is, it prints the difference between a and b (a - b). Otherwise, it prints the difference between b and a (b - a).
In this case, k is 1, which is not divisible by 2. Therefore, the code will print the difference between b and a, which is -1.
<<<Output>>>
-1
