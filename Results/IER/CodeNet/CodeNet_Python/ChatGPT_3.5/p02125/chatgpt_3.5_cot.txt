<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized to 2.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of iterations.
The variable x is initialized to 1.
The code enters a while loop that continues as long as 2*x-1 is less than or equal to N.
Inside the loop, x is updated to 2*x, effectively doubling its value in each iteration.
The variable ans is incremented by 1 in each iteration.
Once the condition of the while loop is no longer true, the loop exits and the code prints the final value of ans, which is 2.
