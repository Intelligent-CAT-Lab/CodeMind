<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs: S and K. S is a string and K is an integer.
The code then converts K to an integer and assigns it to the variable K.
The code sets the value of K to the minimum of K and 300.
The code initializes the variable mod to 998244353.
The code initializes an empty list called a.
The code initializes the variable val to 0.
The code enters a loop that iterates over the characters in the string S.
For each character, if it is "0", the code appends the value of val to the list a and resets val to 0.
If the character is not "0", the code increments val by 1.
After the loop, if val is not 0, the code appends val to the list a.
The code sets the variable m to the length of the list a.
The code sets K to the minimum of the sum of the elements in a and K.
The code initializes a 2D list called dp with dimensions K+1 x K+1, filled with zeros.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the range K+1.
For each iteration, it sets the value of dp[j][j] to 1.
The code creates two new lists, b and c, which are copies of the list a.
The code then modifies the elements of b and c by adding the previous elements to the current element.
The code sets the first element of b to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the range m-2 to -1 with a step of -1.
For each iteration, it creates a new 2D list called ndp with dimensions K+1 x K+1, filled with zeros.
The code then enters two nested loops that iterate over the range min(b[i],K)+1 and min(K,k+c[i])+1, respectively.
For each combination of k and j, the code calculates the value of M as the maximum of k-j and -a[i].
The code then calculates the value of ndp[j][k] by summing the elements of dp[j+l][k] for l in the range max(0,M) to K-j+1, and summing the elements of dp[j][k+l] for l in the range 1 to min(K-k,-M)+1.
The code takes the modulo of ndp[j][k] with mod.
After the nested loops, the code sets dp to ndp.
Finally, the code prints the value of dp[0][0].
