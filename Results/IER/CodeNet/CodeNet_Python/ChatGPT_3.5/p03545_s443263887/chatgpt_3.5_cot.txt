<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string `n` which is initialized to '1222'.
The variable `op_cnt` is calculated as the length of `n` minus 1, which is 3 in this case.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 2^op_cnt - 1, which is from 0 to 7 in this case.
Inside this loop, the code initializes a list `op` with op_cnt number of '-' characters.
Then, for each j in the range op_cnt, it checks if the j-th bit of i is set to 1 using bitwise operations.
If the j-th bit is set, it updates the j-th element of `op` to '+'.
After updating `op`, the code constructs a formula string by concatenating each digit of `n` with the corresponding operator from `op`.
For example, if `n` is '1222' and `op` is ['-', '+', '-'], the formula string would be '1+2-2+2'.
The code then evaluates the formula using the `eval()` function and checks if the result is equal to 7.
If the result is 7, it prints the formula followed by '=7' and breaks out of the loop.
Since the loop only iterates from 0 to 7, it will find the first combination of operators that results in a formula equal to 7 and then stop.
If no such combination is found, the code will not print anything.

1+2+2-2=7
