<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string `n` and initializes a variable `_sum` to 0.
Then, it enters a loop that iterates over the length of the input string.
In each iteration, it converts the current character of the string to an integer and adds it to `_sum`.
After the loop finishes, it checks if the input number `n` is divisible by `_sum`.
If it is, it prints 'Yes', otherwise it prints 'No'.
In this case, the input number is 12. The sum of its digits is 1+2=3.
Since 12 is divisible by 3, the output will be 'Yes'.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
