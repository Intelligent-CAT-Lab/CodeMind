<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input from the user and stores it in the variable s.
Then, it uses the replace() method to replace all occurrences of ',' with a space ' ' in the string s.
Finally, it prints the modified string.
In this case, the input string is "happy,newyear,enjoy".
After replacing all occurrences of ',' with a space, the modified string becomes "happy newyear enjoy".
<<<Output>>>
happy newyear enjoy
