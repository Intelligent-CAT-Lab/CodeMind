The variable MOD is initialized to 998244353.
The variables n, a, b, and k are initialized to 4, 1, 2, and 5, respectively.
The variable fac is initialized as a list of length n+1, with all elements set to 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n-1 (inclusive).
For each iteration, it calculates the factorial of i+1 and stores it in the corresponding index of fac.
Next, the code defines a function comb(n, k) that calculates the combination of n choose k using the factorial values stored in fac.
The code initializes the variable ans to 0.
Then, it enters another loop that iterates from 0 to n (inclusive).
Inside this loop, it checks if the expression k - x * a is less than 0 or not divisible by b. If either of these conditions is true, it continues to the next iteration of the loop.
If the conditions are not met, it calculates the value of y as (k - x * a) // b.
Then, it checks if n is less than y. If this condition is true, it continues to the next iteration of the loop.
If the condition is not met, it calculates the product of the combinations comb(n, x) and comb(n, y), and adds it to ans.
Finally, the code prints the value of ans modulo MOD.
