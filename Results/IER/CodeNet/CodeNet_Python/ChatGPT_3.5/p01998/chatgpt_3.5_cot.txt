<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by taking an integer input n.
It then calculates the square root of n and adds 1 to it, storing the result in the variable root.
A list called isPrime is created with n+3 elements, all initialized to True.
The code then enters a loop that starts from 4 and goes up to n+3, incrementing by 2 in each iteration.
Inside this loop, the value at index i in the isPrime list is set to False, effectively marking it as a non-prime number.
The variable ans is initialized to 0 and the variable prePrime is initialized to -1.
The code then enters another loop that starts from 3 and goes up to n+3, incrementing by 2 in each iteration.
Inside this loop, it checks if the value at index i in the isPrime list is True, indicating that i is a prime number.
If the previous prime number (prePrime) plus 2 is equal to i, it means that i is a twin prime number, so the variable ans is incremented by 2.
The value of prePrime is then updated to i.
If i is greater than the square root of n, the code continues to the next iteration of the loop.
Otherwise, it enters a nested loop that starts from i squared and goes up to n+3, incrementing by i in each iteration.
Inside this nested loop, the value at index j in the isPrime list is set to False, marking it as a non-prime number.
After the loops finish, the code prints the final value of ans.
