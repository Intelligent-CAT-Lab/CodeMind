<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input and assigns it to the variable `a`. Then it converts the string to uppercase using the `upper()` method. Finally, it prints the value of `a`.
In this case, the input string is "this is a pen.". When converted to uppercase, it becomes "THIS IS A PEN.".
<<<Output>>>
THIS IS A PEN.
