<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a line of input from the standard input and splits it into a list of strings. The input is '1 7 9 4', so the resulting list is ['1', '7', '9', '4'].
The code then checks if the list of digits is equal to the list ['1', '4', '7', '9']. Since the digits are sorted, this condition will be true if the input contains only the digits 1, 4, 7, and 9.
In this case, the input does contain these digits, so the code will print 'YES'.
<<<Output>>>
YES
