<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three inputs: n, x, and t. These inputs are separated by spaces and are converted to integers using the map() function.
The code then calculates the number of times x can be divided into n using the math.ceil() function, which rounds up the result to the nearest integer.
The result is then multiplied by t to get the total time required.
Finally, the code prints the result.
In this case, n = 20, x = 12, and t = 6.
The number of times 12 can be divided into 20 is 2, so the result is 2 * 6 = 12.
<<<Output>>>
12
