<<<Analysis>>>
The variable K is initialized to 6.
A deque object q is created.
The tuple (1, 1) is appended to q.
An empty dictionary m is created.
The code enters a while loop that continues as long as q is not empty.
Inside the loop, the first element of q is removed and assigned to the variables n and s.
If n is already in the dictionary m, the loop continues to the next iteration.
Otherwise, the value of s is stored in the dictionary m with key n.
The tuple (n * 10 % K, s) is added to the left side of q.
The tuple ((n + 1) % K, s + 1) is added to the right side of q.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the value of m[0], which is the value associated with key 0 in the dictionary m.
