<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input from the user and assigns it to the variable `s`. It then calculates the length of the string and assigns it to the variable `n`.
The variable `ok` is initialized to 0, which will be used as a flag to determine if any replacements were made in the string.
The code enters a while loop that continues until `ok` is not equal to 0. Inside this loop, `ok` is set to 1 at the beginning, indicating that no replacements have been made yet.
The code then enters another while loop that iterates over the characters of the string. It checks if the current character and the next character form the substring "01" or "10". If this condition is true, it replaces the substring with an empty string and sets `ok` to 0, indicating that a replacement has been made.
The code then increments the variable `j` and checks if `i` is greater than `j + 1`. If this condition is true, it updates the value of `str` to be the substring of `s` from `i-j` to `i-j+1`. If the condition is false, it breaks out of the innermost while loop.
After the inner while loop finishes, the code increments the variable `i` and continues to the next iteration.
Once the outer while loop finishes, the code calculates the difference between the original length of the string `n` and the current length of the string `s`. This difference represents the number of replacements made in the string.
Finally, the code prints the result.
