<<<Analysis>>>
The variable K is initialized to 101.
The code then checks if K is divisible by 7. Since 101 is not divisible by 7, the else block is executed and L is assigned the value of 9 * K, which is 909.
The variable ans is initialized to -1.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to L-1 (inclusive), which means it will consider numbers from 1 to 908.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the remainder of n divided by L and stores it in the variable surplus.
The code checks if surplus is equal to 1. If it is, it assigns the current value of i to ans and breaks out of the loop.
The value of n is updated to be 10 times the value of surplus.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is -1.
<<<Output>>>
-1
