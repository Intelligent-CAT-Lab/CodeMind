<<<Analysis>>>
The code imports the sys module and then enters a loop that reads input from the standard input (stdin) line by line.
For each line of input, it splits the line into a list of strings, takes the first element of the list, converts it to an integer, and assigns it to the variable n.
Then it prints the cube of n.
In this case, the input is "2", so the code will assign 2 to n and print 2^3, which is 8.
<<<Output>>>
8
