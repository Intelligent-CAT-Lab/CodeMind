<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input and assigns them to variables x and y.
The code then checks if x is divisible by y using the modulo operator (%). If x is divisible by y (i.e., the remainder is 0), it prints the value of x. Otherwise, it prints -1.
In this case, 8 is not divisible by 6, so the code will print -1.
<<<Output>>>
-1
