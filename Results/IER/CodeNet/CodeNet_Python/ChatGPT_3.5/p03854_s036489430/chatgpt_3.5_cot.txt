<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function examC() that takes no arguments. Inside the function, it reads a string St from the input using the S() function. It also initializes a list t with four strings: "dream", "dreamer", "erase", and "eraser". It then initializes a variable i to the length of St minus 1, and a variable cur to an empty string.

The code enters a while loop that iterates as long as i is greater than or equal to 0. Inside the loop, it appends the character at index i of St to the beginning of cur. It then decrements i by 1. After that, it checks if cur is in the list t. If it is, it sets cur to an empty string.

After the loop finishes, the code checks if the length of cur is 0. If it is, it sets ans to "YES". Otherwise, it sets ans to "NO". Finally, it prints the value of ans.

The code also defines several helper functions: I(), LI(), LS(), and S(). These functions read integers, lists of integers, lists of strings, and strings from the input, respectively.

The code then calls the examC() function, which executes the code defined inside the function.
