<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines several functions for constructing the suffix array, LCP array, and Z algorithm. It then takes an input string `S` and calculates the suffix array `sa` using the `suffix_array` function. It also initializes a variable `res` to the sum of all possible substrings of `S`.

Next, it iterates over the LCP array of `S` and subtracts each LCP value from `res`. The LCP array represents the length of the longest common prefix between adjacent suffixes in the suffix array. By subtracting each LCP value from `res`, we are effectively removing the count of repeated substrings from the total count.

Finally, it prints the final value of `res`, which represents the count of distinct substrings in `S`.
