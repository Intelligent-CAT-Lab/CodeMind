<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four integers as input: a, b, c, and d.
It calculates the absolute difference between c and a, and stores it in the variable c.
It calculates the absolute difference between d and b, and stores it in the variable d.
It finds the greatest common divisor (gcd) of c and d using the fractions module and stores it in the variable g.
It divides c by g and stores the integer part in the variable j.
It divides d by g and stores the integer part in the variable k.
Finally, it calculates and prints the result of ((j+k-1)*g).
In this case, the input values are 1, 1, 3, and 4.
The absolute difference between c and a is 2.
The absolute difference between d and b is 3.
The gcd of 2 and 3 is 1.
The integer part of 2/1 is 2.
The integer part of 3/1 is 3.
The result of ((2+3-1)*1) is 4.
