<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called main() which takes no arguments.
Inside the main() function, it reads two integers n and m from input using the LI() function.
Then it returns the value of n - m - 1.
After the main() function, it calls the main() function and prints its return value.
The input given is "2 0", so n = 2 and m = 0.
Therefore, the output will be 2 - 0 - 1 = 1.
