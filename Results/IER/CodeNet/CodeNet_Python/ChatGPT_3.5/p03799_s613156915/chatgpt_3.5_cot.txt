<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called "resolve" which takes no arguments.
Inside the "resolve" function, it reads two integers n and m from the input.
Then, it initializes a variable cnt to 0, which will be used to store the final result.
The code checks if 2*n is less than or equal to m. If this condition is true, it means that we can use all n pairs of socks and still have enough socks left to form additional pairs. In this case, it adds n to cnt, subtracts n*2 from m to account for the socks used, and adds m//4 to cnt to account for the additional pairs that can be formed with the remaining socks.
If the condition is false, it means that we don't have enough socks to form additional pairs after using all n pairs. In this case, it adds m//2 to cnt to account for the pairs that can be formed with the available socks.
Finally, the code prints the value of cnt.
