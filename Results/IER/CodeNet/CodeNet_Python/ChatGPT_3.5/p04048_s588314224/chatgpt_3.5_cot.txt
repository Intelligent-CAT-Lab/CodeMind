<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs, n and x, and initializes the variable ans to 0.
It then enters a while loop that continues indefinitely until the condition is met to exit the loop.
Inside the loop, it calculates the remainder of n divided by x and stores it in new_x.
It also calculates the integer division of n by x and stores it in new_n.
If new_x is equal to 0, it means that n is divisible by x without any remainder.
In this case, it prints the value of ans plus the product of x, new_n, and 3, and then exits the program.
If new_x is not equal to 0, it adds the product of x, new_n, and 3 to ans.
It then updates the values of n and x to be x and new_x, respectively, and continues to the next iteration of the loop.
