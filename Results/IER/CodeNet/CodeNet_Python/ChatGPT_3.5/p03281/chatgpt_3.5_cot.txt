<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input and assigns it to the variable n.
Then, there is a function called cnt_divisor that takes an integer n as input and returns the count of divisors of n.
Inside the main code, a variable cnt is initialized to 0.
There is a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive). For each number j in this range, it checks if j is divisible by 2. If it is not, it continues to the next iteration of the loop.
If j is divisible by 2, it calls the cnt_divisor function with j as input and checks if the returned count is equal to 8. If it is, it increments the cnt variable by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of cnt.

In this case, the input is 105.
The code will iterate from 1 to 105 and check if each number is divisible by 2 and has 8 divisors.
The numbers that meet these conditions are 1, 3, 5, 15, 35, 105.
So, the output will be 6.
