<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three inputs: N, A, and B. These inputs are separated by spaces and are converted to integers using the map() function.
The code then prints the minimum value between A*N and B.
In this case, N=7, A=17, and B=120.
So, A*N=17*7=119 and B=120.
The minimum value between 119 and 120 is 119.
<<<Output>>>
119
