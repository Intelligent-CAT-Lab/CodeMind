<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by defining some utility functions and importing necessary modules.
Then, it reads an integer n from the input.
If n is equal to 1, it prints 1 and returns.
If n is equal to 2, it prints 2, 0, and "11" and returns.
For any other value of n, it prints n-1 and "11" as the first line of the output.
Then, it enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n-1 (exclusive).
In each iteration, it prints a string consisting of "1" followed by i number of "0"s and then "1".
Finally, it returns.
<<<Output>>>

0
11
