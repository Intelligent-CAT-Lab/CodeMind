<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input and assigns it to the variable x.
The variable y is initialized to 100.
The variable ans is initialized to 0.
The code enters a while loop that continues until y is greater than or equal to x.
Inside the loop, ans is incremented by 1 and y is updated by multiplying it with 1.01 and taking the floor value using the math.floor() function.
The loop continues until y becomes greater than or equal to x.
Finally, the code prints the value of ans, which represents the number of times the loop executed.
In this case, the loop will execute 4 times because y will become 100.0, 101.0, 102.01, and 103.0301.
