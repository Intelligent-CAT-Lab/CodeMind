<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input and assigns them to variables a, b, and c.
It then checks if a is equal to b and b is equal to c. In this case, all three variables are equal to 2, so the condition is true.
If the condition is true, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
In this case, the condition is true, so the output will be "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
