<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string and splits it into a list of substrings using the comma (',') as the delimiter. 
Then, it joins all the substrings together to form a single string without any commas.
Next, it splits the string again using the period ('.') as the delimiter.
After that, it joins all the substrings together to form a single string without any periods.
Then, it splits the string again using the space (' ') as the delimiter.
The code initializes an empty list L.
It then enters a loop that iterates over the range from 0 to the length of the list d.
For each element in d, it checks if the length of the element is between 3 and 6 (inclusive).
If the condition is true, it appends the element to the list L.
Finally, it prints the elements of L joined by a space.
