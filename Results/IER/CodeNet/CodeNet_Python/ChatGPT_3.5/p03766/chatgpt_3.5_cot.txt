<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input and assigns it to the variable n.
Then it checks if n is equal to 1. If it is, it prints 1 and the code execution ends.
If n is not equal to 1, the code initializes two lists, res_v and res_v_cumsum, with size n+1 and fills them with 0.
It also initializes the first three elements of res_v and res_v_cumsum with specific values.
Then it sets the value of M to 1000000007.
The code then enters a loop that starts from 3 and goes up to n-1 (inclusive).
In each iteration of the loop, it calculates the value of res_v[k] and res_v_cumsum[k] based on the previous values.
After the loop finishes, the code calculates a final result using the values in res_v_cumsum and prints it.
