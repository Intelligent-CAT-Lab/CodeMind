<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input N, which is a string.
It then checks if the first three characters of N are the same or if the last three characters of N are the same.
If either of these conditions is true, it prints 'Yes'. Otherwise, it prints 'No'.
In this case, the first three characters of N are '111', so the condition is true and the code will print 'Yes'.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
