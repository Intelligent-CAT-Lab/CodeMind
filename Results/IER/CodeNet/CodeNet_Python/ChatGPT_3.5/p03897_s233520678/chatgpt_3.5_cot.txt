<<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the necessary modules and defines some utility functions for reading input.

Then, it reads an integer N from the input.

Next, it creates a 2D array called grid with dimensions N x N, filled with zeros.

The code then sets certain cells in the grid to 1 based on specific patterns. These patterns create a checkerboard-like pattern with some additional cells set to 1.

After setting the cells in the grid, the code modifies some specific rows and columns to ensure that the outer border of the grid is also set to 1.

Finally, the code finds the indices of all cells in the grid that have a value of 1 and stores them in the arrays x and y.

The code then prints the length of the array x, which represents the number of cells with a value of 1 in the grid.

Finally, it prints the coordinates of each cell with a value of 1 in the grid.
