<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes input as a list of integers and stores it in the variable num.
Then it prints the minimum value in the list followed by a space and the maximum value in the list.
In this case, the input list is [4, 5, 3].
The minimum value is 3 and the maximum value is 5.
So, the output will be "3 5".
<<<Output>>>
3 5
