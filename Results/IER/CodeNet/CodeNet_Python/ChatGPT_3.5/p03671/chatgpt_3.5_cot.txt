<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes input in the form of three integers and stores them in a list called abc.
The list abc is then sorted in ascending order using the sort() method.
Finally, the code prints the sum of the first two elements of the sorted list abc.
In this case, the sorted list abc would be [600, 700, 780], so the output would be 600 + 700 = 1300.
<<<Output>>>
1300
