<<<Analysis>>>
The variable A, variable B and variable C are initialized to 10, 10 and 5, respectively.
The variable time is initialized to 0, which will be used to keep track of the current time.
The variable ss is initialized as an empty set, which will be used to store the remainders of time%60.
The code then enters a while loop that continues indefinitely until a condition is met to break out of the loop.
Inside the loop, the code checks if the current time is divisible by 60 and the remainder is equal to C. If it is, it prints the current time and exits the program.
If the condition is not met, the code enters a for loop that iterates A times. For each iteration, it increments the time by 1 and checks if the current time is divisible by 60 and the remainder is equal to C. If it is, it prints the current time and exits the program.
After the for loop, the code increments the time by B and checks if the remainder of time%60 is already in the set ss. If it is, it breaks out of the while loop.
If the remainder is not in ss, it adds the remainder to ss and continues to the next iteration of the while loop.
If the while loop is exited without printing a time, it means that no time satisfying the conditions is found, so the code prints -1.
