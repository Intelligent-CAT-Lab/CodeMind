<<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports necessary libraries and defines some helper functions for mathematical calculations.

Then, it reads the input values N and MOD.

Next, it defines a function cumprod() that calculates the cumulative product of an array.

After that, it defines a function make_fact() that generates factorial and factorial inverse arrays.

Then, it initializes some variables and arrays for further calculations.

The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N//2 (inclusive). For each value x in this range, it updates the array f by adding 2 times the inverse values of f[x::x].

If N is odd, it calculates the value for x = (N+1)//2 separately and updates the array f.

Finally, it calculates the exponential of the array f using the function fps_exp() and stores the result in the array g.

The answer is then calculated as the sum of the first N elements of the array g modulo MOD.

The final answer is printed.
