<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers n and k as input.
It initializes a variable i to 0.
Then it enters a while loop that continues until n divided by k raised to the power of i becomes 0.
In each iteration of the loop, it increments the value of i by 1.
Finally, it prints the value of i.
In this case, n is 11 and k is 2.
The loop will iterate until n divided by k raised to the power of i becomes 0.
In the first iteration, i is 0 and n divided by k raised to the power of i is 11 divided by 2 raised to the power of 0, which is 11.
In the second iteration, i is 1 and n divided by k raised to the power of i is 11 divided by 2 raised to the power of 1, which is 5.5.
Since 5.5 is not equal to 0, the loop continues.
In the third iteration, i is 2 and n divided by k raised to the power of i is 11 divided by 2 raised to the power of 2, which is 2.75.
Since 2.75 is not equal to 0, the loop continues.
In the fourth iteration, i is 3 and n divided by k raised to the power of i is 11 divided by 2 raised to the power of 3, which is 1.375.
Since 1.375 is not equal to 0, the loop continues.
In the fifth iteration, i is 4 and n divided by k raised to the power of i is 11 divided by 2 raised to the power of 4, which is 0.6875.
Since 0.6875 is not equal to 0, the loop continues.
In the sixth iteration, i is 5 and n divided by k raised to the power of i is 11 divided by 2 raised to the power of 5, which is 0.34375.
Since 0.34375 is not equal to 0, the loop continues.
In the seventh iteration, i is 6 and n divided by k raised to the power of i is 11 divided by 2 raised to the power of 6, which is 0.171875.
Since 0.171875 is not equal to 0, the loop continues.
In the eighth iteration, i is 7 and n divided by k raised to the power of i is 11 divided by 2 raised to the power of 7, which is 0.0859375.
Since 0.0859375 is not equal to 0, the loop continues.
In the ninth iteration, i is 8 and n divided by k raised to the power of i is 11 divided by 2 raised to the power of 8, which is 0.04296875.
Since 0.04296875 is not equal to 0, the loop continues.
In the tenth iteration, i is 9 and n divided by k raised to the power of i is 11 divided by 2 raised to the power of 9, which is 0.021484375.
Since 0.021484375 is not equal to 0, the loop continues.
In the eleventh iteration, i is 10 and n divided by k raised to the power of i is 11 divided by 2 raised to the power of 10, which is 0.0107421875.
Since 0.0107421875 is not equal to 0, the loop continues.
In the twelfth iteration, i is 11 and n divided by k raised to the power of i is 11 divided by 2 raised to the power of 11, which is 0.00537109375.
Since 0.00537109375 is not equal to 0, the loop continues.
In the thirteenth iteration, i is 12 and n divided by k raised to the power of i is 11 divided by 2 raised to the power of 12, which is 0.002685546875.
Since 0.002685546875 is not equal to 0, the loop continues.
In the fourteenth iteration, i is 13 and n divided by k raised to the power of i is 11 divided by 2 raised to the power of 13, which is 0.0013427734375.
Since 0.0013427734375 is not equal to 0, the loop continues.
In the fifteenth iteration, i is 14 and n divided by k raised to the power of i is 11 divided by 2 raised to the power of 14, which is 0.00067138671875.
Since 0.
