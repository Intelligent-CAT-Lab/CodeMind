<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input and assigns them to variables a, b, and c.
It then checks if the product of a and c is less than b. If this condition is true, it prints the value of c.
Otherwise, it calculates the floor division of b by a (b//a) and prints the result.
In this case, a=2, b=11, and c=4.
The condition a*c<b is true because 2*4=8<11.
Therefore, the code will print the value of c, which is 4.
<<<Output>>>
4
