<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three inputs: n, a, and b. These inputs are then used to determine the output.
The code checks if the product of n and a is greater than b. If it is, it prints the value of b.
Otherwise, it prints the product of n and a.
In this case, n = 7, a = 17, and b = 120.
The product of n and a is 7 * 17 = 119, which is not greater than b.
Therefore, the code will print the product of n and a, which is 119.
<<<Output>>>
119
