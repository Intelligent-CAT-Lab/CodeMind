<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs, t and x, and assigns them to the variables t and x respectively.
Then it calculates the division of t by x and prints the result.
In this case, t is 8 and x is 3, so the division is 8/3 which is approximately 2.6666666666666665.
<<<Output>>>
2.6666666666666665
