<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input value and assigns it to the variable x.
It then checks the value of x using if-elif-else statements.
If x is equal to 'A', it prints 'T'.
If x is equal to 'T', it prints 'A'.
If x is equal to 'G', it prints 'C'.
If none of the above conditions are met, it prints 'G'.
In this case, the input value is 'A', so the first condition is met and the code prints 'T'.
<<<Output>>>
T
