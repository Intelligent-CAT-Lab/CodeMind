<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines two functions: getprime and factorization. 
The getprime function takes an integer n as input and returns a list of prime numbers up to n. It uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to find the prime numbers. 
The factorization function takes an integer n as input and returns a dictionary of prime factors of n and their exponents. It uses the getprime function to find the prime numbers up to the square root of n and then checks if each prime number is a factor of n. If it is, it divides n by the prime number and increments the exponent of the prime factor in the dictionary. Finally, if n is not equal to 1, it adds n as a prime factor with exponent 1 to the dictionary. 
The main part of the code reads two integers n and p from input. If p is equal to 1, it prints 1 and exits. Otherwise, it initializes a variable ans to 1 and calls the factorization function with p as input. It then iterates over the keys of the dictionary returned by the factorization function. If the exponent of a prime factor is greater than or equal to n, it multiplies ans by the prime factor raised to the power of the integer division of the exponent by n. Finally, it prints the value of ans.
In this case, n is 3 and p is 24. The factorization of 24 is {2: 3, 3: 1}, which means that 24 = 2^3 * 3^1. The exponent of 2 is 3, which is greater than or equal to 3, so ans is multiplied by 2^(3//3) = 2^1 = 2. The exponent of 3 is 1, which is not greater than or equal to 3, so ans remains unchanged. Therefore, the final value of ans is 2.
