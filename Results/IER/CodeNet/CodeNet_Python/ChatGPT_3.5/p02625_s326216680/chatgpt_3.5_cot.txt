<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function `factorials_with_inv` that calculates the factorials and modular inverses of numbers from 0 to k. It uses these values to calculate the binomial coefficients for the given values of N and M.
The code then defines a function `solve` that uses the binomial coefficients to calculate the desired result. It iterates over the values of k from 0 to N and calculates the term `fac[M-k]*inv[k]*inv[N-k]` for each value of k. It adds or subtracts this term from the result depending on the value of `sign`. Finally, it multiplies the result by `fac[N]*fac[M]*inv[M-N]**2` and returns the final result.
The code also defines a function `naive` that uses nested loops to generate all possible permutations of A and B and checks if each pair of permutations satisfies the condition. This function is not used in the main code.
In the main code, it reads the values of N and M from input, calls the `solve` function with these values, and prints the result.
