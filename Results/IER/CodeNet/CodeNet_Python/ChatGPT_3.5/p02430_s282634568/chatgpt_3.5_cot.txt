<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 5 and variable k is initialized to 3.
The code creates a list l containing numbers from 0 to n-1, which is [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] in this case.
The code then initializes an empty list p, which will store tuples of the form (num, i).
The code enters a loop that generates all combinations of length k from the list l using the combinations function from the itertools module.
For each combination i, the code initializes a variable num to 0.
It then iterates over each element j in the combination i and performs a bitwise OR operation with num and the result of shifting 1 to the left by j positions.
This effectively sets the j-th bit of num to 1.
After the inner loop finishes, the code appends a tuple (num, i) to the list p.
The code then sorts the list p based on the first element of each tuple (num).
Finally, the code iterates over each tuple (i, j) in the sorted list p and prints the value of i followed by the elements of j separated by a space.
