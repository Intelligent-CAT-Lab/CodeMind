<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes input as a string and splits it into a list of strings using the split() function. In this case, the input "1 3 8" will be split into the list ['1', '3', '8'].
The code then checks if the first element of the list ('1') is less than the second element ('3') and if the second element is less than the third element ('8'). Since both conditions are true, the code will print 'Yes'.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
