<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input and assigns it to the variable n.
Then, it enters a nested loop where the outer loop iterates from 1 to 3500 (inclusive) and the inner loop iterates from the current value of the outer loop variable i to 3500 (inclusive).
Inside the inner loop, the code checks if the expression (4*i*j-n*(i+j)) is greater than 0 and if n*i*j is divisible by (4*i*j-n*(i+j)). If both conditions are true, it calculates the value of k as n*i*j divided by (4*i*j-n*(i+j)) and breaks out of both loops.
If the conditions are not met, the code continues to the next iteration of the inner loop.
After the loops finish, the code prints the values of i, j, and k.
