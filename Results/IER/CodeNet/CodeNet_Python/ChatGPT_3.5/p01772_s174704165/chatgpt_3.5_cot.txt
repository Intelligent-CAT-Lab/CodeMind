<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string S and initializes variables A, c to False and 0 respectively.
It then enters a loop that iterates over each character s in the input string S.
Inside the loop, it checks if the current character s is equal to "A" and sets the variable A to True if it is.
It also checks if the current character s is equal to "Z" and if the variable A is True. If both conditions are met, it increments the variable c by 1 and sets the variable A back to False.
After the loop finishes, it checks if the variable c is greater than 0. If it is, it prints the string "AZ" repeated c times. Otherwise, it prints -1.
<<<Output>>>
AZ
