<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by taking an input string and converting it into a list of characters.
Then, it uses the Counter function from the collections module to count the occurrences of each character in the list.
The code creates a new list, c, which contains the counts of the characters 'a', 'b', and 'c' in that order.
Next, it checks if the difference between the maximum and minimum values in c is less than 2.
If the condition is true, it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".
In this case, the counts of 'a', 'b', and 'c' are 2, 1, and 1 respectively. The difference between the maximum and minimum values is 2-1=1, which is less than 2.
Therefore, the code will print "YES".
<<<Output>>>
YES
