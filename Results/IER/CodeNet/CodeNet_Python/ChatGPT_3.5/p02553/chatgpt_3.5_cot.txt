<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four integers as input and assigns them to variables a, b, c, and d.
The variable ans is initialized with a very large negative value.
The code then calculates the maximum value among a*c, a*d, b*c, and b*d using the max() function and assigns it to ans.
Finally, the code prints the value of ans.
In this case, the maximum value among 1*1, 1*1, 2*1, and 2*1 is 2, so the output will be 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
