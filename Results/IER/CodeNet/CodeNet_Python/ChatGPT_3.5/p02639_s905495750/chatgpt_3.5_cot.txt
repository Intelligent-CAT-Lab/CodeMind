<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes input as a list of integers and stores it in variable x.
Then, it enters a loop that iterates through each element of x.
Inside the loop, it checks if the current element is equal to 0.
If it is, it prints the index of the element plus 1.
In this case, the input list is [0, 2, 3, 4, 5].
The first element is 0, so the code will print 1.
<<<Output>>>
