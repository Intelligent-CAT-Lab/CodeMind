<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers a, b, and c as input.
It first checks if a, b, and c are equal and even. If they are, it prints -1 and exits.
Otherwise, it initializes a variable res to 0 and enters a while loop.
Inside the while loop, it checks if a, b, and c are all even. If any of them is odd, it breaks out of the loop.
If all of them are even, it updates the values of a, b, and c using the formula (b+c)//2, (a+c)//2, and (a+b)//2 respectively.
It also increments the value of res by 1.
The loop continues until at least one of a, b, or c becomes odd.
Finally, it prints the value of res.
In this case, a=4, b=12, and c=20. All of them are even.
In the first iteration of the loop, a becomes (12+20)//2 = 16, b becomes (4+20)//2 = 12, and c becomes (4+12)//2 = 8.
In the second iteration, a becomes (12+8)//2 = 10, b becomes (16+8)//2 = 12, and c becomes (16+12)//2 = 14.
In the third iteration, a becomes (12+14)//2 = 13, which is odd. So the loop breaks.
The final value of res is 3.
