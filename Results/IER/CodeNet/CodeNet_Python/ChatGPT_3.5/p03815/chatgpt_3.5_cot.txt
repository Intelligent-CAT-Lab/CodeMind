<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input and assigns it to the variable x.
It then calculates the integer division of x by 11 and assigns it to the variable n.
Next, it subtracts 11*n from x and assigns the result back to x.
The code then checks if x is equal to 0. If it is, it prints 2*n.
If x is not equal to 0, the code checks if x is between 1 and 6 (inclusive). If it is, it prints 1+2*n.
If x is not equal to 0 and not between 1 and 6, the code prints 2+2*n.
In this case, the input is 7. When divided by 11, the quotient is 0 and the remainder is 7.
Since x is not equal to 0 and not between 1 and 6, the code will print 2+2*0, which is 2.
