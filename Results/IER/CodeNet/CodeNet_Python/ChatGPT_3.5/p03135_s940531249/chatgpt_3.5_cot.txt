<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called solve that takes two arguments, T and X. Inside the function, it prints the result of dividing T by X.
The code then defines a main function that reads input from the standard input and calls the solve function with the input values.
The main function is executed only if the script is run directly (i.e., not imported as a module).
In this case, the input values are 8 and 3.
The solve function prints the result of dividing 8 by 3, which is approximately 2.6666666666666665.
<<<Output>>>
2.6666666666666665
