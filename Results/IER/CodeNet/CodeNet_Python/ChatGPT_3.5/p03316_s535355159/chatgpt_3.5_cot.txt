<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input and stores it in the variable n.
It then calculates the sum of the digits of n by converting it to a string, splitting it into individual characters, converting each character back to an integer, and then summing them using the sum() function. This sum is stored in the variable s_n.
The code then checks if n is divisible by s_n (i.e., n % s_n == 0). If it is, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
In this case, the input is 12. The sum of its digits is 1 + 2 = 3. Since 12 is divisible by 3, the output will be "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
