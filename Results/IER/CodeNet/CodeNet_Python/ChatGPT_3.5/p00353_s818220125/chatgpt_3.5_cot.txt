<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input: a, b, and c.
It then checks three conditions:
1. If c is less than or equal to a, it prints "0".
2. If c is less than or equal to the sum of a and b, it prints the difference between c and a.
3. If none of the above conditions are met, it prints "NA".

In this case, the values of a, b, and c are 1000, 3000, and 3000 respectively.
Since c is equal to a, the first condition is met and the code will print "0".

<<<Output>>>
0
