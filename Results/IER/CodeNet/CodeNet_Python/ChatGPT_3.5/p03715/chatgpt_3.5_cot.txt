<<<Analysis>>>
The variable h and variable w are initialized to 3 and 5, respectively.
The code first checks if either h or w is divisible by 3. If either of them is divisible by 3, it prints 0 and exits the program.
If neither h nor w is divisible by 3, the code initializes the variable res to the minimum of h and w.
Then it enters a loop that iterates from 1 to h-1 (inclusive). For each value of hi in this range, it calculates three values: b1, b2, and b3.
b1 is the area of a rectangle with height hi and width w.
b2 is the area of a rectangle with height h-hi and width w//2 (integer division).
b3 is the area of a rectangle with height h-hi and width w//2+w%2 (integer division plus the remainder).
The code then updates the value of res to be the minimum of res and the difference between the maximum and minimum of b1, b2, and b3.
After the loop finishes, the code enters another loop that iterates from 1 to w-1 (inclusive). For each value of wi in this range, it calculates three values: b1, b2, and b3.
b1 is the area of a rectangle with width wi and height h.
b2 is the area of a rectangle with width w-wi and height h//2 (integer division).
b3 is the area of a rectangle with width w-wi and height h//2+h%2 (integer division plus the remainder).
The code then updates the value of res to be the minimum of res and the difference between the maximum and minimum of b1, b2, and b3.
Finally, the code prints the value of res, which is the minimum difference between the areas of the rectangles calculated in the previous loops.
