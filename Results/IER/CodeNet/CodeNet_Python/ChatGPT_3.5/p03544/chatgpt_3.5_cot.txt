<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function `fib(n)` that calculates the nth Fibonacci number using dynamic programming. It initializes a list `memo` of size `n` with all elements set to 0. Then it sets the first two elements of `memo` to 2 and 1, respectively. It then iterates from index 2 to `n-1` and calculates each Fibonacci number by summing the previous two numbers. Finally, it returns the last element of `memo`, which is the nth Fibonacci number.

The code also defines a function `solve()` that takes an integer input `N`. It calls the `fib()` function with `N+1` as the argument and prints the result.

In the main part of the code, it calls the `solve()` function.

So, when the input is `5`, the code will calculate the 6th Fibonacci number (since `N+1` is 6) and print it.
