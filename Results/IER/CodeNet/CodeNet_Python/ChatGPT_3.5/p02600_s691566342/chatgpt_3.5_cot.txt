<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input and assigns it to the variable x.
The variable result is initialized to 0.
The code then checks the value of x against a series of conditions using if-elif statements.
If x is less than or equal to 599, result is assigned the value 8.
If x is greater than 599 and less than or equal to 799, result is assigned the value 7.
If x is greater than 799 and less than or equal to 999, result is assigned the value 6.
If x is greater than 999 and less than or equal to 1199, result is assigned the value 5.
If x is greater than 1199 and less than or equal to 1399, result is assigned the value 4.
If x is greater than 1399 and less than or equal to 1599, result is assigned the value 3.
If x is greater than 1599 and less than or equal to 1799, result is assigned the value 2.
If none of the above conditions are met, result is assigned the value 1.
Finally, the code prints the value of result, which will be the value assigned based on the conditions.
In this case, since x is 725, it falls into the second condition and result is assigned the value 7.
