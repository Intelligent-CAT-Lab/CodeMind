<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function f(n) that calculates the nth Fibonacci number modulo M (998244353 in this case) using matrix exponentiation.
The code then reads two integers n and m from input.
The code initializes a list I with the values [1, 1].
The code calls the function f with the argument m+2*n-2 and stores the result in the variable r.
The code initializes the variable c to 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to n-1 (inclusive).
For each iteration, the code appends a new value to the list I, which is calculated using the formula (M-M//i)*I[M%i]%M.
The code then updates the value of r by subtracting c*f(2*n-2-2*i) from it and taking the result modulo M.
The code updates the value of c by multiplying it with (m+i)*I[i+1] and taking the result modulo M.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of r.
