<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input and assigns them to variables a and b.
It then checks if both a and b are either 1 or 3. If they are, it prints 'Yes'. Otherwise, it prints 'No'.
In this case, a is 3 and b is 1, so both conditions are met and the code will print 'Yes'.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
