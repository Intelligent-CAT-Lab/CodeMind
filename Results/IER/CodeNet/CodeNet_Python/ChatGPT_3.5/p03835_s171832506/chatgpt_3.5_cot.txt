<<<Analysis>>>
The variable K and variable S are initialized to 2 and 2, respectively.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the count of valid combinations.
The code then enters a nested loop that iterates from 0 to K (inclusive) for both i and j.
For each combination of i and j, it calculates the value of k as S-i-j.
The code checks if k is within the range [0, K]. If it is, it increments the count ans by 1.
After the nested loops finish, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 6.
<<<Output>>>
6
