<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes an empty list called stack.
It then enters a loop that iterates over each element in the input string after splitting it by spaces.
For each element, it checks if it is one of the operators '+', '-', or '*'.
If it is an operator, it pops the last two elements from the stack, performs the corresponding operation, and appends the result back to the stack as a string.
If it is not an operator, it simply appends the element to the stack.
After the loop finishes, the code joins all the elements in the stack into a single string and prints it.
In this case, the input is "1 2 +", so the code will perform the addition operation on the numbers 1 and 2, resulting in 3.
The final output will be the string "3".
