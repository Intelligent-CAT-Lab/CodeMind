<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized to 2 and variable X is initialized to 7.
The code then initializes two lists, l and p, both with length 51, and sets the first element of each list to 1.
Then, in a loop that iterates from 1 to 50, it calculates the values of l[i] and p[i] based on the previous values in the lists.
After that, the code initializes a variable ans to 0.
Then, in another loop that iterates from N to 0 (inclusive) in reverse order, it checks several conditions.
If i is 0 and X is greater than or equal to 1, it increments ans by 1 and breaks the loop.
If X is less than or equal to 1, it breaks the loop.
If X is less than or equal to l[i - 1] + 1, it subtracts 1 from X and continues to the next iteration of the loop.
If X is equal to l[i - 1] + 2, it increments ans by 1 and subtracts 2 from X.
Otherwise, it increments ans by p[i - 1] + 1 and subtracts l[i - 1] + 2 from X.
Finally, the code prints the value of ans.
