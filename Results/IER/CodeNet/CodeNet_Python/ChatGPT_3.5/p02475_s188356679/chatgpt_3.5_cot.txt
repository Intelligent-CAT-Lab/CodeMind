<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input and assigns them to variables a and b.
It then checks if the product of a and b is greater than or equal to 0.
If the condition is true, it performs integer division of a by b using the // operator and prints the result.
If the condition is false, it performs integer division of -a by b using the // operator, negates the result using the - operator, and prints the negated result.
In this case, the product of 5 and 8 is 40, which is greater than 0. So the code performs integer division of 5 by 8 and prints the result, which is 0.
<<<Output>>>
0
