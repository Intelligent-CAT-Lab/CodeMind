<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by taking an integer input n. It then initializes an empty list l, a variable i to 1, and enters a while loop that continues until n becomes 0 or negative.
Inside the loop, it subtracts i from n and calculates the value of t using the formula i * (i - 1) // 2. It then appends a list of numbers from t + 1 to t + i + 1 to the list l.
After the loop ends, the code checks if n is negative. If it is, it prints "No" and exits the program.
If n is not negative, it prints "Yes" and continues.
The code then decreases the value of i by 1 and initializes a list ans with the value i + 1.
It then appends i to ans, followed by the last element of each sublist in l.
Next, it enters a nested loop that iterates over the range from 0 to i-1. In each iteration, it appends i to ans, followed by the elements of the sublist at index j in l, and the elements of the sublist at index k in l for k in the range from j + 1 to i.
Finally, it prints the elements of ans separated by spaces.
