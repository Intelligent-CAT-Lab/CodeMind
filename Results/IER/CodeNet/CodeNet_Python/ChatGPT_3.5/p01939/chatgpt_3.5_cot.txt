<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called "sum" that takes three parameters: a, d, and n. This function calculates the sum of an arithmetic series using the formula: n*(2*a+(n-1)*d)//2.

The code then defines a function called "main" that does the following:
1. Reads two integers, n and m, from input.
2. Initializes a variable s to 0.
3. Checks if n is equal to 1. If it is, it sets s to m+1.
4. If n is not equal to 1, it calculates the sum using the "sum" function with the parameters m+1, -n+1, and 1+m//(n-1). This sum is stored in s.
5. Multiplies s by 2.
6. Subtracts (m+1) from s.
7. Prints the value of s modulo MOD.

The code then calls the "main" function.

Given the input "3 9", the code will execute the following steps:
1. n is assigned the value 3 and m is assigned the value 9.
2. Since n is not equal to 1, the code calculates the sum using the "sum" function with the parameters 10, -2, and 5. This sum is 30.
3. s is multiplied by 2, resulting in 60.
4. (m+1) is subtracted from s, resulting in 50.
5. The value of s modulo MOD is printed, which is 50.

<<<Output>>>
50
