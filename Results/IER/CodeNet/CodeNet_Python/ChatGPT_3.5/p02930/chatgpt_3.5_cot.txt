<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 3.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 3.
For each number i in this range, it enters another loop that iterates from i+1 to n-1, meaning it will consider numbers from i+1 to n-1.
For each pair of numbers (i, j), it calculates the bitwise XOR of i and j and stores it in x.
Then, it initializes a variable ct to 0 and enters a while loop that continues as long as x is greater than 0.
In each iteration of the while loop, it divides x by 2 (integer division) and increments ct by 1.
After the while loop finishes, it prints the value of ct followed by a space.
After the inner loop finishes, it prints a newline character to move to the next line.
This process continues for all pairs of numbers (i, j) in the given range.
