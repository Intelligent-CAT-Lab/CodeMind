<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called solve that takes two arguments, N and K. It then initializes an empty list called ns.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N+1. For each iteration, it checks if N is less than i*i. If it is, it breaks out of the loop. Otherwise, it appends i and N//i to the ns list.
The ns list is then sorted and duplicates are removed using the set function. The result is stored back in the ns list.
The code creates a dictionary called m, where the keys are the elements of ns and the values are their corresponding indices.
The code initializes a list called l with 1s, with the same length as ns.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the indices and values of ns, except for the last value. For each iteration, it calculates the difference between the number of times N is divisible by the current value and the next value, and stores it in the corresponding index of l.
The code initializes a 2D list called dp with 0s, with K+1 rows and the length of ns columns.
The code sets the value of dp[0][m[N]] to 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates K times. For each iteration, it updates the values of dp by adding the values of the next column to the current column, starting from the second to last column and moving backwards. It then iterates over the indices and values of ns. For each iteration, it calculates the index of the next value in ns in the m dictionary and updates the value of dp[i+1][j] by adding the product of dp[i][nj] and l[j] to it, modulo MOD.
Finally, the code returns the sum of the last row of dp modulo MOD.

The main function reads the input from stdin, calls the solve function with the input values, and prints the result.
