<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input and assigns them to variables a and b.
It then calculates the remainder of a divided by b using the modulus operator (%).
In this case, a is 5 and b is 8, so the remainder of 5 divided by 8 is 5.
The code then prints the result, which is 5.
<<<Output>>>
5
