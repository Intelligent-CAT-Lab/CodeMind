<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string s.
It then checks if the character at index 2 of s is equal to the character at index 3 of s, and if the character at index 4 of s is equal to the character at index 5 of s.
If both conditions are true, it assigns the value 'Yes' to the variable ans. Otherwise, it assigns the value 'No' to ans.
Finally, it prints the value of ans.
In this case, the character at index 2 of s is 'p' and the character at index 3 of s is 'p', so the first condition is true.
However, the character at index 4 of s is 'u' and the character at index 5 of s is 'u', so the second condition is also true.
Therefore, the value of ans will be 'Yes'.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
