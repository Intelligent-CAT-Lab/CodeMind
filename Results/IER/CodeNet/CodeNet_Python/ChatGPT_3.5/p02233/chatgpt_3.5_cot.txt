<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 3.
Variables a and b are initialized to 1.
Variable i is initialized to 0.
The code then enters a while loop that will iterate n times.
In each iteration, the values of a and b are updated as follows:
    a = b
    b = a + b
    i is incremented by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of a, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>
