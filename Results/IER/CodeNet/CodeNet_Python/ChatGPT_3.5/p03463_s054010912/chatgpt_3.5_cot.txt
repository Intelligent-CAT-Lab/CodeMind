<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three inputs: n, a, and b. These inputs are separated by spaces and are converted to integers using the map() function.
The code then checks if the difference between b and a is divisible by 2. If it is, it prints 'Alice', otherwise it prints 'Borys'.
In this case, the difference between b and a is 2-4 = -2, which is not divisible by 2.
Therefore, the code will print 'Borys'.
<<<Output>>>
Borys
