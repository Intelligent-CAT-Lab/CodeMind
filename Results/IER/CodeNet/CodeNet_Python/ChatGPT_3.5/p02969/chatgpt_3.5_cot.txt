<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads an integer value from the input and assigns it to the variable r.
Then it calculates the square of r and multiplies it by 3.
Finally, it prints the result of this calculation.
In this case, the input value is 4, so the code will calculate 3*(4**2) = 3*16 = 48.
<<<Output>>>
48
