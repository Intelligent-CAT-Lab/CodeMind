<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by importing necessary modules and defining some helper functions.
Then, it reads the values of H, W, and K from the input.
Next, it initializes the variable P to 10^9 + 7.
It creates a list fib of size M (W + 100) and initializes the first two elements to 1. Then, it calculates the Fibonacci sequence up to the (M-2)th element using a loop.
After that, it defines a recursive function solve(h, k) using the functools.lru_cache decorator. This function calculates the number of ways to fill a grid of size h x W with k black cells, using the Fibonacci sequence.
The function has three base cases: when h is 0, when k is 1, and when k is W. In each case, it returns a specific value based on the current values of h and k.
For other cases, the function uses recursion and the Fibonacci sequence to calculate the number of ways to fill the grid.
Finally, the code checks if W is 1. If it is, it prints 1 and exits. Otherwise, it calls the solve function with the values of H and K and prints the result.
