The code takes an input string S, which is "x^2+3x+2" in this case. It then calculates the length of the string and stores it in variable L.
The code initializes a variable cur to 0 and a list P with 6 elements, all initialized to 0.
The code defines a function expr() which will be used to parse the expression. It starts by initializing a variable op to "+".
Inside a while loop, it calls the function term(op) to parse a term in the expression. If the current position cur is equal to L, meaning we have reached the end of the string, it breaks out of the loop. Otherwise, it updates the value of op to the next character in the string and increments cur by 1.
The function term(op) is defined to parse a term in the expression. It starts by initializing a variable k to 1. If the current character at position cur is not "x", it calls the function num() to parse a number and assigns it to k. It then initializes a variable d to 0. If the current character at position cur is "x", it increments cur by 1. If the next character is "^", it increments cur by 1 and calls the function num() to parse a number and assigns it to d. Finally, it updates the value of P[d] to k if op is "+", otherwise it updates it to -k.
The function num() is defined to parse a number. It starts by initializing a variable v to 0. Inside a while loop, it checks if the current character at position cur is a digit. If it is, it multiplies v by 10 and adds the integer value of the current character to v. It then increments cur by 1. The loop continues as long as cur is less than L and the current character is a digit. Finally, it returns the value of v.
After defining the necessary functions, the code calls the function expr() to parse the expression.
Next, the code defines a function f(P, x) which calculates the value of the polynomial represented by the list P at a given value of x. It initializes a variable res to 0 and then iterates over the elements of P. For each element, it multiplies it by x raised to the power of its index and adds it to res. Finally, it returns the value of res.
The code then initializes a variable d to 5. It enters a while loop that continues as long as the element at index d in P is equal to 0. Inside the loop, it decrements the value of d by 1.
Next, the code initializes an empty list R. It enters a for loop that iterates over a range from 2000 to -2001 (inclusive) with a step of -1. For each value of x, it checks if f(P, x) is equal to 0. If it is, it appends x to the list R.
Finally, the code prints the elements of R as a string, where each element is formatted as "(x%+d)" % -x. This means that each element is enclosed in parentheses and preceded by a sign depending on the value of x.
