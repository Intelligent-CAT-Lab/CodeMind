<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by importing various modules and setting up some constants and lambda functions for input reading.
Then, it defines a function called "prepare" that calculates factorials and inverses modulo MOD.
After that, it defines the main function that reads two integers n and m from input.
If n is less than m, it prints 0 and exits.
Otherwise, it subtracts m from n and continues.
Next, it initializes a 2D list called dp with dimensions (m+1) x (n+1) and sets dp[0][0] to 1.
Then, it enters two nested loops to calculate the values of dp.
For each i from 1 to m, and each j from 0 to n, it checks if j-i is non-negative.
If it is, it adds dp[i-1][j] and dp[i][j-i] and assigns the result to dp[i][j].
Otherwise, it assigns dp[i-1][j] to dp[i][j].
Finally, it prints dp[m][n].
