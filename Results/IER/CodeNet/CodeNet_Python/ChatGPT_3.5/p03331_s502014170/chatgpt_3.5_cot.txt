<<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the numpy library as np.
Then it takes an integer input N.
The code defines a function called Num_Each_Digit that takes two arguments: N and limit.
Inside the function, an empty numpy array called ans is initialized.
The code then checks if N is less than 10^limit. If it is, it enters a loop that iterates from 1 to limit (inclusive).
Inside the loop, it checks if 10^(i-1) is greater than N. If it is, it breaks out of the loop.
If i is equal to 1, it appends the remainder of N divided by 10^i to the ans array.
If i is greater than 1, it appends the result of (N%(10^i) - N%(10^(i-1))) divided by 10^(i-1) to the ans array.
After the loop finishes, the function returns the ans array.
If N is not less than 10^limit, the function prints "too large" and returns N.
The code then calls the Num_Each_Digit function with arguments N and 10, and assigns the result to the variable digit.
The code then checks if N is equal to 10^(length of digit - 1). If it is, it prints 10.
Otherwise, it prints the sum of the elements in the digit array, converted to an integer.
