<<<Analysis>>>
The variable K is initialized to 2.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of gcd values.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to K (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 2.
For each pair of numbers i and j in this range, it calculates the gcd(i, j) and stores it in dp[i][j].
After that, it enters another loop that iterates from 1 to K (inclusive) three times, meaning it will consider triplets of numbers from 1 to 2.
For each triplet of numbers i, j, and k in this range, it retrieves the gcd value from dp[i][j] and stores it in variable a.
Then, it retrieves the gcd value from dp[a][k] and adds it to ans.
Finally, it prints the final value of ans, which is 2.
