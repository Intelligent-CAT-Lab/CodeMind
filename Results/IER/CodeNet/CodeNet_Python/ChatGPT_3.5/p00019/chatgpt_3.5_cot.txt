<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 5.
The variable k is initialized to 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 5.
For each number j in this range, it multiplies the current value of k by j and updates the value of k.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of k, which is 120.
<<<Output>>>
120
