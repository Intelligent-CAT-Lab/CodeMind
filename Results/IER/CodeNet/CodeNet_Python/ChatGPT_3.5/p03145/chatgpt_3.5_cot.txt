<<<Analysis>>>
The code imports several modules and defines some utility functions for input and common operations.
Then, it initializes variables a, b, and c to the values obtained from the input.
The code then calculates the product of a and b and divides it by 2, and prints the result.
In this case, the product of 3 and 4 is 12, and dividing it by 2 gives 6.
<<<Output>>>
6
