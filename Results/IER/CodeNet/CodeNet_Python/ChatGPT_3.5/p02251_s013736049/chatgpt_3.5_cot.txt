<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 100.
The variable coin is a list containing the denominations of coins: [25, 10, 5, 1].
The variable sum_s is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the number of coins used.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each coin denomination in the list.
For each coin denomination i, it calculates the number of times the coin can be used by dividing n by i and stores it in the variable sent.
It then updates the value of n by taking the remainder of the division n % i.
Finally, it adds the value of sent to sum_s.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_s, which represents the total number of coins used to make change for n.
In this case, the output will be 4, as 100 can be made using 4 coins: 25, 25, 25, and 25.
<<<Output>>>
4
