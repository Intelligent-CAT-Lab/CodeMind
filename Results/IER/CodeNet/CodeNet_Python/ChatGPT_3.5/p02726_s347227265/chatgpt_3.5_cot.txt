<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three inputs: n, x, and y. These inputs are then used to initialize the variables n, x, and y.
The code then creates a list D of size n+1, with all elements initialized to 0.
The code then enters a nested loop. The outer loop iterates from 0 to n-2, and the inner loop iterates from i+1 to n-1.
For each pair of indices (i, j), the code calculates two distances: dist1, which is the absolute difference between j and i, and dist2, which is the sum of the absolute differences between i and x, and between j and y, plus 1.
The code then calculates the minimum of dist1 and dist2, and increments the corresponding element in the list D.
After the nested loop finishes, the code enters another loop that iterates from 1 to n-1.
For each index i, the code prints the value of D[i].
