<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by importing the defaultdict class from the collections module.
Then, it initializes a defaultdict object named d, which will be used to store the frequency of remainders.
The code takes an input string S and reverses it using the slice notation S=S[::-1].
It initializes two variables i and x to 1 and 0, respectively.
It also initializes a constant variable MOD to 2019.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each character s in the reversed string S.
For each character, it calculates the value of (int(s)*i)%MOD and adds it to x.
Then, it takes the remainder of x when divided by MOD and stores it in x.
It updates the frequency of x in the defaultdict d by incrementing d[x] by 1.
It multiplies i by 10 and takes the remainder when divided by MOD, and stores the result back in i.
After the loop finishes, the code initializes a variable ans to 0.
It then iterates over the values of d and for each value k, it adds k*(k-1)//2 to ans.
Finally, it prints the value of ans plus the frequency of 0 in d.
