<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes input from the user and splits it into a list of integers. In this case, the input is "1 7 9 4", so the list becomes [1, 7, 9, 4].
The list is then sorted in ascending order using the sorted() function, resulting in [1, 4, 7, 9].
The code then checks if the sorted list is equal to the list [1, 4, 7, 9]. Since they are equal, the variable ans is assigned the value 'YES'.
Finally, the code prints the value of ans, which is 'YES'.
<<<Output>>>
YES
