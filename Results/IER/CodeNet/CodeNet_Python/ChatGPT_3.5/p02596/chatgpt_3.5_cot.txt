<<<Analysis>>>
The code first reads an integer k from the input.
Then it checks the remainder of k divided by 10 to determine which branch of the if-elif-else statement to execute.
If the remainder is 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, or 8, it prints -1 and exits.
If the remainder is 1, it enters a while loop that continues until a certain condition is met.
Inside the loop, it checks if the count of the digit "7" in the string representation of tmp is equal to the length of the string representation of tmp. If it is, it prints the sum of ans and the length of tmp minus 1, and breaks out of the loop.
If the condition is not met, it calculates a new value for tmp based on certain conditions and increments ans by 1.
If ans becomes greater than k, it prints -1 and breaks out of the loop.
The same process is repeated for the cases where the remainder is 3, 7, or 9.
<<<Output>>>
-1
