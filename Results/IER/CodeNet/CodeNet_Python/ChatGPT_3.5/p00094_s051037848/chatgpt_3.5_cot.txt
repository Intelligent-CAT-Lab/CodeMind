<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input and assigns them to variables a and b.
Then it calculates the product of a and b, and divides it by the constant value 3.305785.
The result is then formatted as a floating-point number with 6 decimal places using the format() method.
Finally, the formatted result is printed.
In this case, the input values are 15 and 25.
So, the code calculates (15 * 25) / 3.305785 = 113.63636363636363.
The formatted result is "113.636364".
<<<Output>>>
113.636364
