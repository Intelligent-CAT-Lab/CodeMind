<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input and assigns them to variables a and b.
Then it calculates three values: a+b, a-b, and a*b.
Finally, it prints the maximum value among these three calculated values.
In this case, a=3 and b=1, so the code will calculate a+b=4, a-b=2, and a*b=3.
The maximum value among these three is 4, so the output will be 4.
<<<Output>>>
4
