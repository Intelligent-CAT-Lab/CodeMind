<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four integers as input: r1, c1, r2, and c2.
It then initializes a variable L to 10^9 + 7.
Next, it defines a function get_euclidian that implements the Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor.
After that, it initializes a list F with the first element as 1.
Then, it enters a loop that iterates from 1 to r2 + c2 + 3 (inclusive) and calculates the factorial of each number using the previous factorial value and the current index.
Next, it defines another function get_combi that calculates the combination of two numbers using the factorial values and the Euclidean function.
The code then calculates four combinations: combi1, combi2, combi3, and combi4, using different combinations of r1, c1, r2, and c2.
Finally, it prints the result of the expression (combi1 - combi2 - combi3 + combi4) modulo L.

In this case, the input is 1 1 2 2.
The code calculates combi1 as the combination of (2+2+2) choose (2+1), which is 10.
combi2 is calculated as the combination of (2+1+1) choose (1), which is 3.
combi3 is calculated as the combination of (1+2+1) choose (1), which is 3.
combi4 is calculated as the combination of (1+1) choose (1), which is 2.
Finally, the code prints the result of (10 - 3 - 3 + 2) modulo L, which is 6.
