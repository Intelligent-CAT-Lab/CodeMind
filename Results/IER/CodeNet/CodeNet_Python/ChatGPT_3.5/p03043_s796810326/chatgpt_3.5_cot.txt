<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs, n and k, and converts them to integers.
It initializes the variable score to 0.
It calculates the value of r as 1/n.
Then it enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), representing the possible outcomes of rolling a dice.
Inside the loop, it initializes the variable counter to 0 and the variable mul to the current dice value.
It enters a while loop that continues as long as mul is less than k.
Inside the while loop, it multiplies mul by 2 and increments the counter by 1.
After the while loop, it calculates the score by adding r multiplied by (0.5) raised to the power of counter.
Finally, it prints the rounded value of score with 12 decimal places.

For the given input (3 10), the code will iterate through the loop three times, with dice values 1, 2, and 3.
For dice value 1, the while loop will not be entered because 1 is already greater than or equal to 10.
For dice value 2, the while loop will be entered once because 2 * 2 = 4, which is still less than 10.
For dice value 3, the while loop will be entered twice because 3 * 2 * 2 = 12, which is greater than 10.
The score will be calculated as (1/3) * ((0.5)^0 + (0.5)^1 + (0.5)^2) = 0.625.
The rounded value of score with 12 decimal places is 0.625.
<<<Output>>>
