<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input and assigns it to the variable n.
Then, it defines a recursive function called dfs, which takes a string parameter s.
Inside the dfs function, there is a base case that checks if the integer value of s is greater than n. If it is, the function returns 0.
Next, there is a loop that iterates over the characters "753". For each character, it checks if all three characters "753" are present in the string s. If they are, it adds 1 to the variable ret, otherwise it adds 0.
After that, there is another loop that iterates over the characters "753". For each character, it calls the dfs function recursively with the updated string s+c, where c is the current character.
Finally, the dfs function returns the value of ret.
Outside the dfs function, the code calls the dfs function with the initial string '0' and prints the returned value.
