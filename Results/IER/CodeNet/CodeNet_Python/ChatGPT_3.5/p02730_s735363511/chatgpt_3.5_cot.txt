<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string `s` and calculates its length `n`.
It then creates a reversed string `r_s` by iterating through each character of `s` in reverse order and appending it to `r_s`.
The code checks if `s` is equal to `r_s`. If they are not equal, it prints 'No' and exits the program.
Next, it creates a substring `top` by taking the first half of `s` (excluding the middle character if `n` is odd).
It creates a reversed string `r_top` by iterating through each character of `top` in reverse order and appending it to `r_top`.
The code checks if `top` is equal to `r_top`. If they are not equal, it prints 'No' and exits the program.
Then, it creates a substring `last` by taking the second half of `s` (including the middle character if `n` is odd).
It creates a reversed string `r_last` by iterating through each character of `last` in reverse order and appending it to `r_last`.
The code checks if `r_last` is equal to `last`. If they are not equal, it prints 'No' and exits the program.
Finally, if all the conditions are met, it prints 'Yes'.
In this case, the input string is 'akasaka'. The length of the string is 7.
The reversed string is 'akasaka', which is equal to the original string.
The first half of the string is 'aka', and its reversed string is also 'aka'.
The second half of the string is 'saka', and its reversed string is also 'saka'.
Therefore, all the conditions are met and the output will be 'Yes'.
