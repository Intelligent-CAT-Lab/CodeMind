<<<Analysis>>>
The variables A, B, C, and K are initialized to 2, 1, 1, and 3, respectively.
The variable sum is initialized to 0, which will be used to store the final result.
The code then checks if K is greater than or equal to A. Since K is 3 and A is 2, this condition is true.
In this case, the code sets sum to A (which is 2) and subtracts A from K, resulting in K being 1.
Next, the code checks if K is greater than or equal to B (which is 1) and K is greater than or equal to 1. Both conditions are true, so it subtracts B from K, resulting in K being 0.
Finally, the code checks if K is greater than or equal to C (which is 1) and K is greater than or equal to 1. Both conditions are false, so it subtracts K from sum, resulting in sum being 2 - 0 = 2.
After all the conditions are checked, the code prints the final value of sum, which is 2.
