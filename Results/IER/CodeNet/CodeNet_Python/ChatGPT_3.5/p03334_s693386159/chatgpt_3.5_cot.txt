<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by importing the sqrt function from the math module and the product function from the itertools module. It also imports the numpy module as np.

Then, there is a function called helper that takes two parameters, N and D. This function is used to generate a grid based on the values of N and D. The grid is a boolean array of size N x N.

The code then reads three integers from input: N, D1, and D2.

Next, the code initializes a variable M to N*2.

The code calls the helper function twice, passing M and D1 as arguments the first time, and M and D2 as arguments the second time. The results are stored in variables g1 and g2, respectively.

The code then performs a bitwise AND operation between g1 and g2, and stores the result in a variable called ans.

Finally, the code iterates over the non-zero elements of ans and prints their coordinates.
