<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers A, B, and C as input using the map function and split method.
It then checks if the sum of A and B is greater than or equal to C.
If the condition is true, it prints 'Yes', otherwise it prints 'No'.
In this case, the sum of 50 and 100 is 150, which is greater than 120.
Therefore, the output will be 'Yes'.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
