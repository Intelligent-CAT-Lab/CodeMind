<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four inputs: a, b, c, and k.
It initializes a variable ans to 0.
The code then checks three conditions:
1. If k is less than or equal to a, it sets ans to k.
2. If k is less than or equal to the sum of a and b, it sets ans to a.
3. If none of the above conditions are met, it sets ans to a minus the difference between k and the sum of a and b.

In this case, a is 2, b is 1, c is 1, and k is 3.
Since k is greater than a, it moves to the next condition.
Since k is less than or equal to the sum of a and b, it sets ans to a, which is 2.
