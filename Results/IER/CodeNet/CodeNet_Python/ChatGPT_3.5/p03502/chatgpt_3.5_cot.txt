<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input n and converts it into a list of its digits. For example, if n is 12, then list_N will be ['1', '2'].
It then initializes a variable num to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of the digits.
The code enters a loop that iterates over each digit in list_N and adds it to num.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if n is divisible by num. If it is, it sets the variable ans to "Yes". Otherwise, it remains "No".
Finally, the code prints the value of ans, which will be either "Yes" or "No" depending on the divisibility condition.
In this case, the sum of the digits of 12 is 1 + 2 = 3. Since 12 is not divisible by 3, the output will be "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
