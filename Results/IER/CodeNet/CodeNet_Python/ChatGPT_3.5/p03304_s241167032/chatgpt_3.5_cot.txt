The code takes three inputs: n, m, and d. These inputs are then used to calculate the value of ans.
The formula for ans is: 2*(n-d)*(m-1)/pow(n,2)
If d is equal to 0, the formula changes to: (m-1)/n
In this case, the values of n, m, and d are 2, 3, and 1 respectively.
So, the first formula will be used to calculate ans.
Substituting the values, we get: 2*(2-1)*(3-1)/pow(2,2) = 2*1*2/4 = 4/4 = 1
Therefore, the output of the code will be 1.
