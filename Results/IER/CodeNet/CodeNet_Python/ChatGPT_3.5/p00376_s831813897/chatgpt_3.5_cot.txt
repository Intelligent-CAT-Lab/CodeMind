<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input and assigns them to variables a and b.
It then checks if a-b is equal to 0. If it is, it prints 0.
If a-b is not equal to 0, it checks if a is greater than b. If it is, it prints the value of a-b.
If a is not greater than b, it means b is greater than a, so it prints the value of b-a.
In this case, a is 20 and b is 30. Since a is not greater than b, the code will print the value of b-a, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
