<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string and checks if the first and last characters of the string are both 'x'. If they are, it prints 'x', otherwise it prints 'o'.
In this case, the input string is 'oxxoxoo'. The first character is 'o' and the last character is 'o', so the condition is not met. Therefore, the code will print 'o'.
<<<Output>>>
o
