<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string and splits it into two parts, n and m. Both n and m are converted to integers.
The code then checks if n is equal to 1. If it is, it calculates (m+1)%1000000007 and prints the result.
If n is not equal to 1, the code proceeds to calculate the value of d, which is m divided by (n-1).
The code then calculates the values of A and B using the formulas provided.
Finally, the code calculates the value of ans using the formulas provided and prints the result after taking the modulo 1000000007.
