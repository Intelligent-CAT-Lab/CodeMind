<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers N and K from the input.
If K is equal to 1, it prints 1 and exits.
Otherwise, it initializes a variable MOD to 10^9 + 7.
Then, it defines two functions: cumprod and make_fact.
The cumprod function takes an array A and calculates the cumulative product of its elements modulo MOD.
The make_fact function takes an integer U and returns two arrays: fact and fact_inv.
The fact array contains the factorials of the numbers from 0 to U-1 modulo MOD.
The fact_inv array contains the inverses of the factorials modulo MOD.
Next, the code initializes a variable U to (N + 10) * (K + 10).
It calls the make_fact function with U as the argument and assigns the returned arrays to the variables fact and fact_inv.
Then, it initializes a variable dp as an array with two elements: [0, 1].
The code enters a loop that iterates from 2 to N+1.
For each iteration, it calculates the sum of the elements in the dp array modulo MOD and assigns it to the variable S.
It calculates the cumulative sum of the elements in the prev array modulo MOD and assigns it back to the prev array.
It initializes the dp array as an array of zeros with length n+1.
It assigns S to the first element of the dp array.
It assigns S minus the elements in the prev array, excluding the last element, to the remaining elements of the dp array.
Next, it calculates the coefficients for the current iteration.
It takes a slice of the fact array from n*(K-1)-1 to n*K and reverses it.
It multiplies it by the inverse of the factorial of K-2 modulo MOD.
It takes a slice of the fact_inv array from (n-1)*(K-1) to (n-1)*K+2, reverses it, and multiplies it by the inverse of the factorial of K-2 modulo MOD.
It multiplies the dp array by the coefficients modulo MOD.
After the loop finishes, it calculates the sum of the elements in the dp array modulo MOD and assigns it to the variable answer.
It multiplies the answer by the factorial of N modulo MOD and assigns it back to the answer variable.
Finally, it prints the value of the answer variable.
