<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines several helper functions for input and output.
The main function reads a string s from input and calculates the length of the string.
It then calculates n2, which is the integer division of n by 2.
The variable ans is calculated as n2 multiplied by (n2+1), plus n%2 multiplied by (n2+1).
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each character c and its index i in the string s.
If the character c is "1", the loop continues to the next iteration.
Otherwise, the code subtracts (rem+1)//2 from ans.
If rem is even and i is even, the code subtracts 1 from ans.
If (i-rem) is even, the code increments rem by 1.
Finally, the code prints the value of ans.
In this case, the input string is "1101".
The length of the string is 4, so n=4.
n2 is calculated as 4//2=2.
ans is calculated as 2*(2+1)+4%2*(2+1)=7.
The loop iterates over each character in the string.
For the first character "1", the loop continues to the next iteration.
For the second character "1", the loop continues to the next iteration.
For the third character "0", the code subtracts (rem+1)//2=0 from ans.
Since rem is even and i is even, the code subtracts 1 from ans.
rem is incremented by 1.
For the fourth character "1", the loop continues to the next iteration.
The final value of ans is 7-0-1=6.
<<<Output>>>
