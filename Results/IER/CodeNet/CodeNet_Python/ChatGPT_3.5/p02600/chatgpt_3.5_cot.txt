<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input X.
It then checks the value of X against multiple conditions using if-elif statements.
If X is between 400 and 599 (inclusive), it prints 8.
If X is between 600 and 799 (inclusive), it prints 7.
If X is between 800 and 999 (inclusive), it prints 6.
If X is between 1000 and 1199 (inclusive), it prints 5.
If X is between 1200 and 1399 (inclusive), it prints 4.
If X is between 1400 and 1599 (inclusive), it prints 3.
If X is between 1600 and 1799 (inclusive), it prints 2.
If X is between 1800 and 1999 (inclusive), it prints 1.
If none of the conditions are met, it does not print anything.
In this case, X is 725, which falls between 600 and 799, so the code will print 7.
