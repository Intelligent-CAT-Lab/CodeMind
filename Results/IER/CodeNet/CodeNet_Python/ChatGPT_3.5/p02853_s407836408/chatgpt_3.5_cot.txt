<<<Analysis>>>
The variable sknList is initialized to [300000, 200000, 100000].
The code then takes two inputs, x and y, and assigns them to the variables x and y.
The variable prize is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the prize amount.
The code then checks if x is equal to 1 and y is equal to 1. If both conditions are true, it adds 400000 to the prize.
Next, the code checks if x is less than or equal to 3. If it is, it adds the value at index x-1 of sknList to the prize.
Similarly, the code checks if y is less than or equal to 3. If it is, it adds the value at index y-1 of sknList to the prize.
Finally, the code prints the final value of prize.
In this case, x is 1 and y is 1, so both conditions are true. The code adds 400000 to the prize.
The final value of prize is 400000.
<<<Output>>>
400000
