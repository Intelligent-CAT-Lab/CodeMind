<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized to 3.
Since N is odd, the code enters the else block.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N-1, which is from 1 to 2 in this case.
Inside this loop, there is another loop that iterates from i+1 to N, which is from 2 to 3 in this case.
For each pair (i, j) generated by these nested loops, it appends the pair to the list A.
Next, there is another loop that iterates from 1 to N//2, which is from 1 to 1 in this case.
For each iteration, it appends the pair (i+1, N-i-1) to the list B.
After that, it calculates the set difference between A and B and stores it in the variable D.
The code then prints the length of D, which is 1 in this case.
Finally, it prints the elements of D, which is the pair (1, 3).
