<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by reading a string S from the input and calculating its length N.
Then, it creates a list A using the accumulate function from the itertools module. This list represents the cumulative sum of 1's and -1's, where 1 is added for each character '1' in the string S and -1 is added for each character '0'. The list A is initialized with a 0 at the beginning.
Next, it finds the maximum value in A and stores it in the variable ma. It also initializes the variable cur with the last element of A.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the elements of A in reverse order. For each element a, it updates the value of cur to be the maximum between a and cur. It also calculates the difference between ma and cur and appends it to the list C.
After that, the code initializes the variables d and e to 0 and creates two copies of A, D and E.
It then enters another loop that iterates over the characters of S and the elements of reversed(C[:-1]) simultaneously. For each pair (s, c), it checks if s is equal to '?' and if c is greater than or equal to d + 2. If both conditions are true, it increments d by 2.
It then checks if s is equal to '?' and if c is greater than or equal to e + 1. If both conditions are true, it increments e by 2.
Finally, it updates the elements of D and E by adding d to D[i] and e to E[i].
After the loop finishes, the code prints the minimum difference between the maximum and minimum values in D and E.
