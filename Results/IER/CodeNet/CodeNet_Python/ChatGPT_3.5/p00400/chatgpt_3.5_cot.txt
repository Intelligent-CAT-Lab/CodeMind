<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input and assigns it to the variable n.
It then checks if n is between 65 and 90 (inclusive), which corresponds to the ASCII values of uppercase letters. If this condition is true, it prints "1".
If the first condition is not true, the code checks if n is between 97 and 122 (inclusive), which corresponds to the ASCII values of lowercase letters. If this condition is true, it prints "2".
If both conditions are false, it means that n is not an uppercase or lowercase letter, so it prints "0".
In this case, the input is 67, which is between 65 and 90, so the first condition is true and the code prints "1".
