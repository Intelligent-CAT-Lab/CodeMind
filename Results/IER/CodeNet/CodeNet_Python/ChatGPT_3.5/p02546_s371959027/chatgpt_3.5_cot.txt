<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string S.
It checks if the last character of the string is "s".
If it is, it appends "es" to the string and assigns it to the variable ans.
If it is not, it appends "s" to the string and assigns it to the variable ans.
Finally, it prints the value of ans.
In this case, the input string is "apple" and the last character is "e", so the code will append "s" to the string and assign it to ans.
The value of ans will be "apples".
<<<Output>>>
apples
