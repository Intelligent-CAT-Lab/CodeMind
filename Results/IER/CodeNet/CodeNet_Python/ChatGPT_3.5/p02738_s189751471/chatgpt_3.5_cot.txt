<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N and variable M are initialized to 1 and 998244353, respectively.
The code defines a function mod_inv(x) which calculates the modular inverse of x with respect to M using the extended Euclidean algorithm. This function is decorated with the lru_cache decorator to cache the results and improve performance.
The code then defines two generator functions gen_Y(i) and gen_X(). These functions generate the coefficients for the polynomial terms in the expression for the answer.
The code uses the acc_mulmod function to calculate the cumulative product of the coefficients and takes the sum of these products to get the final answer.
The answer is then printed.
