<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by importing the `Counter` class from the `collections` module and initializing a list `prime` with zeros of length `M`, where `M` is set to `10**6 + 4`.
Then, it uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to populate the `prime` list with prime numbers. It iterates from 2 to `M` and for each number `i`, if `prime[i]` is already set (meaning it is not zero), it continues to the next iteration. Otherwise, it iterates from `i` to `M` with a step of `i` and sets `prime[j]` to `i` if `prime[j]` is zero.
After that, the code defines a function `pd(x)` which takes an integer `x` as input. Inside the function, it initializes a `Counter` object `C` and enters a loop that continues until `x` becomes 1. In each iteration, it adds the prime factor of `x` to the `Counter` object `C` and updates `x` by dividing it by the prime factor. Finally, it returns the `Counter` object `C`.
Next, the code reads an integer `N` from the input.
Then, it initializes a variable `ans` to 0, which will be used to accumulate the final answer.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to `N-1`. For each number `i` in this range, it calculates the prime factorization of `i` using the `pd` function and stores the result in the variable `c`.
Then, it initializes a variable `res` to 1, which will be used to calculate the number of divisors of `i`.
The code enters another loop that iterates over the values of the `Counter` object `c`. For each value `vi`, it multiplies `res` by `(1+vi)`.
Finally, it adds `res` to `ans`.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of `ans`.
