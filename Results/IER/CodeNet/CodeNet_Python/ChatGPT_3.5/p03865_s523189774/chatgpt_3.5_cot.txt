<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string `s` and calculates its length `n`.
It then checks if the first character of `s` is equal to the last character of `s`. If they are equal, it increments `n` by 1.
Finally, it prints "First" if `n` is odd (i.e., `n % 2` is True), and "Second" otherwise.

In this case, the input string is "aba".
The length of the string is 3.
The first and last characters are both "a", so `n` is incremented to 4.
Since 4 is even, the code will print "Second".

<<<Output>>>
Second
