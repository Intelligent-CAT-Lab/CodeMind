<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by importing necessary modules and defining some functions and variables.
Then, it reads the input using the `read()` function and assigns the values to variables N and M.
Next, it defines a function called `solve(N,M)` which takes two arguments N and M.
Inside the function, it checks if N is greater than M. If it is, it calls the `solve()` function again with the arguments swapped and transposes the result.
Then, it initializes a numpy array H with shape (1,1) and dtype int8.
Next, it enters a loop that iterates M times. In each iteration, it tiles the array H with shape (2,2) and XORs the bottom right quadrant with 1.
After the loop, it calculates the difference along the rows and columns of the array H.
Finally, it returns the modulo 2 of the resulting array, truncated to the first (1<<N) - 1 rows.
Outside the function, it assigns the result of `solve(N,M)` to the variable H.
Then, it initializes a variable size to 0.
Next, it enters a loop that iterates over each row in the array H.
In each iteration, it converts the elements of the row to strings and joins them together to form a word.
Finally, it prints the word.
