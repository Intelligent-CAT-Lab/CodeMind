<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string and checks if the last character of the string is 's'.
If it is, it prints the input string followed by 'es'.
If it is not, it prints the input string followed by 's'.
In this case, the input string is 'apple' and the last character is 'e', so the code will print 'apples'.
<<<Output>>>
apples
