<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes input as a string and splits it into a list of strings using the space as a delimiter. So, the input "3 5 2 7" is split into ['3', '5', '2', '7'].
The code then converts the first two elements of the list to integers and multiplies them to get the value of a1.
Similarly, it converts the last two elements of the list to integers and multiplies them to get the value of a2.
Finally, the code prints the maximum value between a1 and a2, which is 15 in this case.
<<<Output>>>
15
