<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by initializing an empty list A, which will be used to store lowercase letters from the input.
Then, it enters an infinite loop and tries to read input using the input() function.
Inside the loop, it iterates over each character s in the input string S.
If s is a lowercase or uppercase letter, it converts it to lowercase and appends it to the list A.
If an EOFError exception is raised, meaning there is no more input to read, the loop breaks.
After that, the code initializes an empty dictionary D, which will be used to count the occurrences of each letter in A.
It then iterates over each letter s in A and checks if it is already a key in D.
If it is, it increments the value associated with that key by 1.
If it is not, it adds a new key-value pair to D, with the key being s and the value being 1.
Next, the code initializes a list Str containing all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z'.
It then iterates over each letter s in Str and prints it, followed by a colon and a space.
After that, it checks if s is a key in D.
If it is, it prints the value associated with that key.
If it is not, it prints 0.
Finally, the code prints a newline character after each letter and its corresponding count.
