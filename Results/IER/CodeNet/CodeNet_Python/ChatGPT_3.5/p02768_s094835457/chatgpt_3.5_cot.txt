<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three inputs: n, a, and b. In this case, n=4, a=1, and b=3.
The code then defines a function called cmb, which calculates the combination of n choose r modulo p.
Next, the code initializes N to the value of n.
The code then initializes p to 10^9 + 7.
After that, the code calculates ans as (2^n - 1) modulo p.
Finally, the code subtracts the values of cmb(n, a, p) and cmb(n, b, p) from ans, and prints the result modulo p.
