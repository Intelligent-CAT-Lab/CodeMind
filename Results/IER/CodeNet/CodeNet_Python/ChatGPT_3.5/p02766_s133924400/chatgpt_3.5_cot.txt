<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs, n and k, and initializes a variable res to 0.
Then, it enters a while loop that continues as long as n is greater than 0.
Inside the loop, it increments the value of res by 1 and updates the value of n by performing integer division with k.
This means that in each iteration of the loop, the value of n is divided by k and the result is stored back in n.
The loop continues until n becomes 0 or less.
Finally, the code prints the value of res, which represents the number of times the loop executed.
In this case, the input is "11 2", so n is initially 11 and k is 2.
The loop will execute 4 times because the value of n becomes 0 after 4 iterations.
