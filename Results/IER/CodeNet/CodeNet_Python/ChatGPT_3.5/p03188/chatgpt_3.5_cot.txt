<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input K.
If K is less than or equal to 500, it prints K and then prints K lines of numbers from 1 to K, repeated K times.
If K is greater than 500, it calculates KUP using the formula ((K+1)//2+3)//4*4. This formula rounds up K/2, adds 3, divides by 4 and then multiplies by 4.
It then initializes a 2D list ANS with dimensions KUP x KUP, filled with zeros.
The code then enters a nested loop that iterates over the rows and columns of ANS. It assigns values to ANS based on the current row and column indices. If the row index is even, it assigns the column index + 1 to ANS. If the row index is odd, it assigns the column index + 1 + KUP to ANS.
After assigning values to ANS, the code enters another loop that iterates KUP*2-K times. In each iteration, it searches for the value KUP*2-i in ANS and replaces it with KUP*2-i-KUP.
Finally, the code prints each row of ANS.
