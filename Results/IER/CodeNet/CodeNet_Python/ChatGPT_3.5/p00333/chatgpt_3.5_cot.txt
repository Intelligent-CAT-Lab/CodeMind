<<<Analysis>>>
The code imports the gcd function from the math module.
The variables W, H, and C are initialized to 10, 20, and 5, respectively.
The code then calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of W and H using the gcd function and stores it in the variable g.
Next, it calculates the product of W, H, and C, and divides it by the square of g.
Finally, it prints the result of this calculation.
In this case, the gcd of 10 and 20 is 10, so the output will be 10*20*5/(10*10) = 100.
<<<Output>>>
100
