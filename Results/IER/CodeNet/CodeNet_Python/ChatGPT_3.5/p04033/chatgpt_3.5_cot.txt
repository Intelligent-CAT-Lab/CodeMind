<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines several lambda functions to read input values conveniently.
Then, it reads two integers a and b using the nm lambda function.
The code then checks several conditions to determine the output:
1. If a <= 0 <= b, it prints 'Zero'.
2. If b < 0, it checks if the difference between b and a plus one is odd or even.
   - If it is odd, it prints 'Negative'.
   - If it is even, it prints 'Positive'.
3. If 0 < a, it prints 'Positive'.

In this case, a = 1 and b = 3.
Since 0 < a, the code will print 'Positive'.
<<<Output>>>
Positive
