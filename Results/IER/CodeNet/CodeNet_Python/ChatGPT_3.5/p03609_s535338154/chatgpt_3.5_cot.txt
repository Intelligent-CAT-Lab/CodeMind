<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs, x and t, and assigns them to the variables x and t respectively.
Then it checks if the value of x-t is less than 0. If it is, it prints 0. Otherwise, it prints the value of x-t.
In this case, x is 100 and t is 17. So x-t is 100-17 = 83, which is not less than 0.
Therefore, the code will print the value of x-t, which is 83.
<<<Output>>>
83
