<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four inputs: h, w, s, and t. These inputs are then used in a series of conditional statements to determine the output.
First, the code checks if the product of h and w is odd. If it is, it proceeds to the next conditional statement.
Next, the code checks if the sum of s and t is odd. If it is, it prints "No". Otherwise, it prints "Yes".
If the product of h and w is not odd, the code directly prints "Yes".
In this case, h = 4, w = 5, s = 2, and t = 3. The product of h and w is 20, which is not odd. Therefore, the code will print "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
