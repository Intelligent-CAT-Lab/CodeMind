<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized to 432.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 50000 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 50000.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the value of i multiplied by 1.08 and checks if it is equal to N.
If the condition is met, it prints the value of i and exits the program.
If the loop finishes without finding a match, it prints ":(".
In this case, the loop will find a match when i is 400, because 400 * 1.08 = 432.
<<<Output>>>
400
