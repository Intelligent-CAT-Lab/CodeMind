<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines several input functions: ns(), ni(), nm(), and nl(). These functions are used to read input from the standard input.
The main() function is defined, which is the entry point of the program.
Inside the main() function, the code calls the nm() function to read two integers, n and i, from the input.
Then, it calculates n - i + 1 and prints the result.
