<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input: a, b, and t.
It then calculates the integer division of t by a, which gives the number of times a can be divided into t without remainder.
This result is then multiplied by b to get the final output.
In this case, the input values are a=3, b=5, and t=7.
The integer division of 7 by 3 is 2, and multiplying it by 5 gives the output of 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
