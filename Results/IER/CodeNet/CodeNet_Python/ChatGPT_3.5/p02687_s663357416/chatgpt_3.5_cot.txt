<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines four functions: readInt(), readInts(), readChar(), and readChars(). These functions are used to read input from the user.
The code then reads a string input from the user and stores it in the variable s.
The code checks if the value of s is equal to "ABC". If it is, it prints "ARC". Otherwise, it prints "ABC".
In this case, the value of s is "ABC", so the condition is true and the code prints "ARC".
<<<Output>>>
ARC
