<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers n and k as input.
It initializes some variables and lists, including mod, rng, fctr, and finv.
Then it defines a function cmb(n, k) to calculate the combination of n and k using the factorial and inverse factorial lists.
The code checks if (n-k)*2 is less than or equal to n. If it is, it enters a loop to calculate the answer using the cmb function and some other calculations.
If the condition is not met, it creates a defaultdict named dc and enters another loop to calculate the values of a, b, and cnt.
Then it creates a set named cp and a variable named cpp, and enters a loop to calculate the values of cpp and add them to cp.
Next, it creates a 2D list named dp and initializes its first row to 0 except for the first element, which is 1.
Then it enters a loop to calculate the values of dp based on the values of cp.
Finally, it enters a loop to calculate the final answer using the values of fctr, dp, and nn.
The code prints the final answer.
