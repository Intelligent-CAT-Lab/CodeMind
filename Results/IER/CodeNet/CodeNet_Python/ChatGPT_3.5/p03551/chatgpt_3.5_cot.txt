<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, N and M.
It calculates the value of time using the formula 1900*M + (N-M)*100.
Then it calculates the final output by multiplying time with 2 raised to the power of M.
In this case, N=1 and M=1.
So, time = 1900*1 + (1-1)*100 = 1900.
And the output = time * (2^1) = 1900 * 2 = 3800.
<<<Output>>>
3800
