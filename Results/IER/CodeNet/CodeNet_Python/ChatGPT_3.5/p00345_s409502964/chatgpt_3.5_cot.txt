<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function C() that takes no arguments. Inside the function, it defines another function gcd(a,b) that calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.
The code then reads a string input from the user and assigns it to the variable s. It also calculates the length of the string and assigns it to the variable n.
The code checks if the string contains the character '('. If it doesn't, it means the string represents a decimal number without repeating digits. In this case, the code converts the string to a float and assigns it to the variable t. It also calculates the denominator of the fraction by raising 10 to the power of (n-2), where n is the length of the string. The numerator is obtained by rounding the float t multiplied by the denominator. The code then calculates the greatest common divisor of the numerator and denominator using the gcd() function and divides both the numerator and denominator by the gcd to simplify the fraction. Finally, it prints the simplified fraction in the form "numerator/denominator".
If the string contains the character '(', it means the string represents a decimal number with repeating digits. In this case, the code finds the index of the '(' character and assigns it to the variable n. It converts the substring of the string before the '(' character to a float and assigns it to the variable t. It calculates the denominator of the non-repeating part of the fraction by raising 10 to the power of (n-2), where n is the index of the '(' character. The numerator of the non-repeating part is obtained by rounding the float t multiplied by the denominator. The code then finds the substring between the '(' and ')' characters and converts it to a float, which represents the repeating part of the decimal. It calculates the denominator of the repeating part by subtracting 1 from 10 raised to the power of the length of the repeating part. The numerator of the repeating part is obtained by rounding the float multiplied by the denominator. The code then calculates the greatest common divisor of the numerator and denominator of both the non-repeating and repeating parts using the gcd() function and divides both the numerator and denominator by the gcd to simplify the fractions. Finally, it adds the numerators and denominators of both parts and calculates the greatest common divisor of the resulting numerator and denominator using the gcd() function. It then divides both the numerator and denominator by the gcd to simplify the fraction. Finally, it prints the simplified fraction in the form "numerator/denominator".
