<<<Analysis>>>
The code first reads an integer value from the input and assigns it to the variable k.
Then it calculates the result of the expression math.ceil(k/2)*(k//2) and prints it.
The expression math.ceil(k/2) calculates the ceiling value of k divided by 2, which means it rounds up to the nearest integer.
The expression k//2 calculates the floor division of k by 2, which means it rounds down to the nearest integer.
Finally, the code multiplies these two values and prints the result.
In this case, k is 3. So math.ceil(3/2) is 2 and 3//2 is 1. Therefore, the result is 2*1 = 2.
<<<Output>>>
