<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string and initializes an empty string ss and a variable p to 0.
It then enters a loop that iterates through each character in the input string.
Inside the loop, it checks if p is 0 and the current character is "C". If both conditions are true, it sets p to 1.
If p is 1 and the current character is "F", it sets p to 2.
After the loop finishes, it checks if p is equal to 2. If it is, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
In this case, the input string is "CODEFESTIVAL". The code will go through the following steps:
- The first character is "C", so p is set to 1.
- The second character is "O", so p remains 1.
- The third character is "D", so p remains 1.
- The fourth character is "E", so p remains 1.
- The fifth character is "F", so p is set to 2.
- The loop finishes and p is equal to 2, so the code prints "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
