<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by importing the sys and collections modules, and then reads an integer n from the standard input.
Next, there is a function called koch that takes three parameters: p1, p2, and n. This function is a recursive implementation of the Koch snowflake fractal. It returns a list of points that define the Koch curve between p1 and p2, with a recursion depth of n.
The main part of the code then calls the koch function with the initial points [0.0, 0.0] and [100.0, 0.0], and the value of n read from the input. It iterates over the list of points returned by the koch function and prints each point as a string.
