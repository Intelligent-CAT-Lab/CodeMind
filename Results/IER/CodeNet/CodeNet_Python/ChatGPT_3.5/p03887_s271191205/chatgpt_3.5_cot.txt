<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by importing necessary libraries and setting some constants.
Then it reads the input values N, A, B, and C.
Next, it checks if B is odd. If it is, it prints 0 and exits the program.
The code defines a function cumprod that calculates the cumulative product of an array.
It then initializes some variables and arrays.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to C//3 (integer division of C by 3).
Inside the loop, it checks if B2 (B divided by 2) is 0. If it is, it calculates the values of a, b, and c based on the current value of m.
If a or c is negative, it continues to the next iteration of the loop.
It then calculates the value of x using the factorial and factorial inverse arrays.
The code adds x to the answer.
If B2 is not 0, it calculates the minimum value of n based on the current value of m.
It then calculates the value of x using the factorial and factorial inverse arrays.
The code calculates the value of y using the factorial and factorial inverse arrays.
It adds the product of x and y to the answer.
After the loop finishes, the code takes the modulo of the answer with MOD and prints it.
