<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines three functions: INT(), MI(), and LI(). These functions are used to read integers, multiple integers, and a list of integers from input, respectively.

The code then reads two integers N and M using the MI() function.

The code checks if 2 * N is less than or equal to M. If it is, it calculates the value of ans using the formula N + (M - 2 * N) // 4. Otherwise, it calculates the value of ans using the formula M // 2.

Finally, the code prints the value of ans.

In this case, N is 1 and M is 6. Since 2 * N (2) is less than M (6), the code calculates ans as N + (M - 2 * N) // 4, which is 1 + (6 - 2 * 1) // 4 = 1 + 4 // 4 = 1 + 1 = 2.
