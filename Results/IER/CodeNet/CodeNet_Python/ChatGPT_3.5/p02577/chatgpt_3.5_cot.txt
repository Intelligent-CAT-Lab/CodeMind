<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string `n` which is "123456789".
It initializes a variable `tmp` to 0, which will be used to store the sum of the digits modulo 9.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the length of the input string.
For each iteration, it adds the current digit to `tmp` and takes the modulo 9 of the sum.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if `tmp` is equal to 0. If it is, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
In this case, the sum of the digits of "123456789" modulo 9 is 45 % 9 = 0, so the output will be "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
