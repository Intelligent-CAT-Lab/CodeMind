The variable MOD is initialized to 10^9 + 7.
The variables N and M are initialized to 2 and 6, respectively.
The code then initializes an empty list f, which will be used to store the prime factors of M.
The code enters a while loop that continues until p * p is greater than M.
Inside the loop, it checks if M is divisible by p. If it is not, it increments p by 1 and continues to the next iteration.
If M is divisible by p, it counts the number of times p divides M and stores it in the variable c. It then appends c to the list f.
After that, it divides M by p and increments p by 1.
If M is not equal to 1 after the loop, it means that M is a prime number and it appends 1 to the list f.
The code then initializes the variable ans to 1, which will be used to accumulate the final result.
It enters a for loop that iterates over the elements in the list f.
For each element i in f, it initializes the variable c to 1.
It enters another for loop that iterates from 0 to i-1 (inclusive).
Inside this loop, it calculates the value of c by multiplying c with (N + j) and dividing it by (j + 1).
After the inner loop finishes, it multiplies ans by c modulo MOD and assigns the result back to ans.
Finally, it prints the value of ans.
