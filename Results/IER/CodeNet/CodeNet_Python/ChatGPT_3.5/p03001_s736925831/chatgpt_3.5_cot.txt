<<<Analysis>>>
The code imports the sys module and defines three functions: read, readline, and readlines. These functions are used to read input from the standard input.
The code then reads four integers from the input: w, h, x, and y.
Next, the code calculates the area of the rectangle by multiplying w and h and dividing the result by 2. This value is stored in the variable ans.
The code then checks if x is equal to w/2 and y is equal to h/2. If this condition is true, it prints the value of ans followed by the string '1'. Otherwise, it prints the value of ans followed by the string '0'.
In this case, w=2, h=3, x=1, and y=2. The condition x == w/2 and y == h/2 is not true, so the code will print '3.0 0'.
<<<Output>>>
3.0 0
