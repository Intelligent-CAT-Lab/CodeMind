<<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module and assigns the readline function from sys.stdin to the input variable. This allows the code to read input from the standard input.

The code then initializes some variables and lists. MOD is set to 998244353, U is set to 10000, and two lists, fact and fact_inv, are initialized with 1s.

Next, there is a loop that iterates from 1 to U (inclusive). In each iteration, it calculates the factorial of the current number and stores it in the fact list. It also calculates the modular inverse of the factorial and stores it in the fact_inv list.

After that, there is another loop that iterates from U to 0 (inclusive) in reverse order. In each iteration, it calculates the modular inverse of the factorial and stores it in the fact_inv list.

The code then defines a function called comb, which calculates the binomial coefficient using the factorial and factorial inverse lists.

Next, the code reads two integers, K and N, from the input.

After that, there is a function called F, which takes three parameters: x, y, and N. It calculates a sum using the comb function and some other calculations.

The code then initializes an empty list called answer.

Next, there is a loop that iterates from 3 to K+3 (inclusive) with a step size of 2. In each iteration, it calls the F function with some parameters, calculates a value, and appends it to the answer list twice.

After the loop, there is an if statement that checks if K is odd. If it is, it modifies the answer list by removing the last element and adding the reverse of the sublist from the beginning to the second-to-last element.

Finally, the code prints the elements of the answer list, separated by newlines.
