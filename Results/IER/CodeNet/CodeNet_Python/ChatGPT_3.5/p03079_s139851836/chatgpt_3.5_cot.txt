<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers A, B, and C as input and assigns them to the variables A, B, and C respectively.
Then it checks if A is equal to B and B is equal to C. In this case, all three variables are equal to 2, so the condition is true.
If the condition is true, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
In this case, the condition is true, so the output will be "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
