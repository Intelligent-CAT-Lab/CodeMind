<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes input in the form of two space-separated integers, which are assigned to variables a and b.
Then, it converts the values of a and b to integers using the int() function.
Finally, it adds the values of a and b and prints the result.
In this case, a is 5 and b is 8, so the sum of a and b is 13.
<<<Output>>>
13
