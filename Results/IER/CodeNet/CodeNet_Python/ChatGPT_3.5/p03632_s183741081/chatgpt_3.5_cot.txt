<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four integers as input and assigns them to variables a, b, c, and d.
It then calculates the maximum value between the minimum of b and d and the maximum of a and c.
If the result is negative, it is replaced with 0.
Finally, the code prints the result.
In this case, the minimum of b and d is 75, and the maximum of a and c is 25.
So the result is max(75-25, 0) = max(50, 0) = 50.
<<<Output>>>
50
