<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string and checks if the character "9" is present in the string. If it is, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".
In this case, the input string is "29". The code checks if "9" is present in "29", which is true. Therefore, the output will be "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
