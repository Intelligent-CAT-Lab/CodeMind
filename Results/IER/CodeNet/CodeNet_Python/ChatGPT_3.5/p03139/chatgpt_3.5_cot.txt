<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three inputs: N, A, and B. In this case, N=10, A=3, and B=5.
The code then prints the minimum of A and B, which is 3.
Next, it calculates the value of A+B-N and takes the maximum of this value and 0.
In this case, A+B-N = 3+5-10 = -2. Since -2 is less than 0, the maximum value is 0.
Therefore, the output of the code is 0.
