<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input and assigns them to variables R1 and R2.
Then it calculates the product of R1 and R2 and divides it by the sum of R1 and R2.
Finally, it prints the result of this calculation.
In this case, the input is "2 3", so R1 is assigned the value 2 and R2 is assigned the value 3.
The calculation is (2*3)/(2+3) = 6/5 = 1.2.
Therefore, the output of the code execution would be 1.2.
<<<Output>>>
1.2
