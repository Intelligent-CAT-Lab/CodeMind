<<<Analysis>>>
The code first defines two functions, rd() and rdi(), which are used to read input from the standard input. rd() reads a line and removes any trailing whitespace, while rdi() reads a line and splits it into a list of integers.

The code then reads two integers, N and K, using the rdi() function.

Next, the code initializes a variable s to 0, which will be used to accumulate the final result.

The code then enters a loop that iterates from K+1 to N+1 (inclusive), with the loop variable being b. This loop will consider values of b from K+1 to N.

For each value of b, the code calculates the value of an. It first calculates j, which is the integer division of N by b. Then, it multiplies j by (b - K) and assigns the result to an.

The code then checks if N is divisible by b. If it is, it calculates the values of x1 and x2. x1 is equal to j * b + K, and x2 is equal to the minimum of N and (j+1) * b - 1. These values represent the range of numbers that are divisible by b and are within the range [x1, x2].

If x2 is greater than or equal to x1, the code adds (x2 - x1 + 1) to an. This accounts for the numbers in the range [x1, x2] that are divisible by b.

Finally, the code adds the value of an to s.

After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of s.
