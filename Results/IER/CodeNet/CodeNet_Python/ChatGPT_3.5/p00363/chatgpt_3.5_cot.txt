<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three inputs: w, h, and c. These inputs are split by a space and assigned to the variables w, h, and c respectively. Then, w and h are converted to integers.
The code then prints a line consisting of a "+" followed by "-" repeated w-2 times, and then another "+".
Next, there is a loop that iterates from 0 to h-3 (inclusive). For each iteration, it checks if i*2 is equal to h-3. If it is, it prints a line consisting of a "|" followed by "." repeated (w-3)//2 times, then the character c, then "." repeated (w-3)//2 times, and finally a "|". Otherwise, it prints a line consisting of a "|" followed by "." repeated w-2 times, and then a "|".
Finally, the code prints a line consisting of a "+" followed by "-" repeated w-2 times, and then another "+".
