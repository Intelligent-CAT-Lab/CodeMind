<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input sentence and splits it into individual words using the split() function.
It initializes two variables, max_f and freq_w, to keep track of the maximum frequency of a word and the word with the maximum frequency, respectively.
It also initializes two variables, max_len and len_w, to keep track of the maximum length of a word and the word with the maximum length, respectively.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each word in the list of words.
For each word, it checks if the frequency of that word is greater than the current maximum frequency (max_f). If it is, it updates the max_f and freq_w variables with the new maximum frequency and the corresponding word.
Similarly, it checks if the length of the current word is greater than the current maximum length (max_len). If it is, it updates the max_len and len_w variables with the new maximum length and the corresponding word.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the values of freq_w and len_w using the print statement.
In this case, the word "your" has the maximum frequency of 2, and the word "lectures" has the maximum length of 8.
