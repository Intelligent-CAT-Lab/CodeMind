<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an input from the user, which is expected to be a string representing a day of the week.
It then uses the index() method to find the index of the input string in the list ['SUN','MON', 'TUE', 'WED', 'THU', 'FRI', 'SAT'].
The result of the index() method is subtracted from 7, and the final result is printed.
In this case, the input is 'SAT', which has an index of 6 in the list. Therefore, the output will be 7 - 6 = 1.
