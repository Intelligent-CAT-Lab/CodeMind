<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes 5 inputs: A, B, C, X, and Y.
It then calculates the cost of buying items individually (v1) by multiplying the price of A with X and the price of B with Y.
Next, it calculates the cost of buying items in sets (v2) by comparing the values of X and Y.
If X is greater than or equal to Y, it calculates the cost of buying C sets of 2Y items and the remaining X-Y items of A.
If Y is greater than X, it calculates the cost of buying C sets of 2X items and the remaining Y-X items of B.
Finally, it calculates the cost of buying all items in sets (v3) by taking the maximum value between X and Y and multiplying it by 2C.
The code then prints the minimum value among v1, v2, and v3.
In this case, the output would be 7900.
