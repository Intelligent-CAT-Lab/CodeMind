<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two inputs, a and b, from the standard input. In this case, a is 1 and b is 21.
It concatenates a and b to form a string '121' and converts it to an integer n.
It then calculates the square root of n and stores it in sqrtn.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to sqrtn (inclusive).
For each iteration, it checks if i*i is equal to n. If it is, it prints 'Yes' and breaks out of the loop.
If the loop completes without finding a match, it prints 'No'.
In this case, the loop does not find a match and the code prints 'No'.
<<<Output>>>
No
