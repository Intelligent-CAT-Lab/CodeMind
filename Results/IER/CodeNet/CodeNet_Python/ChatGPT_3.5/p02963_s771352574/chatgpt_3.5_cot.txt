<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by initializing a list called sosu with the value [2] and a variable called now with the value 3.
Then, it enters a while loop that continues until the square of now is greater than or equal to 10^9.
Inside the while loop, there is a for loop that iterates over the elements in sosu.
For each element i in sosu, the code checks if now is divisible by i. If it is, the flag variable is set to False and the loop breaks.
If the flag variable is still True after the for loop, it means that now is not divisible by any element in sosu and it is a prime number. In this case, now is appended to sosu.
After the for loop, now is incremented by 1.
The code then inserts the value 1 at the beginning of sosu.
Next, the code reads an integer S from the input.
A list called lis is initialized as an empty list.
A variable called r is set to the square root of S.
Variables st1 and st2 are set to r.
A variable called mode is set to 0.
The code enters a while loop that continues indefinitely until a break statement is encountered.
Inside the while loop, there is an if statement that checks if the product of st1 and st2 minus S is greater than or equal to 0.
If the condition is true, the code calculates the value of cd as the product of st1 and st2 minus S.
Then, there is a for loop that iterates over the elements in sosu.
For each element i in sosu, the code checks if cd is divisible by i and if cd divided by i is less than or equal to 10^9 and if st1 and st2 are both less than or equal to 10^9.
If all these conditions are true, the code prints the values 0, 0, st1, cd divided by i, i, and st2. It also sets the flag variable to True and breaks the loop.
If the flag variable is True, the code breaks the while loop.
If st2 is equal to 10^9 and st1 is equal to 10^9, the code sets mode to 1 and st1 to 10^9 and st2 to r.
If mode is equal to 1 and the product of st1 and st2 is less than S, the code decrements st1 by 1 and sets st2 to r.
If mode is equal to 1, the code decrements st2 by 1.
If st1 is greater than or equal to 10^9, the code increments st2 by 1 and sets st1 to r.
Otherwise, the code increments st1 by 1.
