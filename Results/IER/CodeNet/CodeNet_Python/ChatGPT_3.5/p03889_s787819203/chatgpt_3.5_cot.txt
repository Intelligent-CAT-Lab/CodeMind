<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string and stores it in the variable s.
It then creates a reversed version of the input string and stores it in the variable sr.
The variable t is calculated as the floor division of the length of s by 2.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to t (inclusive).
For each iteration, it checks if the current characters at index i in s and sr satisfy any of the following conditions:
- s[i] is "b" and sr[i] is "d"
- s[i] is "d" and sr[i] is "b"
- s[i] is "p" and sr[i] is "q"
- s[i] is "q" and sr[i] is "p"
If none of these conditions are satisfied, it prints "No" and breaks out of the loop.
If the loop completes without breaking, it means that all characters in s and sr satisfy the conditions, so it prints "Yes".
In this case, the input string is "pdbq".
The first character in s is "p" and the last character in sr is "p", so the first condition is satisfied.
The second character in s is "d" and the second last character in sr is "d", so the second condition is satisfied.
The third character in s is "b" and the third last character in sr is "b", so the third condition is satisfied.
The fourth character in s is "q" and the fourth last character in sr is "q", so the fourth condition is satisfied.
Since all conditions are satisfied, the code prints "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
