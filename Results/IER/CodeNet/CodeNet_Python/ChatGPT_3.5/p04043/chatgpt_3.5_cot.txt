<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input and assigns them to variables a, b, and c.
It then creates a list containing the values of a, b, and c, and sorts it in ascending order.
The sorted list is then compared to the list [5, 5, 7].
If the two lists are equal, meaning that a, b, and c are all equal to 5, 5, and 7 respectively, the code prints "YES".
Otherwise, it prints "NO".
In this case, the input is "5 5 7", which means that a=5, b=5, and c=7.
The sorted list of [a, b, c] is [5, 5, 7], which is equal to [5, 5, 7].
Therefore, the code will print "YES".
<<<Output>>>
YES
