<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n, variable a and variable b are initialized to 5, 2 and 4, respectively.
The code calculates the difference between b and a and stores it in the variable diff. In this case, diff is 2.
The code then checks if diff is divisible by 2. Since 2 is divisible by 2, the code enters the first if statement and prints diff divided by 2, which is 1.
Therefore, the output of the code execution is 1.
