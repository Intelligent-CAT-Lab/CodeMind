<<<Analysis>>>
The code imports the `stdin` module from the `sys` library.
It then reads a line of input from the user and splits it into two integers, `n` and `m`.
The code then checks if `(n+1)/2` is greater than or equal to `m`.
If the condition is true, it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".
In this case, `n` is 3 and `m` is 2.
`(n+1)/2` is equal to 2, which is equal to `m`.
Therefore, the condition is true and the code will print "YES".
<<<Output>>>
YES
