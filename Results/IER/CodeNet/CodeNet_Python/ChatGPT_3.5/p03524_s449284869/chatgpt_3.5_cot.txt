<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string and counts the occurrences of the characters 'a', 'b', and 'c' in the string.
It stores the counts in variables a, b, and c, respectively.
Then, it checks if the absolute difference between the counts of any two characters is less than or equal to 1.
If this condition is true for all three pairs of characters, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
In this case, the input string is 'abac'.
The count of 'a' is 2, the count of 'b' is 1, and the count of 'c' is 1.
The absolute differences between the counts are:
- abs(a-b) = abs(2-1) = 1
- abs(b-c) = abs(1-1) = 0
- abs(c-a) = abs(1-2) = 1
All three differences are less than or equal to 1, so the condition is true.
Therefore, the code will print 'YES'.
<<<Output>>>
