<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string from the input and stores it in the variable `string`.
It then checks if `string` is equal to "ARC". If it is, it prints "ABC". Otherwise, it prints "ARC".
In this case, the input is "ABC", which is not equal to "ARC". Therefore, the code will print "ARC".
<<<Output>>>
ARC
