<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three inputs A, B, and T and assigns them to the variables A, B, and T respectively.
Then it calculates the integer division of T by A and multiplies the result by B.
Finally, it prints the result of the multiplication.
In this case, T//A is equal to 7//3 which is 2, and 2 multiplied by B (which is 5) gives the final result of 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
