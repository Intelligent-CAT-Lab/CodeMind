<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three inputs a, b, and c and initializes the variable ans to 0.
Then, it enters a loop that iterates from a to b (inclusive).
For each iteration, it checks if c is divisible by i (i.e., c % i == 0). If it is, it increments ans by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans.
In this case, the code will iterate from 5 to 14 and check if 80 is divisible by each number. The numbers that divide 80 are 5, 8, 10, and 16. So, the final value of ans will be 4.
<<<Output>>>
4
