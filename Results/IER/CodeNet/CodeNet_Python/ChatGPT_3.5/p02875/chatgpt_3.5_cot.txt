<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized to 2.
The code then initializes variables nn and P to N+10 and 998244353, respectively.
It also initializes two lists, fa and fainv, with all elements set to 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to nn-1. In each iteration, it calculates the factorial of the current number and stores it in the corresponding index of fa.
After the loop, the code calculates the modular inverse of the last element of fa and stores it in the last index of fainv.
Then, it enters another loop that iterates from nn-1 to 0 (in reverse order). In each iteration, it calculates the modular inverse of the current number and stores it in the corresponding index of fainv.
The code defines a lambda function C that calculates the binomial coefficient using the factorial and modular inverse values stored in fa and fainv.
Next, it initializes the variable ans to the result of 3 raised to the power of N modulo P.
Finally, it enters a loop that iterates from N//2 + 1 to N+1. In each iteration, it subtracts 2 times the binomial coefficient C(N, i) multiplied by 2 raised to the power of N-i modulo P from ans.
After the loop, it prints the final value of ans.
