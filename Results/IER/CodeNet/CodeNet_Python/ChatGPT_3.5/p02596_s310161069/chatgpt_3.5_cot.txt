<<<Analysis>>>
The variable K is initialized to 101.
The variable A is calculated as 7%K, which is 7 in this case.
The variable Flag is initialized to False.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to K (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 101.
For each number T in this range, it checks if A is equal to 0. If it is, it sets Flag to True and breaks out of the loop.
If A is not equal to 0, it updates A to (10*A+7)%K.
After the loop finishes, the code prints either '-1' or T based on the value of Flag. If Flag is True, it prints T. Otherwise, it prints '-1'.
In this case, since A is not equal to 0 for any value of T, the code will print '-1'.
<<<Output>>>
-1
