<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes input in the form of two integers, a and b, separated by a space.
It then uses the divmod() function to calculate the quotient and remainder when a is divided by b.
Next, it calculates the floating-point division of a by b and stores it in the variable f.
Finally, it prints the values of d (quotient), r (remainder), and f (floating-point division) in the specified format.
In this case, a is 3 and b is 2.
The divmod() function returns (1, 1), indicating that 3 divided by 2 is 1 with a remainder of 1.
The floating-point division of 3 by 2 is 1.5.
Therefore, the output of the code execution will be:
1 1 1.50000
<<<Output>>>
1 1 1.50000
