<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called SumOfDigits that takes an integer n as input and calculates the sum of its digits. It initializes a variable sum to 0 and enters a while loop that continues until n becomes 0. In each iteration, it adds the last digit of n to sum and updates n by removing the last digit. Finally, it returns the value of sum.

The code then reads three integers n, a, and b from input and initializes a variable sum to 0. It enters a for loop that iterates from 0 to n (inclusive). For each iteration, it calls the SumOfDigits function with the current value of i and stores the result in a variable add. It then checks if add is within the range [a, b] (inclusive). If it is, it adds the current value of i to sum.

After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum.

In this case, the input values are n=20, a=2, and b=5. The code will iterate from 0 to 20 and calculate the sum of digits for each number. It will add the numbers whose sum of digits is within the range [2, 5] to the variable sum. Finally, it will print the value of sum.
