<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string and assigns it to the variable s.
It then checks if the string s is equal to its reverse, s[::-1].
If the condition is true, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
In this case, the input string is "575", which is a palindrome because it reads the same forwards and backwards.
Therefore, the condition is true and the code will output "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
