<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function `judge()` that checks if there exists an integer `i` such that `i**2` is equal to the value of `x`. The function iterates from 0 to 10000 and checks if the square of each number is equal to `x`. If such a number is found, the function returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.

In the `main()` function, the code reads two inputs `a` and `b` and concatenates them to form a new integer `x`. In this case, `a` is "1" and `b` is "21", so `x` becomes 121.

The code then calls the `judge()` function and checks its return value. If the return value is `True`, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".

<<<Output>>>
No
