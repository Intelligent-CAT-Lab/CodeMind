<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input N and checks if N is a power of 2. If it is, it prints "No". Otherwise, it prints "Yes" and performs some calculations and prints some values based on the value of N.

In this case, N is 3. Since 3 is not a power of 2, the code will print "Yes". It then enters the else block and performs the following steps:

1. It calculates the value of k as N//2, which is 1.
2. It enters a loop that iterates from 1 to k+1, which is 2.
3. For each iteration, it prints four lines of output:
   - The first line prints 2*i and 2*i+1.
   - The second line prints 2*i+1 and 1.
   - The third line prints 1 and 2*i+N.
   - The fourth line prints 2*i+N and 2*i+1+N.
4. After the loop finishes, it prints the line 1+N and 2.

So the output of the code execution will be:
Yes
2 3
3 1
1 5
5 4
4 2

[Output]
Yes
2 3
3 1
1 5
5 4
4 2
