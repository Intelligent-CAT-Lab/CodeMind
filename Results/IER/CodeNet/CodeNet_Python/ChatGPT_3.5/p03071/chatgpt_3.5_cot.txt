<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers A and B as input and stores them in variables A and B, respectively.
Then, it creates a list with three elements: A+B, 2*A-1, and 2*B-1.
Finally, it prints the maximum value from the list.
In this case, A=5 and B=3, so the list becomes [8, 9, 5].
The maximum value in the list is 9.
<<<Output>>>
9
