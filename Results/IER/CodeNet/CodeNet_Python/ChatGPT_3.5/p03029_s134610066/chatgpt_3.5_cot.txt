<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, `a` and `p`, using the `map` function and `input().split()`. The values of `a` and `p` are then assigned to the variables `a` and `p` respectively.
The code then calculates `piece` by adding `p` and `3*a`.
Finally, the code prints the floor division of `piece` by 2 using the `floor` function from the `math` module.
In this case, `a` is 1 and `p` is 3. So, `piece` will be 3 + 3*1 = 6.
The floor division of 6 by 2 is 3.
<<<Output>>>
3
