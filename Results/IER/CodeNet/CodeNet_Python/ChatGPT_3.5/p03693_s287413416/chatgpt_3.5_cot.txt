<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input: r, g, and b.
It then calculates the answer by multiplying r by 100, g by 10, and adding b to the result.
Next, it checks if the answer is divisible by 4 using the modulo operator (%). If the answer is divisible by 4, it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".
In this case, the answer is 432, which is not divisible by 4.
<<<Output>>>
NO
