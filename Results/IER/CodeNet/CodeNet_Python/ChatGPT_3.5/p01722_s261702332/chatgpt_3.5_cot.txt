<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input and assigns it to the variable n.
It then checks the value of n using if-elif-else statements.
If n is equal to 0, it prints 1.
If n is equal to 1, it prints 2.
If n is equal to 2, it prints 1.
If none of the above conditions are met, it prints 0.
In this case, n is equal to 0, so the code will print 1.
<<<Output>>>
