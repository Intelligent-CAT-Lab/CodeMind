<<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the Decimal module from the decimal library.
Then it takes an integer input and assigns it to the variable N.
The code then calculates the value of N multiplied by (N-1)/2 using Decimal arithmetic.
Finally, it converts the result to an integer and prints it.
In this case, since N is 2, the calculation would be 2 * (2-1)/2 = 1.
Therefore, the output would be 1.
