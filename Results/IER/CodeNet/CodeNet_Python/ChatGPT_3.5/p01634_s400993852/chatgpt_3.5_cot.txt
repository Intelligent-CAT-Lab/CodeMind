<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string and checks if it meets certain conditions to be considered a valid password.
First, it checks if the length of the input string is greater than or equal to 6. If it is not, it immediately prints "INVALID" and exits.
If the length is 6 or greater, it proceeds to the next condition.
It uses the re.findall() function to check if the input string contains at least one digit. If it does not, it prints "INVALID" and exits.
If the input string contains at least one digit, it proceeds to the next condition.
It uses the re.findall() function again to check if the input string contains at least one uppercase letter. If it does not, it prints "INVALID" and exits.
If the input string contains at least one uppercase letter, it proceeds to the next condition.
It uses the re.findall() function once more to check if the input string contains at least one lowercase letter. If it does not, it prints "INVALID" and exits.
If the input string contains at least one lowercase letter, it finally prints "VALID".
<<<Output>>>
INVALID
