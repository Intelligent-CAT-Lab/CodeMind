<<<Analysis>>>
The code first reads a string S from the input and calculates its length L.
Then it initializes a binary indexed tree (BIT) with L+1 elements, all set to 0.
The code defines two functions: query_sum(i) and add(i, x), which are used to calculate the prefix sum and update the BIT, respectively.
Next, the code creates a dictionary A to store the indices of each character in the string S.
It also initializes a variable odd to keep track of the number of characters with odd frequency.
The code then iterates over the items in A and checks if the length of the list of indices is odd.
If it is, it increments the variable odd.
After checking all characters, if the value of odd is greater than 1, the code prints -1 and exits.
Otherwise, it proceeds to create a list make_ind to store the indices of characters that need to be rearranged.
For each character in A, if the length of its list of indices is odd, it calculates the middle index and adds it to make_ind.
Then, for each index in the list of indices, if the index is less than the middle index, it adds it to make_ind.
The code sorts make_ind in ascending order.
Next, it creates a list IND of length L, initialized with None.
For each index i and value m in the enumerated make_ind list, it assigns the value i+1 to IND[m].
It also finds the corresponding index inv for each index m in make_ind and assigns the value L-i to IND[inv].
Then, it updates the dictionary dic to keep track of the number of times each character has been used.
If the length of the string S is odd, it assigns the middle index to IND[mid].
Next, the code initializes a variable ans to 0.
It iterates over the indices j and values a in the enumerated IND list.
For each value a, it calculates the difference between j and the prefix sum up to index a using the query_sum function.
It adds this difference to ans and updates the BIT by adding 1 to index a using the add function.
Finally, it prints the value of ans.
