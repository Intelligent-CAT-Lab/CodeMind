<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n, variable a and variable b are initialized to 4, 2 and 9, respectively.
The code then calculates the value of ans using a conditional expression.
If the product of n and a is greater than b, ans is assigned the value of b.
Otherwise, ans is assigned the value of n * a.
In this case, n * a is 8, which is not greater than b.
Therefore, ans is assigned the value of n * a, which is 8.
Finally, the code prints the value of ans, which is 8.
<<<Output>>>
8
