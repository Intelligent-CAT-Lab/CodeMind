<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input: a, b, and c.
It initializes a variable t to 0, which will be used to keep track of time.
The code then enters a loop that iterates 61 times, representing 61 minutes.
Inside the loop, it checks if the remainder of t divided by 60 is within the range [c, c+a]. If it is, it prints the current value of t divided by 60 multiplied by 60 plus c, which represents the time in minutes.
If the condition is not met for any of the 61 minutes, the code prints -1.
In this case, a = 10, b = 10, and c = 5.
The code checks if the remainder of t divided by 60 is within the range [5, 15] for each minute.
At minute 5, the condition is met and the code prints 5.
<<<Output>>>
5
