<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to the input value, which is 3 in this case.
The variable a is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 3.
For each number i in this range, it adds i to the current value of a.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of a, which is 6.
<<<Output>>>
6
