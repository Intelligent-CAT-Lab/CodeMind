<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines several functions: getInv, getCmb, and solve. 

The getInv function calculates the inverse of each number from 1 to N using the modulo operator. It initializes a list called inv with zeros and sets inv[1] to 1. Then, it iterates from 2 to N and calculates the inverse of each number using the formula inv[i] = (-(MOD // i) * inv[MOD % i]) % MOD. The inverse is stored in the inv list.

The getCmb function uses the getInv function to calculate the binomial coefficient for each number from 0 to N. It initializes a list called nCr with zeros and sets nCr[0] to 1. Then, it iterates from 1 to N and calculates the binomial coefficient using the formula nCr[i] = (nCr[i - 1] * (N - i + 1) * inv[i]) % MOD. The binomial coefficient is stored in the nCr list.

The solve function takes four parameters: N, A, B, and K. It initializes a variable called ans to 0. Then, it calculates the binomial coefficient using the getCmb function. It iterates from 0 to N and calculates the value of b using the formula b = (K - A * a) // B. If the condition (A * a + B * b == K) and (0 <= b <= N) is satisfied, it adds the product of nCr[a] and nCr[b] to ans. Finally, it returns ans.

In the main part of the code, it reads four integers from input and assigns them to the variables N, A, B, and K. Then, it calls the solve function with these variables as arguments and prints the result.

In this case, N = 4, A = 1, B = 2, and K = 5. The solve function will be called with these values. The getCmb function will calculate the binomial coefficient for each number from 0 to 4. The solve function will iterate from 0 to 4 and check if the condition (A * a + B * b == K) and (0 <= b <= N) is satisfied for each value of a. The condition is satisfied when a = 1 and b = 2. The product of nCr[1] and nCr[2] will be added to ans. Finally, ans will be printed.
