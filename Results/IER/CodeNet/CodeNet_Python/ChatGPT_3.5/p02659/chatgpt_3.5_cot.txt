<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by importing necessary modules and setting up some constants and functions.
Then, it defines a function called `main` which is the entry point of the program.
Inside the `main` function, it reads two inputs A and B using `input().split()`.
Then, it multiplies A and B using the `Decimal` class from the `decimal` module and converts the result to an integer using the `int` function.
Finally, it prints the result.
The input given is "198 1.10", so A will be "198" and B will be "1.10".
The code will multiply A and B, which is equivalent to multiplying 198 and 1.10, resulting in 217.8.
Then, it converts 217.8 to an integer, which will be 217.
<<<Output>>>
217
