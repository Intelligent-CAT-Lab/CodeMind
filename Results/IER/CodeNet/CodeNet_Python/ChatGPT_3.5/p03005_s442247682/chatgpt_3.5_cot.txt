<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs, x and y, and assigns them to variables N and K, respectively.
In this case, x is "3" and y is "2".
N is then converted to an integer, so N becomes 3.
K is also converted to an integer, so K becomes 2.
The code then checks if K is equal to 1. Since K is 2, the condition is not met.
Therefore, the code executes the else block and prints the value of N-K, which is 3-2 = 1.
