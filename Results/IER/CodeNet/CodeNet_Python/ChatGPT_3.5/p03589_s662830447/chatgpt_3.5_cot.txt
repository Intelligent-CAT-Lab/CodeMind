<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input N and initializes two nested loops. The outer loop iterates from 1 to 2*N (inclusive) and the inner loop iterates from 1 to N (inclusive).
Inside the inner loop, the code calculates the value of h using the formula h = w*n*N // (4*w*n-(n+w)*N). If an exception occurs during this calculation, the code continues to the next iteration of the inner loop.
The code then checks if h is greater than 0 and if the equation h*(4*w*n-(n+w)*N) - w*n*N equals 0. If both conditions are true, it prints the values of h, n, and w and exits the program using sys.exit().
Since the code exits after printing the first set of values that meet the conditions, it will only print one set of values.
