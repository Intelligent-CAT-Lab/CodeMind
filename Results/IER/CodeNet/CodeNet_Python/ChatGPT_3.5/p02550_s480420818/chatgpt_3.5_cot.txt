<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes three inputs: N, X, and M. In this case, N = 6, X = 2, and M = 1001.
Then, it calculates the value of H, which is the smallest integer greater than or equal to log2(N) + 1. In this case, H = 4.
The code initializes two 2D arrays, nxt and dp, with dimensions H x M. The initial values of nxt and dp are set based on the formula given in the code.
Next, the code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to H-1. For each iteration, it updates the values of nxt and dp based on the previous values.
After the loop, the code initializes two variables, ans and r. ans is set to 0 and r is set to X % M.
Then, the code enters another loop that iterates from 0 to H-1. For each iteration, it checks if the i-th bit of N is 1 using the bitwise AND operator. If it is, it adds the value of dp[i][r] to ans and updates the value of r to nxt[i][r].
Finally, the code prints the value of ans, which is the final result.
