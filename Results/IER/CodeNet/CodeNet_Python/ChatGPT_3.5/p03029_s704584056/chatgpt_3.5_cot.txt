<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input and assigns them to variables a and b.
It then multiplies the value of a by 3 and assigns it to variable c.
Next, it adds the value of b to c and assigns the result to variable d.
Then, it performs integer division of d by 2 and assigns the result to variable e.
Finally, it prints the value of e.
In this case, a=1 and b=3.
So, c = 1*3 = 3
d = 3+3 = 6
e = 6//2 = 3
Therefore, the output will be 3.
