<<<Analysis>>>
The code first reads two integers H and W from the input, which are 4 and 5 in this case.
Then it checks if either H or W is equal to 1. If either of them is 1, it means that the grid has only one row or one column, and in that case, the output should be 1. So, the code prints 1 and exits.
If neither H nor W is 1, it means that the grid has more than one row and one column. In that case, the code calculates the area of the grid by multiplying H and W, and adds 1 to it. Then it divides the result by 2 and takes the integer part. This is done to round down the result if it is a decimal number. The final result is stored in the variable ans.
Finally, the code prints the value of ans, which is 11 in this case.
<<<Output>>>
11
