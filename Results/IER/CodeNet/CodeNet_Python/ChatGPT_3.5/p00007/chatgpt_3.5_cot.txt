<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by initializing the variable ans to 100000.
Then, it enters a loop that iterates for the number of times specified by the input, which is 5 in this case.
Inside the loop, it multiplies the value of ans by 1.05, effectively increasing it by 5%.
Next, it checks if ans is not divisible by 1000 (ans % 1000 != 0). If this condition is true, it adds the difference between 1000 and the remainder of ans divided by 1000 to ans. This ensures that ans is always a multiple of 1000.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is converted to an integer using the int() function.
<<<Output>>>
105000
