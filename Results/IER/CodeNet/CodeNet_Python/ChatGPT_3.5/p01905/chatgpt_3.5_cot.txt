<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized to 2 and the variable M is initialized to 0.
The code then creates an empty list called a.
The code enters a loop that iterates M times. Since M is 0, the loop is not executed and the list a remains empty.
The code then calculates the value of num by subtracting M from N. In this case, num is equal to 2.
The variable ans is initialized to 0.
The code enters a while loop that continues as long as num is not equal to 0.
Inside the while loop, ans is incremented by 1 and num is decremented by 1.
Since num is initially 2, the while loop runs twice and ans becomes 2.
Finally, the code prints the value of ans minus 1, which is 1.
