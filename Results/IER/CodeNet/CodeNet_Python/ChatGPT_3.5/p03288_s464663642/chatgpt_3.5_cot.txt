<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input and assigns it to the variable n.
Then it uses a conditional expression to determine the output string based on the value of n.
If n is less than 1200, it prints "ABC".
If n is between 1200 and 2799 (inclusive), it prints "ARC".
Otherwise, it prints "AGC".
In this case, the value of n is 1199, so the code will print "ABC".
<<<Output>>>
ABC
