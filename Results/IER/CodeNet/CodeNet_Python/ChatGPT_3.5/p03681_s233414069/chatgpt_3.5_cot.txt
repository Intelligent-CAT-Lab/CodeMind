<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers n and m as input.
It initializes the variable mod to 10^9 + 7.
Then it checks if n is equal to m. If they are equal, it calculates the result as 2 times the factorial of n times the factorial of m, and stores it in the variable res.
If the absolute difference between n and m is 1, it calculates the result as the factorial of n times the factorial of m, and stores it in the variable res.
If neither of the above conditions are met, it prints 0.
In this case, n is equal to m, so the code calculates the result as 2 times the factorial of 2 times the factorial of 2, which is 2 * 2 * 1 = 4.
The code then prints the result modulo mod, which is 4 % (10^9 + 7) = 4.
<<<Output>>>
