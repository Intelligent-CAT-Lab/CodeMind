<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes input as a list of 12 integers and stores it in the variable lst.
Then it sorts the list in ascending order.
Next, it checks if the first element of the sorted list is equal to the fourth element, and if the fifth element is equal to the eighth element, and if the ninth element is equal to the twelfth element.
If all these conditions are true, it prints "yes". Otherwise, it prints "no".
In this case, the first element of the sorted list is 1, the fourth element is 4, the eighth element is 5, and the twelfth element is 5. So the conditions are met and the output will be "yes".
<<<Output>>>
yes
