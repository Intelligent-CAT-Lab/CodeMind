<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 9 and the variable y is initialized to 45000.
The code then enters a nested loop. The outer loop iterates from 0 to n (inclusive), and the inner loop iterates from 0 to n - i (inclusive).
For each combination of i and j, the code calculates the remaining amount of money after subtracting 10000 * i and 5000 * j from y. This remaining amount is stored in the variable res.
The code then checks if res // 1000 is equal to n - i - j. If it is, it means that the remaining amount can be divided into 1000 yen bills to match the remaining number of bills needed (n - i - j).
If the condition is met, the code prints the values of i, j, and res // 1000, and sets the flag variable to True to indicate that a solution has been found. It then breaks out of both loops.
If no solution is found after the loops finish, the code prints -1, -1, -1.
In this case, the code will find a solution when i = 4, j = 0, and res // 1000 = 5. Therefore, the output will be "4 0 5".
<<<Output>>>
4 0 5
