<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by importing the factorial function from the math module and initializing the variables B and W with the values 2 and 1, respectively. The variable mod is set to 10^9 + 7.

Next, there is a function called comb that calculates the combination of two numbers using the factorial function. It takes two arguments, n and r, and returns the combination value modulo mod. If n is less than r, it returns 0.

The code then initializes two lists, ans and ans_change, with zeros. These lists will be used to store intermediate and final results.

The variable change is calculated using the comb function and some mathematical operations. It is then multiplied by 2^W modulo mod and stored in the variable change.

Next, there is a loop that iterates from 0 to W (inclusive). Inside this loop, there are several calculations and assignments that update the values in the ans_change list.

After the loop finishes, there is another loop that iterates from 0 to B+W (inclusive). Inside this loop, the values in the ans_change list are accumulated and stored in the ans list.

Finally, there is a loop that iterates over the values in the ans list (excluding the first element). Inside this loop, each value is multiplied by a constant value and printed.
