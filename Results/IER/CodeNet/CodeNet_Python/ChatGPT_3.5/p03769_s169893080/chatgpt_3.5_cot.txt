<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input integer n and increments it by 1. It then converts the incremented value to binary and removes the first two characters ('0b') from the binary representation. For example, if n is 7, the binary representation of n+1 is '1000' and after removing the first two characters, it becomes '00'.
The code initializes two empty lists ra and rb, and a variable c to 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each character i in the binary representation of n+1.
For each character i, it appends the value of c to both ra and rb, and increments c by 1.
If i is '1', it appends the value of c to ra and prepends the value of c to rb, and increments c by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code concatenates ra and rb to form a new list res.
Finally, the code prints the length of res and the elements of res separated by a space.
