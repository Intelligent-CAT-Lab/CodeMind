<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs N and K using the map function and splits them by space. In this case, N=2 and K=2.
The code initializes a variable ans to 0.
The code then checks if N is equal to 1. If it is, it prints the value of K.
If N is not equal to 1, it calculates the value of K*(K-1)^(N-1) and prints it.
In this case, N is not equal to 1, so the code calculates 2*(2-1)^(2-1) = 2*1^1 = 2*1 = 2 and prints it.
<<<Output>>>
