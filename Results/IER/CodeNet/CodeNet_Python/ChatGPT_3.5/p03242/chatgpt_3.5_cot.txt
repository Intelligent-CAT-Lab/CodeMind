<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string `moji` and initializes an empty string `ans`.
Then, it enters a loop that iterates over the indices of the characters in `moji`.
For each index `i`, it checks if the character at that index in `moji` is equal to "1".
If it is, it appends "9" to `ans`, otherwise it appends "1".
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of `ans`.
In this case, the input string is "119", so the code will append "1" to `ans` for the first and third characters, and "9" for the second character.
Therefore, the output will be "191".
<<<Output>>>
191
