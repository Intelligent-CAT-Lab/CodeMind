The variable n is initialized to 3 and the variable m is initialized to 14.
The variable ans is initialized to -1, which will be used to store the maximum factor of m that is greater than or equal to n.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to m (inclusive), meaning it will consider all numbers from 1 to 14.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is a factor of m. If it is, it checks if the quotient of m divided by i is greater than or equal to n. If it is, it updates the value of ans to be the maximum of ans and i.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 2.
