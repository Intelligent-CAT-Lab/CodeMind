<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes input values for R, C, ay, ax, by, and bx.
It initializes the variables MOD and INF to 10^9+7.
It creates a 2D list called dists with dimensions RxC and initializes all values to INF.
It sets the value at position (ay, ax) in dists to 0.
It creates another 2D list called ptns with dimensions RxC and initializes all values to 0.
It sets the value at position (ay, ax) in ptns to 1.
It creates a deque called q and adds the tuple (0, ax, ay) to it.
It creates two lists called dxs and dys, which represent the possible movements in the x and y directions.
It initializes the variable ans_d to None.
The code enters a while loop that continues as long as q is not empty.
Inside the loop, it pops the leftmost element from q and assigns its values to the variables d, x, and y.
If ans_d is not None and d is greater than ans_d, the loop breaks.
If the current position (x, y) is equal to the target position (bx, by), it assigns the value of d to ans_d.
If d is greater than the value at position (y, x) in dists, the loop continues to the next iteration.
Otherwise, it updates the value at position (y, x) in dists to d.
It then iterates over the possible movements in the dxs and dys lists.
For each movement, it calculates the new position (nx, ny) by adding dx to x and dy to y.
If the new position is outside the grid boundaries, it continues to the next iteration.
If d+1 is greater than the value at position (ny, nx) in dists, the loop continues to the next iteration.
If the value at position (ny, nx) in dists is still INF, it appends the tuple (d+1, nx, ny) to q and updates the value at position (ny, nx) in dists to d+1.
It then updates the value at position (ny, nx) in ptns by adding the value at position (y, x) in ptns and taking the modulo of MOD.
Finally, it iterates over the positions (x, 0), (x, R-1), (0, y), and (C-1, y).
For each position, it performs the same operations as before.
After the while loop finishes, the code prints the values of ans_d and ptns[by][bx] modulo MOD.
