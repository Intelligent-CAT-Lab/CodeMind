<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three inputs N, A, and B using the map function and split method. In this case, N=5, A=1, and B=3.
The code then initializes the variables M=998244353, P=N+1, f=1, and creates two lists F and I with initial values of 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to P (inclusive), and calculates the factorial of each number using the variable f. The factorial is stored in the list F.
Next, the code calculates the modular inverse of the factorial of N and stores it in the variable i using the pow function.
Another loop is used to calculate the modular inverse of the factorials of the numbers from N to 1, and stores them in the list I.
The code then enters another loop that iterates from 0 to min(A+1, N-B) if N-B-A is true, otherwise it iterates from 0 to A+1. In this case, it will iterate from 0 to 2.
Inside this loop, the code calculates the value of Q as N-B-k-1.
The variable z is then updated by adding the product of (B-k), F[B+k-1], I[B], I[k], F[Q+A-k], I[Q], and I[A-k].
After the loop finishes, the code checks if B is equal to 0. If it is, it prints 1. Otherwise, it prints the value of z modulo M.
