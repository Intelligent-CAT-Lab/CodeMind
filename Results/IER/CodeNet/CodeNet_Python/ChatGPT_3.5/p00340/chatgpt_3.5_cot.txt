<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes input as a list of integers and stores it in the variable num.
The code then sorts the list in ascending order.
Next, it checks if the first element of the sorted list is equal to the second element and if the third element is equal to the fourth element.
If both conditions are true, it prints "yes". Otherwise, it prints "no".
In this case, the sorted list is [1, 1, 3, 4]. The first element is equal to the second element (both are 1), but the third element is not equal to the fourth element (3 is not equal to 4).
Therefore, the code will print "no".
<<<Output>>>
no
