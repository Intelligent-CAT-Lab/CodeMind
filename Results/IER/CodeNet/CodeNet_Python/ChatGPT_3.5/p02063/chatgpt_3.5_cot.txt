<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers A and B as input.
It first checks if B is divisible by A. If it is, it prints -1 and exits the program.
If B is not divisible by A, it calculates the value of _k as the ceiling division of B by A.
Then it enters a loop that iterates from _k to _k + 10^7.
For each value of k in this range, it calculates the values of bn and rem using the divmod function.
Then it calculates the values of an and rem using the divmod function again.
Finally, it calculates the value of n as the sum of bn, an, and rem.
If n is greater than k, it prints k*A and exits the program.
If the loop finishes without finding a suitable value of k, it prints -1.
In this case, A = 4 and B = 6.
The code checks if 6 is divisible by 4, which is not true.
It calculates _k as the ceiling division of 6 by 4, which is 2.
Then it enters the loop and starts iterating from 2 to 2 + 10^7.
For each value of k, it calculates bn and rem using the divmod function.
Then it calculates an and rem using the divmod function again.
Finally, it calculates n as the sum of bn, an, and rem.
Since n is not greater than k for any value of k in the range, the loop finishes without printing anything.
Therefore, the code prints -1 as the final output.
