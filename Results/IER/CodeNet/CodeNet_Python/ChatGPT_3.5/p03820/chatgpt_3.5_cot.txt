The code imports necessary libraries and defines some constants and functions.
It then reads the input values N and K.
The code initializes a 2D array C with shape (U, U) and sets the first element to 1.
It then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to U-1, where U is 2010 in this case.
In each iteration, it updates the elements of C based on the previous row.
Next, the code initializes a 2D array dp with shape (N+10, N+10) and sets the element (0, 0) to 1.
It then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N+10.
In each iteration, it updates the elements of dp based on the previous row and column.
After that, the code enters another loop that iterates from N+9 to 1 (in reverse order).
In each iteration, it updates the elements of dp based on the previous row.
Next, the code initializes a variable ans to 0.
If K is equal to N-1, the code returns the sum of the elements in the last column of dp, modulo MOD.
Otherwise, the code enters a loop that iterates from N-K to N+1.
In each iteration, it calculates a value x based on the elements of C, dp, and some other variables.
Finally, the code updates the value of ans by adding x, modulo MOD.
After the loop finishes, the code calculates ans modulo MOD again and returns the result.
The main function is called with the input values N and K, and the result is printed.
