<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a dictionary called dic with keys "A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F" and their corresponding values 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
The code then takes input in the form of two strings X and Y, which are separated by a space.
The code enters a loop that iterates over each key in the dictionary dic.
For each key, it checks if the key is equal to X or Y. If it is, it assigns the corresponding value to variables x and y, respectively.
After the loop finishes, the code compares the values of x and y.
If x is greater than y, it prints '>'.
If x is less than y, it prints '<'.
If x is equal to y, it prints '='.
In this case, X is "A" and Y is "B". The code assigns the value 1 to x and the value 2 to y. Since x is less than y, the code will print '<'.
