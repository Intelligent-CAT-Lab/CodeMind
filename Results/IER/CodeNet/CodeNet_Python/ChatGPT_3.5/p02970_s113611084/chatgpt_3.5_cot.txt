<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs, N and D, and assigns them to the variables N and D, respectively.
The code then checks if N is divisible by (2 * D + 1). If it is, it prints the result of N divided by (2 * D + 1).
Otherwise, it prints the result of N divided by (2 * D + 1) plus 1.
In this case, N is 6 and D is 2.
The code checks if 6 is divisible by (2 * 2 + 1), which is 5. Since it is not divisible, it adds 1 to the result of 6 divided by 5, which is 1.
Therefore, the output of the code is 1.
