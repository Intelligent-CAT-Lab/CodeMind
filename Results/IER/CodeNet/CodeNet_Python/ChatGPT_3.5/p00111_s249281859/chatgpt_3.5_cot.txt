<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines two dictionaries, encode and decode, which map characters to binary codes and vice versa.
The code then enters an infinite loop, where it reads input from the user until an EOFError is raised.
Inside the loop, it converts each character in the input to its corresponding binary code using the encode dictionary.
It then iterates over the binary code and checks if a substring of the code exists in the decode dictionary.
If it does, it appends the corresponding character to the code variable and resets the temp variable.
Finally, it prints the code variable, which contains the decoded message.
In this case, the input is "?D-C'KOPUA`?", which corresponds to the binary code "111000000011100100011011000100010111011100000101".
After decoding, the output is "I AM OK".
