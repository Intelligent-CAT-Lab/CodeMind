<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads 5 integers from input: a, b, c, x, and y.
It initializes a variable ans to 0, which will be used to store the final answer.
The code then checks if 2 * c is less than or equal to the sum of a and b. If this condition is true, it means that it is more efficient to buy 2 items of type c instead of 1 item of type a and 1 item of type b.
If the condition is true, the code calculates the cost of buying the minimum of x and y items of type c, which is min(x, y) * 2 * c. It adds this cost to ans.
Then, it subtracts the minimum of x and y from both x and y, to keep track of the remaining items to be bought.
Next, the code checks if there are any remaining items of type x. If there are, it checks if it is more efficient to buy 2 items of type c or 1 item of type a. If 2 * c is less than or equal to a, it buys 2 items of type c for each remaining item of type x. Otherwise, it buys 1 item of type a for each remaining item of type x.
Similarly, if there are any remaining items of type y, the code checks if it is more efficient to buy 2 items of type c or 1 item of type b. If 2 * c is less than or equal to b, it buys 2 items of type c for each remaining item of type y. Otherwise, it buys 1 item of type b for each remaining item of type y.
If the initial condition (2 * c <= a + b) is false, it means that it is more efficient to buy 1 item of type a and 1 item of type b instead of 2 items of type c. In this case, the code calculates the cost of buying x items of type a and y items of type b, which is x * a + y * b, and assigns it to ans.
Finally, the code writes the value of ans to the output.
