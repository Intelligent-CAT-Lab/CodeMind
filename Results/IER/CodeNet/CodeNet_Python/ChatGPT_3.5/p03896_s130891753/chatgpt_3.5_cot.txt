<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized to 7.
The code then checks if N is equal to 2. If it is, it prints -1 and exits the program.
Since N is not equal to 2, the code continues to execute.
The code initializes a 2D list called ans with dimensions (N-1) x N, filled with zeros.
Then, it enters a nested loop that iterates over each element in ans.
For each element, it calculates the value (i+j+1)%N + 1 and assigns it to the current element.
After the nested loop finishes, the code checks if N is divisible by 2.
If it is, it sets the variable m to N//2.
Then, it enters another loop that starts from m and goes up to N.
For each iteration, it swaps the values of ans[i][m] and ans[i][m-1].
Finally, the code enters a loop that iterates over each row in ans.
For each row, it prints the elements separated by a space.
The output will be a matrix of size (N-1) x N, where each element is a number from 1 to N.
