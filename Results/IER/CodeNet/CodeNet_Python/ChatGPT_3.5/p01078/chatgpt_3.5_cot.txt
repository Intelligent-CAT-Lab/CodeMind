<<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the math module and assigns the value of PI to a variable.
Then it takes two inputs, N and K, and assigns them to variables.
The code then calculates the value of the expression N*sin(PI/N)*cos(K*PI/N)/cos((K-1)*PI/N) and prints it.
In this case, N is 5 and K is 2.
The expression evaluates to 0.5877852522924731.
<<<Output>>>
0.5877852522924731
