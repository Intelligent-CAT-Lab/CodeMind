<<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the necessary libraries and defines some constants.
Then, it reads the input values N, A, and B.
Next, it defines a function called solve that takes N, A, and B as parameters.
Inside the solve function, there are several arrays defined using numpy.
The code then initializes the variable ans to 0.
Next, there is a loop that iterates from 0 to N-1.
Inside the loop, there are several calculations and assignments being made to the arrays dp1, dp2, and dp1_sum.
Finally, the code calculates the value of x using the formula pow(2, N, MOD) - ans, and returns x % MOD.
Outside the solve function, the code calls the solve function with the input values N, A, and B, and prints the result.
