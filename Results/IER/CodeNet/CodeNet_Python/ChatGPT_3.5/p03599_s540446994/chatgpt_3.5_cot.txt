<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes input values for variables a, b, c, d, e, and f.
It then multiplies a and b by 100 to convert them to grams.
The code initializes variables x and y to the minimum of a and b multiplied by 100 and 0, respectively.
It also initializes a variable dens to the ratio of y to x.
The code then enters a nested loop that iterates over all possible combinations of i and j, where i ranges from 0 to f // A and j ranges from 0 to (f - A * i) // B.
Inside this nested loop, the code checks if i and j are both 0. If they are, it continues to the next iteration.
It calculates the amount of water and the amount of rest (remaining capacity of the container) based on the current values of i and j.
The code then enters another nested loop that iterates over all possible combinations of k and l, where k ranges from 0 to rest // c and l ranges from 0 to (rest - c * k) // d.
Inside this nested loop, it calculates the amount of sugar and the total amount of solution based on the current values of k and l.
It then checks if the ratio of sugar to total is greater than the ratio of e to (e + 100). If it is, it breaks out of the innermost loop.
Otherwise, it checks if the ratio of sugar to total is greater than the current value of dens. If it is, it updates the values of dens, x, and y.
After the nested loops finish, the code prints the final values of x and y, which represent the total amount of solution and the amount of sugar, respectively.
