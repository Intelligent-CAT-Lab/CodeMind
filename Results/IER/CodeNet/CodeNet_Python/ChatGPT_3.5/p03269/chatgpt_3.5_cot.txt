<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input l.
It then calculates the maximum value of d such that 2^d is less than or equal to l.
It sets n to d+1 and m to 2*d.
It initializes an empty list ans.
It then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n-1.
In each iteration, it appends a tuple (i, i+1, 0) to ans and another tuple (i, i+1, 2^(i-1)) to ans.
After the loop, it checks if l is greater than 2^d.
If it is, it enters another loop that iterates from n-1 to 1 in reverse order.
In each iteration, it checks if l-2^(i-1) is greater than 2^d-1.
If it is, it appends a tuple (i, n, l-2^(i-1)) to ans, increments m by 1, subtracts 2^(i-1) from l, and breaks the loop.
Finally, it prints the values of n and m.
Then it prints each tuple in ans, with the elements separated by a space.
