<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three inputs: N, X, and M. N is the number of iterations, X is the initial value, and M is a modulus value.
The code initializes a list called List with the initial value X.
Then, it enters a loop that iterates N-1 times. In each iteration, it calculates the square of X and takes the modulus M. The result is stored in X.
The code checks if X is already in the List. If it is, it calculates the number of iterations before X repeats and stores it in the variable num. It also finds the index of X in the List and stores it in the variable key. Then, it breaks out of the loop.
If X is not in the List, it appends X to the List.
After the loop finishes, the code calculates the sum of all the elements in the List and stores it in the variable ans.
If the length of the List is equal to N, it means that there are no repeated values and the code prints the value of ans.
If the length of the List is less than N, it means that there are repeated values. The code calculates the number of complete loops that can be formed using the repeated values and stores it in the variable loop. It also calculates the number of remaining iterations after the complete loops and stores it in the variable add.
The code adds the sum of the repeated values (from index key to index num) multiplied by the number of complete loops to ans. Then, it adds the sum of the remaining iterations (from index key to index key+add) to ans.
Finally, the code prints the value of ans.
