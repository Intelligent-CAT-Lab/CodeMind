<<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the necessary libraries and sets some initial variables.
Then it takes input values for variables W and B.
Next, it creates a 2D array called "table" with dimensions HEIGHT x WIDTH (82 x 51 in this case) and initializes it with '#' and '.' characters in a specific pattern.
The code then enters two nested loops to modify the "table" array. It checks if the number of remaining white cells (whites) is greater than W, and if so, it replaces a '#' character with a '.' character. It does this for the top half of the array.
Similarly, it checks if the number of remaining black cells (blacks) is greater than B, and if so, it replaces a '.' character with a '#' character. It does this for the bottom half of the array.
Finally, the code prints the dimensions of the array (HEIGHT and WIDTH) and then prints each row of the "table" array.
<<<Output>>>
