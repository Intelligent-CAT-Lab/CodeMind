<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string s, which is initialized to "BBBWW".
The variable now is initialized to the first character of s, which is "B".
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of times the character changes.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from the second character of s to the last character.
For each character i in this range, it checks if it is different from the previous character now.
If it is different, it increments ans by 1 and updates now to the current character i.
In this case, the loop will iterate through "B", "B", "W", "W".
The first "B" is the same as the initial character, so it is not counted.
The second "B" is the same as the previous character, so it is not counted.
The first "W" is different from the previous character, so ans is incremented to 1 and now is updated to "W".
The second "W" is the same as the previous character, so it is not counted.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 1.
