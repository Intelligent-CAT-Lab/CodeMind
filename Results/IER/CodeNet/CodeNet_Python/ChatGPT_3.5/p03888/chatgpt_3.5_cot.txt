<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called getinputdata() which takes input from the user and stores it in an array called array_result. The input is expected to be in the format of space-separated values. The function continues to take input until an empty line is entered.

After defining the function, the code calls the getinputdata() function and stores the returned array in arr_data.

The code then assigns the first element of the first sub-array of arr_data to the variable r1 and converts it to an integer. Similarly, it assigns the second element of the first sub-array of arr_data to the variable r2 and converts it to an integer.

Finally, the code calculates the result of the expression 1/((r2+r1) /(r1*r2)) and prints it.
