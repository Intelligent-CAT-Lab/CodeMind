<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input L and initializes an empty list xs.
Then it enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 20 (inclusive) with the variable m.
Inside the loop, it checks if (2 << m) is greater than L. If it is, it breaks out of the loop.
Otherwise, it appends a tuple (m+1, m+2, 0) to the list xs, and another tuple (m+1, m+2, 1 << m) to the list xs.
After the loop, it initializes the variable b to 1 << m and the variable x to L - b.
Then it enters another loop that iterates from m-1 to 0 (inclusive) with the variable i.
Inside this loop, it checks if x is greater than or equal to 1 << i. If it is, it appends a tuple (i+1, m+1, b) to the list xs, subtracts 1 << i from x, and adds 1 << i to b.
Finally, it prints the value of m + 1 and the length of xs.
Then it prints each tuple in xs, separated by a space.
