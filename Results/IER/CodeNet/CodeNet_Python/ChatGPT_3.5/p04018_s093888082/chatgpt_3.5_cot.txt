<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string and calculates the number of good substrings in it. A good substring is defined as a substring that appears at least twice in the string and is a palindrome. The code first checks if the entire string is a palindrome. If it is, it prints "1" and exits. Otherwise, it calculates the length of the string and initializes a variable "per" to -1. It then defines a function "good" that calculates the Z-function of a string. The Z-function is used to find all the palindromes in a string. The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to half the length of the string. For each iteration, it checks if the string can be divided into two equal parts such that the first part is equal to the second part. If it can, it sets "per" to the length of the first part and breaks the loop. If "per" is still -1 after the loop, it means that the string cannot be divided into two equal parts, so it prints "1" and exits. If "per" is 1, it means that the string is a palindrome, so it prints the length of the string and exits. Otherwise, it calculates two lists "gl" and "gr" using the "good" function. These lists represent the palindromes that start at the beginning and end of the string, respectively. It then initializes a variable "cnt" to 0 and enters a loop that iterates from 0 to the length of the string minus 1. For each iteration, it checks if the palindrome starting at index "i" in "gl" and the palindrome ending at index "n-2-i" in "gr" are both true. If they are, it increments "cnt" by 1. Finally, it prints "2" and the value of "cnt".
