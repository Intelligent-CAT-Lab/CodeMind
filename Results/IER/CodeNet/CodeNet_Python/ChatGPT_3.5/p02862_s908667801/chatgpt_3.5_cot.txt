<<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the math module.
Then it takes two integers x and y as input.
The variable mod is initialized to 10^9 + 7.
The variable n is calculated as the floor division of the sum of x and y by 3.
If the remainder of the division of the sum of x and y by 3 is not 0, the code prints '0' and exits.
Otherwise, it subtracts n from both x and y.
If either x or y becomes negative, the code prints '0' and exits.
The code then defines a function cmb(n, r, mod) to calculate the combination of n and r modulo mod.
It initializes three lists: g1, g2, and inverse.
It calculates the factorial of numbers from 0 to N and stores them in g1.
It calculates the inverse of numbers from 0 to N modulo mod and stores them in inverse.
It calculates the factorial of numbers from 0 to N modulo mod and stores them in g2.
Finally, it calculates the combination of x+y and x modulo mod and stores it in ans.
The code prints the value of ans.
