<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 5.
The code then creates a list a with initial values [2, 1].
The code enters a loop that iterates n-1 times, which is 4 times in this case.
In each iteration, the code appends a new element to the list a, which is the sum of the last two elements in the list.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the last element in the list a, which is 8.
<<<Output>>>
8
