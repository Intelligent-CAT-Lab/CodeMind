<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by importing the sys module and defining the input function to read input from stdin.
Then, it imports the itertools module.
Next, it reads an integer N from input.
The code initializes a list A with the values [1, 2, 4].
Then, it enters a loop that iterates 12 times.
In each iteration, it calculates the sum of all pairs of elements in A using itertools.combinations and stores the result in the set sum_2.
It also calculates the difference between each pair of elements in sum_2 and each element in A using itertools.product and stores the result in the set avoid.
Next, it finds the minimum value x that is not in the set avoid, sum_2, or A, and appends it to A.
After the loop finishes, the code initializes a 2D list L with dimensions N x (N-1-i) for i in range(N).
Then, it initializes a variable x to 1.
Next, it enters a loop that iterates N times.
In each iteration, it assigns a new list to L[n] by multiplying each element in A[:N-1-n] by x.
If n is less than N-2, it updates the value of x to be the sum of the last two elements in L[n].
After the loop finishes, the code initializes a 2D list graph with dimensions N x N, filled with zeros.
Then, it enters two nested loops to iterate over each element in L.
In each iteration, it assigns the value x to graph[i][i+j+1] and graph[i+j+1][i], where i is the outer loop variable and j is the inner loop variable.
Finally, the code prints each row of the graph.
