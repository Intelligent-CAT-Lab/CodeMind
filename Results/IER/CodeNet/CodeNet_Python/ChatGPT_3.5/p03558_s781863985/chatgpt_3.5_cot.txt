<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by importing the deque module from the collections library.
Then, it defines a function called solve that takes a parameter k.
Inside the solve function, a deque called que is created and initialized with a tuple (1, 1).
A dictionary called dp is also created and initialized with the key-value pair {1: 1}.
The code enters a while loop that continues as long as que is not empty.
In each iteration of the loop, the code pops the rightmost element from que and assigns it to variables x and c.
The code then calculates the remainder of (x + 1) divided by k and assigns it to variable y.
If y is not a key in dp or if the value of dp[y] is greater than c + 1, the code updates dp[y] to c + 1 and appends the tuple (y, c+1) to the left of que.
Next, the code calculates the remainder of (10 * x) divided by k and assigns it to variable z.
If z is not a key in dp or if the value of dp[z] is greater than c, the code updates dp[z] to c and appends the tuple (z, c) to que.
The loop continues until que is empty.
Finally, the solve function returns the value of dp[0].
Outside the solve function, the code prompts the user to enter a value for k and assigns it to variable k.
Then, the code calls the solve function with k as an argument and prints the returned value.
