<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input: a, b, and c.
It then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 100 (inclusive), assigning each value to the variable n.
Inside the loop, it checks if the expression (a*n) % b is equal to c. If it is, it prints "YES" and exits the program.
If the loop finishes without finding a match, it prints "NO".
In this case, the code will find a match when n is 1, because (7*1) % 5 is equal to 1.
<<<Output>>>
YES
