<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines three functions: getN(), getNM(), and getList(). These functions are used to read input values from the user.
The code then reads an integer value N using the getN() function.
Next, the code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 10^4 - 1. For each iteration, it checks if the product of i and (i+1) divided by 2 is greater than or equal to N. If this condition is true, it assigns the value of i to the variable M and calculates the value of upper using the formula M*(M+1)/2. It then breaks out of the loop.
After that, the code initializes an empty list tar and calculates the difference between upper and N, storing it in the variable diff.
The code then enters another loop that iterates M times. For each iteration, it assigns the value of i+1 to the variable j. If j is not equal to diff, it prints the value of j.
Finally, the code prints the sum of the elements in tar (which is currently commented out), as well as the values of M, upper, and diff (also commented out). If the value 1628 is in tar, it prints "True" (also commented out).
