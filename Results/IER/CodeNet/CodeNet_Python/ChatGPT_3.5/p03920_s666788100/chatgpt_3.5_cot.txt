The variable n is initialized to 4.
The variable m is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers.
The variable tmp is initialized to 0, which will be used to keep track of the current number being added to m.
The code enters a while loop that continues until m is greater than or equal to n.
In each iteration of the loop, tmp is incremented by 1 and added to m.
The loop stops when m becomes greater than or equal to n. In this case, tmp will be 3 and m will be 6.
After the loop, the code enters a for loop that iterates from 1 to tmp+1 (inclusive), which is from 1 to 4 in this case.
For each number i in this range, the code checks if m-n is not equal to i. If it is not equal, it prints i.
In this case, m-n is 2, so the code prints 1, 3, and 4.
