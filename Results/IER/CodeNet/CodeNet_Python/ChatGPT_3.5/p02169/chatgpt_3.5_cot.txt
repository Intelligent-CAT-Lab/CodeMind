<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called solve() which takes no arguments.
Inside the solve() function, it reads three integers m, n, and k from input.
The code then checks if n is less than k or m is less than k. If either condition is true, it prints 0 and returns.
If both conditions are false, it calculates ans as the result of m raised to the power of n modulo mod.
It then creates a list p containing the values of i raised to the power of n modulo mod for each i in the range from 0 to k.
The code initializes c to m and creates a 2D list comb to store the values of the binomial coefficients.
It sets the first element of comb to 1 and then uses a nested loop to calculate the remaining values of comb.
Next, the code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to k-1.
Inside this loop, it initializes k to 0 and uses another loop to calculate the value of k based on the binomial coefficients and p values.
It then updates the value of c and calculates the value of k modulo mod.
Finally, the code subtracts k from ans and takes the result modulo mod.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of ans.
