<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called main, which takes no arguments.
Inside the main function, it reads two integers N and M from input and assigns them to variables N and M, respectively.
It then calculates the value of t using the formula 1900*M + 100*(N-M) and assigns it to the variable t.
Next, it calculates the value of p using the formula 2**M and assigns it to the variable p.
Finally, it prints the product of t and p.
The code then checks if the __name__ variable is equal to '__main__'. This condition is true when the code is run directly and not imported as a module.
If the condition is true, it calls the main function.
In this case, the input is '1 1', so N is assigned the value 1 and M is assigned the value 1.
The value of t is calculated as 1900*1 + 100*(1-1) = 1900.
The value of p is calculated as 2**1 = 2.
The final output is the product of t and p, which is 1900*2 = 3800.
