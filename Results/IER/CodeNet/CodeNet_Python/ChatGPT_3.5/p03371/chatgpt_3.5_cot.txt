<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes input values for variables A, B, C, X, and Y.
It then calculates the minimum value between X and Y and stores it in the variable mi.
Next, it calculates the cost of buying all items using the formula a = A*X + B*Y.
Then, it calculates the cost of buying the minimum value of items using the formula b = mi*C*2 + A*(X-mi) + B*(Y-mi).
Finally, it calculates the cost of buying the maximum value of items using the formula c = max(X,Y)*C*2.
The code prints the minimum value among a, b, and c using the min() function.
