<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input from the user and stores it in the variable `a`.
It then checks if the value of `a` is equal to the string `'ani'`.
If the condition is true, it prints the string `'square1001'`.
If the condition is false, it prints the string `'e869120'`.
In this case, the value of `a` is `'ani'`, so the condition is true and the code will print `'square1001'`.
<<<Output>>>
square1001
