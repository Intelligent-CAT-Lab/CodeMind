<<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the necessary modules and sets some constants and configurations.
Then, it defines a function called "resolve" which performs the main logic of the code.
Inside the "resolve" function, it imports the "re" module and defines a regular expression pattern.
The pattern is "^A[a-z]+C[a-z]+$", which matches strings that start with an "A", followed by one or more lowercase letters, followed by a "C", and ends with one or more lowercase letters.
The code then uses the "re.match" function to check if the input string matches the pattern.
If it does, it prints "AC", indicating that the input is valid. Otherwise, it prints "WA", indicating that the input is invalid.
Finally, the code calls the "resolve" function to execute the logic.
