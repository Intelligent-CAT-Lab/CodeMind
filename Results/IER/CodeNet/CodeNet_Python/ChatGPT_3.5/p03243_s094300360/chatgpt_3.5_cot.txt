<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 111, which is the input value.
The variable x is initialized to 111.
The code then enters a loop that iterates 9 times.
In each iteration, it checks if x is greater than or equal to n. If it is, it prints the value of x and breaks out of the loop.
If x is not greater than or equal to n, it adds 111 to x and continues to the next iteration.
Since x is initially 111 and n is also 111, the condition x >= n is true in the first iteration. Therefore, the code prints the value of x, which is 111, and breaks out of the loop.
<<<Output>>>
111
