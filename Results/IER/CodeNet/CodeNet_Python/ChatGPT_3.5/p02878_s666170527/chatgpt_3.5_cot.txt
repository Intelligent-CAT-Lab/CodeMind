<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three inputs: N, A, and B. In this case, N=5, A=1, and B=3.
The code initializes the variable M to 998244353, P to N+1, f to 1, and creates two lists F and I with length P, filled with 1s.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to P (inclusive), and calculates the factorial of each number using the previous factorial value. The factorial values are stored in the list F.
Next, the code calculates the modular inverse of the factorial of N and stores it in the variable i.
Then, the code enters another loop that iterates from N to 1 (inclusive), and calculates the modular inverse of the factorials of the numbers from N to 1. The modular inverse values are stored in the list I.
After that, the code enters another loop that iterates from 0 to min(A+1, N-B) if N-B-A is true, otherwise it iterates from 0 to A+1. In this case, it iterates from 0 to 2.
Inside this loop, the code calculates the value of Q, which is N-B-k-1.
Then, the code updates the value of z by adding the product of several values, all calculated using the lists F and I, and the variables B, k, A, Q, and M.
Finally, the code prints the value of z if B is true, otherwise it prints 1.
