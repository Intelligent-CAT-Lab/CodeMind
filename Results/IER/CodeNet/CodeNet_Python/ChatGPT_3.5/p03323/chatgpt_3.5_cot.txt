<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input and assigns them to variables a and b.
It then checks if both a and b are less than 9. If they are, it prints "Yay!". Otherwise, it prints ":(".
In this case, a is 5 and b is 4, both of which are less than 9. Therefore, the code will print "Yay!".
<<<Output>>>
Yay!
