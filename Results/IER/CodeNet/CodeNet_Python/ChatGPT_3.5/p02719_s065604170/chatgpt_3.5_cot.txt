<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers n and m as input.
It then calculates the remainder of n divided by m using the modulo operator (%).
The code also calculates the remainder of -n divided by m using the modulo operator (-n % m).
Finally, it prints the minimum value between these two remainders.
In this case, n is 7 and m is 4.
The remainder of 7 divided by 4 is 3.
The remainder of -7 divided by 4 is 1.
Therefore, the minimum value between 3 and 1 is 1.
