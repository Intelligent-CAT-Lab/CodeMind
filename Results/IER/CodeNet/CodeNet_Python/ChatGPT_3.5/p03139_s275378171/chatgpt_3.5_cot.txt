<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three inputs: n, a, and b. These inputs are separated by spaces and are converted to integers using the map() function.
The code then initializes two variables: maximum and minimum.
The maximum value is set to the minimum of a and b.
The minimum value is set to the maximum of 0 and the sum of a and b minus n.
Finally, the code prints the values of maximum and minimum.
In this case, n=10, a=3, and b=5.
The maximum value is 3 because it is the smaller of the two values a and b.
The minimum value is 0 because the sum of a and b (3+5=8) is less than n (10), so the maximum value of 0 is chosen.
Therefore, the output of the code execution would be:
3 0
<<<Output>>>
3 0
