<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function check(x) that checks if a number x is prime. It does this by iterating through the list of prime numbers (initialized with [2]) and checking if x is divisible by any of them. If x is divisible by any prime number, it returns False. If x is smaller than the square of the current prime number, it breaks out of the loop and returns True. This function is used later in the code.

The code also defines a function set() that populates the list of prime numbers. It starts from 3 and iterates through odd numbers up to 10^5. For each number, it calls the check() function to determine if it is prime. If it is, it appends it to the prime list.

The code then reads two integers p and q from input. If q is divisible by p, it divides q by p and sets p to 1. This step is done to simplify the fraction p/q.

Next, the code iterates through the prime list and checks if both p and q are divisible by the current prime number. If they are, it divides both p and q by the prime number. This step is done to simplify the fraction further.

After simplifying the fraction, the code initializes a variable ans to 1. It then iterates through the prime list again and checks if q is divisible by the current prime number. If it is, it divides q by the prime number and multiplies ans by the prime number. It continues this process until q is no longer divisible by the prime number.

Finally, the code multiplies ans by the remaining value of q and prints the result.

In this case, the input is "1 2". The code simplifies the fraction to "1 1" and the final value of ans is 2.
