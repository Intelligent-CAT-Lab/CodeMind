<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input from the user and stores it in the variable b.
Then it checks the value of b using if-elif-else statements.
If b is equal to 'A', it prints 'T'.
If b is equal to 'T', it prints 'A'.
If b is equal to 'G', it prints 'C'.
If none of the above conditions are met, it means b is not equal to 'A', 'T', or 'G', so it prints 'G'.
In this case, the input is 'A', so the first condition is met and the code prints 'T'.
<<<Output>>>
T
