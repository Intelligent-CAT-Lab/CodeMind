<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string S from the input and initializes the variables ans, d, and cur to 0.
Then it enters a loop that iterates over each character c in the string S.
If c is equal to "R", the code checks if d is equal to cur. If it is, it increments cur by 1.
Then it updates the value of d by adding 1 and taking the modulo 4.
If d becomes 0 and cur becomes 4, it increments ans by 1 and sets cur back to 0.
If c is not equal to "R", the code updates the value of d by subtracting 1 and taking the modulo 4.
If d becomes 0, it sets cur back to 0.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the value of ans.
In this case, the string S is "RRRRLLLLRRRR".
The code starts with ans = 0, d = 0, and cur = 0.
For the first character "R", d is equal to cur, so cur is incremented to 1.
Then d is updated to 1 % 4 = 1.
For the second character "R", d is not equal to cur, so cur remains 1.
Then d is updated to 2 % 4 = 2.
For the third character "R", d is not equal to cur, so cur remains 1.
Then d is updated to 3 % 4 = 3.
For the fourth character "R", d is not equal to cur, so cur remains 1.
Then d is updated to 0 % 4 = 0.
Since d is now 0 and cur is 1, ans is incremented to 1 and cur is set back to 0.
For the fifth character "L", d is updated to -1 % 4 = 3.
Since d is not 0, cur remains 0.
For the sixth character "L", d is updated to 2 % 4 = 2.
Since d is not 0, cur remains 0.
For the seventh character "L", d is updated to 1 % 4 = 1.
Since d is not 0, cur remains 0.
For the eighth character "L", d is updated to 0 % 4 = 0.
Since d is now 0, cur is set back to 0.
For the ninth character "R", d is equal to cur, so cur is incremented to 1.
Then d is updated to 1 % 4 = 1.
For the tenth character "R", d is not equal to cur, so cur remains 1.
Then d is updated to 2 % 4 = 2.
For the eleventh character "R", d is not equal to cur, so cur remains 1.
Then d is updated to 3 % 4 = 3.
For the twelfth character "R", d is not equal to cur, so cur remains 1.
Then d is updated to 0 % 4 = 0.
Since d is now 0 and cur is 1, ans is incremented to 2 and cur is set back to 0.
Therefore, the final value of ans is 2.
