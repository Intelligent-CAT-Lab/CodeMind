<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four inputs: n, a, b, and c. These inputs are converted to integers and stored in the respective variables.
The variable p is initialized to 10^9 + 7.
The variable ans is initialized to 0.
The code defines three functions: fact, invfact, and comb. These functions are used to calculate factorials, inverse factorials, and combinations.
The code then calculates the factorial and inverse factorial arrays using the fact and invfact functions.
The variables pow_a and pow_b are initialized with the value 1.
The code calculates the inverse of 100 modulo p and multiplies it with a, b, and c to get the updated values of a, b, and c.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n-1. In each iteration, it calculates the powers of a and b and appends them to the pow_a and pow_b arrays.
The code then enters another loop that iterates from n to 2*n-1. In each iteration, it calculates the combination of m-1 choose n-1 and multiplies it with the product of pow_a[n] * pow_b[m-n] and pow_a[m-n] * pow_b[n]. It then multiplies the result with m and adds it to the ans variable.
After the loop finishes, the code multiplies the ans variable with the inverse of (1-c) modulo p.
Finally, the code prints the result of ans modulo p.
