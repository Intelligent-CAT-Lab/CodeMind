<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four integer inputs: A, B, C, and D.
It then enters a while loop that continues indefinitely (while(1)).
Inside the loop, it subtracts the value of B from C and checks if C is less than or equal to 0.
If C is less than or equal to 0, it prints "Yes" and breaks out of the loop.
If C is still greater than 0, it subtracts the value of D from A and checks if A is less than or equal to 0.
If A is less than or equal to 0, it prints "No" and breaks out of the loop.
The loop continues until either C becomes less than or equal to 0 or A becomes less than or equal to 0.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
