<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three inputs: r, d, and x. These inputs are converted to integers using the map function.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 10 (inclusive).
In each iteration, the code updates the value of x using the formula r*x-d.
The updated value of x is then printed.
