<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three inputs: H, W, and K. In this case, the inputs are 2, 1, and 2, respectively.
The code then initializes two variables: P and N. P is set to 10^9 + 7, and N is set to the sum of H and W.
Next, the code calculates the value of x using the given formula. It involves several mathematical operations, including multiplication, division, and exponentiation.
After calculating x, the code enters a loop that iterates K times. In each iteration, it updates the value of x by multiplying it with (N-i) modulo P.
Finally, the code prints the final value of x.
