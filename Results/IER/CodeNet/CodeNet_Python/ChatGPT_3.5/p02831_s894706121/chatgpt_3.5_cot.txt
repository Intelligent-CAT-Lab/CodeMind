<<<Analysis>>>
The code imports the fractions module, which provides a function gcd() to calculate the greatest common divisor of two numbers.
The code then reads two integers, a and b, from the input and stores them in variables.
The code calculates the product of a and b, and then divides it by the greatest common divisor of a and b using the gcd() function from the fractions module.
Finally, the code prints the result of the division.
In this case, a is 2 and b is 3. The greatest common divisor of 2 and 3 is 1. So the code calculates 2 * 3 // 1, which is 6.
<<<Output>>>
6
