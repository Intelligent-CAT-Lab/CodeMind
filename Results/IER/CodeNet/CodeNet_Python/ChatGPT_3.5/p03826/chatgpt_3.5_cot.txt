<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four integers as input: a, b, c, and d.
It then calculates the product of a and b and stores it in the variable s.
It also calculates the product of c and d and stores it in the variable t.
The code then checks if s is greater than t. If it is, it prints the value of s. Otherwise, it prints the value of t.
In this case, a is 3, b is 5, c is 2, and d is 7.
So, s = 3 * 5 = 15 and t = 2 * 7 = 14.
Since s is greater than t, the code will print 15.
<<<Output>>>
15
