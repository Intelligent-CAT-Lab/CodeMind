<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers n and k as input.
It initializes a variable a to 0.
Then it enters a loop that iterates n-1 times.
In each iteration, it adds a//(k-1) + 1 to the variable a.
Finally, it prints the value of a.
In this case, n is 4 and k is 2.
In the first iteration, a is 0, so a//(k-1) + 1 is 0 + 1 = 1. So a becomes 1.
In the second iteration, a is 1, so a//(k-1) + 1 is 1 + 1 = 2. So a becomes 3.
In the third iteration, a is 3, so a//(k-1) + 1 is 3 + 1 = 4. So a becomes 7.
Finally, a is printed, which is 7.
<<<Output>>>
7
