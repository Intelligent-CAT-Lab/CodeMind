<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes input as a list of integers and assigns it to variable A.
It then checks if the sum of the elements in A is greater than or equal to 22.
If the condition is true, it prints 'bust', otherwise it prints 'win'.
In this case, the sum of the elements in A is 5 + 7 + 9 = 21, which is less than 22.
Therefore, the code will print 'win'.
<<<Output>>>
win
