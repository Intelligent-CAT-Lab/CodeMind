<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines several helper functions for input and output.
The main function starts by reading an integer n from input.
It initializes a list called base with some predefined values.
Then it initializes a 2D list called ans with dimensions n x n, filled with zeros.
It sets ans[1][0] and ans[0][1] to 1.
Then it enters a loop that iterates from 3 to n (inclusive).
Inside this loop, it initializes a variable mx to 0.
It then enters another loop that generates all permutations of length vn-1.
For each permutation, it calculates the sum of ans[v0][v1] for each pair of adjacent elements in the permutation.
If this sum is greater than mx, it updates mx with the new value.
After the inner loop finishes, it sets ans[vn-1][0] and ans[0][vn-1] to base[vn-2] * (mx + 1).
It also sets ans[vn-1][vn-2] and ans[vn-2][vn-1] to base[vn-3] * (mx + 1).
Finally, it enters another loop that iterates from 1 to vn-2 (exclusive).
For each index j, it sets ans[vn-1][j] and ans[j][vn-1] to base[j-1] * (mx + 1).
After the loop finishes, it prints the elements of ans row by row.
