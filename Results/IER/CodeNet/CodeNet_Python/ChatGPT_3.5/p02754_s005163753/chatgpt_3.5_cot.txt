<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n, variable a and variable b are initialized to 8, 3 and 4, respectively.
The code then checks if the remainder of n divided by (a + b) is less than or equal to a.
If it is, it calculates the result as (n // (a + b)) * a + n % (a + b).
If it is not, it calculates the result as (n // (a + b)) * a + a.
In this case, n % (a + b) is 8 % (3 + 4) = 1, which is less than or equal to a.
So the result is (8 // (3 + 4)) * 3 + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4.
<<<Output>>>
4
