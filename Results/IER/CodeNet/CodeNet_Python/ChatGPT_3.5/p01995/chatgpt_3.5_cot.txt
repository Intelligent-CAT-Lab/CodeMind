<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function main() and imports two functions from the bisect module: bisect_left and bisect_right.
It then takes an input string s.
The code initializes a string alpha with all lowercase letters of the alphabet and a variable l with the length of the input string s.
It creates a dictionary alpha2 that maps each letter in alpha to its index.
It creates a list memo with 26 empty lists.
It initializes a variable mod with the value 10^9 + 7.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the characters of the input string s.
For each character, it appends the index of the character in the input string to the corresponding list in memo.
Next, it creates a 2D list dp with dimensions (l+1) x (l+1) and initializes all elements to 0.
It sets dp[0][l] to 1.
It initializes a variable ans to 0.
The code then enters two nested loops that iterate over the indices i and j.
For each pair of indices, it retrieves the value p from dp[i][j].
If p is 0, it continues to the next iteration of the loop.
Otherwise, it enters another loop that iterates over the indices k from 0 to 25.
For each index k, it finds the leftmost index x in the list memo[k] that is greater than or equal to i, and the rightmost index y in the list memo[k] that is less than j.
If x is greater than y, it continues to the next iteration of the loop.
Otherwise, it increments ans by p.
If x is less than y, it retrieves the values mx and my from memo[k] at indices x and y, respectively.
It updates dp[mx+1][my] by adding p modulo mod.
After the nested loops finish, it updates ans by taking the modulo mod.
It then calculates the sum of all elements in dp and takes the modulo mod.
It adds this sum to ans and takes the modulo mod.
Finally, it subtracts 1 from ans and takes the modulo mod.
The code prints the final value of ans.
