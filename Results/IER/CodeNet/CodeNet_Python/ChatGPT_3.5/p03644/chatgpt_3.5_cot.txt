<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized to 7.
The code then initializes two variables, ans and k, to 1 and 0 respectively. These variables will be used to store the number with the maximum count of consecutive 2's and the count itself.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 2 to N (inclusive) with a step of 2, meaning it considers only even numbers in this range.
For each even number i, it initializes two variables, temp and res, to i and 0 respectively. These variables will be used to calculate the count of consecutive 2's in i.
The code then enters a while loop that continues as long as temp is divisible by 2. In each iteration of the while loop, it increments res by 1 and divides temp by 2.
After the while loop finishes, the code checks if the count res is greater than the current maximum count k. If it is, it updates ans to i and k to res.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is the even number with the maximum count of consecutive 2's. In this case, it is 4.
