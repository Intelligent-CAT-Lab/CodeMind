<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by importing the necessary modules and setting the recursion limit.
Then, it reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable k.
A list of empty lists, g, is created with length k.
A loop is used to populate the list g. For each index i, two tuples are appended to the corresponding list in g.
The first tuple is ((i+1)%k, 1), which represents an edge from i to (i+1)%k with weight 1.
The second tuple is (10*i%k, 0), which represents an edge from i to (10*i)%k with weight 0.
A deque, q, is created with the initial value of [1].
A list, res, is created with length k and all elements initialized to infinity.
The element at index 1 is set to 1.
A while loop is used to process the elements in q.
Inside the loop, the leftmost element, v, is removed from q.
If v is equal to 0, the loop breaks.
For each tuple (c, d) in the list g[v], the code checks if res[c] is less than or equal to res[v]+d.
If it is, the code continues to the next iteration of the loop.
Otherwise, res[c] is updated to res[v]+d.
If d is 1, c is appended to q.
If d is 0, c is prepended to q.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the value of res[0].
