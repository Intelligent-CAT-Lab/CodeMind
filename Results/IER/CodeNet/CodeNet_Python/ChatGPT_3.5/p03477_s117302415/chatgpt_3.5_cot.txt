<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four integers as input and assigns them to variables a, b, c, and d.
It then checks if the sum of a and b is greater than the sum of c and d. If it is, it prints 'Left'.
If the sum of a and b is less than the sum of c and d, it prints 'Right'.
If neither of these conditions is true, it means that the sums are equal, so it prints 'Balanced'.
In this case, a=3, b=8, c=7, and d=1.
The sum of a and b is 3+8=11, and the sum of c and d is 7+1=8.
Since 11 is greater than 8, the code will print 'Left'.
<<<Output>>>
