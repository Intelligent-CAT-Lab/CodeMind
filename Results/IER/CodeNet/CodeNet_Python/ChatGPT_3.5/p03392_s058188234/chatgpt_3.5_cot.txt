<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by importing the Counter class from the collections module and setting the recursion limit to 10^6.
The variable MOD is set to 998244353.
The variable ABC is set to the index method of the string "abc". This means that ABC is a function that takes a character from "abc" and returns its index in the string.
The input is read and stored in the list S after mapping each character to its index using the ABC function.
The length of S is stored in the variable N.
The function bruteforce is defined. It takes a list S as input and uses recursion to generate all possible combinations of S by swapping adjacent elements. It keeps track of the combinations it has already seen using the used set. The function returns the number of unique combinations it has generated.
If the length of S is less than or equal to 3, the function bruteforce is called with S as input and the result is printed.
Otherwise, a Counter object c is created from S to count the occurrences of each element in S.
If any element occurs N times in S, meaning all elements are the same, the output is 1.
Otherwise, two 3D lists P and Q are created, each with dimensions 3x3x2. P is initialized with 1s in the diagonal elements and 0s elsewhere.
A loop is started from 0 to N-2. In each iteration, Q is reset to 0s and then updated based on the values in P.
After the loop, the variable ans is initialized to 0.
The variable r is set to the sum of all elements in S modulo 3.
A loop is started from 0 to 2. In each iteration, ans is updated by adding the value in P[i][r][1].
If all adjacent elements in S are different, meaning no two adjacent elements are the same, 1 is added to ans.
Finally, the value of ans modulo MOD is printed.
