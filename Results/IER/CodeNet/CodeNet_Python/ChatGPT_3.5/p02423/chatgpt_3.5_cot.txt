<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input and assigns it to the variable n.
The variable mask is initialized to (1<<32)-1, which is a binary number with 32 bits, all set to 1.
The code then prints the binary representation of n using the format '{:032b}'.format(n). This will print the binary representation of n with leading zeros to make it 32 bits long.
Next, it prints the binary representation of the bitwise complement of n, which is obtained by using the ~ operator. The bitwise complement is calculated by flipping all the bits of n. The result is then bitwise ANDed with the mask to ensure that only the last 32 bits are considered.
After that, it prints the binary representation of n shifted left by 1 bit. The << operator is used for left shift. The result is again bitwise ANDed with the mask to ensure that only the last 32 bits are considered.
Finally, it prints the binary representation of n shifted right by 1 bit. The >> operator is used for right shift. The result is again bitwise ANDed with the mask to ensure that only the last 32 bits are considered.
