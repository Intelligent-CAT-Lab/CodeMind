<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n, k, and s are initialized to 4, 2, and 3, respectively.
The code then initializes the variable num to 998245637.
Next, it creates a list arr with k elements, where each element is equal to s. In this case, arr will be [3, 3].
Similarly, it creates a list arr2 with n-k elements, where each element is equal to num. In this case, arr2 will be [998245637, 998245637].
Finally, it prints the concatenation of arr and arr2, separated by spaces. The output will be "3 3 998245637 998245637".
<<<Output>>>
3 3 998245637 998245637
