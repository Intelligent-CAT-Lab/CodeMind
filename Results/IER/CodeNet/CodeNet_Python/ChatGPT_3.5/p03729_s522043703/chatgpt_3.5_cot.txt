<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three inputs A, B, and C using the input().split() method. In this case, the inputs are 'rng', 'gorilla', and 'apple'.
The code then checks if the last character of A (which is 'g') is equal to the first character of B (which is 'g') and if the last character of B (which is 'a') is equal to the first character of C (which is 'a'). 
Since both conditions are true, the code prints 'YES'.
<<<Output>>>
YES
