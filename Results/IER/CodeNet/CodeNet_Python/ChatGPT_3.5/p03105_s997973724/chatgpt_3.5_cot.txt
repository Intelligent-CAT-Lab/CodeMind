<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three inputs A, B, and C and assigns them to variables A, B, and C respectively.
The code then checks if the integer division of B by A (B // A) is greater than or equal to C.
If the condition is true, it prints the value of C.
Otherwise, it prints the integer division of B by A.
In this case, A = 2, B = 11, and C = 4.
The integer division of 11 by 2 is 5, which is not greater than or equal to 4.
Therefore, the code will print the value of B // A, which is 5.
<<<Output>>>
5
