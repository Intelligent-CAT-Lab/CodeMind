<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers A and B as input.
If A is equal to 1, it changes the value of A to 14.
If B is equal to 1, it changes the value of B to 14.
Then it checks if A is greater than B. If it is, it prints 'Alice'.
If B is greater than A, it prints 'Bob'.
If neither condition is true, it prints 'Draw'.
In this case, A is 8 and B is 6. A is not equal to 1, so it remains unchanged. B is also not equal to 1, so it remains unchanged.
Since A is not greater than B and B is not greater than A, the code prints 'Draw'.
<<<Output>>>
Draw
