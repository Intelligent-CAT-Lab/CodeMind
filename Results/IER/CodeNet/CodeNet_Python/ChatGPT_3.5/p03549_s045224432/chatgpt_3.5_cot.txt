<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs, N and M, and assigns them to the variables N and M, respectively.
It then calculates the result using the formula ((N-M)*100+M*1900)*2**M.
In this case, N is 1 and M is 1.
So the calculation becomes ((1-1)*100+1*1900)*2**1, which simplifies to (0*100+1900)*2, and further simplifies to 1900*2.
The final result is 3800.
<<<Output>>>
3800
