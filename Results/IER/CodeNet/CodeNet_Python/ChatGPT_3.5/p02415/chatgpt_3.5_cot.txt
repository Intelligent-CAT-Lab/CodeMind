<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string from the input and stores it in the variable s.
Then, it uses the swapcase() method to convert the case of each character in the string. Uppercase letters are converted to lowercase, and lowercase letters are converted to uppercase.
Finally, it prints the modified string.
In this case, the input string is "fAIR, LATER, OCCASIONALLY CLOUDY.".
After applying the swapcase() method, the string becomes "Fair, later, occasionally cloudy."
<<<Output>>>
Fair, later, occasionally cloudy.
