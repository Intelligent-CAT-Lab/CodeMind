The code imports the bisect and sys modules and sets the recursion limit to 10000.
An empty list 'a' is created.
The function 'f' is defined, which takes three parameters: 'a', 'bin', and 'n'.
Inside the function, there are two recursive calls to 'f' with different values for 'bin'.
The function appends 'bin' to the list 'a' if 'bin' is not greater than 'n'.
The function 'g' is defined, which takes two parameters: 'n' and 'p'.
Inside the function, there is a variable 'm' initialized to -1<<20.
The function finds the index of 'n' in the list 'a' using bisect_left and assigns it to 'x'.
If 'x' is not equal to the length of 'a' and the element at index 'x' is equal to 'n', 'm' is set to 1.
The function checks if the square of the element at index 'p' in 'a' is greater than 'n'. If it is, 'm' is returned.
If 'n' is divisible by the element at index 'p' in 'a', the function recursively calls 'g' with 'n' divided by the element at index 'p' and 'p' incremented by 1, and adds 1 to 'm'.
The function returns the maximum value between 'm' and the result of recursively calling 'g' with 'n' and 'p' incremented by 1.
The code reads an integer 'n' from input.
If 'n' is odd, -1 is printed and the program exits.
The function 'f' is called with the list 'a', 0, and 'n' as arguments.
The list 'a' is sorted and a large number (10^20) is appended to it.
The function 'g' is called with 'n' and 0 as arguments and the result is assigned to 'b'.
If 'b' is less than 0, it is set to -1.
The value of 'b' is printed.
