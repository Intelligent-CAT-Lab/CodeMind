<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input and assigns them to variables a and b.
Then it calculates three values: a-b, a+b, and a*b.
Finally, it prints the maximum value among these three calculated values.
In this case, a is -13 and b is 3.
So, a-b = -13-3 = -16, a+b = -13+3 = -10, and a*b = -13*3 = -39.
The maximum value among these three is -10.
<<<Output>>>
-10
