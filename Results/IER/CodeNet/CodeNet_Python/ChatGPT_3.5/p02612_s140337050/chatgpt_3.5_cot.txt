<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input and assigns it to the variable n.
It then checks if n is divisible by 1000 (i.e., n % 1000 == 0). If it is, it prints 0.
If n is not divisible by 1000, it calculates the remainder when n is divided by 1000 (i.e., n % 1000) and subtracts it from 1000. The result is then printed.
In this case, the input is 1900. Since 1900 is divisible by 1000, the code will print 0.
<<<Output>>>
