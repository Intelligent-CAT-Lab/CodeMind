<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string `s` and calculates the number of substrings of `s` that are divisible by 2019.

First, it initializes a list `memo` with 2019 elements, all set to 0. This list will be used to store the count of each remainder when dividing a substring by 2019.

Then, it initializes `num` to 0 and `t` to 1. These variables will be used to calculate the remainder of each substring.

Next, it iterates through the characters of `s` in reverse order. For each character `i`, it converts it to an integer and multiplies it by `t`. It then adds this value to `num` and takes the remainder when dividing by 2019. This calculates the remainder of the current substring.

After that, it multiplies `t` by 10 and takes the remainder when dividing by 2019. This is done to update the multiplier for the next character.

Then, it increments the count of the current remainder in `memo`.

Finally, it calculates the total number of substrings that are divisible by 2019 by iterating through `memo` and adding the count of each remainder to the answer variable `ans`. The formula used is `p*(p-1)//2`, which calculates the number of combinations of 2 elements from `p`.

The code then prints the final value of `ans`, which is the number of substrings of `s` that are divisible by 2019.
