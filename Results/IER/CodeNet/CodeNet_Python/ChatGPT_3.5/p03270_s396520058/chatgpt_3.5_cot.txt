<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by defining some utility functions and constants. It then initializes the variable `n` to 6000.
Next, it calculates the factorial and inverse factorial values using a loop. These values will be used to calculate combinations later on.
The code defines two functions: `comb` and `h`. The `comb` function calculates the combination of two numbers, and the `h` function calculates the number of ways to distribute `r` identical objects into `n` distinct boxes.
The code then reads two integers `k` and `n` from input.
Next, there is a loop that iterates from 2 to `2 * k + 1`. For each iteration, it calculates the value of `ret` and prints it.
The value of `m` is calculated as the minimum of `i // 2` and `(k - (i + 1) // 2 + 1)`. This value will be used in the following loops.
If `i` is odd, there is a loop that iterates from 0 to `m`. For each iteration, it calculates the value of `ret` by multiplying the combination, power of 2, and `h` values.
If `i` is even, there is a loop that iterates from 0 to `m`. For each iteration, it calculates the value of `ret` by multiplying the combination, power of 2, and `h` values. There is an additional condition for `j = 0` to calculate the value of `ret`.
The final value of `ret` is printed after each iteration of the loop.
