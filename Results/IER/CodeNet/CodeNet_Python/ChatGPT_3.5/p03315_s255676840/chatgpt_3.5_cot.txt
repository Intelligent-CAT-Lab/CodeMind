<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string S.
It then uses the count() method to count the number of occurrences of the character "+" in the string and multiplies it by 1.
Similarly, it counts the number of occurrences of the character "-" in the string and multiplies it by -1.
Finally, it prints the difference between the two counts.
In this case, the input string is "+-++", so the count of "+" is 3 and the count of "-" is 1.
Therefore, the output will be 3 - 1 = 2.
