<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input: a, b, and k.
It then checks if a is greater than or equal to k. If it is, it prints the difference between a and k, and the value of b.
If a is not greater than or equal to k, it checks if the sum of a and b is greater than or equal to k. If it is, it prints 0 and the difference between the sum of a and b and k.
If neither of the above conditions are met, it prints 0, 0.
In this case, a is 2, b is 3, and k is 3.
Since a is not greater than or equal to k, the code checks if the sum of a and b is greater than or equal to k. The sum of 2 and 3 is 5, which is greater than k.
Therefore, the code prints 0 and the difference between the sum of a and b (5) and k (3), which is 2.
