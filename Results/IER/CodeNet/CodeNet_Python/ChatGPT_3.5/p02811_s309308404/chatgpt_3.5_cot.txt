<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input and assigns them to variables a and b.
It then checks if the product of 500 and a is greater than or equal to b.
If the condition is true, it prints 'Yes', otherwise it prints 'No'.
In this case, 500 * 2 is equal to 1000, which is greater than 900.
Therefore, the output of the code would be 'Yes'.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
