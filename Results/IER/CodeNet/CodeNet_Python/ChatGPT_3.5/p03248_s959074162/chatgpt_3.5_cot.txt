<<<Analysis>>>
The code first reads a string S from the input and calculates its length N. It then adds a '0' character at the beginning of the string and assigns it back to S.
The code checks three conditions:
1. If the second character of S is '0', it prints -1 and exits.
2. If the last character of S is '1', it prints -1 and exits.
3. If S is not equal to its reverse, it prints -1 and exits.

If none of these conditions are met, the code initializes an empty list called edges and a variable base to 1.
Then, it enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N-1. For each iteration, it appends a tuple (base, i+1) to the edges list, where i is the loop variable.
If the i-th character of S is '1', it updates the value of base to i+1.

Finally, the code prints each tuple in the edges list.

In this case, the input string is '1111'. The conditions in the if statements are not met, so the code proceeds to the loop.
The loop iterates from 1 to 3 (N-1), and in each iteration, it appends a tuple (base, i+1) to the edges list.
Since all characters in S are '1', the value of base is updated to 2 in the first iteration, to 3 in the second iteration, and to 4 in the third iteration.
Therefore, the edges list contains the tuples (1, 2), (2, 3), and (3, 4).
