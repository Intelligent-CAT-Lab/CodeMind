<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N and variable K are initialized to 4 and 3, respectively.
The variable MOD is initialized to 10^9 + 7.
A 2D list D is created with dimensions (N+1) x (K+1), filled with zeros.
The value at index [0][0] of D is set to 1.
The code then enters a nested loop. The outer loop iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), and the inner loop iterates from 1 to K (inclusive).
For each iteration, the code calculates the value at index [n][k] of D using the formula (D0[k-1] + k * D0[k]) % MOD, where D0 is the previous row of D (D[n-1]).
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of D[N][K].
