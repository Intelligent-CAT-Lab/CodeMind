<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input and assigns them to variables a and b.
Then it multiplies the values of a and b and prints the result.
In this case, the input is "2 5", so a is assigned the value 2 and b is assigned the value 5.
The code then calculates the product of a and b, which is 2 * 5 = 10.
Finally, it prints the value 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
