<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a list of dominoes patterns, where each pattern is represented as a string. The patterns are then processed to remove spaces and newline characters.
The code then reads an integer input n.
If n is equal to 2, the code prints -1 and exits.
If n is equal to 3, the code prints the first domino pattern and exits.
The code then splits each domino pattern into a list of strings, where each string represents a row of the pattern.
The code defines a function write(ix, col) that writes a portion of a domino pattern to the output. The function takes two parameters: ix, which represents the index of the domino pattern to use, and col, which represents the number of columns to write before the domino pattern.
The code initializes col to 0 and writes a portion of the domino pattern corresponding to n % 4 columns. It then updates col and calculates the remaining number of columns, rem.
The code enters a loop that continues while rem is greater than 0. In each iteration, it writes a portion of the first domino pattern and updates col and rem.
The loop continues until rem is no longer greater than 0.
