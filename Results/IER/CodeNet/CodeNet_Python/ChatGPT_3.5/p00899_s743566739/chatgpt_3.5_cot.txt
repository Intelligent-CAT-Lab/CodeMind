<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts with an infinite loop that will continue until a break statement is encountered.
Inside the loop, it reads an integer value n from the input.
If n is equal to 0, the loop is terminated using the break statement.
Otherwise, it proceeds to read n strings from the input and stores them in the list ss.
Next, it creates a new list ts that contains only the strings from ss that do not have any substring present in any other string in ss.
Then, it calculates the length of ts and stores it in the variable m.
The code defines a function overlap(c, d) that takes two indices c and d and returns the length of the longest common prefix between the strings ts[c] and ts[d].
It uses this function to create a 2D list ov that stores the overlap values for all pairs of strings in ts.
Next, it creates a 2D list memo that will be used for memoization. All elements of memo are initialized to -1.
The code defines a recursive function rec(c, cs) that takes two arguments: the index c of the current string and a bit set cs that represents the set of strings to be used.
The function uses memoization to avoid redundant calculations.
Inside the function, it checks if cs is equal to 0. If it is, it returns 0.
Then, it checks if the value of memo[c][cs] is already calculated. If it is, it returns the stored value.
Otherwise, it calculates the maximum overlap value for the current string c by iterating over all strings d in the set cs and recursively calling the function rec with the updated set cs - (1<<d).
The maximum overlap value is stored in the variable ans and also stored in memo[c][cs] for future use.
Finally, the function returns the maximum overlap value.
The code calculates the maximum overlap value for all strings in ts by iterating over the range of m and calling the function rec with the set ((1<<m) - 1) - (1<<i) for each index i.
The maximum overlap value is stored in the variable maxov.
Then, it calculates the sum of the lengths of all strings in ts and subtracts the maximum overlap value to get the final answer, which is stored in the variable ans.
Finally, it prints the value of ans.

The output cannot be determined without knowing the input values.
