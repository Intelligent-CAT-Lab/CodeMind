<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers x and y as input.
It then checks if the product of x and y is greater than 0. If it is, it assigns the value 2 to the variable k. Otherwise, it assigns the value 1 to k.
Next, it checks if x is equal to y. If it is, it prints 0.
If x is equal to 0 and y is less than 0, it prints the absolute value of y plus 1.
If x is less than y, it checks if k is equal to 2 or if x is equal to 0. If either condition is true, it prints the difference between y and x.
If y is equal to 0, it prints the absolute value of x.
Otherwise, it prints the absolute value of the difference between the absolute values of y and x, plus k.
If x is greater than y, it checks if y is equal to 0 and if x is less than 0. If both conditions are true, it prints the absolute value of x.
Otherwise, it prints the absolute value of the difference between the absolute values of y and x, plus k.
