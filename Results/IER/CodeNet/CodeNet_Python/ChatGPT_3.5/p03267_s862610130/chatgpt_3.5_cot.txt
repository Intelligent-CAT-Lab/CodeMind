<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called solve that takes an integer l as input.
Inside the function, it initializes a variable n to 0 and enters a while loop that continues until 2^n is greater than l. In each iteration of the loop, it increments n by 1.
After the while loop, it initializes an empty list called E.
Then, it enters a for loop that iterates from n-1 to -1 with a step of -1. In each iteration, it calculates x as 2^i.
If i is not equal to n-1, it appends a tuple (i, i+1, 0) to the list E, and another tuple (i, i+1, x) to the list E.
If l - x is greater than or equal to 2^(n-1), it appends a tuple (i, n-1, l-x) to the list E, and subtracts x from l.
Finally, it prints the values of n and the length of E. Then, it prints each tuple in E, with the first two values incremented by 1.
Outside the function, it reads an integer l from input and calls the solve function with l as the argument.
