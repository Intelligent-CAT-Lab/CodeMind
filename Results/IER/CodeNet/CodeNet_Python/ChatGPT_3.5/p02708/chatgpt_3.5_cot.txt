<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 3 and the variable k is initialized to 2.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the final answer.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from k to n+2 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 2 to 5.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the following expression:
(((2*n-i+1)*i)//2)-(i*(i-1)//2)+1
This expression calculates the sum of the arithmetic sequence from 1 to i, subtracts the sum of the arithmetic sequence from 1 to i-1, and adds 1.
The result of this expression is added to ans.
After the loop finishes, the code calculates ans modulo (10^9+7) and prints the result.
