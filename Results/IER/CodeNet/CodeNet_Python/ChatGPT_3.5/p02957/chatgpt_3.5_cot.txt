<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers A and B as input.
It then calculates the value of x using the formula (A^2 - B^2) / (2*(A-B)).
The code checks if x is an integer by checking if x%1 is equal to 0.
If x is an integer, it prints the value of x as an integer.
Otherwise, it prints 'IMPOSSIBLE'.
In this case, A=2 and B=16.
Using the formula, x = (2^2 - 16^2) / (2*(2-16)) = (-252) / (-28) = 9.
Since 9 is an integer, the code will print 9.
<<<Output>>>
9
