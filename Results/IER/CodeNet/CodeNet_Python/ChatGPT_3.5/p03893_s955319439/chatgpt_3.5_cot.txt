<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input and assigns it to the variable x.
The variable j is initialized to 2.
The code then enters a loop that iterates x times.
In each iteration, the code multiplies j by 2 and adds 2 to it.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of j.
In this case, since x is 2, the loop will iterate twice.
In the first iteration, j is multiplied by 2 and added by 2, resulting in 6.
In the second iteration, j is again multiplied by 2 and added by 2, resulting in 14.
Therefore, the final value of j is 14.
<<<Output>>>
14
