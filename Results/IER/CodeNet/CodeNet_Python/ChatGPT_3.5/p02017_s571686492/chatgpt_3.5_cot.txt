<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four inputs: H, W, x, and y. These inputs are mapped to the variables H, W, x, and y respectively.
The code then checks two conditions:
1. H*W%2==1: This condition checks if the product of H and W is odd. If it is, it means that the total number of cells in the grid is odd.
2. (x+y)%2==1: This condition checks if the sum of x and y is odd. If it is, it means that the starting cell (x, y) is in an odd position.

If both conditions are true, the code prints "No". Otherwise, it prints "Yes".

In this case, H=3, W=5, x=1, and y=4. The product of H and W is 15, which is odd. The sum of x and y is 5, which is also odd. Therefore, both conditions are true and the code will print "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
