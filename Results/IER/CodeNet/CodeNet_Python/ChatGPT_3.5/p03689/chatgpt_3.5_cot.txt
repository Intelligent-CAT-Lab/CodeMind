<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four integers as input: H, W, h, and w.
It then checks if H is divisible by h and W is divisible by w. If both conditions are true, it prints "No".
If W is not divisible by w, it prints "Yes" and enters a loop that iterates over the range of H.
Inside this loop, it enters another loop that iterates over the range of W.
For each iteration, it checks if x is not equal to 0. If it is not, it prints a space character.
Then, it checks if x modulo w is not equal to w-1. If it is not, it prints the number 100000. Otherwise, it prints the number -100000*(w-1)-1.
After each inner loop iteration, it prints a newline character.
If W is divisible by w, it prints "Yes" and enters a loop that iterates over the range of H.
Inside this loop, it enters another loop that iterates over the range of W.
For each iteration, it checks if x is not equal to 0. If it is not, it prints a space character.
Then, it checks if y modulo h is not equal to h-1. If it is not, it prints the number 100000. Otherwise, it prints the number -100000*(h-1)-1.
After each inner loop iteration, it prints a newline character.
