<<<Analysis>>>
The variables T1, T2, R1, and R2 are initialized to 9, 8, 1000, and 999 respectively.
The code first checks if either R1 or R2 is equal to -1. In this case, neither R1 nor R2 is -1, so the code moves to the else block.
In the else block, the code checks if R1 is greater than R2. Since R1 is 1000 and R2 is 999, R1 is indeed greater than R2. Therefore, the code prints "Alice".
<<<Output>>>
Alice
