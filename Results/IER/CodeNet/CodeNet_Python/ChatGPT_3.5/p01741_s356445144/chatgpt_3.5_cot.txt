<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes a float input and assigns it to the variable d.
Then it calculates the integer part of d + 1 and the square root of 2 multiplied by d.
Finally, it prints the maximum value between the integer part of d + 1 and the square root of 2 multiplied by d.
In this case, the input is 1.000.
The integer part of 1.000 + 1 is 2.
The square root of 2 multiplied by 1.000 is approximately 1.414.
The maximum value between 2 and 1.414 is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
