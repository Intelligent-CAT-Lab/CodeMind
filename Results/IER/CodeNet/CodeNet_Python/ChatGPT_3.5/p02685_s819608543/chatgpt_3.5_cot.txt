<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines several functions: power, mul, div, div2, modinv, and cmb. These functions are used to perform mathematical calculations.

The code then initializes some variables: mod, sys.setrecursionlimit, NNN, g1, g2, and inverse. These variables are used in the calculations later.

Next, the code takes input for variables N, M, and K.

The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to K (inclusive). For each iteration, it calculates a value for r using the cmb function, M, and pow. The calculated value is added to r and then modulo mod is taken.

Finally, the code prints the value of r.
