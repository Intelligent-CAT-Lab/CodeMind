<<<Analysis>>>
The code imports the factorial function from the math module and initializes the variable MAX to 10^9+7.
The code then takes two integers N and M as input.
It calculates the difference between N and M and stores it in the variable diff.
The code checks if the absolute value of diff is greater than 1. If it is, it prints 0 and exits.
If diff is equal to 0, it means N and M are equal. In this case, it calculates the factorial of N and M, multiplies them together, multiplies the result by 2, and takes the modulo MAX. The result is then printed.
If diff is not equal to 0, it means N and M are not equal but the difference is within 1. In this case, it calculates the factorial of N and M, multiplies them together, and takes the modulo MAX. The result is then printed.
In this case, N and M are both 2, so diff is 0. The code calculates factorial(2)*factorial(2)*2%MAX, which is 2*2*2%10^9+7 = 8%10^9+7 = 8. Therefore, the output is 8.
