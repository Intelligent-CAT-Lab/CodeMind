<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string S and removes any leading or trailing whitespace characters using the strip() method.
It then checks if the sorted version of S is equal to the list ['a', 'b', 'c'].
If the condition is true, it prints 'Yes'. Otherwise, it prints 'No'.
In this case, the input string is 'bac'. When sorted, it becomes 'abc', which is equal to the target list.
Therefore, the code will print 'Yes'.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
