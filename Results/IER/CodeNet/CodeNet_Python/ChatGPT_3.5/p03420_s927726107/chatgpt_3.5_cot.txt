<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by defining several input functions and setting the recursion limit and modulo value.
Then, it defines a function called "solve" which takes no arguments.
Inside the "solve" function, it reads two integers n and k from input.
If k is 0, it prints n^2 and returns.
Otherwise, it initializes a variable ans to 0.
Then, it enters a loop that iterates from k+1 to n+1 (inclusive) with variable b.
For each value of b, it calculates the integer division of n by b and stores it in variable s.
It adds s*(b-k) to ans.
Then, it adds max(0, n-s*b-k+1) to ans.
Finally, it prints the value of ans.
Outside the "solve" function, it checks if the script is being run as the main program.
If it is, it calls the "solve" function.
