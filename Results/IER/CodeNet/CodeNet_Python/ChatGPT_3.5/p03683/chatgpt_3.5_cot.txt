<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes input in the form of a string and splits it into two parts, N and M. In this case, N=2 and M=2.
The code then initializes a variable thres to 10^9+7.
Next, it checks if the absolute difference between N and M is equal to 1. Since N and M are both 2, the condition is not met.
The code then checks if N is equal to M. Since N and M are both 2, the condition is met.
Inside the if block, the code initializes a variable retVal to 2.
It then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), which is 1 to 2 in this case.
For each iteration, it multiplies retVal by i^2 and checks if retVal is greater than or equal to thres. If it is, it takes the modulo of retVal with thres.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of retVal, which is 8.
<<<Output>>>
8
