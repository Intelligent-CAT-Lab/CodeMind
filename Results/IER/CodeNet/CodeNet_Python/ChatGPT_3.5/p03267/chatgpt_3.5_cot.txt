<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by importing the sys module and defining three lambda functions: sr, ir, and lr. These functions are used to read input from the standard input and convert it to the desired format.

The code then reads an integer L from the input.

Next, it initializes an empty list called edges, which will be used to store tuples representing edges in a graph.

The code calculates the length of L in binary representation using the bit_length() method. This length is stored in the variable length.

The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to length-1. In each iteration, it appends two tuples to the edges list. The first tuple represents an edge from i to i+1 with a weight of 2^(i-1), and the second tuple represents an edge from i to i+1 with a weight of 0.

After the loop, the code enters another loop that iterates from 0 to length-2. In each iteration, it checks if the i-th bit of L is set to 1 using the bitwise AND operator (&). If it is, it subtracts 2^i from L and appends a tuple to the edges list representing an edge from i+1 to length with a weight of L.

Finally, the code prints the values of length and the length of the edges list. Then it prints each tuple in the edges list.
