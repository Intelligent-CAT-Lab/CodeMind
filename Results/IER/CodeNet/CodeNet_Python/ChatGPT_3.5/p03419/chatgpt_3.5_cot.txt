<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and variable m are initialized to 2 and 2, respectively.
The code then checks if either n or m is equal to 1. In this case, neither n nor m is equal to 1, so the code proceeds to the else block.
In the else block, the code calculates the result by subtracting 2 from both n and m, and then multiplying the results together. In this case, (2 - 2) * (2 - 2) = 0.
Finally, the code prints the final value of the result, which is 0.
<<<Output>>>
0
