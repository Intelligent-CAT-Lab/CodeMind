<<<Analysis>>>
The code imports the `stdin` module from the `sys` library, which allows reading input from the console.
The code then reads a line of input using `stdin.readline()` and removes any trailing whitespace using `rstrip()`. The input in this case is "SAT".
The code initializes a dictionary called `week` with the days of the week as keys and their corresponding values as integers. For example, 'SUN' is mapped to 0, 'MON' is mapped to 1, and so on.
The code then uses the `week` dictionary to get the value corresponding to the input 'SAT', which is 6.
Finally, the code subtracts the value obtained from 7 and prints the result, which is 1.
