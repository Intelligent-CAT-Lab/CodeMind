The variable n is initialized to 2.
The code then initializes an empty list called ans, which will be used to store pairs of numbers.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n-2 (inclusive), which means it will iterate once since n is 2.
Inside this loop, the code checks if i is odd (i%2 == 1). If it is, it appends a tuple (i, 0) to the ans list.
The code then enters another loop that iterates from 0 to n-2 (inclusive), which means it will iterate once since n is 2.
Inside this loop, the code checks if i%6 is equal to 1. If it is, it enters another loop that iterates from 2 to n-1 (inclusive).
Inside this nested loop, the code checks if j is even (j%2 == 0). If it is, it appends a tuple (i, j) to the ans list.
The code then checks if i%6 is equal to 4. If it is, it enters another loop that iterates from 0 to n-1 (inclusive).
Inside this nested loop, the code checks if j is odd (j%2 == 1). If it is, it appends a tuple (i, j) to the ans list.
Finally, the code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n-1 (inclusive).
Inside this loop, the code checks if (n-1+j)%2 is equal to 1. If it is, it appends a tuple (n-1, j) to the ans list.
After all the loops finish, the code prints the length of the ans list and then prints each pair of numbers in the ans list.
Since n is 2, the ans list will contain the following tuples: [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1)].
Therefore, the output will be:
3
0 0
1 0
1 1
