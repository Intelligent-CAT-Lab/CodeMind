<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to the input value, which is 5 in this case.
The variable rent is initialized to 100000.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n-1 (inclusive), meaning it will run 5 times.
In each iteration of the loop, the code calculates the new value of rent using the formula: rent = math.ceil(rent*1.05/1000)*1000.
The math.ceil() function is used to round up the result to the nearest integer.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of rent.
<<<Output>>>
105000
