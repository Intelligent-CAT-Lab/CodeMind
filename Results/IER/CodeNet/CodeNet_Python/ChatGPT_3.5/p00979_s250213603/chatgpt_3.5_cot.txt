<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by reading an integer T from the input. In this case, T is 19.
Then, the code calls the solve() function passing T as an argument and prints the result.
Inside the solve() function, there is a series of calculations to determine the value of sec, which represents the number of seconds it takes to solve the problem given T.
First, it checks if T is less than or equal to 3. If it is, it returns T.
Otherwise, it initializes sec to 1, T is decremented by 1, and f is set to 3.
Then, there is a while loop that continues as long as T is greater than or equal to 2 times f.
Inside the loop, T is decreased by 2 times f, f is multiplied by 3, and sec is increased by 2.
After the loop, there is an if-else statement that checks if T is greater than or equal to f.
If it is, T is decreased by f and sec is increased by 1. Otherwise, f is divided by 3.
Finally, there is another while loop that continues as long as T is greater than 0.
Inside the loop, t is calculated as T divided by f, T is decreased by t times f, sec is increased by t, and f is divided by 3.
The solve() function returns sec as the final result.
The main() function reads an integer T from the input, calls solve(T), and prints the result.
