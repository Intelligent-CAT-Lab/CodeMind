<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers n and m as input.
It then calculates the number of even pairs and odd pairs using the formula n * (n-1) // 2 and m * (m-1) // 2, respectively.
Finally, it adds the number of even pairs and odd pairs and prints the result.
In this case, n is 2 and m is 1.
The number of even pairs is calculated as 2 * (2-1) // 2 = 1.
The number of odd pairs is calculated as 1 * (1-1) // 2 = 0.
The final result is 1 + 0 = 1.
