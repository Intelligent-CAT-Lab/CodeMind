<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called egcd that calculates the extended Euclidean algorithm. It takes two parameters, a and b.
Inside the function, it initializes four variables x, y, u, and v to 0, 1, 1, and 0 respectively.
Then it enters a while loop that continues until a becomes 0.
Inside the loop, it calculates the quotient q and remainder r of dividing b by a using the // and % operators.
It also calculates new values for x and y using the formulas x-u*q and y-v*q.
Then it updates the values of b, a, x, y, u, and v using the formulas a=r, b=a, u=x, v=y, x=m, and y=n respectively.
After the loop finishes, it assigns the value of b to the variable gcd.
Then it assigns the values of x and y to the variables x and y respectively.
Next, it checks if the equation y * a + x * b == gcd is true.
If it is true, it swaps the values of x and y using a temporary variable tmp.
Finally, it prints the values of x and y.

In the given input, the values of a and b are 4 and 12 respectively.
The code calls the egcd function with these values and assigns the returned values to the variables gcd, x, and y.
Since 4 and 12 are both divisible by 4, the gcd is 4.
The values of x and y are calculated as -3 and 1 respectively.
The equation y * a + x * b == gcd is true, so the values of x and y are not swapped.
The code then prints the values of x and y, which are -3 and 1 respectively.

<<<Output>>>
