<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function ex_euclid that takes two parameters x and y.
Inside the function, several variables are initialized: c0 and c1 are set to x and y, a0 and a1 are set to 1 and 0, and b0 and b1 are set to 0 and 1.
The code then enters a while loop that continues as long as c1 is not zero.
Inside the loop, the code updates the values of a0, a1, b0, b1, c0, and c1 using the extended Euclidean algorithm.
Finally, the function returns the values of c0, a0, and b0.
Outside the function, the code reads two integers x and y from input and assigns them to the variables x and y.
The code then calls the ex_euclid function with x and y as arguments and assigns the returned values to the variables c, a, and b.
Finally, the code prints the values of a and b.
