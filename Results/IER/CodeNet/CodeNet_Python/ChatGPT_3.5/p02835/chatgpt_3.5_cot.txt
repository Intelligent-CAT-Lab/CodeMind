<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input and assigns them to variables a, b, and c.
It then checks if the sum of a, b, and c is less than 22. If it is, it prints 'win'. Otherwise, it prints 'bust'.
In this case, the sum of 5, 7, and 9 is 21, which is less than 22. Therefore, the output will be 'win'.
<<<Output>>>
win
