<<<Analysis>>>
The code first reads an integer n from the input, which is 6 in this case.
Then it checks if n is equal to 2. If it is, it prints -1 and exits.
If n is not equal to 2, it checks if n is equal to 3. If it is, it assigns the value of a3 to the variable ans.
If n is not equal to 3, it checks if n is divisible by 2. If it is, it creates a 2D list ans with dimensions n x n, filled with ".".
It then iterates over the first half of the rows and columns of ans and assigns the corresponding values from a21 to the corresponding positions in ans.
Next, it iterates over the first half of the rows and columns of the remaining part of ans (after subtracting 2 from n) and assigns the corresponding values from a22 to the corresponding positions in ans.
If n is not divisible by 2, it checks if n modulo 4 is equal to 1. If it is, it creates a 2D list ans with dimensions n x n, filled with ".".
It then assigns the values from a5 to the first 5 rows and columns of ans.
Next, it iterates over the remaining part of ans (after subtracting 5 from n) and assigns the corresponding values from a21 to the corresponding positions in ans.
Finally, it iterates over the remaining part of ans (after subtracting 5 from n) and assigns the corresponding values from a22 to the corresponding positions in ans.
If n modulo 4 is not equal to 1, it checks if n modulo 4 is equal to 3. If it is, it creates a 2D list ans with dimensions n x n, filled with ".".
It then assigns the values from a7 to the first 7 rows and columns of ans.
Next, it iterates over the remaining part of ans (after subtracting 7 from n) and assigns the corresponding values from a21 to the corresponding positions in ans.
Finally, it iterates over the remaining part of ans (after subtracting 7 from n) and assigns the corresponding values from a22 to the corresponding positions in ans.
After constructing the ans list, the code prints each row of ans, separated by a space.
