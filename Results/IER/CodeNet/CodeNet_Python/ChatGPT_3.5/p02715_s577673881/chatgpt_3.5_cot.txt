<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs N and K. N and K are initialized to 3 and 2, respectively.
The variable MOD is initialized to 10^9 + 7.
The code then initializes a list called just with K+1 elements, all set to 0.
The code enters a loop that iterates from K to 1 (inclusive), and for each value of X, it calculates just[X] as (K // X) ^ N % MOD.
Then, the code enters another loop that iterates from X+X to K (inclusive), and for each value of mul, it subtracts just[mul] from just[X].
After the loops finish, the code initializes a variable ans to 0.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to K (inclusive), and for each value of X, it adds X * just[X] % MOD to ans, and takes the modulo of ans with MOD.
Finally, the code prints the value of ans.
