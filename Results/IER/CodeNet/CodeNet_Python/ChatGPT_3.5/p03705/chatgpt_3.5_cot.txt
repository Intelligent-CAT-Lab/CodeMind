<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three inputs: n, a, and b.
It first checks if n is greater than or equal to 2.
If it is, it checks if b is greater than or equal to a.
If both conditions are true, it calculates the result using the formula (n-2)*(b-a)+1 and prints it.
If the second condition is false, it prints 0.
If n is less than 2, it checks if a is equal to b.
If it is, it prints 1.
If it is not, it prints 0.
In this case, n is 4, a is 4, and b is 6.
Since n is greater than or equal to 2 and b is greater than or equal to a, the code calculates the result as (4-2)*(6-4)+1 = 5 and prints it.
<<<Output>>>
5
