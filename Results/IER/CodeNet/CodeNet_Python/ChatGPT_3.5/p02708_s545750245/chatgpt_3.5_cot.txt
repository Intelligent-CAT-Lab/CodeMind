<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers n and k as input.
The variable tot is initialized to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from k to n+2 (inclusive).
For each iteration, it calculates the value of n+2-i+(i-1)*(n+1-i) and adds it to tot.
After the loop finishes, the code calculates the remainder of tot divided by 1000000007 and converts it to a string.
Finally, the code prints the string representation of the remainder.
In this case, n=3 and k=2.
The loop will iterate from 2 to 5 (inclusive).
For each iteration, it calculates the value of n+2-i+(i-1)*(n+1-i) and adds it to tot.
The values calculated in each iteration are: 4, 6, 6, 4.
The final value of tot is 20.
The remainder of 20 divided by 1000000007 is 20.
Therefore, the output of the code is "20".
