<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input N and initializes a boolean variable can_be_ans to False.
Then it enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 10^5 (exclusive) with variable k.
Inside the loop, it checks if 2 * N is equal to k * (k - 1). If it is, it sets can_be_ans to True, breaks out of the loop, and continues to the next step.
If 2 * N is less than k * (k - 1), it breaks out of the loop.
After the loop, it checks if can_be_ans is False. If it is, it prints "No" and exits the program.
If can_be_ans is True, it prints "Yes" and the value of k.
Then it initializes a 2D list s_grid with dimensions k x (k - 1) and fills it with values according to a specific pattern.
Finally, it prints the values in s_grid row by row, with each row separated by a space.
