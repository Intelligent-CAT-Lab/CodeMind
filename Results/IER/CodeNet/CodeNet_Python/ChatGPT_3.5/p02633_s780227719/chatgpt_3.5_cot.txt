<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input and assigns it to the variable X.
Then, it imports the math module to use the gcd (greatest common divisor) function.
The code calculates the gcd of 360 and X using math.gcd(360, X).
It then divides 360 by the gcd and assigns the result to the variable ans.
Finally, it prints the value of ans.
In this case, X is 90. The gcd of 360 and 90 is 90. So, ans will be 360 // 90 = 4.
<<<Output>>>
4
