<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes input from the user and splits it into a list of strings using the split() function. In this case, the input "5 8" will be split into the list ['5', '8'].
The code then converts the first element of the list, '5', into an integer using the int() function.
Similarly, it converts the second element of the list, '8', into an integer.
Finally, it subtracts the second integer from the first integer and prints the result.
In this case, the result of the subtraction would be -3.
<<<Output>>>
-3
