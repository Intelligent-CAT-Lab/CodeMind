<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input and assigns it to the variable x.
Then it calculates the cube of x by multiplying it with itself twice.
Finally, it prints the result of the cube calculation.
In this case, the input is 2, so the code will calculate 2 * 2 * 2, which is 8.
<<<Output>>>
8
