<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input K and initializes it to the variable K.
It then prints the number 50.
Next, it calculates the quotient and remainder of K divided by 50 and assigns them to variables a and b, respectively.
The code initializes an empty list called ans.
It enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 50-b (exclusive), which means it will run 50-b times.
Inside the loop, it appends the string representation of a+i to the ans list.
After the first loop finishes, it enters another loop that iterates from 0 to b (exclusive), which means it will run b times.
Inside this loop, it appends the string representation of a+50-b+i+1 to the ans list.
Finally, it prints the elements of the ans list joined by a space.

In this case, since K is 0, the quotient a will also be 0 and the remainder b will also be 0.
Therefore, the first loop will not run and the second loop will also not run.
The ans list will remain empty.
The code will print 50 and then an empty line.

<<<Output>>>
50
