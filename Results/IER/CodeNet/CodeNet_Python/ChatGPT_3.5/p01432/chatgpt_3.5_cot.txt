<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines several functions: mul, fast_pow, and solve. It also imports the sys module and defines readline and write functions for input and output.

The solve function is the main function that performs the calculations. It takes three inputs: S, N, and K. It first calculates the absolute value of S and checks if it is zero. If it is, it prints 0 and returns.

If N is 1, it checks if S is divisible by K. If it is not, it prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the result of S divided by K.

If N is not 1, it initializes some variables and performs calculations using loops and matrix operations. Finally, it prints the result.

The input given is S=6, N=6, and K=1.
