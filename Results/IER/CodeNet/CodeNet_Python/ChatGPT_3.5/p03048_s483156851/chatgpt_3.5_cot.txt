<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four inputs: r, g, b, and n. These inputs are stored in variables r, g, b, and n respectively.
The code then defines a function dfs that takes three parameters: i, ais, and tot.
Inside the dfs function, there are several if statements and a while loop.
The function returns 0 if tot is less than 0, indicating that the current combination of numbers is not valid.
If i is equal to the length of ais, the function returns 1 if tot is equal to 0, indicating that the current combination of numbers is valid. Otherwise, it returns 0.
If i is equal to the length of ais minus 1, the function returns 1 if tot is greater than or equal to 0 and tot is divisible by ais[i]. Otherwise, it returns 0.
If none of the above conditions are met, the function checks if the current combination of i and tot is already stored in the mem dictionary. If it is, the function returns the corresponding value from mem.
If the combination is not in mem, the function calculates the new value of tot and initializes cumul to 0.
The function then recursively calls dfs with i+1, ais, and tot as parameters and adds the result to cumul.
Inside the while loop, tot is decremented by ais[i] and the function recursively calls dfs with i+1, ais, and tot as parameters. The result is added to cumul.
Finally, the function stores the value of cumul in mem and returns cumul.
After defining the dfs function, the code calls dfs with 0 as the initial value of i and [r,g,b] as the initial value of ais. The result is printed.
