<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a list called fib with 45 elements, all set to 0. It then sets the first two elements of the list to 1.
The code then takes an input value n.
Next, it enters a loop that starts from 2 and goes up to 44 (exclusive). In each iteration, it calculates the Fibonacci number at index i by adding the previous two Fibonacci numbers.
Finally, it prints the Fibonacci number at index n.
In this case, since n is 3, the code will calculate the Fibonacci number at index 3, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
