<<<Analysis>>>
The variable H, W, and d are initialized to 2, 2, and 1, respectively.
The code checks if d is odd or even. In this case, d is odd, so it enters the first if statement.
The code then enters a loop that iterates H times, which is 2 in this case.
For each iteration, it prints a line of characters based on the condition (i+j)%2 == 0. If the condition is true, it prints "R", otherwise it prints "Y".
Since W is 2, it prints two characters per line. The first line will be "RY" and the second line will be "YR".
Therefore, the output will be:
RY
YR
<<<Output>>>
RY
YR
