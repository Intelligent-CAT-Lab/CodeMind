<<<Analysis>>>
The code imports the necessary libraries and defines some utility functions.
It then initializes the variable MOD to 10^9 + 7.
The function fact_table is defined to calculate the factorial table and inverse table modulo MOD.
The function main takes three arguments: N, M, and MOD. It calculates the value of ret using the fact_table function and some mathematical operations.
The code then checks if the script is being run in an online judge environment. If it is, it uses the numba library to compile the functions and imports the main function from the compiled module.
Finally, the code reads the values of N and M from the input and calls the main function with these values and MOD. It prints the output of the main function.
