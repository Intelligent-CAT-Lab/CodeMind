<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 7 and the variable k is initialized to 4.
The variable rot is calculated as the integer division of n by k, which in this case is 1.
The variable x is initialized to n.
The code then checks several conditions:
- If k is equal to 1 or n is equal to k or n modulo k is equal to 0, x is set to 0.
- If rot is greater than or equal to 1, x is set to n minus k times rot.
The variable t is calculated as the modulo of x by k.
Finally, the code prints the minimum value between t and the absolute value of t minus k.
