<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers n and m as input.
It then checks if n is equal to m and if both n and m are equal to 1. If this condition is true, it prints 1.
If the above condition is false, it checks if the minimum of n and m is equal to 1. If this condition is true, it prints the maximum of n and m minus 2.
If both of the above conditions are false, it calculates the product of n-2 and m-2 and prints the result.
In this case, n=2 and m=2. The first condition is false, so the code moves to the second condition. The minimum of n and m is 1, so the code prints the maximum of n and m minus 2, which is 2-2=0.
