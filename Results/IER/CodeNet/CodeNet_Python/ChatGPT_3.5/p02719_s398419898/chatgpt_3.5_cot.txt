<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers n and k as input.
It calculates the remainder of n divided by k and stores it in variable a.
Then it prints the minimum value among n, a, and the absolute difference between a and k.
In this case, n is 7 and k is 4.
The remainder of 7 divided by 4 is 3, so a is 3.
The minimum value among 7, 3, and the absolute difference between 3 and 4 (which is 1) is 1.
