<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string `s`. It initializes variables `i` and `j` to 0 and `len(s)-1` respectively. It also initializes `ans` to 0, which will be used to store the final answer.
The code then enters a while loop that continues until `i` is less than `j`. Inside this loop, there are several nested while loops and if statements.
The first nested while loop checks if both `s[i]` and `s[j]` are equal to "x". If they are, it increments `i` and decrements `j` by 1. If `i` becomes greater than `j`, it breaks out of the loop. This loop continues until `s[i]` or `s[j]` is not equal to "x".
The next if statement checks if `i` is greater than `j`. If it is, it breaks out of the loop.
The next three nested while loops check if `s[i]` or `s[j]` is equal to "x". If they are, it increments `i` or decrements `j` by 1 respectively, and increments `ans` by 1. If `i` becomes greater than `j`, it breaks out of the loop.
The next if statement checks if `i` is greater than `j`. If it is, it breaks out of the loop.
The next if statement checks if `s[i]` is not equal to `s[j]`. If it is not, it sets `ans` to -1 and breaks out of the loop.
Finally, it increments `i` and decrements `j` by 1. If `i` becomes greater than `j`, it breaks out of the loop.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of `ans`.
