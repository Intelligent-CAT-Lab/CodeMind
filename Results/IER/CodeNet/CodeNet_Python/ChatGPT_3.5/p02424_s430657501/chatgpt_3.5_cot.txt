<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input and assigns them to variables a and b.
The variable MASK is initialized to (1 << 32) - 1, which is a bitmask with all bits set to 1.
The code then prints the binary representation of the bitwise AND, OR, and XOR operations between a and b.
For the bitwise AND operation, it uses the format method to format the result as a 32-bit binary string with leading zeros.
For the bitwise OR and XOR operations, it follows the same approach.
In this case, a is 8 and b is 10.
The binary representation of 8 is 00000000000000000000000000001000.
The binary representation of 10 is 00000000000000000000000000001010.
The bitwise AND operation between 8 and 10 results in 00000000000000000000000000001000, which is 8 in decimal.
The bitwise OR operation between 8 and 10 results in 00000000000000000000000000001010, which is 10 in decimal.
The bitwise XOR operation between 8 and 10 results in 00000000000000000000000000000010, which is 2 in decimal.
