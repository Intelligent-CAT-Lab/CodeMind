<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines several utility functions and initializes some variables.
It then takes two integers N and K as input.
The code creates an instance of the ModTools class and initializes it with N+K+1 and MOD.
It then calculates the value of ans using the nCr method of the ModTools instance, passing N-1 and K-1 as arguments.
Finally, it prints the value of ans modulo MOD.
