<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input and multiplies it by 2. Then it uses the divmod function to divide the result by 60 and return the quotient and remainder as a tuple. Finally, it prints the elements of the tuple separated by a space.

In this case, the input is 0. When multiplied by 2, it becomes 0. Dividing 0 by 60 gives a quotient of 0 and a remainder of 0. Therefore, the output will be "0 0".

<<<Output>>>
0 0
