<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function f that takes two arguments: n and deno. If n is -1, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates the integer division of n by deno and adds 1 to the result.

The code then reads three integers from input: a, b, and x. It calls the function f with arguments b and x, and subtracts the result of calling f with arguments a-1 and x. Finally, it prints the result.

In this case, the input values are a=4, b=8, and x=2. The code first calls f(8, 2), which returns 8 // 2 + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5. Then it calls f(4-1, 2), which is f(3, 2), and returns 3 // 2 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2. Finally, it subtracts 2 from 5 and prints the result, which is 3.
