<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string and assigns it to the variable s. It then initializes the variable p to 700.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each character c in the string s.
Inside the loop, it checks if the current character c is equal to 'o'. If it is, it adds 100 to the variable p.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of p, which is 900.
<<<Output>>>
900
