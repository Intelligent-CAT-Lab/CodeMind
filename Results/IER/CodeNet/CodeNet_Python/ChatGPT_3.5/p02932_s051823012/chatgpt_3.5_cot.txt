<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by defining a constant MOD as 10^9+7.
Then, it defines two functions: kaijo and gyaku_kaijo. These functions calculate the factorial and the inverse factorial, respectively. They use memoization to store previously calculated values and avoid redundant calculations.
Next, the code defines the function nCr, which calculates the binomial coefficient using the factorial and inverse factorial functions.
The code then reads four integers: N, M, L, and R.
It initializes a list P with zeros.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to R. For each iteration, it calculates the value of u using the formula (R-M*(k+1))//(k+1). Then, it enters another loop that iterates from 0 to u. For each iteration, it updates the value of P[(k+1)*j+M*(k+1)] by adding nCr(N-M,j)*(-1)^(j%2) to it. The value of P[(k+1)*j+M*(k+1)] is then reduced modulo MOD.
After the first loop finishes, the code enters another loop that iterates from 1 to R. For each iteration, it calculates the value of u using the formula (R-M*(k+1))//k. Then, it enters another loop that iterates from 0 to u. For each iteration, it updates the value of P[k*j+M*(k+1)] by subtracting nCr(N-M,j)*(-1)^(j%2) from it. The value of P[k*j+M*(k+1)] is then reduced modulo MOD.
Next, the code initializes a list Q by calculating the binomial coefficient for each value of i from 0 to R using the nCr function.
The code defines two more functions: f and F. The function f calculates the sum of P[t]*Q[MAX-t] for each value of t from 0 to MAX. The function F calculates the difference between Q[x] and nCr(N,M)*f(x) modulo MOD.
Finally, the code prints the value of (F(R)-F(L-1)) modulo MOD.
