<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input and assigns it to the variable n.
Then it calculates the value of (n+1) &- (n+1), where &- is the bitwise negation operator.
The bitwise negation operator inverts all the bits of a number and adds 1 to the result.
So, (n+1) &- (n+1) is equivalent to -(n+1).
Finally, the code prints the value of -(n+1).
In this case, since n is 2, -(n+1) is -3.
<<<Output>>>
-3
