<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input and stores it in the variable n.
It initializes a list called cnt with 101 elements, all set to 1.
Then it enters a nested loop that iterates from 2 to n (inclusive) twice.
Inside the nested loop, it checks if i is divisible by j. If it is, it divides i by j and increments the value at index j in the cnt list by 1.
This process continues until i is no longer divisible by j.
After the nested loop finishes, the code initializes five variables: san, go, jugo, nijugo, and shitigo, all set to 0.
Then it enters another loop that iterates from 2 to 101 (inclusive).
Inside this loop, it checks the value at index i in the cnt list.
If it is greater than or equal to 3, it increments the value of san by 1.
If it is greater than or equal to 5, it increments the value of go by 1.
If it is greater than or equal to 15, it increments the value of jugo by 1.
If it is greater than or equal to 25, it increments the value of nijugo by 1.
If it is greater than or equal to 75, it increments the value of shitigo by 1.
Finally, the code prints the sum of shitigo, nijugo multiplied by (san-1), jugo multiplied by (go-1), and go multiplied by (go-1) divided by 2 multiplied by (san-2).
