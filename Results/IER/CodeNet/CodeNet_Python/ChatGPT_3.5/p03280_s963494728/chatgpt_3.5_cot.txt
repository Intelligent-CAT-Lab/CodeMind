<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers A and B as input and assigns them to the variables A and B, respectively.
Then it calculates the expression (A-1)*(B-1) and prints the result.
In this case, A is 2 and B is 2, so the expression evaluates to (2-1)*(2-1) = 1*1 = 1.
Therefore, the output of the code execution would be 1.
