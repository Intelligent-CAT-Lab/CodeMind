<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three inputs A, B, and K.
It creates a list X that contains all the numbers from A to A+K-1 that are less than or equal to B.
It creates a list Y that contains all the numbers from B-K+1 to B that are greater than or equal to A.
It then creates a new list ans by combining the elements of X and Y and removing any duplicates.
Finally, it sorts the elements of ans in ascending order and prints each element on a new line.

In this case, A=3, B=8, and K=2.
The list X will contain [3, 4] because 3 and 4 are the only numbers from 3 to 4 that are less than or equal to 8.
The list Y will contain [7, 8] because 7 and 8 are the only numbers from 7 to 8 that are greater than or equal to 3.
The list ans will contain [3, 4, 7, 8] because it combines the elements of X and Y.
Finally, the code will print each element of ans on a new line, resulting in the following output:
3
4
7
8
<<<Output>>>
3
4
7
8
