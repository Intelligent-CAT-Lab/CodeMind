<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by taking an integer input and storing it in the variable n.
Then, an empty list cnt is initialized to store the values of a.
The code then enters three nested loops, each ranging from 1 to 101.
Inside these loops, the code calculates the value of a using the formula given.
If the value of a is less than or equal to n, it is appended to the list cnt.
After the loops finish, the code uses the collections.Counter() function to count the occurrences of each value in cnt.
Finally, the code prints the count of each value from 1 to n using a loop.

In this case, the input is 20.
The code calculates the value of a for all possible combinations of x, y, and z from 1 to 100.
If the value of a is less than or equal to 20, it is added to the list cnt.
The code then counts the occurrences of each value in cnt and prints the count for each value from 1 to 20.
