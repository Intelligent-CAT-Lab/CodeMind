<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs, D and L, and assigns them to the variables D and L, respectively.
Then it calculates the integer division of D by L using the expression int(D/L) and adds it to the product of L and the integer division of D by L using the expression (D-L*int(D/L)).
Finally, it assigns the result to the variable ans and prints it.
In this case, D is 10 and L is 5, so the integer division of 10 by 5 is 2. The product of 5 and 2 is 10. Therefore, the final value of ans is 2 + 10 = 12.
<<<Output>>>
12
