<<<Analysis>>>
The code first checks if the last character of the input string is "1" or the first character is "0". If either of these conditions is true, it prints -1 and exits the program.

If the conditions are not met, the code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to (len(s) - 1) // 2. This loop checks if the characters at positions i and len(s) - i - 2 are equal. If they are not, it prints -1 and exits the program.

If all characters pass the equality check, the code creates a new string sd by removing the last character of the input string s and appending "1" to it. It then creates a list plist that contains the indices of all "1" characters in sd.

Next, the code enters another loop that iterates over the characters in s[:-1]. For each character, it uses the bisect.bisect() function to find the index in plist where the current index should be inserted to maintain a sorted order. It then prints the current index + 1 and the value at plist[r] + 1.
