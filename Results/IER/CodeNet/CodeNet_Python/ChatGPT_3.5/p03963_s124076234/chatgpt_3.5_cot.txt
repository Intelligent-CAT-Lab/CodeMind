<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers N and K as input.
It then calculates the value of K multiplied by (K-1) raised to the power of (N-1).
In this case, N is 2 and K is 2.
So the code calculates 2 multiplied by (2-1) raised to the power of (2-1).
This simplifies to 2 multiplied by 1 raised to the power of 1, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
