<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N and variable M are initialized to 2 and 2, respectively.
The code then checks if the maximum of N and M is equal to 1. Since the maximum is 2, this condition is not met.
Next, the code checks if the minimum of N and M is equal to 1. Since the minimum is also 2, this condition is not met either.
Finally, the code enters the else block and calculates the result as (N-2)*(M-2), which is (2-2)*(2-2) = 0.
The code then prints the final value of 0.
<<<Output>>>
