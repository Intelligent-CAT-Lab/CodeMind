<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three inputs A, B, and T and assigns them to variables A, B, and T respectively.
The code then calculates the expression (T + 0.5) // A * B and prints the result.
The expression (T + 0.5) // A calculates the integer division of (T + 0.5) by A.
The result of this division is then multiplied by B.
Finally, the code converts the result to an integer using the int() function and prints it.
In this case, with A = 3, B = 5, and T = 7, the expression evaluates to (7 + 0.5) // 3 * 5 = 7 // 3 * 5 = 2 * 5 = 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
