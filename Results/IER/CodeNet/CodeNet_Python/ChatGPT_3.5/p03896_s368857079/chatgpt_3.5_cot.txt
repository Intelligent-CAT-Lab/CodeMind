<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input n and checks if it is equal to 2. If it is, it prints -1 and exits the program.
If n is not equal to 2, the code continues to execute.
The code initializes a range object r from 0 to n-2 (inclusive) and assigns it to the variable s.
The code then creates a 2D list A using a nested list comprehension. Each element in A is calculated using the formula 1+(i+j+1)%n, where i and j are the indices of the current element in the nested loop.
After creating the 2D list A, the code enters another nested loop that iterates over the elements of A.
For each element A[j][i], the code checks if A[A[j][i]-1][i] is equal to j+1. If it is, it swaps the values of A[j][i] and A[j][i-n].
Finally, the code prints the elements of A in a formatted way, with each row of A separated by a newline character and each element in a row separated by a space.
