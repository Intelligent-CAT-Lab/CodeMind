<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable H and variable D are initialized to 2, 2 and 1, respectively.
The variable MOD is initialized to 10^9 + 7.
The variable fact is initialized to 1, which will be used to store the factorial of N.
The variable s is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of factorials.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 2.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the factorial of i and stores it in fact.
It also adds the current value of fact to s.
After the loop finishes, the code calculates the value of dp, which is a list of length H initialized with zeros.
The first element of dp is set to 1.
The variable ret is initialized to 1.
The code then enters another loop that iterates from 1 to H (exclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 1.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the value of dp[i] using the formula ret * s % MOD.
It also updates the value of ret using the formula ret + ret * s % MOD.
If i is greater than or equal to D, it subtracts dp[i - D] from ret.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ret multiplied by fact % MOD.
