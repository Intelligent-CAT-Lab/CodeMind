<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input and stores it in the variable n.
It initializes an empty list l.
Then it enters a while loop that continues until n becomes 0.
Inside the loop, it checks if n is divisible by 3. If it is, it adds "0" to the beginning of the list l and divides n by 3.
If n is not divisible by 3, it checks if n modulo 3 is equal to 1. If it is, it adds "+" to the beginning of the list l and subtracts 1 from n before dividing it by 3.
If n modulo 3 is not equal to 1, it adds "-" to the beginning of the list l and adds 1 to n before dividing it by 3.
After the loop finishes, it joins the elements of the list l into a string and prints it.
<<<Output>>>
-0
