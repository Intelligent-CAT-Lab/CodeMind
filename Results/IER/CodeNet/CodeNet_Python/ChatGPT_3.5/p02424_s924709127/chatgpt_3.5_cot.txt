<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers, a and b, as input.
It then defines a constant MASK as (1 << 32) - 1, which is a binary number with 32 bits, all set to 1.
The code then prints the binary representation of the bitwise AND of a and b, using the format specifier "{:032b}". This will print the binary representation of the result, padded with leading zeros to a width of 32 characters.
Next, it prints the binary representation of the bitwise OR of a and b, using the same format specifier.
Finally, it prints the binary representation of the bitwise XOR of a and b, again using the same format specifier.
In this case, a is 8 and b is 10. Their binary representations are 1000 and 1010, respectively.
The bitwise AND of 8 and 10 is 1000 & 1010 = 1000, which is 8 in decimal.
The bitwise OR of 8 and 10 is 1000 | 1010 = 1010, which is 10 in decimal.
The bitwise XOR of 8 and 10 is 1000 ^ 1010 = 0010, which is 2 in decimal.
