<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called intersection that takes two parameters, x and y.
Inside the function, it calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of x and y using the math.gcd() function and stores it in the variable g.
If g is equal to 1, meaning x and y are coprime, the function returns the sum of x and y.
Otherwise, it recursively calls the intersection function with the values x//g and y//g, multiplies the result by g, and subtracts (g-1).
The code then calls the intersection function with the values obtained from the input, which are 4 and 4 in this case.
Finally, it prints the result of the intersection function.
