<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called solve() which performs a series of calculations and returns the final result.
Inside the solve() function, the code initializes the variable MOD to 10^9 + 7.
Then it reads three integers N, M, and K from the input.
The code initializes the variable L to the sum of N, M, and 2 times K.
It then creates two lists, fact and rfact, both of length L+1, and initializes them with 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to L+1, and calculates the factorial of each number using the previous factorial value and the modulo operation.
Next, it calculates the modular inverse of the factorial of L and stores it in rfact[L].
After that, it calculates the modular inverse of the factorial of each number from L to 1 and stores them in rfact in reverse order.
The code defines two helper functions, C(n, k) and F(n, k), which calculate combinations and factorials using the fact and rfact lists.
Then, it initializes the variable ans to 0.
The code enters another loop that iterates from 0 to K (inclusive).
Inside this loop, it calculates the value of b as K minus a.
Then, it calculates the value of ans by adding the product of three terms:
1. C(N+2*a+M+2*b, N+2*a): a combination of N+2*a+M+2*b choose N+2*a.
2. F(N+a, a): a factorial of N+a multiplied by (n-a+1) modulo MOD.
3. F(M+b, b): a factorial of M+b multiplied by (n-b+1) modulo MOD.
Finally, it takes the modulo of ans with MOD and writes the result to the output.
