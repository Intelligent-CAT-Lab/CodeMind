<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function gcd(x, y) that calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.
The variables H, W, and T are initialized to 2, 2, and 1, respectively.
The code then calculates the GCD of H and T and stores it in the variable gh, and the GCD of W and T and stores it in the variable gw.
Next, it calculates the values of h and w by dividing H and W by gh and gw, respectively.
The code then initializes the variable MOD to 1000000007.
Finally, it prints the result of a complex expression involving exponentiation and subtraction, using the values of h, w, gh, gw, and MOD.
