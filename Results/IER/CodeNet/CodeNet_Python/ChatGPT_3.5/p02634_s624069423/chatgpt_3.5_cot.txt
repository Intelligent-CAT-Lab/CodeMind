<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four integers as input: a, b, c, and d.
It initializes a 2D list called dp with dimensions (c, d) and fills it with zeros.
Then, it sets dp[a-1][b-1] to 1, indicating that the starting point has been reached.
The code checks if a and b are equal to c and d, respectively. If they are, it means that the starting point is also the ending point, so it prints 1 and exits.
Next, it checks if a is equal to c. If it is, it calculates (a^(d-b)) % mod and prints the result. This is because the number of ways to reach the ending point from the starting point is equal to a raised to the power of (d-b).
Similarly, it checks if b is equal to d. If it is, it calculates (b^(c-a)) % mod and prints the result. This is because the number of ways to reach the ending point from the starting point is equal to b raised to the power of (c-a).
If none of the above conditions are met, the code enters a nested loop that iterates over the range (a-1, c) for y and the range (b-1, d) for x.
For each combination of y and x, it calculates the number of ways to reach that point by using the formula dp[y][x] = dp[y][x-1]*(y+1) + dp[y-1][x]*(x+1) - dp[y-1][x-1]*x*y.
Finally, it prints dp[-1][-1] % mod, which is the number of ways to reach the ending point from the starting point.
