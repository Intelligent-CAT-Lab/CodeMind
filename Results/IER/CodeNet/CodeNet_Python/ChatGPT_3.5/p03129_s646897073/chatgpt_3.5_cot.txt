<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes input in the form of a list of integers, where the first integer is assigned to variable N and the second integer is assigned to variable K.
Then, it checks if N divided by 2 is greater than or equal to K. If this condition is true, it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".
In this case, N is 3 and K is 2. When N is divided by 2, the result is 1.5. Since 1.5 is not greater than or equal to 2, the condition is false and the code prints "NO".
<<<Output>>>
NO
