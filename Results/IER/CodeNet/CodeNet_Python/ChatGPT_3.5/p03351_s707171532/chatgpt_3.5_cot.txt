<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four inputs: a, b, c, and x.
It then checks two conditions:
1. If the absolute difference between a and c is less than or equal to x, it prints "Yes".
2. If the absolute difference between a and b is less than or equal to x and the absolute difference between b and c is less than or equal to x, it prints "Yes".
If neither of these conditions is true, it prints "No".
In this case, the absolute difference between a and c is 5, which is greater than x (3). Therefore, the first condition is not true.
The absolute difference between a and b is 3, which is less than x (3), and the absolute difference between b and c is 2, which is less than x (3). Therefore, the second condition is true.
So, the output of the code would be "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
