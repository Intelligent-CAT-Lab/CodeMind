<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called solve that takes a file object as input. It reads an integer n from the file, which represents the number of test cases.

The code then initializes two lists, fact and ifact, with length n+1. These lists will be used to store the factorial and inverse factorial values.

Next, the code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n+1. For each iteration, it calculates the factorial of the current number i and stores it in the fact list. It also calculates the inverse factorial of the current number i using the pow function and stores it in the ifact list.

After the loop finishes, the code defines a function called nCk, which calculates the binomial coefficient using the factorial and inverse factorial values.

The code then initializes two variables, ans and c0, to 0. These variables will be used to accumulate the final answer.

Next, the code enters a loop that iterates from n/2 to n. For each iteration, it calculates the value of c1 using the nCk function and the factorial and inverse factorial values. It then updates the value of ans by adding c1 multiplied by the current number i. It also updates the value of c0 by adding c1.

Finally, the code returns the value of ans.

The main part of the code reads the input from the file using the Reader class and calls the solve function for each test case. It prints the case number and the result of the solve function.
