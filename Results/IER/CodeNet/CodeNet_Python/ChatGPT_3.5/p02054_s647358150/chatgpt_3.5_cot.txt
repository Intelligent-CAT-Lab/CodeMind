<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes input as a string and splits it into a list of strings using the split() function. Then, it converts each element of the list to an integer using the map() function. The resulting list is filtered using a list comprehension to keep only the odd numbers. The length of this filtered list is checked using the len() function. If the length is greater than or equal to 2, the code prints 'Hom', otherwise it prints 'Tem'.
In this case, the input is '1 1 10'. After splitting and converting to integers, the list becomes [1, 1, 10]. Since there are two odd numbers in the list (1 and 1), the code will print 'Hom'.
<<<Output>>>
Hom
