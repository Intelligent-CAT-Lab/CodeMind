<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a list called "lis" with a sequence of numbers.
It then takes an input from the user and subtracts 1 from it.
The code then prints the value at the index given by the user input in the "lis" list.
In this case, the user input is 6, so the code will print the value at index 5 in the "lis" list.
The value at index 5 in the "lis" list is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
