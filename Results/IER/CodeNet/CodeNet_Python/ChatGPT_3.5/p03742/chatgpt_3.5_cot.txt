<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input and assigns them to variables a and b.
It then checks if the absolute difference between a and b is greater than 1.
If the condition is true, it prints 'Alice', otherwise it prints 'Brown'.
In this case, the absolute difference between 2 and 1 is 1, which is not greater than 1.
Therefore, the code will print 'Brown'.
<<<Output>>>
Brown
