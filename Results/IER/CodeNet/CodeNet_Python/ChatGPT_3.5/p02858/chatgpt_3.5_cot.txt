<<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the gcd function from the fractions module.
Then it takes three integers as input: H, W, and T.
The code calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of H and T and stores it in gh.
Similarly, it calculates the gcd of W and T and stores it in gw.
Next, it calculates the values of h and w by dividing H and W by gh and gw respectively.
The code then initializes the variable MOD to 1000000007.
Finally, it prints the result of the expression pow(pow(2, h, MOD) + pow(2, w, MOD) + pow(2, gcd(h, w), MOD) - 3, gh * gw, MOD).
This expression calculates the power of the sum of three powers of 2 (h, w, and gcd(h, w)) minus 3, raised to the power of gh * gw, modulo MOD.
