<<<Analysis>>>
The code imports the ceil, floor, and log2 functions from the math module and the sys module.
It then reads the input from the standard input using the sys.stdin.readline() function and splits it into two integers, n and a.
The variable t is initialized to n, which will be used to store the minimum value found so far.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to the ceiling of the logarithm base 2 of n (exclusive). This loop will consider different values of k.
Inside the loop, the code calculates the value of d, which is the ceiling of the k-th root of n.
It then initializes the variables l and r to 0 and k, respectively.
The code enters a while loop that continues until l + 1 is less than r. Inside this loop, it calculates the value of c as the floor division of the sum of l and r by 2.
The code then checks if n is less than or equal to (d - 1) raised to the power of (k - c) multiplied by d raised to the power of c. If this condition is true, it updates the value of r to c. Otherwise, it updates the value of l to c.
After the while loop finishes, the code calculates the value of t as the minimum of t and (d - 1) multiplied by (k - r) plus d multiplied by r plus (k - 1) multiplied by a.
Finally, the code prints the value of t.
