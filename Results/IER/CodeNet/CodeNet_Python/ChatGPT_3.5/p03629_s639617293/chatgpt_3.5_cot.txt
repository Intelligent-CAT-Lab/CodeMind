The code takes a string input `A` and calculates the shortest lexicographically ordered string that can be obtained by removing some characters from `A`. The code uses dynamic programming to solve this problem.

First, the code initializes some variables. `N` is the length of the input string `A`. `a` is the ASCII value of the character 'a'. `edge` is a 2D list that represents the edges between vertices in a graph. `recon` is a list used for dynamic programming to store the previous vertex and character for each vertex. `q` is a deque used for breadth-first search.

Next, the code constructs the `edge` list. It iterates through the characters of `A` in reverse order and updates the edges based on the current character. Each element `edge[i][j]` represents the next vertex to go to if the current vertex is `i` and the next character is `j`. The value is initialized to `N + 1` for all elements, except for the element corresponding to the current character, which is set to `i + 1`.

After constructing the `edge` list, the code performs a breadth-first search to find the shortest path from the start vertex (0) to the end vertex (N + 1). It starts with the start vertex in the queue and iteratively explores the neighboring vertices. The `recon` list is updated with the previous vertex and character for each vertex that is visited for the first time. This allows us to reconstruct the shortest lexicographically ordered string later.

Finally, the code reconstructs the shortest lexicographically ordered string by starting from the end vertex (N + 1) and following the previous vertex and character stored in the `recon` list. The characters are appended to the `ans` list in reverse order. The `ans` list is then reversed and joined into a string, which is printed as the output.
