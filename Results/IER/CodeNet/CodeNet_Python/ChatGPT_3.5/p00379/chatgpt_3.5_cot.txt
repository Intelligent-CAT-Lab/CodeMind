<<<Analysis>>>
The variable a, variable n and variable m are initialized to 16, 2 and 1000, respectively.
variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the count of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 49 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 49.
For each number y in this range, it calculates x as (y + a) raised to the power of n.
The code checks if x is within the range [1, m], which is [1, 1000] in this case. It also checks if the sum of the digits of x is equal to y.
If both conditions are met, it increments the value of ans by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is the count of numbers that meet the conditions.
