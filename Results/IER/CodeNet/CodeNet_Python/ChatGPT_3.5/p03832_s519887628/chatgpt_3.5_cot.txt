<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by importing necessary libraries and reading the input values N, A, B, C, and D.
It then initializes the MOD variable to 10^9 + 7.
Next, it creates two arrays, fact and fact_inv, of size N+1 and initializes them with 1.
It then calculates the factorial and factorial inverse values using a loop and stores them in the fact and fact_inv arrays.
After that, it creates a 2D array comb of size (N+1) x (N+1) and initializes the first column with 1.
It then calculates the combinations using a loop and stores them in the comb array.
Next, it creates an array dp of size N+1 and initializes the first element with 1.
It then enters a loop that iterates from A to B (inclusive) and performs calculations to update the dp array.
Inside this loop, it creates a copy of the previous dp array and stores it in the prev variable.
Then, it enters another loop that iterates from C to D (inclusive) and performs calculations to update the dp array.
Finally, it prints the value of dp[N], which is the final answer.
