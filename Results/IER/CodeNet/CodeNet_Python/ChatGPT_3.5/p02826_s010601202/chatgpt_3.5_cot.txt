<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers N and M as input.
It initializes a 2D list DP with dimensions 6000x6000 and fills it with -1.
Then, it defines a recursive function P(n, k) that calculates the number of ways to partition n into k parts.
The function uses memoization to store previously calculated values in the DP list.
Next, there is a nested loop that calls the P function for each pair of values (i, j) in the range (0, 5500).
This loop is used to populate the DP list with the values of P(i+1, j+1).
After that, there is another loop that calculates the values of X, which is a list that stores the sum of squares of each row in the DP list.
The loop iterates from 0 to 5500 and for each value of i, it calculates the sum of squares of each element in the i-th row of the DP list and stores it in X.
Then, there is a loop that calculates the values of Y, which is a list that stores the cumulative sum of the values in X.
The loop iterates from 0 to 10800 and for each value of i, it calculates the sum of all values in X up to index i//2 and stores it in Y.
Finally, there is a loop that calculates the final result P.
The loop iterates from 1 to N and for each value of i, it adds the i-th value of X to P.
If 2*i is greater than N, it subtracts the (2*i-N)-th value of Y from P.
The final value of P is printed as the output.
