<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers a and b as input.
It initializes a list called lis with 1000 elements, all set to 0.
Then, it enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 999.
Inside the loop, it calculates the value of lis[i] using the formula (i+2)*(i+1)//2.
If i is greater than or equal to 1, it checks if the difference between b and a is equal to the difference between lis[i] and lis[i-1].
If the condition is true, it prints the value of lis[i] minus b and breaks out of the loop.
If the condition is not true, the loop continues to the next iteration.
If the loop finishes without finding a match, it means there is no solution and the code does not print anything.
