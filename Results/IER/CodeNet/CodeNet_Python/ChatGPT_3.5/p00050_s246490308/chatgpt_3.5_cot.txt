<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads the input string using the input() function.
Then it replaces the word 'apple' with '???' using the replace() method.
Next, it replaces the word 'peach' with 'apple' using the replace() method.
Finally, it replaces the word '???' with 'peach' using the replace() method.
The resulting string is then printed.
In this case, the input string is "the cost of one peach is higher than that of one apple."
The first replace() method replaces 'apple' with '???', resulting in "the cost of one ??? is higher than that of one ???."
The second replace() method replaces 'peach' with 'apple', resulting in "the cost of one apple is higher than that of one ???."
The third replace() method replaces '???' with 'peach', resulting in "the cost of one apple is higher than that of one peach."
Therefore, the output of the code execution is "the cost of one apple is higher than that of one peach."
<<<Output>>>
the cost of one apple is higher than that of one peach.
