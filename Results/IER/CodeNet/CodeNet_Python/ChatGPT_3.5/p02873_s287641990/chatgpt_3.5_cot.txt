<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function main() that takes no arguments.
Inside the main() function, the code imports the groupby function from the itertools module.
The code then reads a string input and converts it into a list of characters, which is stored in the variable s.
The variables f and ans are initialized to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the elements of s, grouped by consecutive equal elements.
For each group, the code calculates the length of the group and stores it in the variable d.
If the current element is ">", the code sets the variable left to d and right to 0.
If the current element is "<", the code sets the variable left to 0 and right to d.
The code then checks if the value of f is greater than the value of left.
If it is, the code calculates the sum of the arithmetic sequence from 1 to d (inclusive) and subtracts the value of left from it. This value is added to the variable ans.
If f is not greater than left, the code calculates the sum of the arithmetic sequence from -1*f to d (inclusive) and adds it to the variable ans.
Finally, the code updates the value of f to right.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans.
