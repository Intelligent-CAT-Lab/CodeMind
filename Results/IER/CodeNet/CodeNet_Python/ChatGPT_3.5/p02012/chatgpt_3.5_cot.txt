<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines several helper functions and initializes some variables.
The function `solve()` is the main function that performs the calculations.
Inside `solve()`, the code first reads an integer `s` from input.
If `s` is equal to 1, the code prints 1 and returns.
Otherwise, the code calls the `fact()` function to get a list of factors of `s`.
The code then initializes two defaultdicts `f` and `p`.
The variable `f` will store the frequency of each sum, and `p` will keep track of whether a pair of numbers has been processed or not.
The code sorts the list of factors in ascending order.
Then, for each factor `k` in the list, the code enters two nested loops.
The first loop iterates over all possible values of `a` from 1 to `k`, and calculates `b` as `k - a`.
If `a` is less than or equal to `b`, and the pair `(a, b)` has not been processed before, the code calculates the sum of `a` and `b` using the `sum()` function, and increments the frequency of that sum in the `f` defaultdict.
The second loop iterates over all possible values of `a` from 1 to `s`, and calculates `b` as `k + a - 1`.
If the pair `(a, b)` has not been processed before, the code calculates the sum of `a` and `b` using the `sum()` function, and increments the frequency of that sum in the `f` defaultdict.
After the loops finish, the code initializes a variable `ans` to 0.
Then, for each factor `k` in the list, the code calculates the product of the frequencies of `k` and `s//k`, and adds it to `ans`.
Finally, the code prints the value of `ans`.
