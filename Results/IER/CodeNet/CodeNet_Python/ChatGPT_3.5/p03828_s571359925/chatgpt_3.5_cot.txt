<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by importing necessary modules and defining a constant variable MOD.
Then, a function prime_decomposition is defined, which takes an integer n as input and returns a list of prime factors of n.
The function solve is defined, which takes an integer N as input.
Inside the solve function, the prime_decomposition function is called to get the prime factors of the factorial of N.
The Counter class from the collections module is used to count the occurrences of each prime factor.
A variable answer is initialized to 1.
A loop is then used to iterate over the values of the counter.
In each iteration, the answer is multiplied by (value + 1), where value is the count of a prime factor.
Finally, the answer modulo MOD is printed.
The main function is defined, which reads the input from stdin and calls the solve function with the input value of N.
The code then executes the main function.
