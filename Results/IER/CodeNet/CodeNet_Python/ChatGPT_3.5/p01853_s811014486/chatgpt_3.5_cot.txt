<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers n and m as input using the map function and split method. The input "3 100" will be split into n=3 and m=100.
The code then calculates the value of p by dividing n by 2 and adding 1. In this case, p = 3//2 + 1 = 2.
Next, the code creates a list with p number of 0s followed by n-p number of m. In this case, the list will be [0, 100, 100].
Finally, the code prints the elements of the list separated by a space. The output will be "0 100 100".
<<<Output>>>
0 100 100
