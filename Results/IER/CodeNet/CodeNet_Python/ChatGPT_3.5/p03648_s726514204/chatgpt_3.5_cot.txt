<<<Analysis>>>
The variable k is initialized to 0.
The variable n is initialized to 50.
The list a is initialized with 50 elements, all set to 49.
The code then calculates the integer division of k by n and stores it in c. In this case, c will be 0.
The code enters a loop that iterates over the range of n, which is from 0 to 49. It adds the value of c to each element of the list a.
Next, the code calculates the remainder of the division of k by n and stores it in c. In this case, c will still be 0.
The code then enters another loop that iterates c times. Since c is 0, this loop will not be executed.
Finally, the code prints the value of n, which is 50, and then prints each element of the list a separated by a space.
