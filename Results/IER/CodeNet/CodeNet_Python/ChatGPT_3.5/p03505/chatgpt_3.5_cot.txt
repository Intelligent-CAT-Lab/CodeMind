<<<Analysis>>>
The variable K, variable A and variable B are initialized to 4000, 2000 and 500, respectively.
The code first checks if A is less than or equal to B and if K is greater than A. If this condition is true, it prints -1 and exits the code.
In this case, A is greater than B, so the condition is not met.
The code then checks if A is greater than or equal to K. If this condition is true, it prints 1 and exits the code.
In this case, A is not greater than or equal to K, so the condition is not met.
Finally, the code calculates the value of 1 - int(- (K-A) // (A-B))*2 and prints it.
The expression -(K-A) // (A-B) calculates the number of times (A-B) can be subtracted from (K-A) while keeping the result negative.
The int() function is used to convert this result to an integer.
The final result is 1 minus twice this integer value.
In this case, -(K-A) // (A-B) is equal to -3, so the final result is 1 - (-3)*2 = 7.
