<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines several input functions and sets some variables and constants.
Then it defines a main function that reads a string input and performs some operations on it.
The code first checks if the length of the string is 2 and if both characters are the same. If this condition is true, it prints "1 2" and returns.
If the length of the string is 2 but the characters are different, it prints "-1 -1" and returns.
If the length of the string is greater than 2, the code creates a dictionary to count the occurrences of each character in the first three positions of the string.
Then it checks if any character has occurred at least twice. If this condition is true, it prints "1 3" and returns.
If no character has occurred at least twice in the first three positions, the code enters a loop that iterates from the fourth position to the end of the string.
In each iteration, it updates the dictionary by subtracting 1 from the count of the character at the current position and adding 1 to the count of the character at the position three positions ahead.
Then it checks if any character has occurred at least twice in the updated dictionary. If this condition is true, it prints the current position plus 2 and the current position plus 4, and returns.
If no character has occurred at least twice in any position, it prints "-1 -1".
<<<Output>>>
-1 -1
