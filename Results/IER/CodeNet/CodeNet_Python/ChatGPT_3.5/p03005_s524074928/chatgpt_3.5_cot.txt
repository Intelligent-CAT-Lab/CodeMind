<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input and assigns them to variables a and b.
It then checks if b is equal to 1. If it is, it prints 0.
If b is not equal to 1, it subtracts b from a and prints the result.
In this case, b is 2, so the code will execute the else block and print the result of a-b, which is 1.
<<<Output>>>
