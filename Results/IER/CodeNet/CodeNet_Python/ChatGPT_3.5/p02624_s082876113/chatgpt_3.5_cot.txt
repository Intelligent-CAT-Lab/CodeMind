<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input and assigns it to the variable n.
It then creates a list called a, which contains the numbers from 0 to n.
The variables res and time are initialized to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive).
For each iteration, it calculates the integer division of n by the current element in the list a.
It multiplies the current element by the result of the division, the result of the division plus 1, and then divides the product by 2.
The result of this calculation is added to the variable res.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of res.
In this case, the input is 4, so the loop will iterate for i = 1, 2, 3, and 4.
For each iteration, the calculation will be as follows:
- i = 1: cnt = 4 // 1 = 4, res = 0 + 1 * 4 * (4 + 1) // 2 = 10
- i = 2: cnt = 4 // 2 = 2, res = 10 + 2 * 2 * (2 + 1) // 2 = 16
- i = 3: cnt = 4 // 3 = 1, res = 16 + 3 * 1 * (1 + 1) // 2 = 19
- i = 4: cnt = 4 // 4 = 1, res = 19 + 4 * 1 * (1 + 1) // 2 = 21
Therefore, the final value of res will be 21.
