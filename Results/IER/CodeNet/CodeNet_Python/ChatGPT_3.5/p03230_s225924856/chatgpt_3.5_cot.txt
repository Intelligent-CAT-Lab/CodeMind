<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines several utility functions and imports various modules.
The main function reads an integer N from input and calls the solve function with N as an argument.
The solve function checks if N is equal to 1. If it is, it prints "Yes" and the following lines:
2
1 1
1 1
If N is not equal to 1, the code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N+1. For each value of k, it checks if (k * (k - 1)) // 2 is equal to N. If it is, it sets K to k and breaks out of the loop.
If K is still equal to -1 after the loop, the code prints "No" and returns.
If K is not equal to -1, the code initializes a list of lists called ans with K empty lists.
The code then enters a nested loop that iterates over the indices i and j. For each pair of indices, it appends the current value of num to ans[i] and ans[j], and increments num by 1.
After the nested loop, the code prints "Yes" and the value of K. It then iterates over the lists in ans and prints the length of each list followed by its elements.
