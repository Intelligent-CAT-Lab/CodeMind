<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes 6 inputs: c1, c5, c10, c50, c100, and c500.
It then calculates the sum of the values by multiplying each coin value with its respective count and adding them all together.
If the sum is greater than or equal to 1000, it prints 1. Otherwise, it prints 0.
In this case, the input values are 3, 1, 4, 0, 4, and 1.
The sum is calculated as: 3 + 5*1 + 10*4 + 50*0 + 100*4 + 500*1 = 3 + 5 + 40 + 0 + 400 + 500 = 948.
Since the sum is less than 1000, the code will print 0.
<<<Output>>>
0
