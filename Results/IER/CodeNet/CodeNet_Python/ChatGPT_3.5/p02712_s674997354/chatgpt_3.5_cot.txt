<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized to 15.
The variable sum is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers that are not divisible by 3 or 5.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 15.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is not divisible by 3 and not divisible by 5. If this condition is true, it adds the current number i to sum.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum, which is 60.
<<<Output>>>
60
