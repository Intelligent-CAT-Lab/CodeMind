<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input from the user and stores it in the variable s.
Then, it uses the replace() method to replace all occurrences of the comma (",") with a space (" ").
Finally, it prints the modified string.
In this case, the input string is "happy,newyear,enjoy".
After replacing the commas with spaces, the modified string is "happy newyear enjoy".
<<<Output>>>
happy newyear enjoy
