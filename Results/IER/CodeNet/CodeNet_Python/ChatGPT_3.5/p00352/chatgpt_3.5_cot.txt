<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input and assigns them to variables a and b.
Then it calculates the sum of a and b, and divides it by 2 using the // operator, which performs integer division.
Finally, it prints the result of the division.
In this case, the input is "1000 3000", so a is assigned the value 1000 and b is assigned the value 3000.
The sum of a and b is 4000, and when divided by 2, the result is 2000.
<<<Output>>>
2000
