<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input N and initializes a variable answer to 0.
Then it enters a loop that iterates from the square root of N (rounded down) to 1 (inclusive).
For each value of i in this range, it checks if N is divisible by i. If it is, it calculates the value of answer as (i-1) + (N//i-1) and breaks out of the loop.
Finally, it prints the value of answer.
In this case, N is 10. The loop starts from the square root of 10, which is 3, and goes down to 1. When i is 2, it is found that 10 is divisible by 2. So, answer is calculated as (2-1) + (10//2-1) = 1 + 4 = 5. Therefore, the output is 5.
