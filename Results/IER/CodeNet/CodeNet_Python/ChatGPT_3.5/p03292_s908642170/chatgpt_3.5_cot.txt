<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes input as a string and splits it into a list of strings using the split() function. Then, it converts each element of the list to an integer using the int() function and creates a new list called 'a'.
The list 'a' is then sorted in ascending order using the sorted() function.
The code then calculates the difference between the second and first elements of the sorted list, and adds it to the difference between the third and second elements of the sorted list.
Finally, the code prints the result of this calculation.
In this case, the input is '1 6 3', so the list 'a' will be [1, 6, 3] after the conversion. After sorting, the list becomes [1, 3, 6]. The output will be (3 - 1) + (6 - 3) = 5.
