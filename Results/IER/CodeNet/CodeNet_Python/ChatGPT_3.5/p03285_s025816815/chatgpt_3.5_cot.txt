<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input and assigns it to the variable n.
It initializes the variable p to 0 and the variable t to True.
The code then enters a while loop that continues until p is less than 26.
Inside the loop, it calculates the value of r by subtracting 7 multiplied by p from n.
It checks if r is greater than or equal to 0 and if r is divisible by 4 without any remainder.
If both conditions are true, it sets t to False, prints "Yes", and breaks out of the loop.
If the conditions are not met, it increments p by 1 and continues to the next iteration of the loop.
After the loop finishes, it checks the value of t. If t is still True, it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
