<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input and assigns it to the variable x.
It then checks if x is greater than or equal to 30. If it is, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
In this case, the input is 25, which is not greater than or equal to 30.
Therefore, the code will print "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
