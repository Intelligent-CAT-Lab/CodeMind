<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function A() that takes no arguments.
Inside the function, it reads a string s from input.
The code then initializes variables i, now, and ans to 0.
The code enters a while loop that iterates as long as i is less than the length of s.
Inside the loop, the code checks if the current character s[i] is equal to "R".
If it is, the code checks the value of now.
If now is 0, it means that the current "R" is the start of a new sequence of "R"s.
The code increments now by 1 and increments i by 1 to move to the next character.
The code then enters another while loop that iterates as long as i is less than the length of s.
Inside this loop, the code checks if the current character s[i] is equal to "R".
If it is, the code increments now by 1.
If it is not, the code decrements now by 1.
The code then takes the modulo of now with 4 to ensure that it stays within the range [0, 3].
The code increments i by 1 to move to the next character.
The code then checks if now is equal to 0.
If it is, it means that the sequence of "R"s has ended.
The code checks if the last character of the sequence is "R".
If it is, it increments ans by 1.
The code then breaks out of the inner while loop.
If now is not equal to 0, the code increments now by 1 and takes the modulo of now with 4 to ensure that it stays within the range [0, 3].
The code increments i by 1 to move to the next character.
If the current character s[i] is not equal to "R", the code decrements now by 1 and takes the modulo of now with 4 to ensure that it stays within the range [0, 3].
The code increments i by 1 to move to the next character.
After the while loop finishes, the code prints the value of ans.
