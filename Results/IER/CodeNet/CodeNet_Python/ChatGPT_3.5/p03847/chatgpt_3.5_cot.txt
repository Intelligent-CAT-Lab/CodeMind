<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input N and defines a dictionary called memo. It initializes memo[0] to 1 and memo[1] to 2.
Then, it defines a function called func that takes an argument N.
Inside the function, it checks if N is already in the memo dictionary. If it is, it returns the corresponding value.
If N is not in the memo dictionary, it calculates the result using the formula: ( func(N/2)+func((N-1)/2)+func(N/2-1) )% (10**9+7).
The result is then stored in the memo dictionary with the key N and returned.
Finally, outside the function, it prints the result of calling func with the input N.
In this case, the input N is 3.
The function func(3) is called, and since 3 is not in the memo dictionary, it calculates the result using the formula.
The result is 7, which is then stored in the memo dictionary with the key 3.
Finally, the result 7 is printed.
<<<Output>>>
7
