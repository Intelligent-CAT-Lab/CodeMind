<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three inputs: a, t, and r. These inputs are converted to integers using the map function and stored in the variables a, t, and r, respectively.
The code then calculates the value of ans by multiplying r and t and dividing the result by a.
Finally, the code prints the value of ans formatted as a floating-point number with 6 decimal places.
In this case, the value of ans would be 90 * 120 / 180 = 60.
The code will print "60.000000" as the output.
<<<Output>>>
60.000000
