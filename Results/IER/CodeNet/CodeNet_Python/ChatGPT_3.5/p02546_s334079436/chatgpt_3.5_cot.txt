<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string and checks if the last character of the string is 's'.
If it is, it adds 'es' to the end of the string and prints the result.
If it is not, it simply adds 's' to the end of the string and prints the result.
In this case, the input string is 'apple' and the last character is 'e', so the code will add 's' to the end of the string and print 'apples'.
<<<Output>>>
apples
