<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input and assigns them to variables a, b, and c.
It then checks if the difference between b and a is equal to the difference between c and b.
If the condition is true, it prints "YES", otherwise it prints "NO".
In this case, the difference between b and a is 2, and the difference between c and b is also 2.
Therefore, the condition is true and the code will print "YES".
<<<Output>>>
YES
