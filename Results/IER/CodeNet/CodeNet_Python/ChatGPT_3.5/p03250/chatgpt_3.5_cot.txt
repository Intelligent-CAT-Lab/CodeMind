<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes input as three integers and stores them in a list called abc.
The list abc is then sorted in ascending order.
The code then concatenates the second and third elements of the sorted list, converts it to an integer, and adds it to the first element of the list.
Finally, the code prints the result.
In this case, the input is [1, 5, 2].
After sorting the list, it becomes [1, 2, 5].
The code then concatenates the second and third elements, which gives "25".
This is converted to an integer and added to the first element, which is 1.
Therefore, the output of the code would be 26.
