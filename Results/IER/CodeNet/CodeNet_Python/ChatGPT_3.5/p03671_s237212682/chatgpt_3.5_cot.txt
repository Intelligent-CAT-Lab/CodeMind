<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input and assigns them to variables a, b, and c.
It then calculates the minimum value among the sums of pairs (a+b), (b+c), and (c+a).
In this case, the values of a, b, and c are 700, 600, and 780 respectively.
So, the code will calculate the minimum value among (700+600), (600+780), and (780+700).
The minimum value among these three sums is 1300, which is the output of the code.
<<<Output>>>
1300
