<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input: a, b, and k.
It then checks if a is less than or equal to k. If it is, it subtracts a from k and sets a to 0.
If a is greater than k, it prints the values of (a - k) and b, and then exits the program.
If neither of the above conditions are met, it prints the values of 0 and the maximum of (b - k, 0).
In this case, a is equal to k, so the first condition is met. The code subtracts a from k, resulting in k = 1, and sets a to 0.
Therefore, the output of the code execution would be:
0 3
