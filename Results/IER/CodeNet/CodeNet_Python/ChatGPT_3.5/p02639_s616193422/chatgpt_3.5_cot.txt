<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes input as a string and splits it into a list of strings using the split() function. In this case, the input is "0 2 3 4 5", so the list a will be ['0', '2', '3', '4', '5'].
Then, the code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 4 (inclusive). For each iteration, it checks if the current value of i is equal to the integer value of a[i]-1. If it is, the code continues to the next iteration using the continue statement. Otherwise, it prints the value of i+1.
In this case, the condition i == int(a[i])-1 is not satisfied for any value of i, so the code will print the values 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
