<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by importing various modules and defining some utility functions.
Then, it defines the main function which takes three inputs A, B, and C.
The code checks if the product of A and B is divisible by 2, and if the product of B and C is divisible by 2, and if the product of C and A is divisible by 2.
If all three conditions are true, it prints 'Tem', otherwise it prints 'Hom'.
In this case, the values of A, B, and C are 1, 1, and 10 respectively.
The code checks if (1 * 1) % 2 == 0, which is false.
Therefore, it prints 'Hom'.
<<<Output>>>
Hom
