<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function `prime_factorization` that takes an integer `x` as input and returns a dictionary `ret` containing the prime factorization of `x`. The function uses trial division to find the prime factors of `x` and their corresponding powers.

In the `main` function, an integer `N` is read from input. Then, the `prime_factorization` function is called with `N` as the argument, and the result is stored in the `facts` variable.

The code then initializes a string `ans` with the value of `N` followed by a colon and a space. It then iterates over the items in the `facts` dictionary and appends the prime factor followed by a space, repeated `cnt` times, to the `ans` string.

Finally, the `ans` string is printed, excluding the last space character.

In this case, the input is `12`. The prime factorization of `12` is `2^2 * 3^1`, so the expected output is `"12: 2 2 3"`.
<<<Output>>>
12: 2 2 3
