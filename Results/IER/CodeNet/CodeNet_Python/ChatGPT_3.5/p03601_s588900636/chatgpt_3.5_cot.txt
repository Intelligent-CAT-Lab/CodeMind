<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines several helper functions to read input values. Then it defines the main function `solve()` which performs the main logic of the code.

In the `solve()` function, it reads 6 integers `a, b, c, d, e, f` using the `read_int_list()` function. These values represent the amounts of different substances.

The code initializes `best_sugar` to 0 and `best_total` to 100 * a. These variables will be used to keep track of the best combination of substances.

The code then enters a nested loop that iterates over three variables `i, j, k`. These variables represent the amounts of water, substance 1, and substance 2 respectively.

Inside the nested loop, the code checks if the combination of substances satisfies certain conditions. If the conditions are met, it calculates the amount of sugar and total amount of substances.

The code then calculates the density of sugar in the solution and compares it with the best density found so far. If the current density is higher, it updates the `best_sugar` and `best_total` variables.

After the nested loop finishes, the code returns the values of `best_total` and `best_sugar` as a tuple.

The `main()` function calls the `solve()` function and prints the result.
