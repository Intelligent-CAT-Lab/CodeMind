<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string `s` and calculates its length `n`.
It initializes the variable `ans` to `n`, which will be used to store the minimum distance between two different characters in the string.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to `n-1`. For each index `i`, it checks if the character at index `i-1` is equal to the character at index `i`. If they are equal, it continues to the next iteration of the loop. If they are different, it calculates the minimum distance between the two characters and updates `ans` if necessary.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of `ans`, which represents the minimum distance between two different characters in the string.
In this case, the input string is "010". The code will compare the characters at indices 0 and 1, and since they are different, it will update `ans` to the minimum of `ans` and the maximum of `i` and `n-i`, which is 2. Then it will compare the characters at indices 1 and 2, and since they are the same, it will continue to the next iteration. Finally, it will print the value of `ans`, which is 2.
