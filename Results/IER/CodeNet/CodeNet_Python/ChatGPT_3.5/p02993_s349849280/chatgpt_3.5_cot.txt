<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input and assigns it to the variable s.
It then initializes a boolean variable is_good to True.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to len(s)-2 (inclusive), which means it will consider pairs of adjacent characters in the string.
For each pair of adjacent characters, the code checks if they are equal. If they are, it sets is_good to False and breaks out of the loop.
After the loop finishes, the code prints 'Good' if is_good is True, and 'Bad' otherwise.

In this case, the input string is '3776'.
The code will compare the first pair of adjacent characters, '3' and '7', and since they are not equal, is_good remains True.
The code then compares the second pair, '7' and '7', and since they are equal, is_good is set to False and the loop breaks.
Finally, the code prints 'Bad' because is_good is False.

<<<Output>>>
Bad
