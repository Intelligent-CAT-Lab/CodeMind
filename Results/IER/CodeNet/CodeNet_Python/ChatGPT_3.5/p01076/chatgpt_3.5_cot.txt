<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs, n and d, and assigns them to the variables n and d, respectively.
It then checks if d is equal to 1. If it is, it calculates n*(n-1)//2 and prints the result.
If d is not equal to 1, it calculates (n-1)+(n-d-1)*n-((n-d-1)*(n+d-2)//2) and prints the result.
In this case, n is 4 and d is 3. Since d is not equal to 1, the code calculates (4-1)+(4-3-1)*4-((4-3-1)*(4+3-2)//2).
Simplifying this expression, we get 3+0*4-((0)*(5)//2), which further simplifies to 3-0, resulting in an output of 3.
