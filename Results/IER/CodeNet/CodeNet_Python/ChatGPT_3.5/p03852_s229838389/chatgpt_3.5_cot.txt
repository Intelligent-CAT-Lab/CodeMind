<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input character and assigns it to the variable c.
It then checks if c is present in the string 'aeiou', which represents the vowels.
If c is present in the string, it prints 'vowel'.
Otherwise, it prints 'consonant'.
In this case, the input character is 'a', which is a vowel.
Therefore, the code will print 'vowel'.
<<<Output>>>
vowel
