The code takes three inputs: n, a, and b. In this case, n=2, a=1, and b=3.
The code then defines a function called "doit" which takes three parameters: a, b, and mask.
Inside the "doit" function, there are two loops. The first loop iterates from 0 to n-1 and checks if the i-th bit of the mask is 0 and the i-th bit of (a XOR b) is 1. If this condition is true, it updates the "differ" variable to i.
The second loop iterates from 0 to n-1 and checks if the i-th bit of the mask is 0 and i is not equal to "differ". If this condition is true, it updates the "same" variable to i.
If "same" is still -1 after the second loop, it means there is no more bit to flip, so it returns [a, b].
Otherwise, it recursively calls the "doit" function twice with different parameters and concatenates the results.
After the "doit" function, there is an if statement that checks if the number of set bits in (a XOR b) is odd. If it is not odd, it prints "NO".
Otherwise, it prints "YES" and calls the "doit" function with initial parameters and prints the result.
In this case, the number of set bits in (1 XOR 3) is 2, which is even, so it prints "NO".
