<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a class called RollingHash, which is used to calculate the rolling hash of a string. It also defines a function called solve, which is the main logic of the code.

In the solve function, the code reads three inputs A, B, and C. It then calculates the length of the longest string among A and B and assigns it to variable L. It also initializes a list called pw10 with powers of 10 modulo MOD.

The code then defines a nested function called calc, which takes two strings X and Y as input and calculates a result based on some conditions. It uses the RollingHash class to calculate the rolling hash of X and Y.

Inside the calc function, the code initializes some variables and starts a loop to iterate over the characters of X. It calculates a value called res based on the conditions and updates it in each iteration.

After the loop, the code checks if Y is equal to "0". If it is, it subtracts some values from res based on the length of X.

Finally, the code calculates the final answer by calling the calc function with inputs B and C. It then subtracts another value from the answer based on the value of A. The result is printed as the output.
