<<<Analysis>>>
The code imports the `exit` function from the `sys` module and the `math` module.
It defines three lambda functions `ii`, `mi`, and `li` to read integers, map integers, and map lists of integers from input, respectively.
Then it reads four integers `a`, `b`, `h`, and `m` from input.
The code calculates the angle in radians for the minute hand `rad_m` and the hour hand `rad_h`.
The difference between `rad_m` and `rad_h` is calculated and stored in `r`.
The code then calculates the angle in degrees `rad` based on `r`.
Finally, it calculates the length of the third side of a triangle using the law of cosines and prints the result.
