<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by importing the sys module and defining the input function to read input from stdin.
Then, it reads an integer D from input.
Two lists, memo_F and memo_T, are initialized with 30 zeros each.
The code then enters a nested loop that iterates over all possible values of x and y from 0 to 9.
Inside the loop, it updates the values of memo_T and memo_F based on the difference between y and x.
Next, a function F is defined. It takes three parameters: K, D, and allow_leading_zero.
The function is recursive and has a base case for K = 0 and K = 1.
For K = 0, it returns 1 if D is 0 and 0 otherwise.
For K = 1, it checks if D is 0 and returns 0 if it is not.
If allow_leading_zero is True, it returns 10, otherwise it returns 9.
For K > 1, the function calculates the value of x and d based on the current K and D.
It then initializes a variable ret to 0.
The function iterates over the possible values of use_x, which are d and d-10.
If allow_leading_zero is True, it uses the value of memo_T[use_x] as the coefficient, otherwise it uses memo_F[use_x].
If the coefficient is 0, it continues to the next iteration of the loop.
Otherwise, it adds the product of the coefficient and the recursive call to F with updated parameters to the variable ret.
Finally, the code calculates the answer by summing the values of F for K ranging from 1 to 19 (inclusive).
The answer is then printed.
