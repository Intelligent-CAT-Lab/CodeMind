<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input and assigns it to the variable n.
It then checks if n is divisible by 2 (i.e., n%2 == 0). If it is, it calculates ans as (n/2)/n, which simplifies to 0.5.
If n is not divisible by 2, it calculates ans as ((n+1)/2)/n, which simplifies to (n+1)/(2n).
In this case, n is 4, which is divisible by 2. So, ans is calculated as (4/2)/4, which is 0.5.
Finally, the code prints the value of ans, which is 0.5.
<<<Output>>>
0.5
