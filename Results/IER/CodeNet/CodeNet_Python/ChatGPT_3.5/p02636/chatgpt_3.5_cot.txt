<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function `cmb` that calculates the combination of two numbers `n` and `r` modulo `mod`. It also initializes some variables and tables.

The code then takes an input string `S` and calculates its length `N`. It initializes some variables and arrays.

The code then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to `N-1`. For each iteration, it updates the variables `Zero` and `One` based on the current character of `S`. It also updates the arrays `dp` and `dpf` based on the previous values of `dp` and `dpf`.

After the loop, the code reverses the string `S` and initializes some variables. It then enters another loop that iterates from 0 to `N-1`. For each iteration, it updates the variables `Zero` and `One` based on the current character of the reversed `S`. It also calculates the combinations and updates the variable `ans`.

Finally, the code prints the value of `ans`.
