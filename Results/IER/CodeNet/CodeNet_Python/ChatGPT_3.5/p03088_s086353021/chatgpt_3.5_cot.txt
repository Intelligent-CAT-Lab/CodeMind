The variable N is initialized to 3 and the variable MOD is initialized to 10^9 + 7.
The code then initializes the variable memo as a list of empty dictionaries, with a length of N+1. This will be used for memoization.
The code defines two functions: ok and dfs.
The ok function takes a string last4 as input and checks if the string contains the substring 'AGC' in any of its permutations. If it does, the function returns False. Otherwise, it returns True.
The dfs function takes two parameters: cur and last3. It first checks if the current combination of cur and last3 is already memoized. If it is, it returns the memoized value.
If cur is equal to N, meaning we have reached the end of the sequence, the function returns 1.
Otherwise, it initializes the variable ret to 0 and iterates over the characters 'ACGT'.
For each character, it checks if adding it to last3 would result in a valid combination using the ok function. If it is valid, it recursively calls dfs with cur+1 and the updated last3, and adds the result to ret.
After the loop, it memoizes the result by storing it in memo[cur][last3] and returns ret.
Finally, the code prints the result of calling dfs with initial values of 0 and 'TTT', which is 61.
