<<<Analysis>>>
The code imports the stdin module from the sys library, which allows reading input from the console.
It initializes an empty dictionary called cnt, which will be used to count the occurrences of each lowercase letter.
The code then enters a loop that reads each line from the input. In this case, there is only one line: "This is a pen."
For each character c in the line, it converts it to lowercase using the bitwise OR operation with 0x20 (32 in decimal).
If the resulting character d is a lowercase letter, it updates the count in the dictionary cnt by 1. If the letter is not in the dictionary, it initializes its count to 0 before incrementing it.
After processing all the characters in the line, the code enters another loop that iterates over the lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z'.
For each letter c, it prints the letter followed by a colon and the count of occurrences in the dictionary cnt. If the letter is not in the dictionary, it prints 0 as the count.
In this case, the letter 'a' occurs once, the letter 'e' occurs once, and all other letters do not occur. Therefore, the output will be:
a : 1
b : 0
c : 0
d : 0
e : 1
f : 0
g : 0
h : 0
i : 2
j : 0
k : 0
l : 0
m : 0
n : 0
o : 0
p : 1
q : 0
r : 0
s : 3
t : 1
u : 0
v : 0
w : 0
x : 0
y : 0
z : 0
