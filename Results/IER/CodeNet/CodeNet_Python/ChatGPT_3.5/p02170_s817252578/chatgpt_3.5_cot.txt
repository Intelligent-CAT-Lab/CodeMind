<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable K and variable A are initialized to 1, 1 and 50, respectively.
The code initializes a list called dp with length K+1+N, where each element is initially set to 0 for the first K+1 elements and 1 for the remaining N elements.
The code then sets dp[0] to 1.
The code initializes variables c, mod, p_coin, and p_dice.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to K (inclusive).
For each iteration, it calculates dp[i] using the formula c * p_coin % mod, where c is updated using the formula (dp[i] - dp[i-N]) * p_dice % mod.
Finally, the code prints dp[K] * pow(p_coin, mod-2, mod) % mod.
