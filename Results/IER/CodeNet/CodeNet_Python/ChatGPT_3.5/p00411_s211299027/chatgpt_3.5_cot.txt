<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three inputs: a, t, and r. These inputs are then converted to integers using the map function.
The code then calculates the result by dividing r by a and then multiplying the result by t.
In this case, the values of a, t, and r are 180, 120, and 90 respectively.
So, the code will calculate (90 / 180) * 120 = 0.5 * 120 = 60.
<<<Output>>>
60
