<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string s and initializes a variable p to "ABC". It also initializes an empty set called used.
The code then enters a while loop that continues until s is equal to p. Inside the loop, it initializes a variable idx to 0 and a list c with three elements, all initialized to 0.
The code then enters another while loop that continues until idx is less than the length of s. Inside this loop, it checks if the substring of s starting at idx and of length 3 is equal to p. If it is, it increments idx by 3. Otherwise, it increments the count of the character at idx in the list c.
After the inner while loop finishes, the code checks if the number of elements in c that are equal to 0 is not equal to 1, or if the sum of all elements in c is equal to the length of s. If either of these conditions is true, it prints "No" and exits the program.
If none of the above conditions are true, the code replaces all occurrences of "ABC" in s with the character at the index in p where the corresponding element in c is equal to 0. It then continues to the next iteration of the outer while loop.
If the outer while loop finishes, it means that s is equal to p, so it prints "Yes".
In this case, the input string s is "ABC", which is already equal to p. Therefore, the code will print "Yes".

Yes
