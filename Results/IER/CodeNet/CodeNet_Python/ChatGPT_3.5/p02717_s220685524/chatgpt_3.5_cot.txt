<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input and assigns them to variables a, b, and c.
Then it prints the values of c, a, and b in that order.
In this case, the input is "1 2 3", so the values of a, b, and c are 1, 2, and 3 respectively.
The code then prints the values of c, a, and b, which are 3, 1, and 2.
<<<Output>>>
3 1 2
