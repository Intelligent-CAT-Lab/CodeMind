<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input and assigns it to the variable n.
Then it checks if n is odd or even by checking if n%2 is not equal to 0.
If n is odd, it calculates (n+1)//2 and assigns it to the variable s.
If n is even, it calculates n//2 and assigns it to the variable s.
Finally, it prints the value of s.
In this case, n is 5 which is odd, so s will be (5+1)//2 = 3.
<<<Output>>>
