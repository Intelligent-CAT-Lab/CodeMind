<<<Analysis>>>
The variable D and variable L are initialized to 10 and 5, respectively.
The code then calculates the integer division of D by L using the // operator, which gives the quotient. In this case, 10 // 5 = 2.
Next, it calculates the remainder of the division using the % operator, which gives the modulus. In this case, 10 % 5 = 0.
Finally, it adds the quotient and the modulus together to get the final result. In this case, 2 + 0 = 2.
The code then prints the value of ans, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
