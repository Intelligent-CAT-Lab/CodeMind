<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input and assigns it to the variable p.
The variable sum is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of the denominations.
The code then checks if p is greater than or equal to 10000. If it is, it adds the maximum number of 10000 denominations that can be used to the sum and subtracts the corresponding value from p.
Next, it checks if p is greater than or equal to 5000. If it is, it adds the maximum number of 5000 denominations that can be used to the sum and subtracts the corresponding value from p.
The code continues this process for 1000 and 500 denominations.
Finally, it prints the final value of sum, which is the sum of all the denominations used.
In this case, the input is 5700. The code will add one 5000 denomination and two 1000 denominations to the sum, resulting in a final value of 7000.
<<<Output>>>
7000
