<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input N.
Then it enters a nested loop, where the outer loop iterates from 1 to 3500 and the inner loop iterates from the current value of the outer loop variable to 3500.
Inside the nested loop, it checks if the expression 4*n*h-N*h-N*n is greater than 0. If it is, it proceeds to the next condition.
The next condition checks if (N*h*n)%(4*n*h-N*h-N*n) is equal to 0. If it is, it calculates the value of w as (N*h*n)/(4*n*h-N*h-N*n).
Finally, it prints the values of h, n, and w and exits the program using sys.exit().
The code will continue to iterate through the nested loop until it finds a set of values for h, n, and w that satisfy both conditions. If no such values are found, the program will exit without printing anything.
<<<Output>>>
No output will be printed if no values of h, n, and w are found that satisfy the conditions.
