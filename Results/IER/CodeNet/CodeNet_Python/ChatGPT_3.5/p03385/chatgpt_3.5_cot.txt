<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string S.
It checks if the characters 'a', 'b', and 'c' are all present in the string S.
If all three characters are present, it prints 'Yes'. Otherwise, it prints 'No'.
In this case, the input string is 'bac', which contains all three characters 'a', 'b', and 'c'.
Therefore, the code will print 'Yes'.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
