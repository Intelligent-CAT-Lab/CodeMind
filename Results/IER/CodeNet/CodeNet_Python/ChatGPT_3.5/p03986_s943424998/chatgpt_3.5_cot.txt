<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string X and initializes an empty stack using the deque data structure from the collections module.
It then iterates over each character in the input string X.
If the current character is 'S', it adds it to the left side of the stack using the appendleft() method.
If the current character is 'T', it checks if the stack is not empty. If it is not empty, it removes the leftmost element from the stack and assigns it to the variable check.
If the removed element is 'T', it adds it back to the left side of the stack using the appendleft() method, followed by adding the current character 'T' to the left side of the stack.
If the stack is empty, it simply adds the current character 'T' to the left side of the stack.
After iterating over all the characters in the input string, the code prints the length of the stack.

In the given input "TSTTSS", the code performs the following steps:
1. The first character 'T' is added to the left side of the stack.
2. The second character 'S' is ignored.
3. The third character 'T' is added to the left side of the stack.
4. The fourth character 'T' is added to the left side of the stack after removing the 'T' that was already present.
5. The fifth character 'S' is ignored.
6. The sixth character 'S' is ignored.

After processing all the characters, the stack contains two 'T' characters.
Therefore, the length of the stack is 2.
