<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes the variable mod to 10^9+7, rng to 2000100, and fctr as a list of zeros with length rng-1. It then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to rng-1 and calculates the factorial of each number using the previous factorial value. The factorial values are stored in the fctr list.

The code defines two functions: finv(x) and cmb(n,k). The finv(x) function calculates the modular inverse of x using the pow() function. The cmb(n,k) function calculates the binomial coefficient using the factorial values stored in the fctr list.

The code then reads four integers x1, y1, x2, y2 from input and assigns them to the variables x1, y1, x2, y2 respectively.

Finally, the code calculates the desired value using the cmb() function and prints the result modulo mod.
