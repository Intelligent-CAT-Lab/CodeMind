<<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module and defines a function called main().
Inside the main() function, it reads two integers a and b from the input using the map() function and input() method.
The code then checks if a is less than or equal to 0 and 0 is less than or equal to b. If this condition is true, it prints "Zero" and returns from the function.
If the previous condition is not true, the code checks if both a and b are negative. If they are, it calculates the difference between b and a and checks if it is divisible by 2. If it is, it prints "Negative" and returns from the function.
If none of the previous conditions are true, the code prints "Positive".
In this case, the input is "1 3". The code checks if 1 is less than or equal to 0 and 0 is less than or equal to 3, which is false. It then checks if 1 and 3 are negative, which is false. Therefore, the code prints "Positive".
<<<Output>>>
Positive
