<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and variable m are initialized to 2 and 2, respectively.
The variables ans1 and ans2 are initialized to 1, which will be used to store the factorial of n and m, respectively.
The variable mod is initialized to 10^9 + 7, which is a large prime number used for modulo arithmetic.

The code then checks if the absolute difference between n and m is greater than or equal to 2. If it is, it means that the difference is too large and there are no valid combinations, so it prints 0 and exits the program.

If the difference is not greater than or equal to 2, the code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive). For each iteration, it multiplies the current value of ans1 by i and takes the modulo mod. This calculates the factorial of n and stores it in ans1.

The code then enters another loop that iterates from 1 to m (inclusive). For each iteration, it multiplies the current value of ans2 by j and takes the modulo mod. This calculates the factorial of m and stores it in ans2.

After both loops finish, the code checks if the absolute difference between n and m is equal to 1. If it is, it means that there is exactly one extra element in either n or m, so it prints the product of ans1 and ans2 modulo mod.

If the absolute difference is not equal to 1, it means that n and m have the same number of elements, so it prints twice the product of ans1 and ans2 modulo mod.

In this case, n and m are both 2, so the absolute difference is 0. The code enters both loops and calculates the factorial of 2 for both ans1 and ans2. Then it prints twice the product of ans1 and ans2 modulo mod, which is 2.
