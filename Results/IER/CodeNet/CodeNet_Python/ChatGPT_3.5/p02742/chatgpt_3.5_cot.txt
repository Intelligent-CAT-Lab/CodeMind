<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by importing various modules and defining some utility functions.
Then, it sets the recursion limit and initializes some variables.
The code then defines the main function, which takes input values for H and W.
It calculates the area of the rectangle by multiplying H and W, and then divides it by 2.
If H and W are both not equal to 1, it uses the ceil function to round up the result.
Otherwise, it sets the result to 1.
Finally, it prints the result.
In this case, H = 4 and W = 5, so the area is 20.
Since both H and W are not equal to 1, the result is ceil(20/2) = 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
