<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized to 3.
The code checks if N is even or odd. In this case, N is odd.
Since N is odd, the code initializes an empty list called edge.
Then, it enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 3.
For each number s in this range, it calculates ng as N - s.
Then, it enters another loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 3.
For each number t in this range, it checks two conditions:
1. If s is greater than or equal to t, it continues to the next iteration of the loop.
2. If t is equal to ng, it continues to the next iteration of the loop.
If both conditions are not met, it appends the tuple (s, t) to the edge list.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the length of the edge list, which is 3.
Then, it prints each tuple (s, t) in the edge list, which are (1, 2), (1, 3), and (2, 3).
