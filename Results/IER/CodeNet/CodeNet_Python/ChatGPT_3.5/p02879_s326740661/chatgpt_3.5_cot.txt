<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input and assigns them to variables a and b.
It then checks if both a and b are between 1 and 9 (inclusive). If they are, it prints the product of a and b. Otherwise, it prints -1.
In this case, both a and b are between 1 and 9, so the code will print the product of 2 and 5, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
