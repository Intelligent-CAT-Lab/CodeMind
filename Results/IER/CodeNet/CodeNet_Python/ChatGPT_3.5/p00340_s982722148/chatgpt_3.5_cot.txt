<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four integers as input: a, b, c, and d.
It then checks three conditions:
1. If a is equal to b and c is equal to d, it prints 'yes'.
2. If a is equal to c and b is equal to d, it prints 'yes'.
3. If a is equal to d and b is equal to c, it prints 'yes'.
If none of these conditions are met, it prints 'no'.
In this case, the values of a, b, c, and d are 1, 1, 3, and 4 respectively.
The first condition is not met because a is equal to b but c is not equal to d.
The second condition is not met because a is not equal to c.
The third condition is not met because a is not equal to d.
Therefore, the code will print 'no'.
<<<Output>>>
no
