<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized to 4 and the variable M is initialized to 1.
The code checks if N is even or odd. In this case, N is even.
If N is even, the code enters the first loop. This loop iterates from 1 to (M+1)//2+1, which is 1 to 1 in this case.
Inside the loop, it prints the values of i and N-i+1. Since i is 1 and N is 4, it prints (1, 4).
After the first loop finishes, the code enters the second loop. This loop iterates from 0 to M-(M+1)//2, which is 0 to 0 in this case.
Inside the loop, it prints the values of M-i and M+i+2. Since M is 1, it prints (1, 3).
Since there are no more loops or statements to execute, the code finishes.
