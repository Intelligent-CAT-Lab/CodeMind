<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string using the input() function.
It then converts the input string to a string using the str() function.
Next, it slices the string from the beginning to the 8th character from the end using the [:-8] syntax.
Finally, it prints the sliced string.
In this case, the input string is "CODEFESTIVAL" and the sliced string would be "CODE".
