<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by importing necessary libraries and defining a user-defined function called ncr, which calculates the combination of two numbers using the formula n! / (r! * (n-r)!).
Then, there is another user-defined function called rd, which takes an integer parameter p and reads input based on the value of p. If p is 0, it reads a string input. If p is 1, it reads an integer input. If p is 2, it reads multiple integers separated by space. If p is 3, it reads a list of integers separated by space.
After that, there is a global variable called par, which is a list of -1s with a length of 100001.
Next, there is a for loop that iterates once because the value of t is 1. Inside the loop, it reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable n.
Then, it initializes the variables div and tot to 10 and 0, respectively.
If n is odd, it prints 0 and exits the loop.
Otherwise, it enters a while loop that continues until n is less than div. In each iteration, it divides n by div and adds the quotient to tot. Then, it multiplies div by 5.
Finally, it prints the value of tot.
