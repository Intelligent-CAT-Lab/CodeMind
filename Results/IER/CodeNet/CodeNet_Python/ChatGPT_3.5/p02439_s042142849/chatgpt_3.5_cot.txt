<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes input as a string of numbers separated by spaces and converts it into a list of integers using the map() function.
In this case, the input "4 5 3" will be converted into the list [4, 5, 3].
The code then uses the min() and max() functions to find the minimum and maximum values in the list, respectively.
The minimum value in the list is 3 and the maximum value is 5.
Finally, the code prints the minimum and maximum values separated by a space.
<<<Output>>>
3 5
