<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers, n and k, from the input.
It then checks if n is divisible by k by calculating the remainder of the division n % k.
If the remainder is 0, it means that n is divisible by k, so it prints 0.
Otherwise, it prints 1.
In this case, 7 % 3 is equal to 1, so the code will print 1.
