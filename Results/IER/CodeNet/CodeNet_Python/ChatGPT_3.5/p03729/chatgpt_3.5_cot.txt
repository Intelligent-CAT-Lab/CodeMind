<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three inputs a, b, and c using the input().split() method. In this case, the inputs are 'rng', 'gorilla', and 'apple'.
The code then checks if the last character of a (which is 'g') is equal to the first character of b (which is 'g') and if the last character of b (which is 'a') is equal to the first character of c (which is 'a').
Since both conditions are true, the code prints 'YES'.
<<<Output>>>
YES
