<<<Analysis>>>
The variable K is initialized to 15.
The code then imports the sys module and the Queue class from the queue module.
A queue object named "queue" is created.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 9 (inclusive) and adds each number to the queue.
If K is less than or equal to 9, the code prints K and exits the program.
Otherwise, a variable count is initialized to 0.
The code enters an infinite loop.
In each iteration of the loop, it removes an element from the queue and assigns it to the variable j.
The count is incremented by 1.
If the count is equal to K, the code prints j and breaks out of the loop.
If the last digit of j is not 0, it calculates a new number by multiplying j by 10 and adding the last digit minus 1. This new number is then added to the queue.
It also calculates a new number by multiplying j by 10 and adding the last digit. This new number is also added to the queue.
If the last digit of j is not 9, it calculates a new number by multiplying j by 10 and adding the last digit plus 1. This new number is also added to the queue.
The loop continues until the count is equal to K.
<<<Output>>>
15
