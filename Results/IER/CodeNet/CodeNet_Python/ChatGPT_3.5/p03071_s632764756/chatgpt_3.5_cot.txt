<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called "resolve" that takes no arguments.
Inside the function, it reads two integers from input and assigns them to variables "a" and "b".
Then, it prints the maximum value among three expressions: 2*a-1, a+b, and 2*b-1.
The expression 2*a-1 calculates twice the value of "a" minus 1.
The expression a+b calculates the sum of "a" and "b".
The expression 2*b-1 calculates twice the value of "b" minus 1.
The code prints the maximum value among these three expressions.
In this case, when a=5 and b=3, the maximum value is 9, which is the result of the expression 2*a-1.
<<<Output>>>
9
