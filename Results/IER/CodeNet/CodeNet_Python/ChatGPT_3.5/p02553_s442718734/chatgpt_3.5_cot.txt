<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four integers as input and assigns them to variables a, b, c, and d.
It then calculates the maximum value among the products of a*c, a*d, b*c, and b*d.
In this case, the values of a, b, c, and d are 1, 2, 1, and 1 respectively.
So, the code calculates the maximum value among 1*1, 1*1, 2*1, and 2*1.
The maximum value is 2.
<<<Output>>>
