<<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the math module, which provides various mathematical operations and functions.
Then it reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable n.
Next, it calculates the factorial of n using the math.factorial() function and takes the modulo 1000000007 of the result.
Finally, it prints the calculated value.
In this case, the input is 3.
The factorial of 3 is 3 * 2 * 1 = 6.
Taking the modulo 1000000007 of 6 gives the output 6.
<<<Output>>>
6
