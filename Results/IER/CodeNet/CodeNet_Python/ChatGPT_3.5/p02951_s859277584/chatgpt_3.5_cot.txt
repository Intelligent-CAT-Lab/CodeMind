<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input and assigns them to variables a, b, and c.
It then calculates the value of d by subtracting (a-b) from c.
If d is less than 0, it prints 0. Otherwise, it prints the value of d.
In this case, a=6, b=4, and c=3.
So, d = 3 - (6-4) = 1.
Since d is not less than 0, the code will print 1.
