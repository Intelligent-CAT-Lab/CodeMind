<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads three integers A, B, and C from the input.
It then checks if any of the three numbers is divisible by 2. If at least one of them is divisible by 2, it prints 0 and exits.
Otherwise, it calculates the products AB, BC, and CA.
Finally, it prints the minimum value among AB, BC, and CA.
In this case, all three numbers A, B, and C are odd, so the code calculates the products AB, BC, and CA as 9, 9, and 9 respectively.
The minimum value among these three is 9, so the code prints 9.
<<<Output>>>
9
