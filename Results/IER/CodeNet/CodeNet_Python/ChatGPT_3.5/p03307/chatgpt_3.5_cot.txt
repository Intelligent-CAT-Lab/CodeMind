<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input and assigns it to the variable n.
It then checks if n is divisible by 2 (i.e., if n % 2 == 0). If it is, it prints the value of n. Otherwise, it prints 2 times the value of n.
In this case, the input is 3, which is not divisible by 2. Therefore, the code will print 2 * 3, which is 6.
<<<Output>>>
6
