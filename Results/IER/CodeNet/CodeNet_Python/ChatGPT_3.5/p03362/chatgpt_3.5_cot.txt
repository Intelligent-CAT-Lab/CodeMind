<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function make_prime_nums(n) that generates a list of prime numbers up to n.
The main function reads an integer n from input.
It then calls the make_prime_nums function with an argument of 2000 to generate a list of prime numbers.
The code initializes an empty list ans to store the prime numbers that satisfy the condition.
It iterates over each prime number pi in the list p.
If pi ends with a digit 1, it appends pi to the ans list.
If the length of ans is equal to n, it breaks out of the loop.
Finally, it prints the elements of ans separated by a space.

In this case, the input is 5.
The code generates a list of prime numbers up to 2000.
It then iterates over each prime number and checks if it ends with a digit 1.
If it does, it appends it to the ans list.
Since the length of ans is equal to n (5), it breaks out of the loop.
Finally, it prints the elements of ans, which are the first 5 prime numbers that end with a digit 1.
