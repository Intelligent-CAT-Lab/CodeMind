<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by importing the math module and initializing the variable mod to 10^9+7.
Then, it reads two integers n and k from the input.
The code initializes a list cnt with k+1 elements, all set to 0.
Next, it enters a loop that iterates from 1 to k+1. For each iteration, it calculates the value of cnt[i] using the pow function from the math module. The pow function calculates the value of (k/i)^n modulo mod.
After that, the code enters another loop that iterates from k+1 to 0 (exclusive) with a step of -1. For each iteration, it enters a while loop that multiplies i by j until i*j is greater than k. Inside the while loop, it subtracts cnt[i*j] from cnt[i] and takes the modulo mod of cnt[i].
Finally, the code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to k+1. For each iteration, it adds cnt[i]*i to the variable ans and takes the modulo mod of ans.
The final value of ans is printed as the output.
