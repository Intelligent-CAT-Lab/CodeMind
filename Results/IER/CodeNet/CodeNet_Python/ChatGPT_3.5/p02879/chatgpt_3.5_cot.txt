<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs, `a` and `b`, and converts them to integers using the `int()` function.
Then, it checks if both `a` and `b` are between 0 and 10 (exclusive). If they are, it multiplies `a` and `b` and prints the result.
If either `a` or `b` is not between 0 and 10, it prints "-1".
In this case, `a` is 2 and `b` is 5, both of which are between 0 and 10. Therefore, the code will multiply `a` and `b` and print the result.
<<<Output>>>
10
