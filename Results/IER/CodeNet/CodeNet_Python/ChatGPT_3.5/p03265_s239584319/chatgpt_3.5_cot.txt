<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input values for x1, y1, x2, and y2.
It then creates two numpy arrays, p1 and p2, using the input values.
Next, it calculates v1 by subtracting p1 from p2.
Then, it calculates v2 by taking the negative of the second element of v1 and swapping the first and second elements.
After that, it calculates p3 by adding p2 and v2.
Finally, it calculates p4 by adding p3 and the negative of v1.
The code then prints the values of p3 and p4, separated by a space.
In this case, the values of p3 and p4 are [0, 1] and [0, 0] respectively.
<<<Output>>>
0 1 0 0
