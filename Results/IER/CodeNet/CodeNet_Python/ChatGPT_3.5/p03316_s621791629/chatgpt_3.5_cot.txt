<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input number as a string and stores it in the variable n.
It initializes a variable s to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of the digits of the input number.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the length of the input number.
In each iteration, it converts the current digit to an integer and adds it to s.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if the input number is divisible by s without any remainder.
If it is, it prints 'Yes'. Otherwise, it prints 'No'.
In this case, the input number is 12. The sum of its digits is 1 + 2 = 3.
Since 12 is divisible by 3 without any remainder, the output will be 'Yes'.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
