<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes input as a list of integers and assigns it to the variable i.
The code then checks a series of conditions using the values in the list i.
First, it checks if the sum of i[2] and i[4] is less than or equal to i[0].
If this condition is true, it proceeds to the next condition.
Next, it checks if the difference between i[2] and i[4] is greater than or equal to 0.
If this condition is true, it proceeds to the next condition.
Next, it checks if the sum of i[3] and i[4] is less than or equal to i[1].
If this condition is true, it proceeds to the next condition.
Finally, it checks if the difference between i[3] and i[4] is greater than or equal to 0.
If this condition is true, it prints "Yes".
If any of the conditions are not met, it prints "No".
In this case, the conditions are met and the output will be "Yes".
