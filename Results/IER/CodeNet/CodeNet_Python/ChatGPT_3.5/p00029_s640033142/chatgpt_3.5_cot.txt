<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string and splits it into a list of words using the split() function. In this case, the input string is "Thank you for your mail and your lectures", so the list A will contain the words ["Thank", "you", "for", "your", "mail", "and", "your", "lectures"].
The code then initializes two empty lists, S and L, which will be used to store the counts of each word and the lengths of each word, respectively.
Next, the code enters a loop that iterates over each word in the list A. For each word, it counts the number of occurrences of that word in the list A using the count() function and stores it in the list S. It also calculates the length of the word using the len() function and stores it in the list L.
After the loop finishes, the code finds the maximum value in the list S using the max() function and stores it in the variable M. It also finds the maximum value in the list L and stores it in the variable m.
The code then finds the index of the maximum value in the list S using the index() function and stores it in the variable Y. It also finds the index of the maximum value in the list L and stores it in the variable y.
Finally, the code prints the word in the list A at index Y and the word in the list A at index y, which correspond to the words with the highest count and the longest length, respectively. In this case, the output will be "your lectures".
<<<Output>>>
your lectures
