<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three inputs: n, a, and b. These inputs are separated by spaces and are converted to integers using the map() function.
The code then prints the minimum value between a * n and b.
In this case, n = 7, a = 17, and b = 120.
So, the code will calculate a * n = 17 * 7 = 119 and compare it with b = 120.
Since a * n = 119 is less than b = 120, the minimum value is a * n.
Therefore, the output will be 119.
<<<Output>>>
119
