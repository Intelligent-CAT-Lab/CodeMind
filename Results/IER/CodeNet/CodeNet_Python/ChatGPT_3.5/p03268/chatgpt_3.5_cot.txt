<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers, n and k, from the input. In this case, n is 3 and k is 2.
The code then calculates n_k, which is the integer division of n by k. In this case, n_k is 1.
The code also calculates n_mod_k, which is the remainder of the division of n by k. In this case, n_mod_k is 1.
The code defines a function called mod_k, which takes an argument x. Inside the function, it initializes a variable res to n_k.
If x is not equal to 0 and x is less than or equal to n_mod_k, it increments res by 1.
If x is equal to 0 and n_mod_k is equal to k, it increments res by 1.
The code then initializes a variable ans to 0.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to k-1. In this case, the loop will iterate from 0 to 1.
For each iteration of the loop, it calculates the values of a_mod, b_mod, and c_mod.
a_mod is equal to i.
b_mod is equal to -i modulo k.
c_mod is equal to -i modulo k.
The code then checks if (b_mod + c_mod) modulo k is equal to 0.
If it is, it increments ans by the product of mod_k(a_mod), mod_k(b_mod), and mod_k(c_mod).
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 1.
