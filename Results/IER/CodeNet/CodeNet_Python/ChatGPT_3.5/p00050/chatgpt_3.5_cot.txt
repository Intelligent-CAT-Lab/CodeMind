<<<Analysis>>>
The code uses the re.sub() function from the re module to perform a substitution in a string.
The regular expression pattern "(apple|peach)" matches either the word "apple" or the word "peach".
The lambda function is used as the replacement parameter in re.sub(). It takes a match object as input and returns either "apple" or "peach" based on the value of m.group(0).
The input string is "the cost of one peach is higher than that of one apple."
The code replaces every occurrence of "apple" or "peach" in the input string with either "apple" or "peach" itself, depending on the match.
The final result is printed, which is "the cost of one peach is higher than that of one peach."
<<<Output>>>
the cost of one peach is higher than that of one peach.
