<<<Analysis>>>
The variable a, variable b and variable k are initialized to 8, 12 and 2, respectively.
An empty list res is initialized, which will be used to store the common divisors of a and b.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 100 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 100.
For each number i in this range, it checks if both a and b are divisible by i without any remainder. If they are, it appends i to the list res.
After the loop finishes, the code sorts the list res in descending order.
Finally, the code prints the k-th element of the sorted list res, which is 8 in this case.
<<<Output>>>
8
