<<<Analysis>>>
The code imports the groupby function from the itertools module and then prints the result of a calculation.
The input is taken using the input() function.
The input is then passed to the groupby function, which groups consecutive elements that are the same.
The code uses a generator expression to count the number of groups and subtracts 1 from it.
Finally, the result is printed.
In this case, the input is "BBBWW", which has 2 groups of "B" and 1 group of "W".
So, the output will be 2 - 1 = 1.
