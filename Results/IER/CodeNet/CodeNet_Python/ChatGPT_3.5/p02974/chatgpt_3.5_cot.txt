<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by importing various modules and defining some utility functions.
Then, it initializes variables n and k to the values obtained from the input.
The code also initializes a 3D list called dp with dimensions (n+1) x (n+1) x (k+2*(n+1)).
dp[i][j][l] represents the number of ways to choose j numbers from the first i numbers such that the sum of the chosen numbers is l.
The initial value of dp[0][0][0] is set to 1.
The code then enters a nested loop that iterates over i, j, and l.
For each combination of i, j, and l, the code updates the values of dp[i+1][j+1][l+2*(j+1)], dp[i+1][j][l+2*j], and dp[i+1][j-1][l+(j-1)*2] based on the values of dp[i][j][l].
Finally, the code prints the value of dp[n][0][k] modulo mod.
