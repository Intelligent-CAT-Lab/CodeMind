<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs, N and M, using the map() function and split() method. In this case, N is 1 and M is 998244353.
A 2D list, dp, is initialized with dimensions (3*N+1) x (2*N+1), filled with zeros.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to N (inclusive). For each iteration, it sets the value of dp[0][j] to 1.
Next, there is another nested loop that iterates from 1 to (3*N+1) and from 0 to (2*N+1). Inside this loop, there are several conditional statements that calculate the values of dp[i][j] based on the values of dp[i-1][j-1], dp[i-2][j+1], and dp[i-3][j].
Finally, the code prints the value of dp[3*N][N] modulo M.
