<<<Analysis>>>
The code first defines several helper functions for prime factorization, finding divisors, and extended Euclidean algorithm.
Then, it reads an integer N from input.
If N is equal to 1, it prints 1 and exits.
Otherwise, it calculates the prime factorization of N and stores it in the variable pf.
It then initializes a list L to store the powers of prime factors.
For each prime factor p in pf, it calculates the power n and adds pow(p, n) to L.
If N is odd, it sets the initial value of ans to N-1.
If N is even, it sets the initial value of ans to 2*N-1.
Next, it uses itertools.product to generate all possible combinations of 0 and 1 with length M (the number of prime factors).
For each combination, it calculates the values of a and b by multiplying the corresponding powers in L.
It then solves the equation ax - by = 1 using the extended Euclidean algorithm, where x and y are the coefficients.
Finally, it updates the value of ans to the minimum of abs(a*x) and abs(b*y), if it is non-zero.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of ans.
