<<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the math module.
Then it takes an integer input N.
The code then calculates the square root of N using the math.sqrt() function and converts it to an integer using the int() function.
Finally, it multiplies the integer square root by itself and prints the result.
In this case, the input is 10.
The square root of 10 is approximately 3.1622776601683795.
Converting it to an integer gives 3.
Multiplying 3 by itself gives 9.
So the output of the code execution would be 9.
<<<Output>>>
9
