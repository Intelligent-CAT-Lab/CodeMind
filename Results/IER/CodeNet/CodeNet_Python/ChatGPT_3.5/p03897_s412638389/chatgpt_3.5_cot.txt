<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 2.
The code then creates two lists: odd and even. The odd list contains all odd numbers from 3 to n (inclusive), which is an empty list in this case. The even list contains all even numbers from 2 to n (inclusive), which is [2] in this case.
The code initializes an empty list ans, which will store pairs of numbers.
The code initializes a list added with n elements, all set to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to n (inclusive), incrementing by 2. This loop appends pairs of numbers (1, i) to the ans list.
The code then enters another loop that iterates from 2 to n (inclusive), incrementing by 3. Inside this loop, there is an if-else statement that checks if i is divisible by 2. If it is, it enters a loop that appends pairs of numbers (item, i) to the ans list, where item is an element from the odd list. If i is not divisible by 2, it enters a loop that appends pairs of numbers (item, i) to the ans list, where item is an element from the even list.
After this loop, the code enters a loop that iterates from n to 0, decrementing by 1. Inside this loop, there is an if statement that checks if (i - 2) is divisible by 3. If it is, it continues to the next iteration of the loop. If it is not, it enters a loop that appends pairs of numbers (item, i) to the ans list, where item is an element from the odd list. It then breaks out of the loop.
The ans list is then sorted in ascending order.
The code prints the length of the ans list.
Then, it enters a loop that iterates over the pairs of numbers in the ans list and prints each pair, subtracting 1 from each element.
