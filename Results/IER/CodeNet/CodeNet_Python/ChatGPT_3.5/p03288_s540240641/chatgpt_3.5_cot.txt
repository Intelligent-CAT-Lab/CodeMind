<<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports several modules and defines some functions. These functions are not used in the code, so we can ignore them for now.
The code then reads an integer R from the standard input.
It checks if R is between 0 and 1200 (exclusive). If it is, it prints "ABC".
If R is not between 0 and 1200, it checks if R is between 1200 and 2800 (exclusive). If it is, it prints "ARC".
If R is not between 1200 and 2800, it prints "AGC".
In this case, the input is 1199, which is less than 1200. Therefore, the code will print "ABC".
<<<Output>>>
ABC
