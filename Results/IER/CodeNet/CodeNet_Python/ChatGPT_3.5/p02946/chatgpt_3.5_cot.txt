<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines several utility functions and constants, but they are not used in this specific case.
The code then reads two integers K and X from input, which are 3 and 7 in this case.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from max(X-K+1, -1000000) to min(X+K, 1000000).
In this case, max(X-K+1, -1000000) is 5 and min(X+K, 1000000) is 10, so the loop will iterate from 5 to 10 (inclusive).
For each iteration, the code prints the current value of i followed by a space.
After the loop finishes, the code prints an empty line.
So the output will be the numbers 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 followed by an empty line.
<<<Output>>>
5 6 7 8 9 10
