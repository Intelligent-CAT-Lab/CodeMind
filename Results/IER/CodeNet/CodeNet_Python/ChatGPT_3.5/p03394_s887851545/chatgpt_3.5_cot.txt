<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function `_agc022_b` that takes an integer `N` as input.
If `N` is greater than or equal to 4, the code initializes an empty list `S` and calculates the integer division of `N` by 8 and stores it in variable `a`.
The code then defines a list `l` with the values [2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12].
The code enters a nested loop that iterates `a` times and for each iteration, it iterates over the values in `l` and appends `i * 12 + v` to the list `S`.
After the nested loop, the code calculates the remainder of `N` divided by 8 and stores it in variable `b`.
Based on the value of `b`, the code assigns a new value to `l` and appends `a * 12 + v` to `S` for each value in `l`.
Finally, the code prints the elements of `S` separated by a space.
If `N` is equal to 3, the code prints the string '2 5 63'.
In this case, `N` is equal to 3, so the code will print '2 5 63'.
<<<Output>>>
2 5 63
