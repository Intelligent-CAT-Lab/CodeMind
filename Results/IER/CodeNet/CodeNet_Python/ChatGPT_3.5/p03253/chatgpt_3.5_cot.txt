<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers n and m as input.
It initializes three lists: fact, inv, and invfact, each with size MAX (2*10^5+1).
The code then defines a function comb_build, which calculates the factorial, inverse, and inverse factorial values for numbers up to n.
Next, it defines a function nCk, which calculates the binomial coefficient using the factorial, inverse, and inverse factorial values.
Then, it defines a function prime_factor, which calculates the prime factors of a given number n.
The code calls the comb_build function with MAX as the argument to precalculate the factorial, inverse, and inverse factorial values.
It initializes a variable ans to 1.
For each value e in the prime factors of m, it calculates the binomial coefficient using the nCk function and multiplies it with ans.
Finally, it prints the value of ans modulo MOD.

In this case, n=2 and m=6.
The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3.
The code calculates the binomial coefficient for each prime factor and multiplies it with ans.
The binomial coefficient for 2 is nCk(2+2-1, 2) = nCk(3, 2) = 3.
The binomial coefficient for 3 is nCk(1+2-1, 1) = nCk(2, 1) = 2.
The final value of ans is 3*2 = 6.
Since MOD = 10^9+7, the output is 6 modulo 10^9+7, which is 6.
