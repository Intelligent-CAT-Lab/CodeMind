<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by importing several modules and setting some constants.
It then initializes a list called POW with powers of 3 up to SIZE.
The code reads an integer W from input.
Next, it finds the maximum digit that can be used to represent W in base 3. It does this by iterating through the POW list and checking if (POW[i]-1)//2 is greater than or equal to W. The first value of i that satisfies this condition is stored in max_digit.
The code initializes two lists, ans and work, both with length max_digit+1.
Then, it defines a recursive function called recursive that takes two parameters: digit and tmp_sum. This function is used to generate all possible combinations of digits that sum up to W.
Inside the recursive function, there is a base case when digit is -1. In this case, it checks if tmp_sum is equal to W. If it is, it copies the values from work to ans.
Otherwise, it sets work[digit] to '0' and makes a recursive call with digit-1 and tmp_sum.
Then, it sets work[digit] to '+' and makes a recursive call with digit-1 and tmp_sum+POW[digit].
Finally, if tmp_sum is greater than 0, it sets work[digit] to '-' and makes a recursive call with digit-1 and tmp_sum-POW[digit].
After defining the recursive function, the code calls recursive with max_digit and 0 as arguments.
Then, it iterates through the ans list in reverse order and prints the corresponding symbol ('0', '+', or '-') depending on the value at each position. If the value is '0', it is skipped unless it is the first digit.
Finally, it prints a newline character.
