<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 100.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the number of coins needed.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the values 25, 10, 5, and 1. These values represent the denominations of coins (quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies).
For each denomination x, the code calculates the number of coins needed by dividing n by x using integer division (//) and adds it to ans. It then updates the value of n by taking the remainder of the division n % x.
This process is repeated for each denomination, starting from the largest (25) and going down to the smallest (1).
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which represents the total number of coins needed to make change for n.
