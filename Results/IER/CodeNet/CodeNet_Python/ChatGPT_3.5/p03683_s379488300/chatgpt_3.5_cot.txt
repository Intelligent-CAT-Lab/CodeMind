<<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the factorial function from the math module.
Then it takes two integers n and m as input.
The code initializes the variable mod to 10^9 + 7.
It checks if the absolute difference between n and m is greater than 1. If it is, it prints 0 and exits.
If the difference is not greater than 1, it checks if the sum of n and m is even. If it is, it calculates the answer as the product of the factorials of n and m, multiplied by 2, modulo mod.
If the sum is not even, it calculates the answer as the product of the factorials of n and m, modulo mod.
Finally, it prints the answer.
In this case, n = 2 and m = 2. The absolute difference between them is 0, which is not greater than 1. The sum of n and m is 4, which is even. So the answer is calculated as factorial(2) * factorial(2) * 2 % mod. The factorials of 2 and 2 are both 2, so the answer is 2 * 2 * 2 % mod = 8 % mod = 8.
