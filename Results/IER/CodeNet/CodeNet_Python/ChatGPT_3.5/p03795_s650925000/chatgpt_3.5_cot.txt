<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input and assigns it to the variable n.
It then calculates the integer division of n by 15 and assigns it to the variable N.
Finally, it calculates the output by multiplying 800 by n and subtracting 200 times N from it.
In this case, since n is 20, the value of N would be 1 (20 divided by 15 is 1 with a remainder of 5).
Therefore, the output would be 800 * 20 - 200 * 1 = 16000 - 200 = 15800.
<<<Output>>>
15800
