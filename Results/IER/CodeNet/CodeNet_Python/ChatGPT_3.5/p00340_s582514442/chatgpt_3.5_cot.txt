<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four inputs e1, e2, e3, and e4.
It then checks multiple conditions using if-elif statements.
The first condition checks if e1 is equal to e2 and e3 is equal to e4.
The second condition checks if e1 is equal to e3 and e2 is equal to e4.
The third condition checks if e1 is equal to e4 and e2 is equal to e3.
The fourth condition checks if e1, e2, e3, and e4 are all equal.
If any of these conditions are true, it prints 'yes'.
If none of the conditions are true, it prints 'no'.
In this case, e1=1, e2=1, e3=3, and e4=4.
None of the conditions are true, so the code will print 'no'.
<<<Output>>>
no
