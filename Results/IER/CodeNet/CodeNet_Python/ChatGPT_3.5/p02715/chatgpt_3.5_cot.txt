<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized to 3 and the variable K is initialized to 2.
The variable P is initialized to 10^9 + 7, which is a large prime number.
The variable X is initialized as a list of zeros with length K+1.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the final answer.

The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to K+1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 2.
For each number i in this range, it adds i to the corresponding element in the X list.
Then, it enters another loop that iterates from i*2 to K+1 with a step size of i.
For each number j in this range, it subtracts X[i] from the corresponding element in the X list.
This step is essentially subtracting the contribution of i from all its multiples in the X list.

After the inner loop finishes, the code calculates X[i] * (K//i)^N % P and adds it to the ans variable.
The expression (K//i)^N calculates the integer division of K by i and raises it to the power of N.
The % P ensures that the result is modulo P.

Finally, the code prints the final value of ans % P, which is the remainder when ans is divided by P.
