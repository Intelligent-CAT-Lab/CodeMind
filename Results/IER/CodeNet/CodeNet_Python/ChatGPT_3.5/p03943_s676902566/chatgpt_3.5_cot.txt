<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input and assigns them to variables a, b, and c.
It then checks three conditions:
1. If a is equal to the sum of b and c, it prints 'Yes'.
2. If a is equal to the sum of b and c, it prints 'Yes'.
3. If a is equal to the sum of b and c, it prints 'Yes'.
If none of these conditions are met, it prints 'No'.
In this case, a = 10, b = 30, and c = 20.
The first condition is not met because 10 is not equal to 30 + 20.
The second condition is not met because 10 is not equal to 30 + 20.
The third condition is met because 10 is equal to 30 + 20.
Therefore, the code will print 'Yes'.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
