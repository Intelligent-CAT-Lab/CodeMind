<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers a and b as input.
It then creates a list j with the numbers [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,1].
The code checks the index of a in the list j and the index of b in the list j.
If the index of a is greater than the index of b, it prints 'Alice'.
If the index of a is less than the index of b, it prints 'Bob'.
If the index of a is equal to the index of b, it prints 'Draw'.
In this case, a is 8 and b is 6. The index of 8 in the list j is 6 and the index of 6 in the list j is 4.
Therefore, the code will print 'Bob'.
<<<Output>>>
Bob
