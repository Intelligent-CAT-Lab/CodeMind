<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called "get" that takes an integer "n" as input. This function returns a list of edges that form a line graph if "n" is not a power of 2, or if "n" is a power of 2, it returns an empty list. The line graph is constructed based on certain conditions and rules.
The main part of the code reads an integer "n" from input and calls the "get" function with "n" as the argument. If the returned list is not empty, it prints "Yes" and then prints each edge in the list. If the returned list is empty, it prints "No".
In this case, the input is 3. The "get" function will return a list of edges that form a line graph for "n=3". Therefore, the output will be "Yes" followed by the edges of the line graph.
