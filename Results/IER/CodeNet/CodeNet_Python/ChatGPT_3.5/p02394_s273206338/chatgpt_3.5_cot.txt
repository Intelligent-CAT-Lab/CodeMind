<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes input values for variables W, H, x, y, and r.
It then checks four conditions:
1. left: checks if x-r is greater than or equal to 0
2. right: checks if x+r is less than or equal to W
3. top: checks if y+r is less than or equal to H
4. bottom: checks if y-r is greater than or equal to 0

If all four conditions are true (i.e., equal to 1), it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".

In this case, the values of W, H, x, y, and r are 5, 4, 2, 2, and 1 respectively.
The code checks the following conditions:
1. left: 2-1 >= 0, which is true
2. right: 2+1 <= 5, which is true
3. top: 2+1 <= 4, which is true
4. bottom: 2-1 >= 0, which is true

Since all four conditions are true, the code will print "Yes".

<<<Output>>>
Yes
