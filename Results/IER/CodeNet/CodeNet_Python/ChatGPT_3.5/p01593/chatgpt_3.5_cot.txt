<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a list dp with the first element as 1 and the rest as 0. It also takes two inputs, n and m, and assigns them to variables n and m respectively.
The code then enters a loop that iterates n times. In each iteration, it initializes a variable j to 1 and enters another loop. This inner loop continues as long as the sum of i and j is less than or equal to n and j is less than or equal to m.
Inside the inner loop, the code updates the value of dp[i+j] by adding dp[i] divided by (n-i). The value of j is then incremented by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the value of dp[n] with 10 decimal places.
