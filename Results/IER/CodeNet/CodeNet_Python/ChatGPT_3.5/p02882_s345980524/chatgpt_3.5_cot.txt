<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three inputs: a, h, and x. These inputs are converted to integers and stored in the variables a, h, and x, respectively.
The code then calculates the value of y using the formula: y = 2*h/a - 2*x/a**3.
Next, the code calculates the value of z using the formula: z = (h**2)*a/(2*x).
The code then checks if b (which is equal to x/(a**2)) is greater than h/2. If it is, it prints the result of math.degrees(math.atan(y)). Otherwise, it prints the result of math.degrees(math.atan(z)).
In this case, a=2, h=2, and x=4. Plugging these values into the formulas, we get y = 2 - 2/8 = 1.75 and z = (2**2)*2/(2*4) = 1.
Since b = 4/(2**2) = 1, which is not greater than 2/2, the code will print math.degrees(math.atan(z)).
The output will be the result of math.degrees(math.atan(1)), which is approximately 45 degrees.
