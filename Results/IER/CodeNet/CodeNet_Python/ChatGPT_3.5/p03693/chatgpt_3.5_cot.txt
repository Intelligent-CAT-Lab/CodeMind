<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input and assigns them to variables r, g, and b.
It then checks if the remainder of (g * 10 + b) divided by 4 is equal to 0.
In this case, g * 10 + b is equal to 32, and 32 % 4 is equal to 0.
Therefore, the condition is true and the code prints "YES".
<<<Output>>>
YES
