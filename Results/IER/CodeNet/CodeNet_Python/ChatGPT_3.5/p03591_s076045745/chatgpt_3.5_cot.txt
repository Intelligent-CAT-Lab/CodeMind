<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string S.
It checks if the first four characters of S are equal to "YAKI".
If they are, it prints "Yes".
If they are not, it prints "No".
In this case, the first four characters of the input string "YAKINIKU" are "YAKI", so the code will print "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
