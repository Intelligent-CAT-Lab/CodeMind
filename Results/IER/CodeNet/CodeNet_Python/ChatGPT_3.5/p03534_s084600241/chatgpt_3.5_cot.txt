<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string S and counts the occurrences of the characters 'a', 'b', and 'c' in the string. It stores the counts in a list called nums.
The code then sorts the nums list in ascending order.
Next, it subtracts the first element of nums from the last element and the second element of nums.
After that, the code defines a function called check(). Inside the function, it checks if the second element of nums is 0 and the last element of nums is greater than 1. If this condition is true, it returns False.
Then, it checks if the second element of nums is greater than 1 or the last element of nums is greater than 1. If either of these conditions is true, it returns False.
If none of the above conditions are met, it returns True.
Finally, the code prints "YES" if the check() function returns True, otherwise it prints "NO".

In this case, the input string is "abac".
The code counts the occurrences of 'a', 'b', and 'c' in the string and stores the counts in nums.
The sorted nums list is [1, 1, 2].
The code subtracts the first element (1) from the last element (2) and the second element (1).
After the subtraction, the nums list becomes [0, 0, 1].
The check() function is called and it returns True.
Therefore, the code prints "YES".

<<<Output>>>
YES
