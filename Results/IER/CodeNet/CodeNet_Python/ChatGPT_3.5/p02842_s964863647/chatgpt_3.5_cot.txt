<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input N, which is 432 in this case.
It then calculates x by dividing N by 1.08 and rounding up to the nearest integer using the math.ceil() function.
Next, it checks if the product of x and 1.08, rounded down to the nearest integer using the math.floor() function, is equal to N.
If the condition is true, it prints the value of x.
Otherwise, it prints ":(".
In this case, x is calculated as 400, and the product of x and 1.08 is 432, which is equal to N.
Therefore, the code will print 400.
<<<Output>>>
400
