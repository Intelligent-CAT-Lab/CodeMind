<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N and variable K are initialized to 3 and 2, respectively.
Two variables ans1 and ans2 are initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the counts of numbers meeting the conditions.
The code then checks if K is even or odd. In this case, K is even, so it enters the first if statement.
Inside the if statement, it enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 3.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is divisible by K. If it is, it increments ans1 by 1.
It also checks if i is equal to K//2. In this case, K//2 is 1, so it increments ans2 by 1.
After the loop finishes, it calculates the sum of cubes of ans1 and ans2 and prints the result, which is 9.
<<<Output>>>
9
