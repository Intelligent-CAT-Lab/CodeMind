<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input and assigns them to variables a and b.
It then checks if the maximum of a and b is greater than 9. If it is, it prints -1.
Otherwise, it prints the product of a and b.
In this case, the maximum of 2 and 5 is 5, which is not greater than 9.
So, the code will print the product of 2 and 5, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
