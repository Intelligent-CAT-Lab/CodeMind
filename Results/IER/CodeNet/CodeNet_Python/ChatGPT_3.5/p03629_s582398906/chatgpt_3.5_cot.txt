<<<Analysis>>>
The code first reads the input string A, which is "atcoderregularcontest".
It then initializes a list K with all elements set to 0, and a set s to store unique characters.
The variable cnt is set to 1, which will be used to count the number of different subsequences.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from the last character of A to the first character.
In each iteration, it updates the value of K[i] to cnt, adds the current character A[i] to the set s, and checks if the size of s is equal to 26 (the number of lowercase alphabets).
If the size of s is 26, it means that all alphabets have been encountered, so cnt is incremented by 1 and s is reset to an empty set.
After this loop, the code creates a defaultdict d to store the indices of each character in A.
It then initializes an empty list ans to store the final result, and a variable now to keep track of the current index.
The code enters another loop that iterates cnt times.
In each iteration, it iterates over all lowercase alphabets.
For each alphabet, it finds the index of the next occurrence of that alphabet in A using the bisect_right function.
If the index is equal to the length of d[alpha], it means that there are no more occurrences of that alphabet, so it appends the alphabet to ans and breaks out of the loop.
Otherwise, it checks if the value of K[nex] is equal to cnt-i-1.
If it is, it means that the next occurrence of the alphabet is part of a subsequence that has not been encountered before, so it updates now to nex and appends the alphabet to ans.
After this loop, the code prints the final result by joining all the characters in ans.
