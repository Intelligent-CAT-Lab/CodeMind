<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines several functions and imports some modules, but only the function B() is called at the end.
Inside the function B(), a defaultdict named d is created to store the count of each number encountered.
The variable s is initialized to the input value 8.
The function f(n) is defined to calculate the next number in the sequence based on the current number.
The code enters a loop that continues until the current number s is already in the defaultdict d.
Inside the loop, the count of the current number s is set to 1 in the defaultdict d.
The current number s is updated by calling the function f(s).
The loop counter i is incremented by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of i, which represents the number of steps taken to reach a number that has already been encountered.
