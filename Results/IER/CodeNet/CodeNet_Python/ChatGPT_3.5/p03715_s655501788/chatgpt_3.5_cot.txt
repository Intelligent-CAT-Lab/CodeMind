<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function `divide_h` that takes two parameters `h` and `w`. It initializes a variable `min_diff` to a very large value (1e12) to keep track of the minimum difference between the areas of the divided rectangles.

The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to `h-1`. For each value of `x`, it calculates the remaining height after dividing by `x` and stores it in `h_rem`. It also calculates the area of the rectangle `A` by multiplying `x` and `w`.

Next, the code considers two possible ways of dividing the rectangle: vertically and horizontally.

For the vertical division, it calculates the width of the left rectangle `w1` by dividing `w` by 2. It then calculates the areas of the left rectangle `B` and the right rectangle `C` by multiplying `w1` and `h_rem` and `(w - w1)` and `h_rem`, respectively.

For the horizontal division, it calculates the height of the top rectangle `h1` by dividing `h_rem` by 2. It then calculates the areas of the top rectangle `B` and the bottom rectangle `C` by multiplying `w` and `h1` and `w` and `(h_rem - h1)`, respectively.

After calculating the areas of the divided rectangles, the code calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum areas and stores it in `tmp`. If `tmp` is smaller than the current minimum difference `min_diff`, it updates `min_diff` with the new value.

After the loop finishes, the code returns the final value of `min_diff`.

In the main part of the code, it reads two integers `H` and `W` from input and calls the `divide_h` function twice with different arguments (`H, W` and `W, H`). It stores the results in variables `a1` and `a2`.

Finally, it prints the minimum value between `a1` and `a2`.
