The code reads an integer n from the input.
It then calculates the square root of n using the numpy sqrt function and assigns it to variable a.
Finally, it prints the square of a as a string.
In this case, n is 10, so the square root of 10 is approximately 3.1622776601683795.
The square of 3.1622776601683795 is approximately 10.000000000000002.
Therefore, the output of the code would be "10.000000000000002".
<<<Output>>>
