<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input and assigns them to variables x and y.
It then checks if y is divisible by x by using the modulo operator (%). If the remainder is 0, it means y is divisible by x.
If y is divisible by x, it prints the sum of x and y.
If y is not divisible by x, it prints the difference between y and x.
In this case, 12 is divisible by 4, so the code will print the sum of 4 and 12, which is 16.
<<<Output>>>
16
