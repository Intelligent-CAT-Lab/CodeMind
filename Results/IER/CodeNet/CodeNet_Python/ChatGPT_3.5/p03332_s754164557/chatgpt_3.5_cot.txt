<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n, a, b, and k are initialized to 4, 1, 2, and 5, respectively.
The variable m is calculated as n // 2 + 1, which is 3 in this case.
The variable mod is initialized to 998244353.
The list comb is initialized with m elements, all set to 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to m-1 (inclusive).
For each iteration, it calculates the value of comb[i] using the formula comb[i] = comb[i - 1] * (n + 1 - i) * pow(i, mod - 2, mod).
The value of comb[i] is then updated to be the remainder when divided by mod.
After the loop finishes, the variable ans is initialized to 0.
The code then enters another loop that iterates from 0 to n (inclusive).
For each iteration, it checks if a * i is greater than k. If it is, it breaks out of the loop.
Otherwise, it calculates the value of j as k - a * i.
If j is divisible by b, it divides j by b and checks if it is within the range [0, n].
If it is, it updates the values of i and j to be the minimum of i and n - i, and the minimum of j and n - j, respectively.
Finally, it adds the product of comb[i] and comb[j] to ans, and updates ans to be the remainder when divided by mod.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of ans.
