The variable X is initialized to 1024.
The code then enters a while loop that continues as long as X is greater than or equal to 500. In each iteration of the loop, X is decreased by 500 and the variable s is increased by 1. This loop will run 2 times because 1024 is greater than 500.
After the first loop, X becomes 24 and s becomes 2.
The code then enters another while loop that continues as long as X is greater than or equal to 5. In each iteration of the loop, X is decreased by 5 and the variable p is increased by 1. This loop will run 4 times because 24 is greater than 5.
After the second loop, X becomes 4 and p becomes 4.
Finally, the code prints the value of 1000*s + 5*p, which is 2000 + 20 = 2020.
<<<Output>>>
2020
