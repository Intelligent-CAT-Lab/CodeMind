<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input and assigns them to variables a and b.
Then it calculates the integer division of a by b using the // operator and adds the remainder of the division using the % operator.
Finally, it prints the result of the calculation.
In this case, a is 10 and b is 5, so the integer division of 10 by 5 is 2 and the remainder is 0.
Therefore, the output of the code execution will be 2.
