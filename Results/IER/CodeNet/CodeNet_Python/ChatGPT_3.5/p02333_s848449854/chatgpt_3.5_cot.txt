<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function `combMod` that calculates the combination of two numbers modulo a given number `p`.
The code then defines another function `resolve` that takes two inputs `n` and `k`.
If `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, the code enters a loop that iterates `k` times.
In each iteration, it calculates a term using the `combMod` function, the current iteration index `i`, and the values of `k` and `n`.
It then adds this term to the variable `ans` and takes the modulo `MOD` of the result.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of `ans`.
If `n` is less than `k`, the code sets `ans` to 0 and directly prints it.
In this case, `n` is 4 and `k` is 3.
The code enters the loop and calculates the terms for `i` from 0 to 2.
The final value of `ans` is 18.

18
