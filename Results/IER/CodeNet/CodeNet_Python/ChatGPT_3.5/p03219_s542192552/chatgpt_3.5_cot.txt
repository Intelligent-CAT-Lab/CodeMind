<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs, X and Y, and assigns them to the variables X and Y, respectively.
Then it calculates the expression X + Y/2 and prints the integer value of the result.
In this case, X is 81 and Y is 58.
So the expression evaluates to 81 + 58/2 = 81 + 29 = 110.
The integer value of 110 is 110.
<<<Output>>>
110
