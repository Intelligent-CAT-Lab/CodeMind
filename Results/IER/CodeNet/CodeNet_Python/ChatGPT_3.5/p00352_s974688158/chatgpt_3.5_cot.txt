<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input and assigns them to variables a and b.
It then calculates the average of a and b by adding them together and dividing by 2, and assigns the result to variable c.
Finally, it prints the value of c.
In this case, the input is "1000 3000", so a is 1000 and b is 3000.
The average of 1000 and 3000 is (1000 + 3000) / 2 = 2000.
Therefore, the output of the code execution would be 2000.
