<<<Analysis>>>
The variable L, variable R and variable d are initialized to 5, 10 and 2, respectively.
variable cnt is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the numbers that are divisible by d.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from L to R (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 5 to 10.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is divisible by d (i % d == 0). If it is, it increments cnt by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of cnt, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>
