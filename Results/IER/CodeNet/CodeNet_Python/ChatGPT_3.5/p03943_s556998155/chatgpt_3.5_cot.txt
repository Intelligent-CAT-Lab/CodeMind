<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes input as a list of integers and assigns it to the variable candy.
Then it sorts the list in ascending order.
Next, it checks if the sum of the first two elements of the sorted list is equal to the third element.
If the condition is true, it prints 'Yes', otherwise it prints 'No'.
In this case, the sorted list is [10, 20, 30]. The sum of the first two elements (10 + 20) is not equal to the third element (30), so the output will be 'No'.
<<<Output>>>
No
