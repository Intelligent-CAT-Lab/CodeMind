<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input and assigns it to the variable n.
It then calculates the value of x by multiplying n by 800.
Next, it calculates the value of y by integer dividing n by 15 and then multiplying it by 200.
Finally, it subtracts the value of y from the value of x and prints the result.
In this case, since the input is 20, the value of x would be 20 * 800 = 16000.
The value of y would be 20 // 15 * 200 = 200.
Therefore, the output would be 16000 - 200 = 15800.
<<<Output>>>
15800
