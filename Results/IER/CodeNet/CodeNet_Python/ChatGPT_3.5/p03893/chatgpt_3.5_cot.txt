<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes two lists, g and h, with None values. It then assigns the values 3 and 6 to h[1] and g[1], respectively.
The code then takes an input value X.
Next, it enters a loop that iterates from 2 to X (inclusive). For each iteration, it calculates the value of h[i] by adding 1 to g[i-1]. It then calculates the value of g[i] by multiplying h[i] by 2.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the value of g[X].
In this case, X is 2. So, the code calculates h[2] = g[1] + 1 = 6 + 1 = 7 and g[2] = 2 * h[2] = 2 * 7 = 14.
Therefore, the output of the code execution would be 14.
