<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four integers as input: a, b, c, and d.
It initializes a variable mod to 998244353.
It creates a 2D list dp with dimensions (c+2) x (d+2), filled with zeros.
It sets dp[a][b] to 1.
Then, it enters a nested loop that iterates over the range (a, c+1) for i and (b, d+1) for j.
Inside the loop, it performs the following operations:
- Modulo operation on dp[i][j].
- Updates dp[i+1][j] by adding dp[i][j] multiplied by j.
- Updates dp[i][j+1] by adding dp[i][j] multiplied by i.
- Updates dp[i+1][j+1] by subtracting dp[i][j] multiplied by i and j.
Finally, it prints the value of dp[c][d].
