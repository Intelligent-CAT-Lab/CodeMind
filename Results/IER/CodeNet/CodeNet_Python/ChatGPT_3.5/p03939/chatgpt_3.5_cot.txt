<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads three integers N, d, and x from the input. These values are initialized to 1, 3, and 3, respectively.
The code then defines a function called main that takes three parameters: N, d, and x.
Inside the main function, there is a while loop that continues until N becomes 0.
In each iteration of the loop, the code performs the following operations:
1. It adds d + (N-0.5) * x to the variable ret.
2. It updates the value of d by adding (d/N) + (5*x)/(2*N).
3. It updates the value of x by adding 2*x/N.
4. It decreases the value of N by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code returns the value of ret.
Finally, the code prints the result of calling the main function with the input values N, d, and x.
