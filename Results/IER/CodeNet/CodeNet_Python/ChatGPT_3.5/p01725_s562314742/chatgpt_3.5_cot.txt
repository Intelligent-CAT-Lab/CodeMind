<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string S, which is "3-2*3" in this case.
It then replaces the characters '(', ')', '+', '-', and '*' with spaces around them, so that the string becomes "3 - 2 * 3".
The string is then split into a list of tokens, which are ['3', '-', '2', '*', '3'].
The code defines a function parse, which takes two arguments: pri and cur. pri is a dictionary that maps operators to their priority levels, and cur is a variable that keeps track of the current position in the list of tokens.
Inside the parse function, there are two nested functions: number and expr.
The number function checks if the current token is a digit. If it is, it converts it to an integer and returns the value. Otherwise, it calls the expr function recursively to evaluate the expression inside the parentheses.
The expr function takes a level argument, which represents the priority level of the current operation. It first calls the number function to get the value of the current token. Then, it enters a while loop that continues as long as there are more tokens and the current token is an operator with the same priority level as the current level. Inside the loop, it gets the next operator and calls the expr function recursively to get the value of the next operand. It then performs the corresponding operation based on the operator and updates the value of this. Finally, it returns the final value of this.
The parse function returns the result of calling the expr function with level 0.
The code initializes a dictionary pri, which maps operators to their priority levels. It also initializes a variable ans to negative infinity.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over all possible combinations of priority levels for the operators '+', '-', and '*'. For each combination, it updates the pri dictionary and calls the parse function with pri and 0 as arguments. It then updates the value of ans with the maximum of the current value of ans and the result of the parse function.
Finally, the code prints the value of ans, which is the maximum possible result of evaluating the expression.
