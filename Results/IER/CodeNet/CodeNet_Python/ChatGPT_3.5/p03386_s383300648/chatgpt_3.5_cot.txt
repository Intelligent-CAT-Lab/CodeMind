<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three inputs A, B, and K.
It then checks if A+K-1 is greater than or equal to B-K+1. In this case, A+K-1 is 4 and B-K+1 is 7, so the condition is not met.
Therefore, the code enters the else block and executes the following steps:
- It prints the numbers from A to A+K-1, which are 3 and 4.
- It then prints the numbers from B-K+1 to B, which are 7 and 8.
So, the output of the code execution would be:
3
4
7
8
<<<Output>>>
3
4
7
8
