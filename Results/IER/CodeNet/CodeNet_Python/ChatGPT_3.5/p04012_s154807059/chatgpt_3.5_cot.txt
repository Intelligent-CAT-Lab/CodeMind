<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called "solve" which takes no arguments.
Inside the function, it imports the "sys" and "collections" modules.
It then uses the "input" function from the "sys" module to read a line of input and removes the newline character at the end.
The input is converted to a list of characters and then passed to the "Counter" function from the "collections" module.
The "Counter" function counts the occurrences of each character in the list and returns a dictionary-like object where the keys are the characters and the values are the counts.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the key-value pairs in the dictionary.
For each pair, it checks if the value (count) is odd (not divisible by 2).
If it is, the code prints "No" and exits the program.
If the loop finishes without printing "No", it means that all counts are even and the code prints "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
