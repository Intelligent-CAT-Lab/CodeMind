The variable K is initialized to 0.
The variable N is initialized to 50.
The variable div is calculated by dividing K by N, which in this case is 0.
The variable mod is calculated by taking the remainder of K divided by N, which in this case is also 0.
The variable A is initialized as a list comprehension that iterates over the range of N (from 0 to 49) and adds div - mod to each element. Since div and mod are both 0, each element of A remains the same.
The code then enters a loop that iterates mod times (0 times in this case). In each iteration, it adds N + 1 to the first mod elements of A. Since mod is 0, this loop does not execute.
Finally, the code prints the value of N, which is 50, and then prints the elements of A separated by a space.
Since A remains the same and N is printed as 50, the output will be:
50
0 1 2 3 ... 49
