<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three inputs: n, a, and b. These inputs are then used in the modcomb function and other calculations.
The modcomb function calculates the combination of n choose a, using the modulo operation mod. It uses a loop to iterate from 0 to a-1 and calculates the product of (n-i) and the modular inverse of (i+1) modulo mod. The result is then multiplied by cnt and updated in each iteration.
The code then calculates X as 2^n modulo MOD, which is 15 in this case.
Next, it calculates A as the combination of n choose a modulo MOD, using the modcomb function.
Similarly, it calculates B as the combination of n choose b modulo MOD, using the modcomb function.
Finally, it calculates ans as (X-A-B) modulo MOD and prints the result, which is 9 in this case.
<<<Output>>>
9
