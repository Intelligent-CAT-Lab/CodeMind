<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input and assigns it to the variable x.
It initializes the variable n to 1.
The code then enters a while loop that continues until the condition 360 * n % x != 0 is False.
Inside the loop, it increments the value of n by 1.
Once the condition becomes False, the code calculates the value of n * 360 // x and prints it.
In this case, the value of x is 90.
The loop will iterate until n * 360 % 90 is equal to 0.
Since 360 is divisible by 90, the condition will be False when n is 4.
Therefore, the code will print the value of 4 * 360 // 90, which is 16.
<<<Output>>>
16
