<<<Analysis>>>
The variable mod is initialized to 10^9 + 7.
The function mul(a, b) is defined, which takes two arguments a and b and returns the product of a and b modulo mod.
The variables H, W, and K are initialized by mapping the input to integers.
The variable ans is initialized to 0.
The variable const is initialized to 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from H+W-1 to H+W-K (inclusive), and for each iteration, it multiplies const by the current value of i modulo mod.
The variable inv is calculated using the pow function, which calculates the modular inverse of H+W-1 modulo mod.
The variable temp1 is calculated by multiplying H+W by the product of (K*(K+1)//2) modulo mod and const.
The variable const is multiplied by inv modulo mod.
The variable u is calculated as (K*(K^2-1))//6 modulo mod.
The variable temp2 is calculated by multiplying 2*H*W by the product of u and const modulo mod.
The variable ans is updated by adding temp1 and temp2 modulo mod.
The variable const is multiplied by (H+W-1) modulo mod.
The variable ans is updated by adding the product of K, (H+W), and const modulo mod.
Finally, the value of ans is printed.
