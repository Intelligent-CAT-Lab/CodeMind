<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input: n, m, and k.
It initializes a variable ans to "No".
Then it enters a nested loop. The outer loop iterates from 0 to n//2 (inclusive), and the inner loop iterates from 0 to m-1 (inclusive).
Inside the loop, it calculates two values: o and x.
o is calculated as i*j + (m-j)*(n-i), and x is calculated as n*m - o.
If either o or x is equal to k, it updates the value of ans to "Yes".
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of ans, which will be either "No" or "Yes" depending on whether there is a combination of i and j that satisfies the condition.
In this case, the loop will iterate only once, with i=0 and j=0. The values of o and x will both be 0, and since neither o nor x is equal to k, the value of ans remains "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
