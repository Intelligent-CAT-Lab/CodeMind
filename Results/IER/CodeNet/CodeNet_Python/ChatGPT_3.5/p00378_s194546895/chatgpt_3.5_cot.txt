<<<Analysis>>>
The variable a, variable b and variable x are initialized to 180, 100 and 2400, respectively.
variable c is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the cost.
The code then enters a while loop that continues until x becomes 0.
Inside the loop, it checks if x is greater than 500. If it is, it adds the cost of a or 2*b to c, depending on which one is smaller. Then it subtracts 1000 from x.
If x is not greater than 500, it adds the cost of b or a to c, depending on which one is smaller. Then it subtracts 500 from x.
The loop continues until x becomes 0.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of c, which is 900.
<<<Output>>>
900
