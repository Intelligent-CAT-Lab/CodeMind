The variable MOD is initialized to 10^9 + 7.
The variable n is initialized to the input value, which is 3 in this case.
The variable dp is initialized as a 2D list with dimensions 61x3, filled with 0s.
The code then sets dp[60][0] to 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 59 to 0 (inclusive) in reverse order.
Inside the loop, the code checks if the i-th bit of n is 1. If it is, it performs certain operations on dp[i] based on the values of dp[i+1].
If the i-th bit of n is 0, it performs different operations on dp[i] based on the values of dp[i+1].
After the loop finishes, the code takes the sum of all elements in dp[0] and takes the modulo MOD.
Finally, the code prints the result.
