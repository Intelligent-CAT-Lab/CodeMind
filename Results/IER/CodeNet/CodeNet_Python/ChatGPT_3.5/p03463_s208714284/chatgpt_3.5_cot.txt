<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three inputs N, A, and B and assigns them to the variables N, A, and B respectively.
The code then checks if the difference between B and A is divisible by 2. If it is, it prints 'Alice', otherwise it prints 'Borys'.
In this case, the difference between B and A is 2-4 = -2, which is not divisible by 2.
Therefore, the code will print 'Borys'.
<<<Output>>>
Borys
