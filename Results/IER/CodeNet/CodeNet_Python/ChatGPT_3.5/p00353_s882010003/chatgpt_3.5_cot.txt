<<<Analysis>>>
The variable m, variable f and variable b are initialized to 1000, 3000 and 3000, respectively.
The code then checks if b is less than or equal to m. If it is, it prints 0.
In this case, b is equal to m, so the condition is not met.
The code then checks if b is less than or equal to the sum of m and f. If it is, it prints the difference between b and m.
In this case, b is equal to the sum of m and f, so the condition is met and it prints 3000 - 1000 = 2000.
Since none of the previous conditions were met, the code prints "NA".
<<<Output>>>
2000
