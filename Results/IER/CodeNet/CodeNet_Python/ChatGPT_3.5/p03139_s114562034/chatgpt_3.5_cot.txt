<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three inputs: n, a, and b. These inputs are then assigned to the variables n, a, and b, respectively.
The code then calculates the minimum value between a and b and assigns it to the variable ma.
Next, it calculates the value of mi by subtracting n from the sum of a and b. If the result is negative, it is set to 0.
Finally, the code prints the values of ma and mi.
In this case, n = 10, a = 3, and b = 5. The minimum value between a and b is 3. The sum of a and b is 8, and subtracting n from it gives -2. Since this is negative, mi is set to 0.
Therefore, the output of the code would be "3 0".
<<<Output>>>
3 0
