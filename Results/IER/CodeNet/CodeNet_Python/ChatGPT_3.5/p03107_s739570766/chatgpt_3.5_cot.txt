<<<Analysis>>>
The code imports the `stdin` function from the `sys` module.
It then reads a line of input from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `S`.
The code then counts the number of occurrences of the characters '0' and '1' in the string `S` using the `count()` method.
It takes the minimum of these two counts and multiplies it by 2.
Finally, it prints the result.
In this case, the input is '0011', so the count of '0' is 2 and the count of '1' is 2.
The minimum of these two counts is 2, so the output will be 2*2 = 4.
