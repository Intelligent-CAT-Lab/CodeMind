<<<Analysis>>>
The variable A and variable B are initialized to 2 and 2, respectively.
The variable f is initialized to False, which will be used to check if a valid number is found.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will store the valid number if found.
The variable n is calculated as A * 100 // 8, which is 25 in this case.
The variable m is calculated as (A + 1) * 100 // 8, which is 37 in this case.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from n to m (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 25 to 37.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i * 8 // 100 is equal to A and i // 10 is equal to B.
If the condition is met, it sets f to True, assigns the current number i to ans, and breaks out of the loop.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans if f is True, otherwise it prints -1.
In this case, the condition is not met, so the code prints -1.
<<<Output>>>
-1
