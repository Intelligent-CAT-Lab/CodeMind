<<<Analysis>>>
The code imports the numpy library as np.
The input is taken as a string and split into a list of strings using the split() function.
The map() function is used to convert each string element in the list to an integer.
The sorted() function is used to sort the list of integers in ascending order.
The sorted list is then converted into a numpy array using the np.array() function and assigned to the variable A.
The expression (A[1:] - A[:-1]) calculates the difference between each element in A and the previous element.
The sum() function is used to calculate the sum of all the differences.
The result of the sum is printed as the output.
In this case, the input [1, 6, 3] will be sorted to [1, 3, 6].
The differences between each element and the previous element are [2, 3].
The sum of these differences is 5.
