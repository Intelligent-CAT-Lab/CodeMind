<<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the math module, which provides mathematical functions and constants.
Then it reads four float values from the input and assigns them to the variables x1, y1, x2, and y2.
The code then calculates the distance between the points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) using the math.hypot() function, which returns the Euclidean distance between two points in a plane.
Finally, the code prints the calculated distance.
In this case, the distance between (0, 0) and (1, 1) is sqrt(2), which is approximately 1.4142135623730951.
<<<Output>>>
1.4142135623730951
