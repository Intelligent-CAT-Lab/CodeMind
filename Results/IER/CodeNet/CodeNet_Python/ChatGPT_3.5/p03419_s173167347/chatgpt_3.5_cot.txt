<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers n and m as input.
It then checks if both n and m are equal to 1. If they are, it prints 1.
If n is equal to 1 or m is equal to 1, it prints the maximum of n and m minus 2.
Otherwise, it prints the product of n-2 and m-2.
In this case, n and m are both equal to 2, so the condition n == m == 1 is not met.
The code then checks if n is equal to 1 or m is equal to 1, which is not the case.
Finally, it prints the product of n-2 and m-2, which is 0.
<<<Output>>>
