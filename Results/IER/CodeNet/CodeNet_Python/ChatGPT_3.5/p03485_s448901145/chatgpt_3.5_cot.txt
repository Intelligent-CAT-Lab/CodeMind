<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input and assigns them to variables a and b.
It then calculates the average of a and b by adding them together and dividing by 2.
The math.ceil() function is used to round up the result to the nearest integer.
Finally, the code prints the rounded up average.
In this case, the average of 1 and 3 is 2, so the rounded up value is also 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
