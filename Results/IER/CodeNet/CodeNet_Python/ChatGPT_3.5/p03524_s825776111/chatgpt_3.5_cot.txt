<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string S and counts the occurrences of the characters 'a', 'b', and 'c' in the string. The counts are stored in variables a, b, and c, respectively.
Then, the code checks if the difference between the maximum count and the minimum count is greater than or equal to 2. If it is, it prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES".
In this case, the counts are: a=2, b=1, c=1. The maximum count is 2 and the minimum count is 1. The difference is 1, which is less than 2. Therefore, the code will print "YES".
<<<Output>>>
YES
