<<<Analysis>>>
The code first reads a string input and stores it in the variable w. In this case, the input is "aab".
The length of the string is stored in the variable n, which is 3 in this case.
The variable t is initialized to -1.
The code then defines a function Z(s) which calculates the Z-function of a string s. The Z-function is used to find all occurrences of a pattern within a string.
Next, the code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n//2+1. In this case, it will iterate from 1 to 2.
For each iteration, it checks if n is divisible by j and if the first n-j characters of w are equal to the last j characters of w. If both conditions are met, it sets t to j and breaks out of the loop.
Since the first iteration satisfies the conditions (n is divisible by 1 and "aa" is equal to "ab"), t is set to 1 and the loop breaks.
The code then checks the value of t. If t is -1, it prints "1\n1". If t is 1, it prints the value of n and "1". Otherwise, it proceeds to the next steps.
The code calls the Z-function on w and stores the result in the variable zl.
It then reverses the string w and calls the Z-function on the reversed string, storing the result in the variable zr.
The code initializes the variable cnt to 0.
It then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n-2. In this case, it will iterate from 0 to 1.
For each iteration, it checks if zl[i] and zr[n-2-i] are both true. If they are, it increments cnt by 1.
After the loop finishes, it prints "2" and the value of cnt.
