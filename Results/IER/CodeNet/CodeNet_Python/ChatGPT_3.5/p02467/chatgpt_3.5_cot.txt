<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function `solve()` that takes an integer `n` as input. It then calls the `prime_factorization()` function to find the prime factorization of `n` and prints the result.

The `prime_factorization()` function takes an integer `n` as input. It first checks if `n` is less than 2. If it is, it returns a list containing `n` itself. This is the base case for the recursive function.

If `n` is greater than or equal to 2, the function initializes an empty list `res` to store the prime factors. It also calculates the square root of `n` and assigns it to the variable `lim`.

The function then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to `lim + 1`. For each number `p` in this range, it checks if `n` is divisible by `p`. If it is, it appends `p` to the `res` list and updates `n` by dividing it by `p`. This process is repeated until `n` is no longer divisible by `p`.

After the loop finishes, the function checks if `n` is greater than 1. If it is, it means that `n` itself is a prime factor and it appends `n` to the `res` list.

Finally, the function returns the `res` list.

In the main part of the code, it first reads an integer `n` from the input. It then calls the `solve()` function, passing `n` as an argument.

The `solve()` function prints the value of `n` followed by a colon and a space. It then calls the `prime_factorization()` function to find the prime factorization of `n` and prints the result using the `*` operator to unpack the list.
