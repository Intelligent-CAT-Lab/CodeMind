<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes 6 integer inputs: a, b, c, d, e, and f.
It initializes two variables: maxsugar to 0 and maxwater to 100*a.
Then it enters a nested loop that iterates through three variables: i, j, and k.
The range of i is from 0 to 30 (inclusive), the range of j is from 0 to 30 (inclusive), and the range of k is from 0 to 3000 (inclusive).
Inside the nested loop, it calculates the values of water and sugar based on the current values of i, j, and k.
It then checks two conditions:
1. If the sum of water and sugar is greater than f, it continues to the next iteration of the loop.
2. If the sugar is greater than (a*i + b*j)*e - c*k, it continues to the next iteration of the loop.
If both conditions are not met, it calculates the additional amount of sugar that can be added based on the remaining capacity of the container and the ratio of sugar to water.
If the current combination of water and sugar has a higher sugar concentration than the previous maximum combination, it updates the values of maxsugar and maxwater.
After the nested loop finishes, it prints the sum of maxsugar and maxwater, followed by the value of maxsugar.
