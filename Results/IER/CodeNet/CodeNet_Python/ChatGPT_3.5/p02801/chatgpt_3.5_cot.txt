<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input character C.
It initializes an empty list al.
Then it enters a loop that iterates over the range of ASCII values from 97 to 123 (inclusive), which corresponds to lowercase alphabets 'a' to 'z'.
Inside the loop, it appends each character to the list al.
After the loop, it finds the index of the input character C in the list al and stores it in the variable idx.
Finally, it prints the character at the index idx+1 in the list al.
In this case, the input character is 'a', which has an ASCII value of 97.
The loop will append all lowercase alphabets to the list al.
The index of 'a' in the list al will be 0.
Therefore, the code will print the character at index 0+1, which is 'b'.
<<<Output>>>
b
