<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string and assigns it to the variable S.
It then checks if S is equal to 'Sunny'. If it is, it prints 'Cloudy'.
If S is not equal to 'Sunny', it checks if S is equal to 'Cloudy'. If it is, it prints 'Rainy'.
If neither of the previous conditions are met, it prints 'Sunny'.
In this case, the input is 'Sunny', so the first condition is met and the code prints 'Cloudy'.
<<<Output>>>
Cloudy
