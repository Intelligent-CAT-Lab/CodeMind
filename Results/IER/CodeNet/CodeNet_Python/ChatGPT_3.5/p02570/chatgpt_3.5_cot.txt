<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes input in the form of three integers: data[0], data[1], and data[2].
It then checks if the division of data[0] by data[1] is less than or equal to data[2].
If the condition is true, it prints 'Yes', otherwise it prints 'No'.
In this case, the division of 1000 by 15 is approximately 66.67, which is greater than 80.
Therefore, the condition is false and the code will print 'No'.
<<<Output>>>
No
