The variable mod is initialized to 10^9+7.
The variable n is initialized to the input value, which is 3 in this case.
The function nth_bit(d) takes an input d and returns the d-th bit of n.
The variable dp is initialized as a 2D list of size 61x3, with all elements set to 0.
The first element of the last row of dp is set to 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 59 to 0 (inclusive), with a step of -1. This loop represents the position of the bits in n.
Inside this loop, there is another loop that iterates over the possible values of s, which can be 0, 1, or 2.
Inside this loop, there is another loop that iterates over the possible values of k, which can also be 0, 1, or 2.
Inside this loop, the code calculates the new value of s2, which is the minimum of 2, 2*s + nth_bit(d) - k. This represents the new state of the dp array.
If s2 is greater than or equal to 0, the code adds the value of dp[d+1][s] to dp[d][s2].
After the loops finish, the code calculates the sum of all elements in the first row of dp, takes the modulo mod, and assigns it to the variable ans.
Finally, the code prints the value of ans.
