<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs, N and K, and assigns them to the variables N and K respectively.
Then it calculates the value of N minus (K-1) and prints the result.
In this case, N is 3 and K is 2, so the calculation is 3 - (2-1) = 2.
Therefore, the output of the code execution would be 2.
