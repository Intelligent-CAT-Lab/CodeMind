<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input and assigns them to variables a and b.
Then, it initializes a variable cnt to 0.
Next, it defines a function cmb(n, r) which calculates the combination of n and r using recursion and memoization.
The code then checks if a is greater than 1. If it is, it calculates the combination of a taken 2 at a time and adds it to cnt.
Similarly, it checks if b is greater than 1. If it is, it calculates the combination of b taken 2 at a time and adds it to cnt.
Finally, it prints the value of cnt.
In this case, a = 2 and b = 1. Since both a and b are greater than 1, the code calculates cmb(2, 2) and cmb(1, 2), which are both 1. Therefore, the value of cnt is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
