<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a, b, c, and d are initialized to 9, 8, 1000, and 999 respectively.
The code then defines three functions: A_win(), B_win(), and Draw(), which print "Alice", "Bob", and "Draw" respectively.
Next, the code checks if either c or d is equal to -1. In this case, neither c nor d is -1, so the code skips this block.
The code then checks if c is greater than d. In this case, c is not greater than d, so the code skips this block as well.
Next, the code checks if c is less than d. In this case, c is not less than d, so the code skips this block too.
Finally, the code checks if c is equal to d. In this case, c is not equal to d, so the code skips this block as well.
Since none of the conditions are met, the code does not print anything.
