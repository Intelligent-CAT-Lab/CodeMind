<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input and assigns it to the variable x.
It initializes the variable t to 0.
Then it enters a while loop that continues as long as the condition t*(t+1)/2 < x is true.
Inside the loop, it increments the value of t by 1.
The loop continues until the condition is no longer true, which means t*(t+1)/2 is greater than or equal to x.
Finally, it prints the value of t.
In this case, the loop will run for t = 1, 2, 3, and 4, and it will stop when t = 4 because 4*(4+1)/2 = 10, which is not less than 6.
Therefore, the output will be 4.
