<<<Analysis>>>
The variable a, variable n and variable m are initialized to 16, 2 and 1000, respectively.
variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the count of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from a to the square root of m (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 16 to 31.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the power of i to the n-th power and stores it in x.
The code checks if x is within the range [1, m]. If it is not, it continues to the next iteration of the loop.
The code then calculates the difference between i and a and stores it in y.
Next, it converts x to a string, splits it into individual digits, converts each digit back to an integer, and calculates the sum of these digits.
If the sum of the digits is equal to y, it increments the count ans by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is the count of numbers meeting the condition.
