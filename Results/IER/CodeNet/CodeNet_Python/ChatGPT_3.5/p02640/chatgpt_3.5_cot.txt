<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers x and y as input.
It initializes a variable count to 0, which will be used to check if a solution is found.
Then it enters a loop that iterates from 0 to x (inclusive), assigning the current value to variable a.
Inside the loop, it calculates the value of b by subtracting a from x.
It checks if the equation 2*a + 4*b is equal to y. If it is, it sets count to 1 and breaks out of the loop.
If the equation is not satisfied, it does nothing and continues to the next iteration of the loop.
After the loop finishes, it prints "Yes" if count is 1, indicating that a solution was found, otherwise it prints "No".
In this case, x is 3 and y is 8. The loop will iterate for a = 0, 1, 2, 3. For a = 2, the equation is satisfied (2*2 + 4*1 = 8), so count is set to 1 and the loop breaks.
Therefore, the output will be "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
