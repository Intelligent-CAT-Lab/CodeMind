<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers n and m as input.
It calculates the value of submit using the formula m*1900+(n-m)*100.
Then it calculates the final output by multiplying submit with 2 raised to the power of m.
In this case, n=1 and m=1.
So, submit = 1*1900 + (1-1)*100 = 1900.
The final output is 1900 * 2^1 = 3800.
<<<Output>>>
3800
