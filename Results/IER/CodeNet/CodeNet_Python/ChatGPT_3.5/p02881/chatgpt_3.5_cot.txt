<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by importing the math module, which provides mathematical functions and constants.
Then, it reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable n.
Next, there is a function definition for ij(x), which takes an argument x.
Inside the function, there is a loop that iterates from x to 0 (exclusive) with a step of -1.
For each value of i in this range, it checks if n divided by i is equal to the floor division of n by i.
If this condition is true, it returns the values of i and n//i as a tuple.
After the function definition, the code calls the sqrt() function from the math module to calculate the square root of n.
The result is then converted to an integer using the int() function and passed as an argument to the ij() function.
The return value of ij() is a tuple of two values, which are then passed as arguments to the sum() function.
Finally, the code subtracts 2 from the sum and prints the result.
