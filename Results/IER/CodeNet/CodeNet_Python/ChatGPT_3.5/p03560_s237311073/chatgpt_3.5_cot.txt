<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called calc that takes an integer k as input.
Inside the function, it initializes a dictionary d with the key 1 and value 1.
It also initializes a deque q with a list containing the values [1, 1].
The code then enters a while loop that continues as long as q is not empty.
In each iteration of the loop, it pops the leftmost element from q and assigns it to the variables n and c.
It calculates the remainder of (n * 10) divided by k and assigns it to the variable a.
If a is not already a key in the dictionary d or if the value c is smaller than the current value associated with a in d, it updates the value of d[a] to c and appends [a, c] to the left of q.
It then calculates the remainder of (n + 1) divided by k and assigns it to the variable b.
If b is not already a key in the dictionary d or if the value c + 1 is smaller than the current value associated with b in d, it updates the value of d[b] to c + 1 and appends [b, c + 1] to the right of q.
The loop continues until q is empty.
Finally, the function returns the value associated with the key 0 in the dictionary d.
Outside the function, the code calls the calc function with the input value converted to an integer using int(input()).
The result is then printed.
