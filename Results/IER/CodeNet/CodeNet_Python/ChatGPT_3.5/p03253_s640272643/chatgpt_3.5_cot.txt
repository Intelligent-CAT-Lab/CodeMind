<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers n and m as input.
It initializes the variable mod to 10^9 + 7.
Then it defines two functions: combination and get_prime_dic.
The combination function calculates the combination of n choose r using a loop.
The get_prime_dic function calculates the prime factorization of a number n and returns a dictionary with the prime factors as keys and their respective powers as values.
The code then calls the get_prime_dic function with the input value m and stores the result in the variable d.
It initializes the variable ans to 1.
Then it enters a loop that iterates over the items in the dictionary d.
For each item, it calculates the combination of n-1+j choose j and multiplies it with the current value of ans.
It takes the modulus of the result with mod to avoid overflow.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of ans.
