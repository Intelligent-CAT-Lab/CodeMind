<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string and initializes two variables, a_index and z_index, to 0.
It then enters a loop that iterates over the indices of the string.
Inside the loop, it checks if the current character is 'A'. If it is, it assigns the current index to a_index and breaks out of the loop.
After the loop, it enters another loop that iterates over the indices of the string in reverse order.
Inside this loop, it checks if the current character is 'Z'. If it is, it assigns the current index to z_index and breaks out of the loop.
Finally, it prints the difference between z_index and a_index, plus 1.

In the given input string "QWERTYASDFZXCV", the first occurrence of 'A' is at index 6 and the last occurrence of 'Z' is at index 11.
Therefore, the output of the code would be 11 - 6 + 1 = 6.
