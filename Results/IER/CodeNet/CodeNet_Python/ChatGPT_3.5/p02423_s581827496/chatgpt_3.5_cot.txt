<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input and assigns it to the variable x.
The code then prints the binary representation of x with leading zeros to make it 32 bits long.
Next, it prints the binary representation of x with the digits '0' and '1' swapped.
Then, it left shifts x by 1 bit and prints its binary representation, taking only the last 32 bits.
Finally, it right shifts x by 1 bit and prints its binary representation, taking only the last 32 bits.
