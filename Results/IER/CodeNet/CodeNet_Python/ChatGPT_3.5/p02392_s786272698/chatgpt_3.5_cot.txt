<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings using the split() function.
Then, it converts each element of the list to an integer and assigns them to variables a, b, and c.
The code then checks if a is less than b and b is less than c. If this condition is true, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
In this case, a=1, b=3, and c=8. The condition a<b<c is not satisfied, so the code will print "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
