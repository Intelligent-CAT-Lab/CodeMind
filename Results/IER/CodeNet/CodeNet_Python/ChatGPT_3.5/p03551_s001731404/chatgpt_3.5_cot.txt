<<<Analysis>>>
The code first reads two integers n and m from the input, which are 1 and 1 in this case.
Then it calculates the value of the expression 2**m*(100*n+1800*m).
2**m means 2 raised to the power of m, which is 2**1 = 2.
100*n means 100 multiplied by n, which is 100*1 = 100.
1800*m means 1800 multiplied by m, which is 1800*1 = 1800.
So the expression becomes 2* (100 + 1800) = 2*1900 = 3800.
Finally, the code prints the value of the expression, which is 3800.
<<<Output>>>
3800
