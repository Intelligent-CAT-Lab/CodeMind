<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string and converts it into a list of characters.
It then checks if the first three characters in the list are all the same.
If they are, it prints "No". Otherwise, it prints "Yes".
In this case, the first three characters are "ABA", which are not all the same.
Therefore, the code will print "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
