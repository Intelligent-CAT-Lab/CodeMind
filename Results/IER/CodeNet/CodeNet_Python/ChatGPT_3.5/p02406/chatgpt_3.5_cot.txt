<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 30.
An empty list A is created.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 30.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is divisible by 3 or if the digit 3 is present in the number. If either condition is true, it appends the number i to the list A.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the elements of list A separated by a space.
<<<Output>>>
3 6 9 12 13 15 18 21 23 24 27 30
