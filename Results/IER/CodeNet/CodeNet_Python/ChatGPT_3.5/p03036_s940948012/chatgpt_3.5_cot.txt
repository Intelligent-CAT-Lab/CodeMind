<<<Analysis>>>
The variable r, variable d and variable x are initialized to 2, 10 and 20, respectively.
The code then enters a loop that iterates 10 times.
In each iteration, it updates the value of x using the formula r*x - d.
The updated value of x is then printed.
The loop continues for 10 iterations, updating and printing the value of x each time.
