<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers m and n as input.
It then calculates the value of m raised to the power of n, modulo 10^9 + 7.
The pow() function is used to perform this calculation.
Finally, the code prints the result of the calculation.
In this case, m is 2 and n is 3.
So, the code calculates 2^3 % (10^9 + 7), which is 8 % (10^9 + 7).
The modulo operation ensures that the result is within the range of 0 to (10^9 + 7) - 1.
<<<Output>>>
8
