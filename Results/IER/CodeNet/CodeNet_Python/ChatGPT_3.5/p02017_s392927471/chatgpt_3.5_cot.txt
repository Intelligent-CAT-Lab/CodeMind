<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four inputs: H, W, x, and y. These inputs are mapped to the variables H, W, x, and y respectively.
The code then checks two conditions:
1. If the product of H and W is odd (i.e., (H*W)%2==1) and the sum of x and y is odd (i.e., (x+y)%2==1), it prints "No".
2. Otherwise, it prints "Yes".

In this case, the input values are H=3, W=5, x=1, and y=4.
The product of H and W is 15, which is odd.
The sum of x and y is 5, which is odd.
Therefore, both conditions are true, and the code will print "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
