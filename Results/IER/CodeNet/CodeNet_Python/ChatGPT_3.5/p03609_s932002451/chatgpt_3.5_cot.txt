<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, x and t, and assigns them to the variables x and t, respectively.
Then it checks if x is greater than t. If it is, it subtracts t from x and prints the result. Otherwise, it prints 0.
In this case, 100 is greater than 17, so the code subtracts 17 from 100 and prints the result, which is 83.
<<<Output>>>
83
