<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string and defines a function called solve that takes a string as an argument.
Inside the solve function, it calculates the length of the input string and stores it in the variable n.
Then it enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider indices from 1 to n-2.
For each index i in this range, it checks if the character at index i-1 is equal to the character at index i.
If they are equal, it prints the indices i and i+1 and returns from the function.
If the loop finishes without finding any equal adjacent characters, it enters another loop that iterates from 2 to n-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider indices from 2 to n-2.
For each index i in this range, it checks if the character at index i-2 is equal to the character at index i.
If they are equal, it prints the indices i-1 and i+1 and returns from the function.
If the second loop also finishes without finding any equal adjacent characters, it prints -1 -1.
Finally, it calls the solve function with the input string s.
<<<Output>>>
-1 -1
