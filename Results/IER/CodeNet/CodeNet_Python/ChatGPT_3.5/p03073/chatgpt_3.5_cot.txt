<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines several helper functions and initializes some variables.
It reads a string S from the input and calculates its length N.
The code then initializes two counters: zero_start_counter and one_start_counter.
It enters a loop that iterates over each character in the string S.
For each character, it checks if the current character is different from the previous character (zero_start != int(S[i])).
If it is different, it increments zero_start_counter by 1.
Then, it updates the value of zero_start to be the opposite of its current value (zero_start = (zero_start+1)%2).
This means that zero_start will alternate between 0 and 1 for each character in the string.
After the loop finishes, the code calculates one_start_counter by subtracting zero_start_counter from N.
Finally, it prints the minimum value between zero_start_counter and one_start_counter.
In this case, the string S is "000", so all the characters are the same.
Therefore, zero_start_counter will be 0 and one_start_counter will be equal to N.
The code then prints the minimum value between 0 and N, which is 0.
