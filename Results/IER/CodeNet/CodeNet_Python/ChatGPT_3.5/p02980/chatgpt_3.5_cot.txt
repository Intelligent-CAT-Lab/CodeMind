<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized to 1 and the variable M is initialized to 2.
The code then checks if N is greater than M. Since it is not, the code does nothing.
The code initializes three lists: fact, powm, and pown. Each list has M+1 elements, all initialized to 0.
The code then sets the first element of each list to 1.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to M+1. In each iteration, it calculates the factorial of i and stores it in fact[i]. It also calculates powm[i] and pown[i] using the formulas given.
The code defines a function pow(n, m) that calculates n^m modulo mod. It uses recursion to calculate the power.
The code initializes a list inv_fact with M+1 elements, all initialized to 0.
The code then calculates the inverse factorial of each element in inv_fact using the formula given.
The code defines a function C(n, r) that calculates the binomial coefficient C(n, r) using the factorial and inverse factorial lists.
The code initializes the variable ans to 0.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to N. In each iteration, it calculates the contribution of the current value of i to the final answer using the formulas given. It adds this contribution to ans.
Finally, the code prints the final value of ans.
