<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized to 105.
The code defines a function called divisor(n) that takes an integer n as input and returns the number of divisors of n.
The code then initializes a variable i to 1 and a variable answer to 0.
The code enters a loop that iterates while i is less than or equal to N.
Inside the loop, the code checks if the number of divisors of i is equal to 8. If it is, it increments the answer variable by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of answer, which represents the number of numbers between 1 and N (inclusive) that have exactly 8 divisors.
