<<<Analysis>>>
The code first defines two functions, rd() and rdi(), which are used to read input from the user.
Then, it reads two integers, K and N, from the input.
The code then checks if K is equal to 1. If it is, it prints "1" N/2 times and exits the program.
If K is not equal to 1, the code checks if K is even. If it is, it prints K/2 followed by K repeated N-1 times, and then exits the program.
If K is odd, the code initializes a list t with N elements, each element being K/2+1.
Then, it enters a loop that iterates N/2 times. In each iteration, it checks if the last element of t is equal to 1. If it is, it decrements the index j by 1. Otherwise, it subtracts 1 from the last element of t and sets all elements from index j+1 to N-1 to K. Then, it sets j back to N-1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the elements of t up to index j+1, separated by spaces.
