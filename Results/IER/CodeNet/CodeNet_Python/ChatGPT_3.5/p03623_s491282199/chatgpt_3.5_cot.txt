<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input and assigns them to variables a, b, and c.
It then checks if the absolute difference between a and b is less than the absolute difference between c and a.
If this condition is true, it prints 'A', otherwise it prints 'B'.
In this case, the absolute difference between a and b is 3, and the absolute difference between c and a is 2.
Since 3 is not less than 2, the condition is false and the code prints 'B'.
<<<Output>>>
B
