<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three inputs: d, t, and s. These inputs are converted to integers using the map function and split by spaces.
The code then checks if the value of d divided by t is less than or equal to s. If this condition is true, it prints 'Yes'. Otherwise, it prints 'No'.
In this case, the value of d/t is 1000/15 = 66.67, which is greater than 80. Therefore, the condition is false and the code will print 'No'.
<<<Output>>>
No
