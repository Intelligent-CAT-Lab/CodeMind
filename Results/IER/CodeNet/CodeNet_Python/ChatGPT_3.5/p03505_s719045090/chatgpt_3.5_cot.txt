<<<Analysis>>>
The variable K, variable A and variable B are initialized to 4000, 2000 and 500, respectively.
The code then checks if A is greater than or equal to K. If it is, it prints 1 and exits the program.
In this case, A is not greater than or equal to K, so the code continues.
The code calculates the difference between A and B and stores it in the variable p.
The code then checks if p is less than or equal to 0. If it is, it prints -1 and exits the program.
In this case, p is greater than 0, so the code continues.
The code initializes the variable ans to 1.
The code then calculates the number of times the difference between K and A can be divided by the difference between A and B, and adds 2 to the result.
The code multiplies this result by 2 and adds it to ans.
Finally, the code prints the value of ans, which is 9.
<<<Output>>>
9
