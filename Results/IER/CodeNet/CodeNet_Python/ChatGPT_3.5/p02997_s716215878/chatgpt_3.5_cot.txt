<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs N and K. N is the number of nodes in a graph and K is the number of edges that need to be added to the graph.
The code calculates the maximum number of edges that can be added to the graph, which is (N-1)*(N-2)/2. If this value is less than K, it means that it is not possible to add K edges to the graph and the code prints -1 and exits.
If it is possible to add K edges, the code creates a list called "edge" which initially contains all the edges connecting node 1 to the other nodes (1,n) where n ranges from 2 to N. Then it adds additional edges to the list using the itertools.combinations function. The number of additional edges to be added is x-K, where x is the maximum number of edges that can be added. The additional edges are created by taking combinations of nodes from 2 to N+1.
Finally, the code prints the length of the "edge" list, which is the total number of edges in the graph, and then prints each edge in a separate line.
