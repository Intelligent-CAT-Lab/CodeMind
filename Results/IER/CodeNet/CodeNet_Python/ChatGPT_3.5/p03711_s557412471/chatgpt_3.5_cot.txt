<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes three sets: a, b, and c. Set a contains the numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, and 12. Set b contains the numbers 4, 6, 9, and 11. Set c contains the number 2.
The code then takes two inputs, x and y, and checks if both x and y are in the same set. If they are, it prints 'Yes'. Otherwise, it prints 'No'.
In this case, x is 1 and y is 3. Both 1 and 3 are in set a, so the condition is true and the code prints 'Yes'.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
