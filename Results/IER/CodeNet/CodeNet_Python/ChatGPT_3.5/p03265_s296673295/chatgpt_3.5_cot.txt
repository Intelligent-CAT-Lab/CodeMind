<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes four integers as input: x1, y1, x2, y2. In this case, the input is 0 0 0 1.
Then, it creates two complex numbers a and b using the input values.
Next, it calculates the length between a and b using the abs() function and stores it in the variable length.
The code then performs some calculations using complex numbers and trigonometric functions to find two new complex numbers c and d.
Finally, it rounds the real and imaginary parts of c and d to integers and stores them in x3, y3, x4, and y4 respectively.
The code prints the values of x3, y3, x4, and y4, separated by spaces.
<<<Output>>>
0 1 0 -1
