<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four integers as input: a, b, c, and d.
It initializes a variable mod to 998244353.
It creates a 2D list dp with dimensions (c+1) x (d+1) and initializes all elements to 0.
It sets dp[a][b] to 1.
Then it enters a loop that iterates from a+1 to c (inclusive).
Inside this loop, it calculates dp[i][b] by multiplying dp[i-1][b] with b and taking the modulo mod.
Next, it enters another loop that iterates from a to c (inclusive) and from b+1 to d (inclusive).
Inside this loop, it calculates dp[i][j] by adding dp[i][j-1]*i, dp[i-1][j]*j, and dp[i-1][j-1]*(i-1)*(j-1), and then taking the modulo mod.
Finally, it prints the value of dp[c][d].
In this case, the output would be 2.
