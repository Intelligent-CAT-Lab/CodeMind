<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input N.
Then, it defines a function p_deg_le(pfac, n) which returns the count of prime numbers in pfac that have a degree greater than or equal to n.
Next, it initializes a list P with prime numbers up to 100.
The code then calculates the prime factorization of N! and stores it in the dictionary pfac, where the keys are prime numbers and the values are their degrees.
The pfac dictionary is then sorted in descending order based on the degrees of the prime numbers.
After that, the code calculates the factorial of N by multiplying each prime number to the power of its degree.
Next, it calculates the number of divisors of N! that have 75 divisors using the p_deg_le function.
Finally, it calculates the answer by adding the counts of different combinations of prime numbers and their degrees.
The answer is then printed.
