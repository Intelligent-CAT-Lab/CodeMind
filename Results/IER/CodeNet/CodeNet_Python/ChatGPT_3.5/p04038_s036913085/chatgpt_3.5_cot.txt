<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines several functions: pow_mod, fac, fac_gen, build_comb_list, solve_dp, and solve.
The main function is solve, which takes two arguments n and k.
If either n or k is equal to 1, the function returns 1.
Otherwise, it calculates the value of m, which is equal to n * k.
It generates a list of combinations using the fac_gen function, which yields the factorial of each number in the range (k-2, m-1).
Then, it calls the build_comb_list function to modify the list of combinations.
Finally, it calls the solve_dp function to solve the dynamic programming problem and returns the result.

The solve_dp function initializes a list dp with length n+1, where each element is set to 1.
It then iterates from 2 to n+1 and calculates the value of ci, which is equal to (i-1) * (k-1).
It initializes a variable v to 0.
For each j and c in the range(i) and the corresponding elements in the comb list, it calculates the value of v by adding dp[j] * c modulo MOD.
It updates dp[j] with the value of v.
Finally, it sets dp[i] to the value of v.
The function returns the last element of dp multiplied by the factorial of n modulo MOD.

The main code reads two integers n and k from input and calls the solve function with these values.
It then prints the result.
