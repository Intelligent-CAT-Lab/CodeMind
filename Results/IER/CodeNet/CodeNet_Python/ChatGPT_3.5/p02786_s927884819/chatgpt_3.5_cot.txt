The variable h is initialized to 2.
The variable l is initialized to 0.
The code enters a while loop that continues as long as h is greater than 0.
Inside the loop, the value of l is updated by multiplying it by 2 and adding 1.
Then, the value of h is divided by 2 using integer division.
This process continues until h becomes 0.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of l, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>
