<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input: a, b, and c.
It then defines a function called foo that takes three parameters: a, b, and c.
Inside the function, it initializes an empty set called seen to keep track of the numbers that have been seen.
It calculates the remainder of a divided by b and assigns it to the variable m.
It then initializes a variable i to the value of m.
The code enters a while loop that continues until i is in the set seen.
Inside the loop, it checks if i is equal to c. If it is, it prints "YES" and returns from the function.
If i is not equal to c, it adds i to the set seen and updates the value of i to be the remainder of (m + i) divided by b.
Once the loop finishes, it means that i has been seen before and it prints "NO".
Finally, the code calls the function foo with the values of a, b, and c as arguments.

Given the input 7 5 1, the code will execute as follows:
- a is assigned the value 7, b is assigned the value 5, and c is assigned the value 1.
- The function foo is called with the arguments 7, 5, and 1.
- Inside the function, seen is initialized as an empty set.
- m is calculated as 7 % 5 = 2.
- i is initialized to 2.
- The while loop starts and since i is not in seen, it enters the loop.
- i is not equal to c, so it adds i to seen and updates i to (2 + 2) % 5 = 4.
- i is not in seen, so it continues to the next iteration.
- i is not equal to c, so it adds i to seen and updates i to (2 + 4) % 5 = 1.
- i is in seen, so it exits the loop.
- Since i was equal to c at some point, it prints "YES" and returns from the function.
