<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string and converts it into a list of characters. In this case, the input string is "01B0" and the list becomes ['0', '1', 'B', '0'].
The code then initializes an empty deque called ans.
The code enters a loop that iterates over each character in the list.
If the current character is 'B', the code checks if ans is empty. If it is, the code continues to the next iteration of the loop. If ans is not empty, the code removes the last element from ans using the pop() method.
If the current character is not 'B', the code appends the character to ans using the append() method.
After the loop finishes, the code joins all the elements in ans into a single string using the join() method and prints the result. In this case, the result is "01".
<<<Output>>>
01
