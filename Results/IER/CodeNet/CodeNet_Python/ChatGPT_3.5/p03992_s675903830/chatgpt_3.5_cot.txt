<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input and assigns it to the variable S.
Then it prints the substring of S from index 0 to 3 (inclusive) and the substring from index 4 to 11 (inclusive).
In this case, the input is "CODEFESTIVAL", so the output will be "CODE FESTIVAL".
<<<Output>>>
CODE FESTIVAL
