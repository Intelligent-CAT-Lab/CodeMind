<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string `n`.
It then calculates the maximum value between two expressions:
1. `int(n[0])-1+9*(len(n)-1)`: This expression subtracts 1 from the first digit of `n`, multiplies 9 by the number of digits in `n` minus 1, and adds the two results together.
2. `sum([int(i) for i in n])`: This expression converts each character in `n` to an integer and sums them up.

The code then prints the maximum value calculated.

For the input `100`, the code calculates the maximum value as `9 + 9*2 = 27`.

<<<Output>>>
27
