<<<Analysis>>>
The variable k and variable s are initialized to 2 and 2, respectively.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the count of valid combinations.
The code then enters a nested loop that iterates over all possible values of x and y, from 0 to k (inclusive).
For each combination of x and y, it calculates the value of z as s - x - y.
The code checks if z is within the range [0, k]. If it is, it increments the count ans by 1.
After the nested loops finish, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 6.
<<<Output>>>
6
