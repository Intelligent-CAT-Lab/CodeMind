<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes 5 inputs: h1, m1, h2, m2, and k. These inputs represent the starting time (h1:m1), ending time (h2:m2), and the duration of an event (k).
The code then calculates the total minutes for the starting time (t1) and the ending time (t2) by multiplying the hours by 60 and adding the minutes.
Finally, the code subtracts t1, t2, and k to calculate the remaining time after the event ends.
In this case, the starting time is 10:00, the ending time is 15:00, and the duration of the event is 30 minutes.
So, t1 = 10*60 + 0 = 600, t2 = 15*60 + 0 = 900, and the output will be t2 - t1 - k = 900 - 600 - 30 = 270.
<<<Output>>>
270
