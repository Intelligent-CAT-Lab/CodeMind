<<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the necessary libraries and defines some constants.
Then it reads the input values N, A, and B.
Next, it defines a function called solve that takes N, A, and B as parameters.
Inside the solve function, there are several arrays defined using numpy.
The code then initializes the variable ans to 0.
It enters a loop that iterates from 0 to N-1.
Inside the loop, it performs various calculations and updates the arrays dp1 and dp2.
Finally, it calculates the value of x using the formula pow(2, N, MOD) - ans, and returns x % MOD.
Outside the solve function, it calls the solve function with the input values N, A, and B, and prints the result.
