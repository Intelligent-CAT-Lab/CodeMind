<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four integers as input and assigns them to variables a, b, c, and d.
It then compares the sum of a and b with the sum of c and d.
If the sum of a and b is greater than the sum of c and d, it prints 'Left'.
If the sum of a and b is less than the sum of c and d, it prints 'Right'.
If the sums are equal, it prints 'Balanced'.
In this case, the sum of a and b is 3 + 8 = 11, and the sum of c and d is 7 + 1 = 8.
Since 11 is greater than 8, the code will print 'Left'.
<<<Output>>>
