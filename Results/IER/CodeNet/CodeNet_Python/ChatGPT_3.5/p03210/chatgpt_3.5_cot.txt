<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input X and checks if it is equal to '7', '5', or '3'. If it is, the variable ans is set to 'YES', otherwise it is set to 'NO'. Finally, the value of ans is printed.
In this case, the input is '5', which is equal to one of the conditions. Therefore, the value of ans will be 'YES'.
<<<Output>>>
YES
