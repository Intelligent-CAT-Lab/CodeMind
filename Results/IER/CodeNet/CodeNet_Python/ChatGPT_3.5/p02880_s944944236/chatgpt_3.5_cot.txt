<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input and assigns it to the variable n.
The variable yes is initialized to True.
The code then checks if n is less than or equal to 10. If it is, the variable yes remains True.
If n is greater than 10, the code enters an else block and sets yes to False.
The code then checks if n is less than or equal to 81. If it is, it enters a for loop that iterates over the list of primesand10.
For each prime number in the list, the code checks if n is divisible by that prime number. If it is, the variable yes is set to False and the loop is broken.
After the loop finishes, the code checks the value of yes. If it is True, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
In this case, n is equal to 10, so the condition n <= 10 is True. Therefore, the code sets yes to True.
The code then prints "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
