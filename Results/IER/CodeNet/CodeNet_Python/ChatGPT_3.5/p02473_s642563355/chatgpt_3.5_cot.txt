<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes input from the user and splits it into a list of strings using the split() function. In this case, the input is "5 8", so the list will be ['5', '8'].
Then, it subtracts the second element of the list from the first element and converts the result to an integer.
Finally, it prints the result.
In this case, the first element is '5' and the second element is '8', so the result of the subtraction is -3.
<<<Output>>>
-3
