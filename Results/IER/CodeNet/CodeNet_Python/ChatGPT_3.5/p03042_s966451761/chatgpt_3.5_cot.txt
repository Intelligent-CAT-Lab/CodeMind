<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines several input functions to read input from stdin and initializes a constant INF to infinity.
It then defines two helper functions: is_yymm and is_mmyy. These functions check if the given first and last two digits of the input string represent a valid year and month combination.
The code reads a string input s and extracts the first two digits as f and the last two digits as l.
It then checks if the combination is both yymm and mmyy. If it is, it prints 'AMBIGUOUS'.
If the combination is yymm but not mmyy, it prints 'YYMM'.
If the combination is mmyy but not yymm, it prints 'MMYY'.
If the combination is neither yymm nor mmyy, it prints 'NA'.
In this case, the input is '1905'. The first two digits are 19 and the last two digits are 05.
The combination is yymm but not mmyy, so the output will be 'YYMM'.
