<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by importing the `sys` module and defining an `input` function that reads a line from the input and removes any trailing whitespace.
Then, it imports the `Decimal` class from the `decimal` module.
Next, it reads an integer `L` from the input.
The code converts `L` to a `Decimal` object and assigns it to the variable `d`.
Finally, it calculates `(d/3) ** 3` and prints the result.
In this case, since `L` is 3, the output will be `(3/3) ** 3 = 1 ** 3 = 1`.
