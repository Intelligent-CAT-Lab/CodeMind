<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input and assigns them to variables a and b.
Then it uses a conditional expression to check if a is less than b.
If a is less than b, it prints 0.
Otherwise, it prints 10.
In this case, a is 3 and b is 5, so a is indeed less than b.
Therefore, the code will print 0.
<<<Output>>>
0
