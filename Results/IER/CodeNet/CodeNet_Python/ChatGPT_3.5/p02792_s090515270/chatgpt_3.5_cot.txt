<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 25.
The code then initializes a 2D list lr_cnt with dimensions 10x10, filled with zeros.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 25.
For each number i in this range, it converts it to a string and extracts the first and last digits.
The code then increments the corresponding element in lr_cnt by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code initializes a variable ans to 0.
The code then enters a nested loop that iterates over all elements in lr_cnt.
For each pair of indices (i, j), it multiplies the corresponding elements in lr_cnt and adds the result to ans.
Finally, the code prints the value of ans, which is the final result.
<<<Output>>>
