<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes input in the form of a string and splits it into three parts: a, op, and b. In this case, a is assigned the value 1, op is assigned the value '+', and b is assigned the value 2.
Then, a and b are converted to integers using the int() function.
The code then checks if the value of op is '+'. If it is, it adds a and b and prints the result. Otherwise, it subtracts b from a and prints the result.
In this case, op is '+', so the code will add 1 and 2 and print the result, which is 3.
