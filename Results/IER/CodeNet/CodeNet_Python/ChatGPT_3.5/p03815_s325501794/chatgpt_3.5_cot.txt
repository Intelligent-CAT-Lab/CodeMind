<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input and assigns it to the variable x.
It then calculates the integer division of x by 11 and assigns it to the variable ans.
The code then checks if the remainder of x divided by 11 is greater than 6. If it is, it prints 2*ans+2.
If the remainder is 0, it prints 2*ans.
Otherwise, it prints 2*ans+1.
In this case, x is 7. The integer division of 7 by 11 is 0, and the remainder is 7.
Since the remainder is not greater than 6, the code prints 2*ans+1, which is 2*0+1 = 1.
