<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a list called ans with some pre-defined values.
Then it takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer.
The code uses this input as an index to access the corresponding value in the ans list.
Finally, it prints the value at the specified index.
In this case, the input is 1, so the code will print the value at index 1 in the ans list, which is 1.
