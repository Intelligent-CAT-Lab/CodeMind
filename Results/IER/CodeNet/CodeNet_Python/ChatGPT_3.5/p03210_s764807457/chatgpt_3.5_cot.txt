<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an input from the user using the input() function. In this case, the input is 5.
The code then converts the input to an integer using the int() function.
Next, the code checks if the integer is present in the list [3, 5, 7]. In this case, the integer 5 is present in the list.
If the integer is present in the list, the code prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".
Since 5 is present in the list, the output of the code execution will be "YES".
<<<Output>>>
YES
