<<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the necessary libraries and defines a constant MOD.
Then, it reads an integer S from the input.
Next, it defines three functions: type_1, type_2, and type_3.
The type_1 function calculates the number of pairs (k, n) such that kn < S < (k+1)n, where k >= 9 and 1 <= n <= M.
The type_2 function calculates the number of pairs (d, n) such that d divides S and d <= M, where n is the number of digits in d.
The type_3 function calculates the number of pairs (L, R) such that L and R are the number of digits in two different numbers, and the sum of the digits of the two numbers is S.
Finally, the code calculates the answer by summing the results of the three functions and taking the modulo MOD.
The answer is then printed.
