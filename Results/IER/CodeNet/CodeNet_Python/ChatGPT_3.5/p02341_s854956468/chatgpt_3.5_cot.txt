<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers n and k as input using the map function and splits them based on the space character. In this case, n is assigned the value 5 and k is assigned the value 10.
The code then checks if n is greater than k. If it is, it prints 0. Otherwise, it prints 1.
In this case, 5 is not greater than 10, so the code will print 1.
