<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines three functions: sub, checkEqual, and check12.
The main code starts by taking an input string S.
It then calls the checkEqual function and the check12 function, passing the input string S as an argument.
The checkEqual function iterates over the range from 1 to the length of S. For each value of k, it checks if the length of S is divisible by k. If it is not, it continues to the next iteration.
Inside the loop, the function initializes the variables mins and maxs to the substring of S from index 0 to k. It then iterates over the range from 0 to the length of S with a step size of k. For each value of s, it updates the mins and maxs variables by comparing the current substring of S with the previous values of mins and maxs.
After the inner loop finishes, the function calls the sub function, passing the maxs and mins variables as arguments. The sub function compares the corresponding digits of maxs and mins and returns the difference if they are not equal. If the digits are equal, it returns 10.
The checkEqual function updates the ans variable with the minimum value between ans and the result of the sub function.
After the loop finishes, the checkEqual function returns the value of ans.
The check12 function initializes the variables maxv and minv to 0 and 10, respectively. It then iterates over the characters of S. If the current character is '1' and there is another character after it, it converts the next two characters to an integer and updates the maxv and minv variables accordingly. If the current character is not '1', it converts it to an integer and updates the maxv and minv variables. Finally, it returns the difference between maxv and minv.
The main code prints the minimum value between the result of the checkEqual function and the result of the check12 function.
