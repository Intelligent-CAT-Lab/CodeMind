<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function `main()` which takes input values for variables N and K. It also initializes a variable MOD to 10^9+7.

The code then defines two helper functions: `between(n, k, i)` and `comb(n, r, mod)`. The `between()` function calculates the number of ways to choose i numbers from the range [1, k] such that the first number is 1. The `comb()` function calculates the binomial coefficient of n and r modulo mod.

Next, the code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to K (inclusive). For each iteration, it checks if i is greater than K or greater than N-K+1. If either condition is true, it prints 0. Otherwise, it calculates the answer using the `comb()` and `between()` functions, and prints the result.

In this case, N=5 and K=3. The loop will iterate three times, for i=1, i=2, and i=3. For each iteration, the code will calculate the answer and print it.
