<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string in the format "YYYY/MM/DD" and extracts the year, month, and date from it.
It then checks if the year is less than or equal to 2019. If it is, it checks if the month is less than or equal to 4. If both conditions are true, it prints "Heisei". Otherwise, it prints "TBD".
If the year is greater than 2019, it directly prints "TBD".
In this case, the input is "2019/04/30". The year is 2019, which is less than or equal to 2019. The month is 4, which is also less than or equal to 4. Therefore, the code will print "Heisei".
<<<Output>>>
Heisei
