<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input and assigns them to variables a, b, and c.
Then it calculates the product of a and b, and divides it by 2 using the // operator, which performs integer division.
Finally, it prints the result of the division.
In this case, a is 3, b is 4, and c is 5.
The product of 3 and 4 is 12, and dividing it by 2 gives 6.
Therefore, the output of the code execution would be 6.
<<<Output>>>
6
