<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input and stores them in variables m[0], m[1], and m[2].
Then, it checks multiple conditions using if-elif statements to determine the order of the three numbers.
The conditions are based on comparing the values of the three numbers using comparison operators (<, >, ==).
If a condition is true, the code prints the numbers in the specified order.
In this case, the input is 3, 8, 1.
The first condition is not true because 3 is not less than 8 and 8 is not less than 1.
The second condition is not true because 3 is not equal to 8 and 8 is not equal to 1.
The third condition is not true because 3 is not less than 8 and 8 is not equal to 1.
The fourth condition is not true because 3 is not equal to 8 and 8 is not less than 1.
The fifth condition is not true because 3 is not less than 8 and 8 is not less than 1.
The sixth condition is true because 3 is less than 8 and 8 is less than 1.
Therefore, the code prints 3, 8, 1.

3 8 1
