<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input and assigns them to variables x and y.
It then checks if the absolute difference between x and y is less than or equal to 1.
If the condition is true, it prints 'Brown', otherwise it prints 'Alice'.
In this case, the absolute difference between 2 and 1 is 1, so the condition is true and the output will be 'Brown'.
<<<Output>>>
Brown
