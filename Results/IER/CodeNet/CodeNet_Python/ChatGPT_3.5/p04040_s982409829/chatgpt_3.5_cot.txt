<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes the variable p to 10^9+7 and the variable M to 10^5.
It then initializes two lists, F and FI, with the first element as 1 and the rest as 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to M*2 (inclusive). For each iteration, it calculates the factorial of the current number i and stores it in the list F.
After the loop, it calculates the modular inverse of F[M] and stores it in FI[M].
Then, it enters another loop that iterates from M to 1 (inclusive). For each iteration, it calculates the factorial inverse of the current number i and stores it in FI.
Next, it reads the input values for H, W, A, and B.
The code calculates the values of hx and hy based on the input values.
It initializes the variable ans to 0.
Then, it enters a while loop that continues as long as hx is less than or equal to W and hy is greater than 0.
Inside the loop, it calculates the temporary value tmp using the values from the lists F and FI.
It updates the value of ans by adding tmp to it and taking the modulo p.
Finally, it increments hx by 1 and decrements hy by 1.
After the loop, it prints the final value of ans.
