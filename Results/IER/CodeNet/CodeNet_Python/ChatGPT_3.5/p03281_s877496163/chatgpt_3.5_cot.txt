<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input and assigns it to the variable n.
If n is less than 105, it prints 0 and the program ends.
Otherwise, it initializes a variable ans to 0.
Then it enters a loop that iterates from 105 to n (inclusive) with a step size of 2.
For each number i in this range, it initializes a variable cnt to 0.
Then it enters another loop that iterates from 1 to i (inclusive) with a step size of 2.
For each number j in this range, it checks if i is divisible by j. If it is, it increments cnt by 1.
After the inner loop finishes, it checks if cnt is equal to 8. If it is, it increments ans by 1.
After the outer loop finishes, it prints the final value of ans.

In this case, the input is 105, which is not less than 105.
So the code initializes ans to 0 and enters the outer loop.
For each number i in the range [105, 105] (inclusive), it enters the inner loop.
For each number j in the range [1, 105] (inclusive), it checks if 105 is divisible by j.
Since 105 is divisible by 1, 3, 5, 7, 15, 21, 35, and 105, cnt becomes 8.
After the inner loop finishes, it checks if cnt is equal to 8, which is true.
So it increments ans by 1.
After the outer loop finishes, it prints the final value of ans, which is 1.
