<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string `s`.
It then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to len(s)-1. For each iteration, it checks if the current character s[i] is equal to the next character s[i+1]. If they are equal, it prints the indices i+1 and i+2 and exits the program.
If the loop finishes without finding any adjacent equal characters, it enters another loop that iterates from 0 to len(s)-2. For each iteration, it checks if the current character s[i] is equal to the character two positions ahead s[i+2]. If they are equal, it prints the indices i+1 and i+3 and exits the program.
If both loops finish without finding any adjacent or two positions ahead equal characters, it prints -1 -1.
In this case, the input string is "needed". The code will not find any adjacent or two positions ahead equal characters, so it will print -1 -1.
<<<Output>>>
-1 -1
