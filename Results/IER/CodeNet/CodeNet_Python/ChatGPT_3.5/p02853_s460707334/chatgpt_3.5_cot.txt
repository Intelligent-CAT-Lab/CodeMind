<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs, x and y, and initializes a variable result to 0.
It then checks the value of x and adds a certain amount to result based on the value of x.
If x is 1, it adds 300000 to result.
If x is 2, it adds 200000 to result.
If x is 3, it adds 100000 to result.
Similarly, it checks the value of y and adds a certain amount to result based on the value of y.
If y is 1, it adds 300000 to result.
If y is 2, it adds 200000 to result.
If y is 3, it adds 100000 to result.
Finally, it checks if both x and y are equal to 1, and if so, it adds an additional 400000 to result.
After all the calculations, it prints the final value of result.
In this case, since x and y are both 1, the code will add 300000 + 300000 + 400000 to result, resulting in a final value of 1000000.
<<<Output>>>
1000000
