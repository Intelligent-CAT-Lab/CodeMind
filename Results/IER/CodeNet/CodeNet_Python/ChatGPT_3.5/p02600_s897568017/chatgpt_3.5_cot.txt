<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input and assigns it to the variable x.
Then it checks the value of x against multiple conditions using if-elif statements.
If x is between 400 and 599 (inclusive), it prints 8.
If x is between 600 and 799 (inclusive), it prints 7.
If x is between 800 and 999 (inclusive), it prints 6.
If x is between 1000 and 1199 (inclusive), it prints 5.
If x is between 1200 and 1399 (inclusive), it prints 4.
If x is between 1400 and 1599 (inclusive), it prints 3.
If x is between 1600 and 1799 (inclusive), it prints 2.
If x is between 1800 and 1999 (inclusive), it prints 1.
Since x is 725, it falls under the condition 600 <= x <= 799, so the output will be 7.
