<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string S.
If the length of S is 2, it checks if both characters are the same. If they are, it prints "1 2", otherwise it prints "-1 -1" and exits the program.
If the length of S is greater than 2, it enters a loop that iterates from 0 to len(S)-3. This loop considers substrings of length 3 in S.
For each substring, it converts it to a list and checks if the number of unique elements in the list is less than or equal to 2. If it is, it prints the starting and ending indices of the substring (1-indexed) and breaks out of the loop.
If the loop completes without finding a substring with less than or equal to 2 unique elements, it prints "-1 -1".
<<<Output>>>
-1 -1
