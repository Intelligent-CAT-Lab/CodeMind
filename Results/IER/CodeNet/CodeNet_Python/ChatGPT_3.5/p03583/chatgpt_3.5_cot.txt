<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input N and initializes three variables n, h, and w to 0.
Then, it enters a nested loop that iterates over two variables i and j, both ranging from 1 to 3500 (inclusive).
Inside the loop, it calculates two temporary variables tmp1 and tmp2 based on the values of N, i, and j.
If tmp2 is not equal to 0, it calculates the quotient and remainder of tmp1 divided by tmp2 using the divmod() function.
If the remainder is 0 and the quotient is greater than or equal to 0, it updates the values of n, h, and w with the current values of i, j, and the quotient respectively.
Finally, it prints the values of n, h, and w and exits the program.

In this case, the input N is 2.
The code will iterate over all possible combinations of i and j from 1 to 3500.
For each combination, it will calculate tmp1 and tmp2 and check if tmp2 is not equal to 0.
If tmp2 is not equal to 0, it will calculate the quotient and remainder of tmp1 divided by tmp2.
If the remainder is 0 and the quotient is greater than or equal to 0, it will update the values of n, h, and w and print them.
Since the code uses the exit() function after printing the values, it will only print the first combination that satisfies the conditions.
