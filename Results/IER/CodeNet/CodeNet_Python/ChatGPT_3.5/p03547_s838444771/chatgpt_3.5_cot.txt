<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs, X and Y, and compares them using if-elif-else statements.
If X is less than Y, it prints '<'.
If X is equal to Y, it prints '='.
If X is greater than Y, it prints '>'.
In this case, X is 'A' and Y is 'B'.
When comparing strings, the comparison is done lexicographically, meaning it compares the ASCII values of the characters.
The ASCII value of 'A' is 65 and the ASCII value of 'B' is 66.
Since 65 is less than 66, the code will print '<'.
