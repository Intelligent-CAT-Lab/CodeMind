<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four inputs: A, B, H, and M.
It then imports the math module to perform mathematical calculations.
The code calculates the angle between the hour hand and the minute hand of a clock.
The variable l represents the angle of the hour hand, which is calculated by multiplying the hour (H) by 360/12 and adding the minute (M) multiplied by 30/60.
The variable s represents the angle of the minute hand, which is calculated by multiplying the minute (M) by 360/60.
The variable ang represents the absolute difference between l and s.
The variable c represents the square of A plus the square of B minus 2 times A times B times the cosine of ang (converted to radians).
Finally, the code prints the square root of c using the math.sqrt() function.
