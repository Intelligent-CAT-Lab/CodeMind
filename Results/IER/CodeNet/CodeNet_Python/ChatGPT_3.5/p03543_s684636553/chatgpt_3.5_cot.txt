<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string `n`.
It then checks if the first three characters of `n` are equal or if the last three characters of `n` are equal.
If either of these conditions is true, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
In this case, the first three characters of `n` are equal (111), so the condition is true and the code will print "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
