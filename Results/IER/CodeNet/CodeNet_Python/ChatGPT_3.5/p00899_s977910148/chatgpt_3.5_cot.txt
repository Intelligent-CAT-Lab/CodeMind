<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines several helper functions and initializes some variables.
The main function reads an integer n from input and then enters a loop that runs n times.
Inside the loop, it calls the function f(n) and appends the result to the list rr.
The function f(n) reads n strings from input and stores them in a list a.
It then removes any strings from a that are substrings of other strings in a.
Next, it initializes a 2D list d with dimensions n x n and fills it with zeros.
For each pair of strings in a, it calculates the length of the longest common suffix between them and stores it in d.
The function then initializes a defaultdict q with default value 0 and populates it with keys representing subsets of the indices of a.
The values of q are the lengths of the longest common suffixes of the strings corresponding to the indices in each subset.
The function then enters a loop that runs n-1 times.
In each iteration, it creates a new defaultdict nq and updates its values based on the values of q and the values in d.
Finally, it returns the sum of the lengths of all strings in a minus the maximum value in q.
The main function prints the elements of rr separated by newlines.
