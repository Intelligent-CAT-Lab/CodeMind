<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes 6 inputs: W, H, w, h, x, and y. These inputs are split and converted to integers using the map function.
The code then calculates the values of X1, X2, Y1, and Y2 based on the input values.
Next, it calculates the values of x1, y1, x2, and y2 using the max and min functions.
Finally, it calculates the values of mx and my by taking the average of x1 and x2, and y1 and y2 respectively.
The code then prints the value of my divided by mx with 10 decimal places.
<<<Output>>>
