<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input and assigns it to the variable X.
The code then calculates the number of 500s in X by performing integer division (//) of X by 500. This result is multiplied by 1000 to get the total value of the 500s.
Next, the code calculates the remaining value after removing the 500s from X by performing modulo (%) division of X by 500. This result is then divided by 5 to get the number of 5s.
Finally, the code adds the value of the 500s and the value of the 5s to get the total value.
In this case, X is 1024. The number of 500s in 1024 is 2, so the value of the 500s is 2000. The remaining value after removing the 500s is 24, which is divisible by 5. So the value of the 5s is 24. The total value is 2000 + 24 = 2024.
<<<Output>>>
2024
