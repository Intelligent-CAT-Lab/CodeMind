<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers A and B as input.
It then calculates three values: a1 = A + B, a2 = A - B, and a3 = A * B.
Next, it checks which of these three values is the largest.
If a1 is the largest, it prints a1.
If a2 is the largest, it prints a2.
If a3 is the largest, it prints a3.
In this case, A = 3 and B = 1.
So, a1 = 3 + 1 = 4, a2 = 3 - 1 = 2, and a3 = 3 * 1 = 3.
Since a1 is the largest, the code will print 4.
<<<Output>>>
4
