<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input and assigns them to variables a, b, and c.
It then checks if a is equal to b. If it is, it prints the value of c.
If a is not equal to b, it checks if b is equal to c. If it is, it prints the value of a.
If neither of the above conditions is true, it prints the value of b.
In this case, a=5, b=7, and c=5.
Since a is not equal to b, the code checks if b is equal to c. Since b=7 and c=5, this condition is not true either.
Therefore, the code prints the value of b, which is 7.
<<<Output>>>
7
