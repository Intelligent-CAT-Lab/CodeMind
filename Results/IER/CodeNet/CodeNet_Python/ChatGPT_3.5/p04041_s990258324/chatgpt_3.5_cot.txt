<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by importing necessary libraries and defining some helper functions.
Then, it reads the input values for variables n, X, Y, and Z.
Next, it initializes a variable t to 1 shifted left by the sum of X, Y, and Z.
It also initializes a variable haiku to the bitwise OR of three shifted values: (1<<(X+Y+Z)), (1<<(Y+Z)), and (1<<Z). This is then right-shifted by 1.
The code creates a list dp of size t and sets all elements to 0. It also sets dp[0] to 1.
Then, it enters a loop that iterates n times.
Inside the loop, it creates a copy of dp called tm.
It then sets dp to a list of zeros of size t.
Next, it enters two nested loops. The first loop iterates over all elements in dp, and the second loop iterates over all digits from 0 to 9.
Inside the second loop, it calculates a new value m by shifting the current element of dp left by (d+1) bits and adding (1<<d).
If m bitwise AND haiku is equal to haiku, it continues to the next iteration of the loop.
Otherwise, it adds tm[k] to dp[int(m)%t] and takes the modulo of dp[int(m)%t] with mo.
After the loops finish, the code initializes a variable sub to 0.
Then, it enters a loop that iterates over all elements in dp and adds each element to sub.
Next, it calculates the value of ans by subtracting sub from 10^n modulo mo.
Finally, it prints the value of ans, sub, dp, and n*t*10.
