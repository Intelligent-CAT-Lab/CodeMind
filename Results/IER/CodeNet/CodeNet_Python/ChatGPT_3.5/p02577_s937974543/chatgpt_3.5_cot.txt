<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string and converts it into a list of characters.
It initializes a variable ans to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of the digits.
Then, it enters a loop that iterates over the length of the list.
In each iteration, it converts the current character to an integer and adds it to ans.
After the loop finishes, it checks if ans is divisible by 9. If it is, it prints 'Yes', otherwise it prints 'No'.
In this case, the input is '123456789', so the sum of the digits is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9 = 45.
Since 45 is divisible by 9, the output will be 'Yes'.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
