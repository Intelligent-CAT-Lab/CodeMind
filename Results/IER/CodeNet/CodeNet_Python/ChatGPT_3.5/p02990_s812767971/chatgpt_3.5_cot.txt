<<<Analysis>>>
The code imports the reduce function from the functools module and defines a function nCr that calculates the combination of n choose r modulo DIV.
The code then takes two integers n and k as input.
It initializes the variable mod to 10^9 + 7.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to k-1.
For each iteration, it initializes the variable ans to -1.
If i+1 is greater than n-k+1, it sets ans to 0.
Otherwise, it calculates ans as the product of two combinations: nCr(k-1, i, mod) and nCr(n-k+1, i+1, mod), modulo mod.
Finally, it prints the value of ans for each iteration of the loop.

In this case, n is 5 and k is 3.
The loop iterates three times, with i taking the values 0, 1, and 2.
For i = 0, ans is calculated as (nCr(2, 0, mod) * nCr(3, 1, mod)) % mod = (1 * 3) % mod = 3.
For i = 1, ans is calculated as (nCr(2, 1, mod) * nCr(3, 2, mod)) % mod = (2 * 3) % mod = 6.
For i = 2, ans is calculated as (nCr(2, 2, mod) * nCr(3, 3, mod)) % mod = (1 * 1) % mod = 1.
