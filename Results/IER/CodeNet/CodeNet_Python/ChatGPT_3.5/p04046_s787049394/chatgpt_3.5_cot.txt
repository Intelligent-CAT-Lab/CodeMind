<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by importing necessary modules and initializing the modulus variable to 1000000007.
Then, it calculates the factorial of numbers from 0 to 2000000 and stores them in the factorial list.
Next, it calculates the modular inverse of the last factorial value (1000000005) and stores it in the factorial_inv_rev list.
After that, it defines a function ncr to calculate the combination of n and r using the factorial and factorial_inv_rev lists.
The code then takes input values for h, w, a, and b.
It creates a list of points using list comprehension, where each point is a tuple of (i, j) coordinates.
The coordinates are generated by iterating from h-a-1 to 0 in reverse order for i and from b to w for j.
Next, it calculates the former and latter lists using list comprehension and the ncr function.
The former list contains the combination values for each point (i, j) in the points list, where i and j are the coordinates.
The latter list contains the combination values for each point (h-i-1, w-j-1) in the points list.
Finally, it calculates the sum of the product of each element in the former and latter lists, and takes the modulus of the result.
The final result is printed as the output.
