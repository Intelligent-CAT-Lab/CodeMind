<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input and assigns them to variables a and b.
Then it prints the result of three operations: a divided by b, a modulo b, and a divided by b as a floating-point number.
In this case, a is 3 and b is 2.
The first operation is 3 divided by 2, which results in 1.
The second operation is 3 modulo 2, which results in 1.
The third operation is 3 divided by 2 as a floating-point number, which results in 1.5.
Therefore, the output of the code execution would be "1 1 1.500000".
<<<Output>>>
1 1 1.500000
