<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes the variables mod, size, f, and invf.
Then, it defines two functions: inv(n) and comb(n, k).
The function inv(n) calculates the modular inverse of n using the extended Euclidean algorithm.
The function comb(n, k) calculates the binomial coefficient C(n, k) using the factorial values stored in f and invf.
The function init(n) initializes the factorial and inverse factorial arrays f and invf.
Next, the code reads the values of n, a, b, and c from input and calls the init(2*n) function to initialize the factorial and inverse factorial arrays.
The variable m is initialized to 0.
Then, there is a loop that iterates from 0 to n-1.
In each iteration, it calculates the value of m using the comb(n+k, n) function, and multiplies it with the expression (a^n * b^k + a^k * b^n) * inv((100-c)^(n+k+1)).
The result is added to m.
Finally, the code prints the value of (m * n * 100) % mod.
