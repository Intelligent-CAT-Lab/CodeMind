<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers A and B as input and checks if any of the following conditions are true:
1. A is divisible by 3
2. B is divisible by 3
3. The sum of A and B is divisible by 3

If any of these conditions are true, it prints 'Possible'. Otherwise, it prints 'Impossible'.

In this case, A is 4 and B is 5. Neither A nor B is divisible by 3, and the sum of A and B is 9, which is divisible by 3. Therefore, the condition (A + B) % 3 == 0 is true, and the code will print 'Possible'.

<<<Output>>>
Possible
