<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a list called "day" with the days of the week in order: ["fri","sat","sun","mon","tue","wed","thu"].
It then takes an input value x and converts it to an integer.
The code then calculates the index of the day in the "day" list by subtracting 1 from x and taking the absolute value. This is done to handle negative values of x.
The code then uses the modulo operator (%) to wrap the index within the range of the "day" list. This ensures that the index is always a valid index for the list.
Finally, the code prints the day corresponding to the calculated index.
In this case, the input value is 1. So, the index is calculated as abs(1-1) % 7 = 0 % 7 = 0. Therefore, the output will be "fri".
<<<Output>>>
fri
