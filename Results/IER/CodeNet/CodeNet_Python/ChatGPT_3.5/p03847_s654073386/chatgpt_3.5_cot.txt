<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input n and converts it to its binary representation nstr.
It initializes two dictionaries f and g.
If the last digit of nstr is 0, it sets f[1] to 1 and g[1] to 3.
If the last digit of nstr is 1, it sets f[1] to 2 and g[1] to 3.
Then, it enters a loop that iterates from 2 to the length of nstr.
For each iteration, it checks the current digit of nstr.
If the digit is 0, it calculates f[k] as f[k-1] modulo 10^9+7 and g[k] as (thrpow[k-1] + f[k-1] + g[k-1]) modulo 10^9+7.
If the digit is 1, it calculates f[k] as (f[k-1] + g[k-1]) modulo 10^9+7 and g[k] as (2*thrpow[k-1] + g[k-1]) modulo 10^9+7.
Finally, it prints the value of f[len(nstr)] modulo 10^9+7.
