<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input and assigns it to the variable s.
Then it prints the hours, minutes, and seconds in the format HH:MM:SS.
To calculate the hours, it divides s by 3600 and uses integer division (//) to get the whole number of hours.
To calculate the minutes, it divides s by 60 and uses integer division (//) to get the whole number of minutes. Then it takes the remainder of this division by 60 to get the minutes within the current hour.
To calculate the seconds, it takes the remainder of s divided by 60.
Finally, it prints the hours, minutes, and seconds separated by colons.
In this case, the input is 46979.
The code will calculate the hours as 13 (46979 // 3600 = 13).
The code will calculate the minutes as 2 ((46979 // 60) % 60 = 2).
The code will calculate the seconds as 59 (46979 % 60 = 59).
Therefore, the output will be "13:2:59".
<<<Output>>>
13:2:59
