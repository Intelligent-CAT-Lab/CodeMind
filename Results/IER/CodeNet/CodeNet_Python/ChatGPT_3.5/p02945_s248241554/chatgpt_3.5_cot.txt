The code takes two integers as input and assigns them to variables a and b.
It then checks two conditions:
1. If the sum of a and b is greater than or equal to the difference between a and b, and the sum of a and b is greater than or equal to the product of a and b, it prints the sum of a and b.
2. If the difference between a and b is greater than or equal to the sum of a and b, and the difference between a and b is greater than or equal to the product of a and b, it prints the difference between a and b.
If neither of these conditions is true, it means that the product of a and b is the largest, so it prints the product of a and b.
In this case, a is -13 and b is 3.
The sum of a and b is -10, which is not greater than or equal to the difference between a and b (-16) and not greater than or equal to the product of a and b (-39).
The difference between a and b is -16, which is greater than or equal to the sum of a and b (-10) and greater than or equal to the product of a and b (-39).
Therefore, the code will print -16.

-16
