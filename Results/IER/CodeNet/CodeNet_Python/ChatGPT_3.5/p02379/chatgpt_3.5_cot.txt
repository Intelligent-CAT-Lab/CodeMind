<<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the math module.
Then it takes input in the form of four space-separated float numbers and assigns them to variables x1, y1, x2, and y2.
The code then calculates the distance between the two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) using the distance formula: sqrt((x1 - x2) ** 2 + (y1 - y2) ** 2).
Finally, it prints the calculated distance with 6 decimal places using the format method and the {:f} format specifier.
In this case, the distance between (0, 0) and (1, 1) is sqrt(1 + 1) = sqrt(2) = 1.4142135623730951.
<<<Output>>>
