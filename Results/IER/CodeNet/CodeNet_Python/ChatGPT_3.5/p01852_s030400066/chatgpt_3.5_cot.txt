<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized to 0.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of times N can be divided by 2.
The code enters a while loop that continues as long as N is non-zero.
Inside the loop, N is divided by 2 using the floor division operator (//) and the result is assigned back to N.
The variable ans is incremented by 1.
This process continues until N becomes 0.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 0.
<<<Output>>>
