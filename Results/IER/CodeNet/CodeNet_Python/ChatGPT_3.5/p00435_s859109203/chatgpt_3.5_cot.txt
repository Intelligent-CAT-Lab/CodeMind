<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string S, which is "MRL" in this case.
It initializes an empty list A, which will be used to store the converted characters.
Then, it enters a loop that iterates over the length of the input string.
For each character in the input string, it converts the character to its corresponding ASCII value using the ord() function.
It subtracts 65 from the ASCII value to normalize it to the range 0-25 (since 'A' has ASCII value 65).
It subtracts 3 from the normalized value and takes the modulo 26 to ensure it stays within the range 0-25.
It adds 65 back to the result to convert it back to the ASCII value of the corresponding character.
It appends the converted character to the list A.
After the loop finishes, it enters another loop that iterates over the elements in list A.
For each element, it prints the element without a newline character (end="").
Finally, it prints an empty string to add a newline character.
