<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by taking an input string x, which is "TSTTSS" in this case.
It then initializes a variable n to the length of x, which is 6.
A deque object st is created to store the characters "S" and "T".
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider each character in the input string.
For each character x[i], it checks if it is equal to "S". If it is, it appends "S" to the deque st.
If x[i] is not equal to "S", it checks if st is empty. If it is, it appends "T" to st.
If st is not empty, it pops the top element from st and stores it in variable a.
If a is equal to "T", it appends two "T" characters to st.
If a is not equal to "T", it continues to the next iteration of the loop.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the length of st, which is the number of elements remaining in the deque.
In this case, the final length of st is 2.
