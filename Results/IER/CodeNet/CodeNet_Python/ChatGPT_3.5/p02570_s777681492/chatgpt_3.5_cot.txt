<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads three integers d, t, and s from the input.
It then checks if the product of s and t is less than d. If it is, it prints 'No'. Otherwise, it prints 'Yes'.
In this case, s*t = 15*80 = 1200, which is greater than d = 1000. Therefore, the code will print 'Yes'.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
