<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by importing various modules and defining some constants and functions.
Then, it reads two integers n and m from the input.
Next, it initializes a 2D list dp with dimensions (n+1) x (n+1) and sets dp[1][1] to 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates m times.
Inside the loop, it creates a new 2D list new_dp with the same dimensions as dp.
For each pair of indices (j, k) in the range (1, n+1), it updates the corresponding entry in new_dp based on the values in dp.
The updates are done according to the following formulas:
- new_dp[j][j] += dp[j][k] * k % mod
- new_dp[j][k] += dp[j][k] * (j - k) % mod
- new_dp[j+1][k] += dp[j][k] * (n - j) % mod
After the inner loop finishes, dp is updated to be equal to new_dp.
Finally, the code prints the value of dp[n][n].
