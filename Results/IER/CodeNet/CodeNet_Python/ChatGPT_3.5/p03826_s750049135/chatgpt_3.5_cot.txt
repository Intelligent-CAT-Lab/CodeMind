<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads four integers A, B, C, and D from the input.
It then compares the product of A and B with the product of C and D.
If A*B is greater than C*D, it prints A*B.
Otherwise, it prints C*D.
In this case, A*B is 3*5 = 15, and C*D is 2*7 = 14.
Since 15 is greater than 14, the code will print 15.
<<<Output>>>
15
