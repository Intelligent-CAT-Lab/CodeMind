<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines three lambda functions: ni, nm, and nl. These functions are used to read input values in different formats (integer, map, and list).
The code then reads a string input and assigns it to the variable s.
Next, the code enters a loop that iterates over the indices of the string s. For each index i, it prints the character 'x' without a newline character.
Since the input string is "sardine", which has 7 characters, the loop will iterate 7 times and print 'x' each time.
<<<Output>>>
xxxxxxx
