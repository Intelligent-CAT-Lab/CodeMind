<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function inpl() that takes input and returns a list of integers. It then uses this function to assign values to variables A and B.
The code defines another function calca(x) that takes an integer x as input and returns the result of x divided by A plus the remainder of x divided by A.
The code then calculates the value of X as the smallest multiple of A that is greater than or equal to B. This is done by dividing B by A, rounding up to the nearest integer, and then multiplying by A.
The code calculates the value of Y by subtracting X divided by B multiplied by B from X, and then passing the result to the calca() function. It also adds X divided by B to the result.
The code then checks if the rounded up division of B by A is less than Y. If it is, it prints the value of X. Otherwise, it prints -1.
In this case, A is 4 and B is 6. The code calculates X as 8 and Y as 4. Since 2 is less than 4, the code prints 8.
<<<Output>>>
8
