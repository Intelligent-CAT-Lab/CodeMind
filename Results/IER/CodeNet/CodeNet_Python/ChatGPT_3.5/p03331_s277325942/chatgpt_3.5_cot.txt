<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called DigitsSum that takes an integer n as input and calculates the sum of its digits. It initializes a variable sum to 0 and enters a while loop that continues until n becomes 0. In each iteration, it adds the last digit of n to sum and updates n by dividing it by 10 (integer division). Finally, it returns the value of sum.

The code then reads an integer N from the input.

It initializes a variable min_sum to a large value (10^5).

The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N-1. For each value of i in this range, it calculates the sum of the digits of i and the sum of the digits of N-i using the DigitsSum function. It adds these two sums and stores the result in the variable sum.

The code checks if sum is less than min_sum. If it is, it updates min_sum to the value of sum.

After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of min_sum.
