<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an input using the input() function, which is '1000' in this case.
The input is then converted to an integer using the int() function.
The code then checks if the integer value is less than 1200.
Since 1000 is less than 1200, the condition is True and the code prints 'ABC'.
<<<Output>>>
ABC
