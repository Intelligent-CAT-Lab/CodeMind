<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input: n, m, and k.
It initializes a list t with n*m+1 elements, all set to 0.
Then it enters a nested loop. The outer loop iterates from 0 to n (inclusive), and the inner loop iterates from 0 to m-1 (inclusive).
Inside the inner loop, it calculates the index a as i*m and the index b as n-i-i.
Then it sets the element at index a in the list t to 1.
After the loops finish, it checks if the element at index k in the list t is 0. If it is, it prints 'No', otherwise it prints 'Yes'.

In this case, n=2, m=2, and k=2.
The outer loop iterates twice, with i=0 and i=1.
For i=0, a=0 and b=2. It sets t[0] to 1.
For i=1, a=2 and b=0. It sets t[2] to 1.
Finally, it checks t[2], which is 1, and prints 'Yes'.

<<<Output>>>
Yes
