<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers N and K from the input, which are 5 and 3 in this case.
It initializes an empty list R to store the results.
The variable v is set to (1 << K) - 1, which is 7 in this case.
The code enters a while loop that continues until v is greater than or equal to (1 << N), which is 32 in this case.
Inside the loop, it appends the current value of v to the list R.
Then it calculates the values of x and y using bitwise operations.
The value of v is updated using bitwise operations and arithmetic operations.
After the loop finishes, the list R is sorted in ascending order.
Finally, the code iterates over the elements of R and prints each element along with a string representation of the binary representation of the numbers from 0 to N-1 that have a bit set in the corresponding position.
