<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines two functions: pow(a, b) and binaryOne(n, multi). 
The pow(a, b) function calculates the power of a to the b-th power using recursion. 
The binaryOne(n, multi) function uses binary search to find the maximum number x such that pow(x, multi) is less than or equal to n. 

The code then takes two inputs: n and a. 
It initializes the variable ans to a very large number (1e18). 
It then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 39. 
For each iteration, it calls the binaryOne function to find the maximum number maxi such that pow(maxi, i+1) is less than or equal to n. 
It then calls the binaryTwo function to find the maximum number subt such that pow(maxi, (i+1) - subt) * pow(maxi - 1, subt) is greater than or equal to n. 
It updates the value of ans by taking the minimum of ans, a*i + maxi*(i + 1) - subt. 

Finally, it prints the value of ans.
