<<<Analysis>>>
The variables A, B, C, X, and Y are initialized to 1500, 2000, 1600, 3, and 2, respectively.
The variable ans is initialized to a large value, 10^9 + 7.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 10^5 (inclusive), meaning it will consider values from 0 to 100000 for the variable i.
For each value of i, the code calculates the cost using the formula 2*C*i + max(0,Y-i)*B + max(0,X-i)*A.
The code checks if this cost is smaller than the current value of ans. If it is, it updates ans to the new cost.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is the minimum cost among all the values of i.
