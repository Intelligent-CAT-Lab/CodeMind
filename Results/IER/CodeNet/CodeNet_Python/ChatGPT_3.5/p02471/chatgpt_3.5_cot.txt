<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by defining a recursive function rec(a, b) that calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two numbers a and b using the Euclidean algorithm. The function returns the values of x, y, and gcd.

The code then reads two integers a and b from the input.

Next, the code checks if a is less than b. If it is, it calls the rec() function with arguments b and a, and assigns the returned values to y0, x0, and gcd. Otherwise, it calls the rec() function with arguments a and b, and assigns the returned values to x0, y0, and gcd.

The code then calculates the values of dx and dy, which are the increments for x and y in each iteration of the following loops. The values of dx and dy are calculated as b/gcd and -a/gcd, respectively. If dx is negative, it is made positive and dy is made negative as well.

The code initializes the variables x, y, and mag to the values of x0, y0, and the sum of the absolute values of x0 and y0, respectively.

The code then enters a loop that repeatedly increments x and y by dx and dy, calculates the new value of mag, and checks if mag has increased. If mag has increased, the loop breaks.

The code then enters another loop that repeatedly decrements x and y by dx and dy, calculates the new value of mag, and checks if mag is greater than the previous value. If mag is greater, the loop breaks.

Finally, the code prints the values of x and y.
