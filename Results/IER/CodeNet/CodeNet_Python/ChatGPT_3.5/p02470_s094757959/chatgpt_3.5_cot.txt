<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and m are initialized to the same value, which is the input value of 6 in this case.
The variable i is initialized to 2.
The code then enters a while loop that continues as long as i*i is less than or equal to n.
Inside the loop, it checks if n is divisible by i. If it is, it updates the value of m by dividing it by i and multiplying it by i-1.
It then enters another while loop that continues as long as n is divisible by i. Inside this loop, it updates the value of n by dividing it by i.
After the inner loop finishes, it increments the value of i by 1.
After the outer loop finishes, it checks if n is not equal to 1. If it is not equal to 1, it updates the value of m by dividing it by n and multiplying it by n-1.
Finally, it prints the value of m, which is the final result.
In this case, the value of m remains 6 because 6 is not divisible by any prime number other than itself.
<<<Output>>>
6
