<<<Analysis>>>
The code imports the sqrt function from the math module and the product function from the itertools module. It also imports the numpy module as np.
The code defines a function called judge, which takes a parameter D. Inside the function, it initializes a variable n to 1.
The code then enters a while loop that continues as long as D is divisible by 4. In each iteration, it multiplies n by 2 and divides D by 4.
After the while loop, the code defines two nested functions called h1 and h2. These functions take two parameters x and y.
The function h1 returns the bitwise NOT of the sum of x divided by n and y divided by n, modulo 2.
The function h2 returns the bitwise NOT of x divided by n, modulo 2.
The judge function returns h1 if D is odd, otherwise it returns h2.
The code then reads three integers N, D1, and D2 from input.
The code calls the judge function with D1 and assigns the returned function to the variable j1.
The code calls the judge function with D2 and assigns the returned function to the variable j2.
The code initializes a variable cnt to 0.
The code then enters a nested loop that iterates over all pairs (x, y) where x and y are integers in the range [0, 2N-1].
For each pair (x, y), the code checks if both j1(x, y) and j2(x, y) are true. If they are, it prints the pair (x, y), increments cnt by 1, and checks if cnt is greater than or equal to N*N. If it is, it breaks out of the loop.
