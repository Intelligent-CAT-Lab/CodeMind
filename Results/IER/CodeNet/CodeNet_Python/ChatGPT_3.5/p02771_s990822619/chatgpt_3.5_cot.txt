<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three inputs A, B, and C and compares them in different conditions.
First, it checks if A is equal to B and B is equal to C. If this condition is true, it prints "No".
Next, it checks if A is not equal to B, B is not equal to C, and C is not equal to A. If this condition is true, it prints "No".
If neither of the above conditions is true, it means that at least two of the variables are equal. In this case, it prints "Yes".
In the given input "5 7 5", A is equal to C, so the first condition is true and it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
