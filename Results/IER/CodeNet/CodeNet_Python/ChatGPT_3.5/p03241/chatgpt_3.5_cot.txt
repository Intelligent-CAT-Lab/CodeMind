<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function make_divisors(n) that takes an integer n as input and returns a list of its divisors.
The main() function reads two integers N and M from input and calculates the ratio MN.
Then, it calls the make_divisors() function with M as input to get a list of divisors of M.
The code initializes a variable max_gcd to 0.
It then iterates over each divisor d in the list of divisors.
For each divisor, it checks if d is less than or equal to MN and greater than or equal to max_gcd.
If both conditions are true, it updates max_gcd to the value of d.
Finally, it prints the value of max_gcd.
In this case, N is 3 and M is 14.
The divisors of 14 are [1, 2, 7, 14].
The ratio MN is 14/3 = 4.6667.
The code iterates over the divisors and finds that 2 is the largest divisor that satisfies the conditions.
Therefore, the output of the code execution would be 2.
