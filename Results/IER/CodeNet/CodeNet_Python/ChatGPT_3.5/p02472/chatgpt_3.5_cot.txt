<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes input in the form of two integers separated by a space. In this case, the input is "5 8".
The code then uses a list comprehension to split the input string by space and convert each element to an integer. This results in a list [5, 8].
The variables A and B are assigned the values of the first and second elements of the list, respectively. So A=5 and B=8.
Finally, the code prints the sum of A and B, which is 13.
<<<Output>>>
13
