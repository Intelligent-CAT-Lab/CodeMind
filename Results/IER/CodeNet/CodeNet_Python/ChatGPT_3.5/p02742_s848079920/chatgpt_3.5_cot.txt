<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs, H and W, and checks if either of them is equal to 1. If either of them is 1, it prints 1 and exits.
If neither H nor W is 1, it calculates the answer using the formula:
ans = H*(W//2) + (H+1)//2*(W%2)
In this case, H = 4 and W = 5.
Since neither H nor W is 1, the code calculates ans as follows:
ans = 4*(5//2) + (4+1)//2*(5%2)
     = 4*2 + 5//2*1
     = 8 + 2*1
     = 8 + 2
     = 10
Finally, the code prints the value of ans, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
