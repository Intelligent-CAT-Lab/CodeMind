<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers A and B as input.
It then checks if both A and B are odd numbers (i.e., not divisible by 2).
If both A and B are odd, it prints "Yes".
Otherwise, it prints "No".
In this case, A=3 and B=1, both of which are odd numbers.
Therefore, the code will print "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
