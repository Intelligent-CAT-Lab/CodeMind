<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three inputs: x, k, and d. These inputs are converted to integers.
The code then takes the absolute value of x and stores it back in x.
The code checks if the product of k and d is less than or equal to x. If it is, it subtracts the product from x and prints the result.
If the product is greater than x, the code subtracts the integer division of x by d from k and takes the remainder of x divided by d.
If k is odd, it subtracts the remainder from d and prints the result.
If k is even, it prints the remainder as is.
