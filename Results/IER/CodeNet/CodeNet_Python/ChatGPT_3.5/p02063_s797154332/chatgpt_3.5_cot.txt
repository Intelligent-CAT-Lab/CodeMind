<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines several functions (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H) but only executes the D function at the end.
The D function takes two integers a and b as input.
If b is divisible by a or a is equal to 2, it prints -1.
Otherwise, it calculates the integer division of b by a and adds 1 to it to get the value of x.
Then, it calculates the product of a and x and stores it in the variable c.
If x is less than the integer division of c by b plus the remainder of c divided by b, it prints c.
Otherwise, it prints -1.
In this case, the input is 4 and 6.
Since 6 is divisible by 4, the code will print -1.
<<<Output>>>
-1
