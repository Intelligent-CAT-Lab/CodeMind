<<<Analysis>>>
The variable X is initialized to 10.
The variable answer is initialized to 0, which will be used to store the maximum value found.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to the square root of X (inclusive), using the math.ceil() function to ensure that the loop includes the square root if it is not an integer.
For each number i in this range, it enters another loop that iterates from 2 to 10 (inclusive).
Inside this loop, it checks if i raised to the power of j is less than or equal to X. If it is, it updates the value of answer to be the maximum between i raised to the power of j and the current value of answer.
After both loops finish, the code prints the final value of answer, which is 9.
<<<Output>>>
9
