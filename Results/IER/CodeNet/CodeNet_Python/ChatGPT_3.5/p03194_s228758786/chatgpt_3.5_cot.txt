<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and variable p are initialized to 3 and 24, respectively.
The code then checks if n is equal to 1. In this case, it is not, so it goes to the else block.
The variable ans is initialized to 1, which will be used to store the final answer.
The variable limit is calculated as the ceiling of the nth root of p. In this case, limit is 2.
The code enters a while loop that continues as long as limit is greater than 1.
Inside the loop, the variable cnt is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of times limit divides p.
The variable a is set to p, which will be used to perform the division.
The code enters another while loop that continues as long as a is not equal to 0.
Inside this loop, the code checks if a is divisible by limit. If it is, it increments cnt by 1 and performs the division a = a // limit. Otherwise, it breaks out of the loop.
After the inner loop finishes, the code checks if cnt is greater than or equal to n. If it is, it updates ans to the current value of limit and breaks out of the outer loop.
Finally, the code decrements limit by 1 and continues to the next iteration of the outer loop.
Once the outer loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 2.
