<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an input string and converts it into a list of characters.
Then, it initializes a variable "ans" to "Yes".
Next, it creates a Counter object "c" which counts the occurrences of each character in the list.
The code then checks if the count of "N" multiplied by the count of "S" is equal to 0. If it is, it means that either "N" or "S" is missing in the input string. In that case, it checks if the count of "N" is not equal to the count of "S". If it is not equal, it means that the counts are not balanced and the answer is set to "No".
Similarly, the code checks if the count of "W" multiplied by the count of "E" is equal to 0. If it is, it means that either "W" or "E" is missing in the input string. In that case, it checks if the count of "W" is not equal to the count of "E". If it is not equal, it means that the counts are not balanced and the answer is set to "No".
Finally, the code prints the value of "ans", which will be either "Yes" or "No" depending on the conditions above.
In this case, the input string is "SENW", which contains all the required characters in balanced counts. Therefore, the answer will be "Yes".
