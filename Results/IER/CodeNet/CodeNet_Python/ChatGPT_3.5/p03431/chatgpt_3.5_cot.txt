<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers n and k as input and initializes a variable p to 998244353.
Then it defines a range function r and creates a list f with the first element as 1.
Next, it enters a loop that iterates k times. In each iteration, it calculates the factorial of the current index i and stores it in the list f.
After the loop, the code prints the sum of a series of calculations. The calculation involves multiplying f[-2] (second to last element of f) with the inverse of the product of f[i] and f[-2-i], where i iterates from 0 to n-2 (inclusive).
Finally, the code takes the modulo p of the sum and prints the result.
