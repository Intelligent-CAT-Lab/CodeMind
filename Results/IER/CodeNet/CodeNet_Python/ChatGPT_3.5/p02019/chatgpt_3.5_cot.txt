<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four inputs: n, a, b, and c.
It then calculates the expression n-(c+a-c+b-c).
The value of c is subtracted from a, b, and c itself, resulting in a, b, and 0 respectively.
The expression then simplifies to n-(a+b).
Given the input values n=6, a=3, b=2, the expression evaluates to 6-(3+2) = 6-5 = 1.
