<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string and converts it into a list of characters, which is stored in the variable S.
It also creates a list of characters "CODEFESTIVAL2016" and stores it in the variable C.
Then, it initializes a counter variable cnt to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to the length of C (exclusive).
For each index i in this range, it checks if the character at index i in S is different from the character at index i in C.
If they are different, it increments the counter cnt by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of cnt, which represents the number of positions where the characters in S and C are different.
