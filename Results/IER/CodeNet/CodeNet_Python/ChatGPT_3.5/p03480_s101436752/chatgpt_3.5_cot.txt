<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string S and removes any leading or trailing whitespace characters using the strip() function.
It then initializes the variable K to the length of the string S.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to len(S)-2. This loop is used to compare each character of the string with the next character.
If the current character is not equal to the next character, it means that there is a change in the sequence of 0s and 1s.
In this case, the code calculates the length of the current sequence (i+1) and the length of the remaining sequence (len(S)-i-1).
It then takes the maximum of these two lengths and assigns it to the variable ln.
Finally, the code updates the value of K to be the minimum of the current value of K and ln.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of K.

In this case, the input string is "010".
The code compares the first character '0' with the second character '1' and finds a change in the sequence.
The length of the current sequence is 1 and the length of the remaining sequence is 2.
The maximum of these two lengths is 2, so the value of K is updated to 2.
The loop then continues to the next iteration and compares the second character '1' with the third character '0'.
Again, there is a change in the sequence and the length of the current sequence is 2.
The length of the remaining sequence is 1.
The maximum of these two lengths is 2, but since the current value of K is already 2, it remains unchanged.
After the loop finishes, the final value of K is printed, which is 2.
