<<<Analysis>>>
The code imports the value of pi from the math module.
The code then takes two float inputs, A and B, and stores them in variables A and B.
The code then calculates the volume of a sphere using the formula (4/3)*pi*r^3, where r is the value of B.
The code uses the format function to format the output to 10 decimal places.
Finally, the code prints the formatted output.
In this case, the value of A is 1 and the value of B is 2.
So, the code calculates the volume of a sphere with radius 2 and prints the result.
