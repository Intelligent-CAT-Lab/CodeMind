<<<Analysis>>>
The code imports the sys module and uses the readline() function from the sys.stdin object to read a line of input.
The input is then split using the split() function and the resulting values are mapped to the variables a and b using the map() function.
The code then prints the sum of a and b.
In this case, the input is "5 8", so a is assigned the value 5 and b is assigned the value 8.
The sum of 5 and 8 is 13.
<<<Output>>>
13
