<<<Analysis>>>
The code first reads the input string W as a list of integers.
Then it calculates the length of W and assigns it to the variable N.
Next, the code defines a function called Z_Algorithm, which implements the Z algorithm for finding the length of the longest common prefix between a string and all of its suffixes.
The function find_good_substr uses the Z algorithm to find good substrings in W. A good substring is defined as a substring that can be repeated to form the original string. The function returns a list of boolean values indicating whether each substring of length i is good or not.
The function solve calls find_good_substr twice, once for the original string W and once for the reversed string W[::-1]. It then checks if the last element of the list G1 is True, which means that the original string itself is a good substring. If it is, the function returns (1, 1). Otherwise, it checks if all characters in W are the same. If they are, it returns (N, 1). Otherwise, it calculates the number of good substrings that can be formed by combining a good substring from the beginning of the string and a good substring from the end of the string. It returns (2, x), where x is the number of such combinations.
Finally, the code prints the values of x and y.
