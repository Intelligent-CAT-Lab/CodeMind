<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called solve(). Inside the function, it reads a string S from the input and removes the newline character at the end.
The variable turn is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of turns.
The variable current is initialized to the first character of S.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from the second character of S to the last character.
For each character i in this range, it checks if it is different from the current character. If it is, it increments the turn count by 1 and updates the current character to i.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of turn, which represents the number of turns required to change from one color to another in the string.
In this case, the string is "BBBWW". The first character is "B", so the current character is set to "B". Then, for each subsequent character, the code checks if it is different from "B". The first three characters are "B", so the turn count remains 0. The fourth character is "W", which is different from "B", so the turn count is incremented to 1. The fifth character is also "W", so the turn count remains 1. Therefore, the final output is 1.
