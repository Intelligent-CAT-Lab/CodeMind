<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by importing the fractions module and the sys module.
Then, it defines a function called lcm(a,b) that calculates the least common multiple of two numbers using the gcd function from the fractions module.
Next, it reads an integer N from the input.
If N is equal to 2, the code prints "4 7" and "23 10" and exits the program.
Otherwise, it initializes a list called lis with the value [2].
The code then enters a while loop that continues until the length of lis is greater than or equal to 2 times N.
Inside the loop, it checks if the current number now is divisible by any number in lis. If it is not, it appends now to lis.
The value of now is incremented by 2 in each iteration.
After the loop finishes, the code initializes a 2D list called ans with dimensions N x N, where each element is initialized to 1.
Then, it enters two nested for loops to iterate over each element in ans.
For each element, it checks if the sum of its row index i and column index j is even. If it is, it multiplies the element by the value at lis[(i+j) // 2].
If N is odd, it enters another nested for loop to iterate over each element in ans.
For each element, it checks if the sum of its row index i and the absolute difference between N-1 and its column index j is even. If it is, it multiplies the element by the value at lis[ -1 - (i + abs(N-1 - j)) // 2 ].
If N is even, it enters another nested for loop to iterate over each element in ans.
For each element, it checks if the sum of its row index i and the absolute difference between N-1 and its column index j is odd. If it is, it multiplies the element by the value at lis[ -1 - ((i + abs(N-1 - j) -1 ) // 2)].
After that, it enters another nested for loop to iterate over each element in ans.
For each element, it checks if the sum of its row index i and column index j is odd.
If it is, it calculates the value of t by finding the least common multiple of the element above it, the element to its left, the element below it, and the element to its right using the lcm function.
Finally, it adds 1 to t and assigns the result to the current element in ans.
After all the calculations, it enters another nested for loop to print each row of ans separated by a space.
