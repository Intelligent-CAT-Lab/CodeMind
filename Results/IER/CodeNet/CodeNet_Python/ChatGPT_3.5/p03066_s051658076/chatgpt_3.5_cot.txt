<<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module and defines an input function that reads input from stdin.
Then it reads two integers N and X from input.
Next, it initializes a variable P to 998244353.
Then it creates a 2D list A with dimensions (N+1) x (2*i+1) and initializes all elements to 0.
It also creates a list B with length (N+1) and initializes all elements to 0.
The code then sets A[0][0] to 1.
Next, it enters a nested loop that iterates over i from 0 to N-1 and j from i to 2*i+1.
Inside the loop, it updates A[i+1][j+1] and A[i+1][j+2] by adding A[i][j] to them.
If the updated values are greater than or equal to P, they are reduced by P.
After the nested loop, the code enters another loop that iterates over i from 0 to N.
Inside this loop, it enters another loop that iterates over j from i to min(2*i+1, X).
Inside this loop, it adds A[i][j] to B[i].
Next, the code checks if X is odd.
If it is, it enters another loop that iterates over i from X to N.
Inside this loop, it adds 1 to B[i].
Next, the code enters another loop that iterates over i from 1 to X-1.
Inside this loop, it calculates a value a as X - 1 - 2 * i.
If a is less than 0, it continues to the next iteration of the loop.
Inside the loop, it enters another loop that iterates over j from (a+1) // 2 to a+1.
Inside this loop, it calculates a value k as j + 2 * i.
If k is greater than N, it breaks out of the loop.
Inside the loop, it adds A[j][a] to B[k].
If B[k] is greater than or equal to P, it reduces it by P.
After all the loops, the code initializes a variable ans to 0.
Then it enters a loop that iterates over i and b in the enumerate of B.
Inside the loop, it updates ans by adding b * A[-1][-1-i] to it.
If ans is greater than or equal to P, it reduces it by P.
Finally, it prints the value of ans.
