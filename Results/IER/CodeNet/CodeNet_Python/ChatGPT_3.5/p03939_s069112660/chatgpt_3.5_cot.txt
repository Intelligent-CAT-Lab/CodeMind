<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable d1 and variable xx are initialized to 1, 3 and 3, respectively.
The code then initializes variable d to d1 multiplied by 1.0, and variable x to xx multiplied by 1.0.
The variable res is initialized to 0.0, which will be used to accumulate the result.
The code then enters a while loop that continues until N is greater than 1.
Inside the loop, it calculates a new value for res by adding (2*d + (2*N-1)*x) / 2 to it.
Then, it updates the value of d by multiplying it by (1.0 + 1.0 / N), and adds x * 5.0/(2*N) to it.
Finally, it updates the value of x by multiplying it by (1.0 + 2.0 / N), and decreases N by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of res + d + x/2, formatted with 12 decimal places.
