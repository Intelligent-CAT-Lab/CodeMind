<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string s.
It then checks if every even-indexed character in s is in the list odd, which contains the characters "R", "U", "D".
If any even-indexed character is not in the list odd, it prints "No" and exits the program.
Next, it checks if every odd-indexed character in s is in the list even, which contains the characters "L", "U", "D".
If any odd-indexed character is not in the list even, it prints "No" and exits the program.
If both checks pass, it prints "Yes".
In this case, the input string "RUDLUDR" satisfies both conditions, so the output will be "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
