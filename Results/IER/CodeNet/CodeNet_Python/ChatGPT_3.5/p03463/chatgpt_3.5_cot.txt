<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers a, b, and c as input and assigns them to variables a, b, and c respectively.
The code then checks if the absolute difference between b and c is divisible by 2. If it is, it prints "Alice". Otherwise, it prints "Borys".
In this case, the absolute difference between 2 and 4 is 2, which is divisible by 2. Therefore, the code will print "Alice".
<<<Output>>>
Alice
