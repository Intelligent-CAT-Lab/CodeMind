<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers X and Y as input and assigns them to variables X and Y respectively.
The code then checks if the absolute difference between X and Y is greater than or equal to 2.
If the condition is true, it prints 'Alice', otherwise it prints 'Brown'.
In this case, the absolute difference between 2 and 1 is 1, which is not greater than or equal to 2.
Therefore, the code will print 'Brown'.
<<<Output>>>
Brown
