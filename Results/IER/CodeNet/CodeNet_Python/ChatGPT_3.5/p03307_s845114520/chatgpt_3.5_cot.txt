<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input N.
It then checks if N is divisible by 2 (i.e., N%2 == 0).
If N is divisible by 2, it prints the value of N.
If N is not divisible by 2, it prints the value of 2*N.
In this case, the input is 3, which is not divisible by 2.
Therefore, the code will print 2*N, which is 2*3 = 6.
<<<Output>>>
6
