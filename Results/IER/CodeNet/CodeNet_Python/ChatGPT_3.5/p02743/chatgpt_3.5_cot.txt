<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input and assigns them to variables a, b, and c.
It then checks if the expression c-a-b is less than 0. If it is, it prints 'No'.
Otherwise, it checks if the expression 4*a*b is less than the square of (c-a-b). If it is, it prints 'Yes'. Otherwise, it prints 'No'.
In this case, a=2, b=3, and c=9.
The expression c-a-b evaluates to 4, which is not less than 0.
The expression 4*a*b evaluates to 24.
The square of (c-a-b) is 16.
Since 24 is not less than 16, the code will print 'No'.
<<<Output>>>
No
