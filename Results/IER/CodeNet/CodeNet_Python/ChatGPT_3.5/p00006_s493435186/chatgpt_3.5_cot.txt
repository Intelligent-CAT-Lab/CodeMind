<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string from the input and stores it in the variable "line".
Then, it uses the slicing operator [::-1] to reverse the string.
Finally, it prints the reversed string.
In this case, the input string is "w32nimda", so the reversed string would be "admin23w".
<<<Output>>>
admin23w
