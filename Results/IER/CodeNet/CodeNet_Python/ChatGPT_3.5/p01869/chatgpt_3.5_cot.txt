<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by importing the bisect and sys modules and setting the recursion limit to 10000.
Then, an empty list 'a' is created.
Next, a function 'f' is defined. This function takes three parameters: 'a', 'bin', and 'n'.
Inside the function, there are two recursive calls to 'f'. The first call appends 'bin' to the list 'a' and then calls 'f' again with 'bin' multiplied by 10 and added with 2. The second call does the same but with 'bin' multiplied by 10 and added with 8.
After the recursive calls, the function 'g' is defined. This function takes two parameters: 'n' and 'p'.
Inside the function, there is a variable 'm' initialized to -1 shifted left by 20 bits.
Then, the function checks if 'n' is present in the list 'a'. If it is, 'm' is set to 1.
Next, the function checks if the square of the element at index 'p' in 'a' is greater than 'n'. If it is, the function returns 'm'.
If 'n' is divisible by the element at index 'p' in 'a', the function recursively calls 'g' with 'n' divided by the element at index 'p' in 'a' and 'p' incremented by 1. The result is stored in 'm'.
Finally, the function returns the maximum value between 'm' and the result of recursively calling 'g' with 'n' and 'p' incremented by 1.
After the function definitions, the code reads an integer 'n' from input.
If 'n' is odd, the code prints -1 and exits.
The function 'f' is called with the empty list 'a', 0, and 'n' as arguments.
The list 'a' is sorted.
The function 'g' is called with 'n' and 0 as arguments, and the result is stored in 'b'.
If 'b' is less than 0, 'b' is set to -1.
Finally, the code prints the value of 'b'.
