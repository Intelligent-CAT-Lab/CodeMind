<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes input as a string and splits it into a list of strings using the split() function. The list of strings is then converted into a list of integers using the map() function and the int() function. The resulting list of integers is converted into a set using the set() function. Finally, the length of the set is calculated using the len() function and printed.

In this case, the input "3 1 4" will be split into the list ['3', '1', '4']. The map() function will convert each string element into an integer, resulting in the list [3, 1, 4]. The set() function will remove any duplicate elements, resulting in the set {1, 3, 4}. The len() function will calculate the length of the set, which is 3. Therefore, the output will be 3.
