<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs, N and C, and assigns them to the variables N and C, respectively.
The code then checks if C is equal to 100. If it is, it prints the result of 100 raised to the power of N, multiplied by 101.
If C is not equal to 100, it prints the result of 100 raised to the power of N, multiplied by C.
In this case, the value of N is 0 and the value of C is 5.
Since C is not equal to 100, the code will execute the else block and print the result of 100 raised to the power of 0, multiplied by 5.
Any number raised to the power of 0 is 1, so the result will be 1 multiplied by 5, which is 5.
<<<Output>>>
5
