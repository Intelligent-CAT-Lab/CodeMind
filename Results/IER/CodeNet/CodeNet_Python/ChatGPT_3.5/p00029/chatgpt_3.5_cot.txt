<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string and splits it into a list of words using the split() function.
Then, it uses the max() function with the key parameter set to a.count to find the word with the highest frequency in the list.
Next, it uses the max() function again with the key parameter set to len to find the longest word in the list.
Finally, it prints the word with the highest frequency and the longest word, separated by a space.
In this case, the input string is "Thank you for your mail and your lectures".
The list of words would be ['Thank', 'you', 'for', 'your', 'mail', 'and', 'your', 'lectures'].
The word with the highest frequency is 'your' because it appears twice in the list.
The longest word is 'lectures' because it has the most characters.
Therefore, the output would be "your lectures".
<<<Output>>>
your lectures
