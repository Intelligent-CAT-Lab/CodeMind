<<<Analysis>>>
The code imports the gcd function from the fractions module and initializes the variable MOD to 10^9 + 7.
The code then takes three inputs: H, W, and T.
It calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of H and T and stores it in the variable ga.
It calculates the gcd of W and T and stores it in the variable gb.
It divides H by ga and W by gb.
The code then calculates the value of ans using the following formula:
ans = (2^H + 2^W - 1 + 2^gcd(H, W) - 2) % MOD
Finally, it prints the value of ans raised to the power of ga*gb modulo MOD.
In this case, H = 2, W = 2, and T = 1.
The gcd of 2 and 1 is 1, so ga = 1.
The gcd of 2 and 1 is also 1, so gb = 1.
H is divided by ga, so H remains 2.
W is divided by gb, so W remains 2.
ans is calculated as (2^2 + 2^2 - 1 + 2^1 - 2) % MOD.
This simplifies to (4 + 4 - 1 + 2 - 2) % MOD.
The final value of ans is 7 % MOD.
Finally, the code prints the value of ans raised to the power of ga*gb modulo MOD.
Since ga*gb is 1*1 = 1, ans^ga*gb is equal to ans.
Therefore, the output of the code is 7 % MOD, which is 7.
