<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines three functions: gcd, lcm, and factorization.
The gcd function calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.
The lcm function calculates the least common multiple of two numbers using the gcd function.
The factorization function calculates the prime factorization of a number.
The code then takes two integers, n and m, as input.
It calculates the gcd of n and m using the gcd function and stores it in the variable g.
If g is equal to 1, it means that n and m are coprime, so it prints 1.
Otherwise, it calculates the prime factorization of g using the factorization function and stores it in the variable arr.
It then prints the length of arr plus 1, which represents the number of distinct prime factors of g plus 1.
In this case, n is 12 and m is 18.
The gcd of 12 and 18 is 6.
The prime factorization of 6 is [[2, 1], [3, 1]].
So the code will print 3.
