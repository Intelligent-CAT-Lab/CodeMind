<<<Analysis>>>
The variable A is initialized to 30 and variable B is initialized to 100.
The code then checks the value of A using if-elif-else statements.
Since A is greater than 5, the first condition is not met.
The second condition is also not met because A is not between 6 and 12.
Therefore, the code executes the else block and prints the value of B, which is 100.
<<<Output>>>
100
