<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input and assigns them to variables a and b.
Then it calculates the product of a and b, and divides it by 3.305785.
The result is stored in the variable x.
Finally, it prints the value of x with 6 decimal places.
In this case, the input is "15 25", so a is 15 and b is 25.
The product of 15 and 25 is 375.
Dividing 375 by 3.305785 gives approximately 113.634.
The code then prints the value of x as "113.634000".
<<<Output>>>
113.634000
