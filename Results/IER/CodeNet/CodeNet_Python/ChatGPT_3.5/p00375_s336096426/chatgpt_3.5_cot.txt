<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input F and assigns it to the variable F.
Then it calculates the value of a by subtracting 30 from F and dividing the result by 2.
Finally, it prints the value of a.
In this case, the input is 68.
So, the value of a would be (68 - 30) / 2 = 19.
<<<Output>>>
19
