<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized to 11.
The code then enters a nested loop. The outer loop iterates from 0 to 24, and the inner loop iterates from 0 to 19.
For each combination of i and j, the code checks if the equation 4*i + 7*j is equal to N.
If the equation is true, it means that there exists a combination of i and j that satisfies the equation, and the code prints 'Yes' and exits the program.
If the equation is not true for any combination of i and j, the code continues to the next iteration of the outer loop.
After all iterations of the nested loop, if no combination of i and j satisfies the equation, the code prints 'No'.
In this case, the equation 4*i + 7*j is not true for any combination of i and j, so the code will print 'No'.
<<<Output>>>
No
