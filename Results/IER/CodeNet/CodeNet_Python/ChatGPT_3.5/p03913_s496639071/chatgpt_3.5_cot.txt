<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called main() which takes no arguments.
Inside the main() function, it reads two integers N and A from input and assigns them to variables N and A, respectively.
The variable ans is initialized to positive infinity.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 40 (inclusive), using the variable i as the loop variable.
Inside the loop, it calculates the value of x as the integer part of the N-th root of N, where N is raised to the power of 1/(i+1).
The variable k is initialized to 0.
The code then enters a while loop that continues as long as the product of x raised to the power of (i+1-k) and (x+1) raised to the power of k is less than N.
Inside the while loop, it increments the value of k by 1.
After the while loop finishes, it calculates the value of y as x multiplied by (i+1-k), added to (x+1) multiplied by k, and added to A multiplied by i.
The code then updates the value of ans to be the minimum of its current value and y.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of ans.

In this case, N is 8 and A is 1.
The code enters the loop and calculates x as 2, because 2 raised to the power of 3 is 8.
Inside the while loop, it increments k to 1, because 2 raised to the power of 2 multiplied by 3 is 12, which is greater than 8.
After the while loop finishes, it calculates y as 2 multiplied by (3-1) plus 3 multiplied by 1 plus 1 multiplied by 2, which is 10.
The code updates ans to be the minimum of its current value (positive infinity) and y, which is 10.
The loop continues for the remaining values of i, but the value of ans remains 10.
Finally, the code prints the value of ans, which is 10.

<<<Output>>>
