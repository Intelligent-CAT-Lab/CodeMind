<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string S, which is initialized to "QWERTYASDFZXCV".
The code then defines a function AtoZ that takes a string s as input.
Inside the function, there are two loops. The first loop iterates over the characters of the string from the front, and the second loop iterates over the characters of the string from the back.
In the first loop, it checks if the current character is "A". If it is, it breaks out of the loop and stores the index of the current character in the variable front.
In the second loop, it checks if the current character is "Z". If it is, it breaks out of the loop and stores the index of the current character in the variable back.
After the loops, it calculates the length of the substring between the first occurrence of "A" and the last occurrence of "Z" (inclusive) by subtracting the index of the first occurrence from the index of the last occurrence and adding 1. This value is stored in the variable ans.
Finally, the code calls the AtoZ function with the input string S and stores the result in the variable ans. It then prints the value of ans, which is the length of the substring between the first occurrence of "A" and the last occurrence of "Z" in the input string S.
