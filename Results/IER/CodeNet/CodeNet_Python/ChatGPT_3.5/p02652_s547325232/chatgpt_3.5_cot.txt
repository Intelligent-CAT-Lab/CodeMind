<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string S.
It initializes several variables: max0, max1, amax0, amax1, mi0, mi1, h0, and h1.
Then it enters a loop that iterates over each character c in the input string S.
Inside the loop, it checks the value of c.
If c is "1", it increments h1 by 1 and checks if h1-mi1 is greater than max1. If it is, it updates max1 and amax1 accordingly. It also decrements h0 by 1 and checks if h0 is less than mi0. If it is, it updates mi0.
If c is "0", it decrements h1 by 1 and checks if h1 is less than mi1. If it is, it updates mi1. It also increments h0 by 1 and checks if h0-mi0 is greater than max0. If it is, it updates max0 and amax0 accordingly. It also checks if h0-mi0 is equal to max0. If it is, it appends the current index i to amax0.
If c is neither "0" nor "1", it decrements both h1 and h0 by 1 and checks if h1 is less than mi1. If it is, it updates mi1. It also checks if h0 is less than mi0. If it is, it updates mi0.
After the loop finishes, the code checks the values of max0 and max1. If max0 is less than max1, it checks if the set of remainders when dividing each index in amax1 by 2 has length 1. If it does, it prints max1. Otherwise, it prints max1+1.
If max0 is greater than max1, it checks if the set of remainders when dividing each index in amax0 by 2 has length 1. If it does, it prints max0. Otherwise, it prints max0+1.
If max0 is equal to max1, it checks if the set of remainders when dividing each index in amax1 by 2 concatenated with the set of remainders when dividing each index in amax0 by 2 has length 1. If it does, it prints max0. Otherwise, it prints max0+1.
