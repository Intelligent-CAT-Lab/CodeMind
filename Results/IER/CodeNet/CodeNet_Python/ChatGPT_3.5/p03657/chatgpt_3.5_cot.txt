<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers a and b as input.
It then checks if a is divisible by 3. If it is, it prints 'Possible'.
If a is not divisible by 3, it checks if b is divisible by 3. If it is, it prints 'Possible'.
If neither a nor b is divisible by 3, it checks if the sum of a and b is divisible by 3. If it is, it prints 'Possible'.
If none of the conditions are met, it prints 'Impossible'.
In this case, a is 4 and b is 5. Neither a nor b is divisible by 3, and the sum of a and b is 9, which is divisible by 3. Therefore, the output would be 'Possible'.
