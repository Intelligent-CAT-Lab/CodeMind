<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized to 25.
A 2D list called num is created with dimensions 10x10, filled with zeros.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 25.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i modulo 10 is greater than 0. If it is, it means that the last digit of i is not 0, so it increments the value at the corresponding position in the num list.
After the loop finishes, the code initializes a variable c to 0.
Then, it enters two nested loops that iterate from 1 to 9 (inclusive). These loops are used to calculate the product of the values in the num list at the corresponding positions, and add it to c.
Finally, the code prints the value of c, which is the final result.
