<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes input in the form of two integers A and B, separated by a space.
It then calculates the sum of A and B, and takes the modulo 24 of the result.
Finally, it prints the result.
In this case, A is 9 and B is 12.
The sum of A and B is 21, and the modulo 24 of 21 is 21.
Therefore, the output of the code would be 21.
