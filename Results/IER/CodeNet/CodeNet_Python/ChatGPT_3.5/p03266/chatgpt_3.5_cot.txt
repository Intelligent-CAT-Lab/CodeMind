<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by importing the sys module and the gcd function from the fractions module.
Then, it defines a main function that takes no arguments.
Inside the main function, it reads two integers n and k from input and assigns them to variables n and k, respectively.
The variable ans is initialized to 0.
The code then checks if k is odd (k % 2 == 1). If it is, it calculates ans as (n // k) raised to the power of 3.
If k is even, it calculates ans as (n // k) raised to the power of 3 plus ((n + k // 2) // k) raised to the power of 3.
Finally, it prints the value of ans.
In this case, n is 3 and k is 2.
Since k is even, the code calculates ans as (3 // 2) raised to the power of 3 plus ((3 + 2 // 2) // 2) raised to the power of 3.
This simplifies to 1 raised to the power of 3 plus (4 // 2) raised to the power of 3.
Therefore, ans is 1 + 2 raised to the power of 3, which is 1 + 8 = 9.
