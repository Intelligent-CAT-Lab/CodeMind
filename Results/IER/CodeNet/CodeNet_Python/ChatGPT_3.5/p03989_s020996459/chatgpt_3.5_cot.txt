<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by importing various modules and setting some constants.
Then it reads two integers n and k from the input.
Next, it initializes a list called fac with the factorial values of numbers from 0 to n.
After that, it initializes a 2D list called dp with zeros.
Then it sets dp[0][0] to 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to min(n,2*k).
Inside this loop, it updates the values of dp based on the current index i.
After the loop, it calculates the value of ans using the values in dp and fac.
Finally, it prints the value of ans.
