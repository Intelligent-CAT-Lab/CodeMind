<<<Analysis>>>
The variable S is initialized to 3.
Variables X1 and Y1 are initialized to 0.
The code calculates the square root of S and stores it in the variable tmp.
If the square of tmp is greater than or equal to S, X2 and Y3 are set to tmp. Otherwise, they are set to tmp+1.
The code then calculates the difference between X2^2 and S and stores it in the variable rest.
If rest is equal to 0, X3 and Y2 are set to 0. Otherwise, the code checks if rest is less than 10^9. If it is, X3 is set to 1 and Y2 is set to rest. Otherwise, the code enters a loop that iterates from 2 to the square root of rest plus 2. If rest is divisible by i, X3 is set to i and Y2 is set to rest divided by i.
Finally, the code prints the values of X1, Y1, X2, Y2, X3, and Y3.
