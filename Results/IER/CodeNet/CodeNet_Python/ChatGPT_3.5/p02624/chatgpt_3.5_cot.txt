<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a class DSumOfDivisors with a method solve. Inside the solve method, there is a commented out function divCount that calculates the number of divisors for a given number. This function is not used in the code.

The code then reads an integer n from the input.

The code then calculates the sum of a series using a generator expression and the sum function. The generator expression iterates over the range from 1 to n+1, and for each number k, it calculates k/2 * int(n/k) * int(1 + n/k). This expression calculates the sum of divisors for each number from 1 to n. The sum function then adds up all these values and returns the result.

Finally, the result is printed.
