<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called solve, which takes three parameters: a, b, and n.
Inside the solve function, there is a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive) and assigns the quotient and remainder of dividing b by l to the variables d and m, respectively.
If m is 0 (meaning b is divisible by l), the code enters another loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive) and calculates the absolute difference between k * d and a, where k is the loop variable.
The code keeps track of the minimum value of this difference in the variable x.
After the loops finish, the solve function returns the value of x.
In the main function, the code reads three integers from input and assigns them to the variables a, b, and n.
Then, it calls the solve function with these values and prints the result.
