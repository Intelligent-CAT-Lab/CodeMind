The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 5, 1 and 3, respectively.
The variable MOD is initialized to 998244353.
The code then checks if B is equal to 0. If it is, it prints 1 and exits the program.
Since B is not equal to 0 in this case, the code continues to execute.
The variable f is initialized to 1, and the list F is initialized with all elements set to 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive). For each iteration, it calculates the factorial of the current number i and stores it in F[i]. It also updates the value of f by multiplying it with i and taking the modulo MOD.
The variable FI is initialized with all elements set to 1, except for FI[N] which is set to the modular inverse of f raised to the power of MOD - 2.
The code then enters another loop that iterates from N to 1 (inclusive). For each iteration, it calculates the modular inverse of the current number i and stores it in FI[i - 1]. It also updates the value of fi by multiplying it with i and taking the modulo MOD.
The variable z is initialized to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to the minimum of A + 1 and N - B (inclusive) if N - B - A is true, otherwise it iterates from 0 to A + 1 (inclusive). For each iteration, it calculates the values of x and y using the formulas provided. It then updates the value of z by adding the product of x and y, modulo MOD.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of z.
