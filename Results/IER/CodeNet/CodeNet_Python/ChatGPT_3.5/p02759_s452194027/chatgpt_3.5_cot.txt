<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input and assigns it to the variable n.
Then it calculates (n+1)//2, which means it adds 1 to n and then divides the result by 2 using integer division.
Integer division returns the quotient without the remainder.
In this case, if n is 5, then (5+1)//2 = 6//2 = 3.
So the output of the code would be 3.
