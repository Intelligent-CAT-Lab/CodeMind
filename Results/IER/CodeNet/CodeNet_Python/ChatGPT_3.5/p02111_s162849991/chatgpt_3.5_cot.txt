<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input and assigns it to the variable s.
Then it prints two values: s // 30 and 2 * (s % 30).
s // 30 calculates the integer division of s by 30.
s % 30 calculates the remainder when s is divided by 30.
The code then prints these two values separated by a space.
In this case, the input is 0.
So, s // 30 will be 0 and 2 * (s % 30) will also be 0.
<<<Output>>>
0 0
