<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input n.
It then calculates m as 2 raised to the power of n.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to m-1.
For each iteration, it initializes a list temp of size n with all elements as 0.
It then assigns the value of i to j and initializes count as 0.
The code enters a while loop that continues until j becomes 0.
Inside the while loop, it checks if j%2 is equal to 1. If it is, it assigns 1 to the count-th element of temp.
It then divides j by 2 and increments count by 1.
After the while loop, the code initializes an empty list temp2.
It enters a for loop that iterates from 0 to n-1.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the k-th element of temp is equal to 1. If it is, it appends k to temp2.
Finally, the code prints the value of i, followed by a colon.
If i is not equal to 0, it prints a space and then prints the elements of temp2 separated by a space.
If i is equal to 0, it prints a newline character.
The code repeats this process for all values of i in the range 0 to m-1.
