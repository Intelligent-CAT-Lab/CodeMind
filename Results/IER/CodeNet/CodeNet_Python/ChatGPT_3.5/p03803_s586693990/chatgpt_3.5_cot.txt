<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by defining several utility functions and then defines the main function.
In the main function, it takes two integers A and B as input.
If A is equal to 1, it sets A to 14. Similarly, if B is equal to 1, it sets B to 14.
Then it compares A and B. If A is greater than B, it prints "Alice". If B is greater than A, it prints "Bob". Otherwise, it prints "Draw".
In this case, A is 8 and B is 6. Since A is greater than B, the output will be "Alice".
<<<Output>>>
Alice
