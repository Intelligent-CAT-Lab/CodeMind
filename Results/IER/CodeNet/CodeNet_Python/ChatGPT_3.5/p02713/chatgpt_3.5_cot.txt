<<<Analysis>>>
The variable K is initialized to 2.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of gcd values.
The code then enters three nested loops, each iterating from 1 to K (inclusive), meaning it will consider all combinations of three numbers from 1 to 2.
For each combination of numbers (a, b, c), it calculates the gcd of a, b, and c using the gcd function from the math module, and adds it to ans.
The code continues to iterate through all possible combinations of numbers, calculating and adding gcd values to ans.
After the loops finish, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 9.
<<<Output>>>
9
