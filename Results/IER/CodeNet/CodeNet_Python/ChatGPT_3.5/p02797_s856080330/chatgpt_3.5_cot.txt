<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by reading three integers N, K, and S from the input. In this case, N=4, K=2, and S=3.
Then, it checks if S is equal to 10^9. Since S=3, this condition is not met.
Next, it creates a list called ans. The first K elements of ans are set to S, and the remaining N-K elements are set to 10^9.
In this case, K=2, so the first two elements of ans are set to 3, and the remaining two elements are set to 10^9.
Finally, the code prints the elements of ans separated by a space.
<<<Output>>>
