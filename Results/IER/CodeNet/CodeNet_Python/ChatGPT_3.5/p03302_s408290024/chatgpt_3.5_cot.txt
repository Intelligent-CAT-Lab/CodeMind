<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes input in the form of a string and splits it into a list of two elements, ['4', '11'].
Then, it converts the first element of the list, '4', into an integer and assigns it to variable a.
Similarly, it converts the second element of the list, '11', into an integer and assigns it to variable b.
The code then checks if the sum of a and b is equal to 15. If it is, it prints '+'.
If the sum is not equal to 15, the code checks if the product of a and b is equal to 15. If it is, it prints '*'.
If neither the sum nor the product is equal to 15, the code prints 'x'.
In this case, the sum of 4 and 11 is not equal to 15, and the product is also not equal to 15.
Therefore, the code will print 'x'.
<<<Output>>>
x
