<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three inputs: x, a, and b. It then checks if the absolute difference between x and a is less than the absolute difference between x and b. If it is, it prints 'A', otherwise it prints 'B'.
In this case, x is 5, a is 2, and b is 7. The absolute difference between x and a is 3, and the absolute difference between x and b is 2. Since 2 is less than 3, the code will print 'B'.
<<<Output>>>
B
