<<<Analysis>>>
The variable X, variable Y and variable Z are initialized to 13, 3 and 1, respectively.
The code then calculates the value of isu by subtracting Z from X, which is 12.
It also calculates the value of hito by adding Z to Y, which is 4.
Finally, it prints the integer division of isu by hito, which is 12 // 4 = 3.
<<<Output>>>
