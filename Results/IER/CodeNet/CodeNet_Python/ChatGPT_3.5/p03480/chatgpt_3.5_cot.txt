<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string s from the input.
It then initializes a variable n to the length of s.
The variable res is initialized to infinity.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n-2 (inclusive).
For each iteration, it checks if the current character s[i] is different from the next character s[i+1].
If they are different, it calculates the maximum length of a substring that can be formed by removing either the character at index i or the character at index i+1.
It updates the value of res to be the minimum of the current value of res and the calculated length.
After the loop finishes, it checks if res is still infinity. If it is, it means that there are no different adjacent characters in the string, so it prints the length of the string n. Otherwise, it prints the value of res.
