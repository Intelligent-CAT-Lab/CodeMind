<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string `n` and defines two functions `solve1` and `solve2`.
In `solve1`, the code initializes a variable `ans` to 0 and converts the input string `n` into a list of integers `a` in reverse order.
Then, it appends a 0 to the end of the list `a` and iterates over the elements of `a` using a for loop.
For each element `c` in `a`, it checks if `c` is less than 5. If it is, it adds `c` to `ans`.
If `c` is equal to 5 and the next element in `a` is less than 5, it adds 5 to `ans`.
Otherwise, it increments the next element in `a` by 1 and adds 10 - `c` to `ans`.
Finally, it adds the last element of `n_list` to `ans` and prints the value of `ans`.

In `solve2`, the code initializes a variable `INF` to 10^9 and reverses the input string `n`.
Then, it appends a '0' to the end of `n` and calculates the length of `n` as `n_len`.
It creates a 2D list `dp` of size (n_len+1) x 2, filled with `INF` values.
The first element of `dp` is set to 0.
The code then iterates over the characters of `n` using nested for loops.
For each character `x` in `n`, it adds the current value of `j` to `x` and checks if `x` is less than 10.
If it is, it updates the value of `dp[i+1][0]` to the minimum of its current value and `dp[i][j] + x`.
Similarly, if `x` is greater than 0, it updates the value of `dp[i+1][1]` to the minimum of its current value and `dp[i][j] + (10 - x)`.
Finally, it prints the value of `dp[n_len][0]`.

The code then calls the function `solve2` with the input string `n`.
