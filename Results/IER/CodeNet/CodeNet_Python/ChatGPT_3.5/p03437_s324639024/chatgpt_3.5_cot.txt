<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers X and Y as input.
It checks if X is divisible by Y by using the modulo operator (%). If the remainder is 0, it means X is divisible by Y.
If X is divisible by Y, it prints -1.
Otherwise, it prints the value of X.
In this case, X = 8 and Y = 6. Since 8 is not divisible by 6 (remainder is 2), the code will print 8.
<<<Output>>>
8
