The variable MOD is initialized to 1000000007.
The variables N and M are initialized by taking input from the user.
Two lists, pow and dp, are initialized with size N+1, and all elements are set to 0.
The first element of pow is set to 1.
A loop is started from 1 to N+1. In each iteration, the value of pow[i] is calculated by multiplying pow[i-1] with 2 and taking the modulo with MOD.
The first element of dp is set to 1.
Another loop is started from 1 to M+1. In each iteration, the value of dp[i] is set to pow[i].
The value of dp[M] is decreased by 1.
Another loop is started from M+1 to N+1. In each iteration, the value of dp[i] is calculated by adding dp[i-1] with (dp[i-1] - dp[i-1-M]) and taking the modulo with MOD.
Finally, the code prints the value of (pow[N] - dp[N] + MOD) modulo MOD.
