<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called main(). Inside the function, it takes two integers x and y as input using the input().split() method and stores them in variables x and y respectively.
Then, it initializes two lists a and b with certain values.
The code then checks if either x or y is equal to 2. If either of them is 2, it prints 'No'.
If neither x nor y is equal to 2, it checks if both x and y are in list a or both x and y are in list b. If this condition is true, it prints 'Yes'.
If none of the above conditions are met, it prints 'No'.
Finally, the code calls the main() function.

In this case, the input is '1 3'. So, x is assigned the value 1 and y is assigned the value 3.
Since neither x nor y is equal to 2, the code checks if both x and y are in list a or both x and y are in list b.
In this case, both x and y are in list a. So, the condition is true and it prints 'Yes'.

<<<Output>>>
Yes
