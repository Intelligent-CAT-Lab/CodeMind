<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by importing necessary libraries and setting up some constants and variables.
Then it reads two integers N and M from the input.
Next, it defines several helper functions for calculating factorials, modular inverses, and combinations.
After that, it calculates the factorials and modular inverses using the helper functions.
Then it defines another helper function for calculating combinations using the factorials and modular inverses.
The code then proceeds to calculate the number of sequences that satisfy certain conditions and prints the result.
In this case, the code calculates the number of sequences where the sum is M*3 and the number of odd elements is at most M, and the number of sequences where the maximum element is greater than M*2 and the number of odd elements is at most M.
Finally, it prints the difference between the two numbers modulo MOD.
