<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input and assigns it to the variable D.
Then, it creates a dictionary called d with keys as integers and values as strings.
The keys in the dictionary represent the number of days left until Christmas, and the values represent the corresponding message.
Finally, the code prints the value in the dictionary that corresponds to the key D.
In this case, since D is 25, the code will print "Christmas".
<<<Output>>>
Christmas
