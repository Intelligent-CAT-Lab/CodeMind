<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string and initializes a flag variable to True.
It then enters a loop that iterates over each character in the input string, along with its index.
For each character, it checks if the index + 1 is divisible by 2. If it is, it checks if the character is either "L", "U", or "D". If it is not, it sets the flag variable to False.
If the index + 1 is not divisible by 2, it checks if the character is either "R", "U", or "D". If it is not, it sets the flag variable to False.
After the loop finishes, it checks the value of the flag variable. If it is True, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
In this case, the input string is "RUDLUDR". The code goes through each character and checks the conditions. Since all the characters meet the conditions, the flag variable remains True. Therefore, the output will be "Yes".
