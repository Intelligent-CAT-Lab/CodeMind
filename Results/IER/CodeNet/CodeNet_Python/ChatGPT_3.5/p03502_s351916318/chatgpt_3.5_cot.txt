<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input N, which is a string.
It then calculates the sum of the digits in N using the map function and the int function.
The code checks if N is divisible by the sum of its digits (sum_Ndig) using the modulo operator (%).
If the condition is true, it prints 'Yes', otherwise it prints 'No'.
In this case, the input is '12', so the sum of the digits is 1 + 2 = 3.
Since 12 is not divisible by 3, the output will be 'No'.
<<<Output>>>
No
