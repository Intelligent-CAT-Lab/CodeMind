<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N and variable M are initialized to 2 and 1, respectively.
The variable count is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the count of pairs.
The code then checks if N is not equal to 0. If it is not, it calculates the count of pairs using the formula N * (N - 1) // 2 and adds it to count.
The code then checks if M is not equal to 0. If it is not, it calculates the count of pairs using the formula M * (M - 1) // 2 and adds it to count.
After the if statements, the code prints the final value of count, which is 1.
