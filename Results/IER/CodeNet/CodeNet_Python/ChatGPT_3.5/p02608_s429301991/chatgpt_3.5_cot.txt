<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by taking an integer input n.
Then, it initializes a list A with size 10^6, where each element is set to 0.
Next, it enters three nested loops, each ranging from 1 to 10^2 (inclusive).
Inside these loops, it calculates the value of i using the given formula and uses it as an index to increment the corresponding element in the list A.
After the loops finish, the code enters another loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive).
In this loop, it prints the value of each element in the list A.
Since n is given as 20, the code will print the values of A[1] to A[20].
