<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string and assigns it to the variable n.
Then it uses the count() method to count the number of occurrences of the digit "2" in the string n.
Finally, it prints the count.
In this case, the input string is "1222", and the count of "2" in the string is 3.
<<<Output>>>
3
