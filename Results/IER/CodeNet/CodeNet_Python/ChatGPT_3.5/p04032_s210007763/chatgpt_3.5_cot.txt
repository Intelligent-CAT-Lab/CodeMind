<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string and stores it in the variable s.
It then calculates the length of the string and stores it in the variable n.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n-2 (inclusive), meaning it will consider pairs of adjacent characters in the string.
For each pair of adjacent characters, the code checks if they are equal. If they are, it prints the indices of the characters (i+1 and i+2) and exits the program.
If no adjacent characters are equal, the code enters another loop that iterates from 0 to n-3 (inclusive), meaning it will consider pairs of characters that have one character in between them.
For each pair of characters with one character in between, the code checks if they are equal. If they are, it prints the indices of the characters (i+1 and i+3) and exits the program.
If no pairs of adjacent or pairs of characters with one character in between are equal, the code prints -1 -1.
In this case, the input string is "needed". The first loop does not find any adjacent characters that are equal, so it continues to the second loop. The second loop also does not find any pairs of characters with one character in between that are equal. Therefore, the code prints -1 -1.
<<<Output>>>
-1 -1
