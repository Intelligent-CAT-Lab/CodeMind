<<<Analysis>>>
The code first reads two integers N and K from the input.
Then it creates three lists: C, A, and B.
C is a list of integers ranging from K+2*N to K+3*N.
A is a list of integers ranging from K to K+N.
B is a list of integers ranging from K+N to K+2*N.
Next, it initializes an empty list called Ans and a variable called ans to 1.
Then it creates an instance of the PMS class with B as the input.
The code checks if the sum of A and B is greater than the sum of C. If it is, it sets ans to -1.
Otherwise, it creates two lists: Ao and Ae.
Ao contains the odd elements from A, and Ae contains the even elements from A.
If the length of Ao is less than the length of Ae, it concatenates Ae and Ao to create a new list called AA.
Otherwise, it concatenates Ao and Ae to create AA.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over pairs of elements from AA and C.
For each pair (a, c), it calculates bx as c - a.
Then it uses the leq method of the BB instance to find the largest element in B that is less than or equal to bx.
If no such element exists (k == 0), it sets ans to -1 and breaks out of the loop.
Otherwise, it retrieves the element b from B using the get method of the BB instance with k as the argument.
It appends the tuple (a, b, c) to the Ans list and removes b from B using the add method of the BB instance with -1 as the second argument.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if ans is not equal to -1.
If it is not, it prints each tuple in Ans in the format "a b c" separated by newlines.
Otherwise, it prints ans.
