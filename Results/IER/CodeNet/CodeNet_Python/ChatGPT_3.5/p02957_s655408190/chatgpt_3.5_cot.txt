<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers A and B as input.
It then checks if the sum of A and B is divisible by 2. If it is, it calculates the average of A and B by dividing their sum by 2 and prints the result as an integer.
If the sum of A and B is not divisible by 2, it prints 'IMPOSSIBLE'.
In this case, A=2 and B=16. The sum of A and B is 18, which is divisible by 2. So, the code will calculate the average of A and B as 18/2 = 9 and print it as an integer.
<<<Output>>>
9
