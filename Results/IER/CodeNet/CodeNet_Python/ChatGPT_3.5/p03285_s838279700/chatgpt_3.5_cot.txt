<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input and assigns it to the variable n.
It initializes the variable cnt to 0, which will be used to count the number of combinations of k and j that satisfy the condition 4*k + 7*j = n.
The code then enters a nested loop that iterates over all possible values of k and j, both ranging from 0 to n-1.
For each combination of k and j, it checks if the equation 4*k + 7*j equals n. If it does, it increments the value of cnt by 1.
After the loops finish, the code checks two conditions:
1. If n is less than 4 or cnt is equal to 0, it prints "No".
2. Otherwise, it prints "Yes".
In this case, n is 11. The code will iterate over all possible combinations of k and j and check if 4*k + 7*j equals 11. If there is at least one combination that satisfies the equation, cnt will be greater than 0 and the code will print "Yes". Otherwise, it will print "No".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
