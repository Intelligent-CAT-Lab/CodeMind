<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function `e_cell_distance` that takes three arguments: N, M, and K. It also defines a nested class `Combination` that is used to calculate combinations.

Inside the function, it creates an instance of the `Combination` class with the maximum value of N * M. It then calculates the combination of (N * M - 2) choose (K - 2) using the `combination` method of the `Combination` class.

Next, it calculates the values of t1 and t2 using list comprehensions. These values are calculated by iterating over the range from 1 to M (for t1) and from 1 to N (for t2), and performing some calculations involving d, M, N, and the square of N or M.

Finally, it calculates the value of t as the sum of t1 and t2 modulo MOD. It then returns the product of comb and t modulo MOD.

In the main part of the code, it reads three integers N, M, and K from input and passes them as arguments to the `e_cell_distance` function. It then prints the result.
