<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input and assigns them to variables a and b.
It then calculates the product of (a-1) and (b-1) and prints the result.
In this case, the input is "2 2", so a is assigned the value 2 and b is assigned the value 2.
The code then calculates (2-1) * (2-1) which is equal to 1 * 1 = 1.
Finally, it prints the value 1.
