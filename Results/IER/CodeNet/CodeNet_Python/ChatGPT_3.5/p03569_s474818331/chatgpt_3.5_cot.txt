<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string and stores it in the variable s. It then calculates the length of the string and stores it in the variable n.
The code initializes the variable ans to 0, which will be used to count the number of operations needed to make the string symmetric.
The code also initializes two pointers, l and r, to the start and end of the string respectively.
The code enters a while loop that continues until l is less than r. This loop checks if the characters at positions l and r are "x". If they are, it checks if both characters are "x". If they are, it increments l by 1 and decrements r by 1. If only one of the characters is "x", it increments ans by 1 and increments l or decrements r accordingly. If neither of the characters is "x", it prints -1 and exits the program.
If the characters at positions l and r are not "x", the code checks if they are equal. If they are, it increments l by 1 and decrements r by 1. If they are not equal, it prints -1 and exits the program.
After the while loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which represents the number of operations needed to make the string symmetric.
In this case, the string "xabxa" can be made symmetric by replacing the first and last characters with "x". Therefore, the final value of ans is 2.
