<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three inputs a, b, and c as strings and splits them using the split() function.
It then checks if the last character of a is equal to the first character of b, and if the last character of b is equal to the first character of c.
In this case, the last character of a is 'a', the first character of b is 'g', and the last character of b is 'a'.
Since 'a' is equal to 'a' and 'a' is equal to 'a', the condition is satisfied and the code prints "YES".
<<<Output>>>
YES
