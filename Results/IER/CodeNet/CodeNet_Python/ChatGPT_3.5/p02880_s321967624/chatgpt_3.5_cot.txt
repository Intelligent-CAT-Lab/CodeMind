<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input and assigns it to the variable n.
Then, it enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 9 (inclusive).
Inside the loop, it checks if n is divisible by i and if the result of the division is less than 10.
If both conditions are true, it prints "Yes" and exits the program.
If the loop finishes without finding a number that satisfies the conditions, it prints "No".
In this case, the input is 10.
The loop will iterate through the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.
For each iteration, it checks if 10 is divisible by the current number and if the result is less than 10.
The condition is met when i is 1, as 10 is divisible by 1 and the result is less than 10.
Therefore, the code will print "Yes" and exit.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
