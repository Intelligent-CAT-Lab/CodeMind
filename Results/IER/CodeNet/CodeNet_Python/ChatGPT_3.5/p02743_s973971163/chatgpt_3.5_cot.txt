<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input and assigns them to variables a, b, and c.
It then checks if the expression c-a-b is greater than 0 and if the expression (c-a-b)**2-4*a*b is greater than 0.
If both conditions are true, it prints 'Yes'. Otherwise, it prints 'No'.
In this case, the values of a, b, and c are 2, 3, and 9 respectively.
The expression c-a-b evaluates to 4, and the expression (c-a-b)**2-4*a*b evaluates to 4.
Since both expressions are greater than 0, the code will print 'Yes'.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
