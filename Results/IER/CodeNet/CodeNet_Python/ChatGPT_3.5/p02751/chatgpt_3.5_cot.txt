<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers n and m as input.
It initializes a 2D list called ans with dimensions (2^n-1) x (2^m-1), where each element is initialized to "1".
Then, it enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 10.
Inside this loop, there are two nested loops. The first nested loop iterates from 2^k to 2^n with a step size of 2^k, and the second nested loop iterates from 2^k to 2^m with a step size of 2^k.
For each iteration of the nested loops, it checks if the element at position (i-1, j-1) in the ans list is "1". If it is, it changes it to "0", and if it is "0", it changes it to "1".
After the loop finishes, it prints each row of the ans list, joining the elements with an empty string.
In this case, since n=1 and m=2, the ans list will have dimensions (2^1-1) x (2^2-1) = 1 x 3.
The initial value of ans is [["1", "1", "1"]].
The loop iterates from 1 to 10, but since n=1, the nested loops are not executed.
Finally, it prints the only row of the ans list, which is "111".
