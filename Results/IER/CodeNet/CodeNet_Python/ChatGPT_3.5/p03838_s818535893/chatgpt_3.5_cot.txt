<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers x and y as input.
It then enters a series of if-elif-else statements to determine the value of the variable ans.
The first if statement checks if y is equal to 0. If it is, it checks if x is less than or equal to 0. If it is, it sets ans to -x. Otherwise, it sets ans to x + 1.
The next elif statement checks if y is greater than 0. If it is, it checks three conditions:
- If x is less than or equal to -y, it sets ans to -y - x + 1.
- If -y < x < 0, it sets ans to x + y + 1.
- If 0 <= x <= y, it sets ans to y - x.
- If none of the above conditions are met, it sets ans to x - y + 2.
The final else statement checks if y is less than 0. If it is, it checks three conditions:
- If x is less than or equal to y, it sets ans to y - x.
- If y < x < 0, it sets ans to -y + x + 2.
- If 0 <= x <= -y, it sets ans to -y - x + 1.
- If none of the above conditions are met, it sets ans to y + x + 1.
Finally, the code prints the value of ans.
In this case, x = 10 and y = 20. Since y is greater than 0, the condition 0 <= x <= y is met, so ans is set to y - x, which is 20 - 10 = 10.
<<<Output>>>
