<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function cmb(n, r, mod) that calculates the combination of n choose r modulo mod. It uses pre-calculated tables g1, g2, and inverse to speed up the calculation.

The code then initializes the variables mod, N, g1, g2, and inverse. It also reads the values of N and K from the input.

If K is equal to 1, the code prints 1 and exits.

Otherwise, the code initializes a list dp with zeros of length N+1 and sets dp[N] to 1.

The code then enters a nested loop. The outer loop iterates from N to 0 (inclusive), and the inner loop iterates from i-1 to 0 (inclusive).

Inside the inner loop, the code calculates the value of n using the formula n=(N-(j+1))*(K-1)+N-i. It then calculates the combination using the cmb function and multiplies it by dp[j+1]. The result is added to dp[j].

After the loops finish, the code prints the final result, which is dp[0] multiplied by g1[N] modulo mod.
