<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string and assigns it to the variable s.
The variable ans is initialized to 700.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each character in the string s.
For each character i, it checks if i is equal to 'o'. If it is, it adds 100 to the value of ans.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans.
In this case, the string s is 'oxo'. The loop will iterate three times, and since two of the characters are 'o', the value of ans will be increased by 200.
Therefore, the output will be 900.
<<<Output>>>
900
