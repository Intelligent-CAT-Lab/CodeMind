The variable N, variable X and variable Y are initialized to 5, 2 and 4, respectively.
The code then creates a 2D list S using list comprehension. The list S is a matrix of size N x N, where each element is a list of numbers. The numbers in each row are in descending order from N to i+1, followed by numbers from 0 to N-i-1. This means that the first row of S will be [5, 4, 3, 2, 1], the second row will be [4, 3, 2, 1, 0], and so on.
The code then sets the element at index (X-1, Y-1) and (Y-1, X-1) of S to 1.
Next, there is a nested loop that iterates over each element of S. For each element, it calculates the minimum distance between the current element and the elements at index (X-1, Y-1) and (Y-1, X-1) of S. It updates the current element with this minimum distance plus 1.
After that, the code initializes a list dist of size N with all elements set to 0.
Using the combinations function from the itertools module, the code iterates over all pairs of indices (i, j) where i and j are different. For each pair, it gets the distance between the elements at index (i, j) of S and increments the corresponding element in dist by 1.
Finally, the code prints the elements of dist starting from index 1.
