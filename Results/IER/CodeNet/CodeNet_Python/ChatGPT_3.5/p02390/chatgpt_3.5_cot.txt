<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input and assigns it to the variable ss.
It then calculates the number of hours in ss by dividing ss by 60^2 (3600) and assigns the result to the variable hour.
Next, it calculates the remaining seconds after removing the hours by taking the modulus of ss with 60^2 and assigns the result to the variable second.
Then, it calculates the number of minutes in the remaining seconds by dividing second by 60 and assigns the result to the variable minute.
Finally, it calculates the remaining seconds after removing the minutes by taking the modulus of second with 60 and assigns the result back to the variable second.
The code then prints the values of hour, minute, and second in the format 'hour:minute:second'.

In this case, the input is 46979.
hour = 46979 // 3600 = 13
second = 46979 % 3600 = 2879
minute = 2879 // 60 = 47
second = 2879 % 60 = 59
The output will be '13:47:59'.
<<<Output>>>
13:47:59
