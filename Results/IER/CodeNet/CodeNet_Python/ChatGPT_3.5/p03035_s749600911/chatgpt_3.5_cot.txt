<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers A and B as input.
It then checks the value of A in a series of if-elif-else statements.
If A is greater than or equal to 13, it prints the value of B.
If A is greater than or equal to 6 but less than 13, it prints the integer division of B by 2.
If A is less than 6, it prints 0.
In this case, A is 30, which is greater than 13, so the code will print the value of B, which is 100.
<<<Output>>>
100
