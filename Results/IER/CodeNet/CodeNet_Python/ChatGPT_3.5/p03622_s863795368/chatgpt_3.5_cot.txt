<<<Analysis>>>
The variable M is initialized to 8^7, which is 2097152.
The variable m is initialized to M*476+1, which is 997920769.
The variables f, g, and h are initialized as lists of length M, with all elements set to 1.
The variable i is initialized to 2.
The code then enters a while loop that iterates while i is less than M.
Inside the loop, it calculates the factorial of i modulo m and stores it in f[i].
It also calculates the modular inverse of i modulo m and stores it in h[i].
It calculates the product of g[i-1] and h[i] modulo m and stores it in g[i].
Finally, it increments i by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code initializes the variables a, b, and j to 0, 1, and 1 respectively.
It also reads two integers A and B from input.
If A is less than B, it swaps the values of A and B.
Then, it enters a while loop that iterates while j is less than or equal to B.
Inside the loop, it updates the value of a by adding b multiplied by f[A+B-j] multiplied by g[B-j] modulo m.
It also updates the value of b by multiplying it by 2 modulo m.
Finally, it increments j by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code calculates the final result by multiplying a by f[B] modulo m, adding A to it, and taking the result modulo m.
The final result is then printed.
