<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called "resolve" that takes no arguments.
Inside the function, it reads a string from the input and assigns it to the variable "t".
The code then replaces all occurrences of "?" in the string with "D" and assigns the result to the variable "res".
Finally, it prints the value of "res".
The main block of code calls the "resolve" function.
