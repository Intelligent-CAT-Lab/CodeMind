<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes variable A to 0, and creates two empty lists: left and Lake.
It then takes an input string s.
The code enters a loop that iterates over the characters of s.
If the current character is "\", it appends the index i to the left list.
If the current character is "/", it checks if the left list is not empty.
If it is not empty, it pops the last index w from the left list and calculates the difference between the current index i and w, storing it in goukei.
It then adds goukei to A.
Next, it iterates over the elements of the Lake list in reverse order.
If the first element of the current element is greater than w, it pops the element from the Lake list and adds its second element to goukei.
After the loop, it appends a new element to the Lake list, consisting of w and goukei.
Finally, it prints the value of A.
If the length of the Lake list is 0, it prints 0.
Otherwise, it prints the length of the Lake list, followed by the elements of the Lake list.
