<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string S, which is expected to be in the format "YYYY/MM/DD".
It extracts the year part of the input string by taking the first 4 characters and converts it to an integer, storing it in the variable year.
It also extracts the month part of the input string by taking characters 5 and 6 and converts it to an integer, storing it in the variable month.
The code then checks if the year is less than 2019. If it is, it prints 'Heisei'.
If the year is not less than 2019, it checks if the month is less than 5. If it is, it prints 'Heisei'.
If neither of the conditions is met, it prints 'TBD'.
In this case, the year is 2019 and the month is 4, so the condition for printing 'Heisei' is met.
<<<Output>>>
Heisei
