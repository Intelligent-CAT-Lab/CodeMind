<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called solve(). Inside the function, it reads a string input from the user and assigns it to the variable s.
The code then checks the value of s using if-elif-else statements.
If s is equal to "RRR", it prints 3.
If s is equal to "RRS" or "SRR", it prints 2.
If s does not contain any "R" characters, it prints 0.
Otherwise, it prints 1.
In this case, the input is "RRS", so the code will enter the elif statement and print 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
