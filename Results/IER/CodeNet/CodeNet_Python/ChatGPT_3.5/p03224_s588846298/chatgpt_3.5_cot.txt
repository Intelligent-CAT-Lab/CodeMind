<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input N and creates a list Nlist containing triangular numbers up to 1000.
It then checks if N is in Nlist. If it is not, it prints 'No' and exits the program.
If N is in Nlist, it prints 'Yes' and continues with the rest of the code.
The code finds the index k of N in Nlist and initializes a 2D list S with k rows and varying number of columns.
It populates the first row of S with values from 1 to k-1.
Then, it iterates from 0 to k-2 and populates the remaining rows of S based on the values in the previous row.
Finally, it prints the value of k and the elements of S in a specific format.
<<<Output>>>
