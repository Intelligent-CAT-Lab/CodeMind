<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers n and m as input.
It first checks if both n and m are equal to 1. If they are, it prints 1.
If not, it checks if either n or m is equal to 1. If either of them is 1, it prints the maximum of 0 and the maximum of n and m minus 2.
If neither n nor m is equal to 1, it prints the product of n-2 and m-2.
In this case, n and m are both 2, so the code enters the else block and calculates (2-2) * (2-2), which is 0.
Therefore, the output is 0.
