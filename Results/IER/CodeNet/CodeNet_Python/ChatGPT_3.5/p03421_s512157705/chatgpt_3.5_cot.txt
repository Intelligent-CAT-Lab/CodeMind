<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 5, 3 and 2, respectively.
The code then defines a function called solve(). Inside the function, it checks if the condition A + B - 1 <= N and N <= A * B is true. In this case, the condition is not met because 3 + 2 - 1 = 4 is not less than or equal to 5, and 5 is not less than or equal to 3 * 2 = 6. Therefore, the code executes the else block and returns [-1].
Finally, the code prints the result of solve() by joining the elements of the list with a space separator and converting them to strings.
