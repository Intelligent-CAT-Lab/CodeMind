<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three inputs: N, X, and D. These inputs are used to calculate the output of the code.
The code first checks if D is less than 0. If it is, it negates the values of X and D.
Next, the code checks if D is equal to 0. If it is, it creates a set called Sets and adds the values of i*X for i in the range from 0 to N (inclusive) to the set. It then prints the length of the set and exits the program.
If D is not equal to 0, the code proceeds to the next part.
The code initializes a variable called ans to 0 and creates a defaultdict called Mode.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to N (inclusive). For each iteration, it calculates the values of L and R using the formulas provided. It appends the tuples (L, 1) and (R+1, -1) to the list associated with the key i*X % D in the Mode defaultdict.
After the loop finishes, the code creates an empty list called Data.
The code then iterates over the keys of the Mode defaultdict. For each key, it sorts the list associated with that key. It initializes variables cnt and sums to 1 and the first value of the sorted list, respectively. It then iterates over the remaining values in the sorted list and appends tuples (sums, num, cnt) to the Data list. It updates the values of cnt and sums accordingly.
Next, the code initializes a variable called ans to 0.
The code then iterates over the tuples in the Data list. For each tuple, if the value of v is greater than 0, it adds the difference between r and l to the ans variable.
Finally, the code prints the value of ans.
