<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized to 25.
A 2D list called count is created with dimensions 10x10, filled with zeros.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 25.
For each number i in this range, it converts it to a string and extracts the first and last digits.
The code increments the count of the corresponding element in the count list.
After the loop finishes, the code calculates the answer by summing the product of count[i][j] and count[j][i] for i and j ranging from 1 to 9.
Finally, the code prints the value of ans, which is the final answer.
