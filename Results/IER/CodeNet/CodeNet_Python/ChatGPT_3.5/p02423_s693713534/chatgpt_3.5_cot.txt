<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input and assigns it to the variable n.
The variable m is assigned the value (1<<32)-1, which is a binary number with 32 bits, all set to 1.
The code then prints the binary representation of n using the format specifier "{:032b}". This will print n as a 32-bit binary number with leading zeros.
Next, it prints the binary representation of the bitwise complement of n bitwise ANDed with m. The bitwise complement of n is obtained by flipping all the bits of n. The bitwise AND operation with m ensures that the result has all bits set to 1 except for the leading zeros.
Then, it prints the binary representation of n shifted left by 1 bitwise ANDed with m. The shift left operation moves all the bits of n one position to the left, and the bitwise AND operation with m ensures that the result has all bits set to 1 except for the leading zeros.
Finally, it prints the binary representation of n shifted right by 1. The shift right operation moves all the bits of n one position to the right, and the result is not bitwise ANDed with m.
