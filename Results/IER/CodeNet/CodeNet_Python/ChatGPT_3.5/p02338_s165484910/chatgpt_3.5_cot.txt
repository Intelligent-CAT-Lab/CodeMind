<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines several utility functions and constants, but they are not used in the main function.
The main function reads two integers n and k from input.
If n is greater than k, it prints 0.
Otherwise, it prints 1.
In this case, n is 5 and k is 10, so n is not greater than k. Therefore, the code will print 1.
<<<Output>>>
1
