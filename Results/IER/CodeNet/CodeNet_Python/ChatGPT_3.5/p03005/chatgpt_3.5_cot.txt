<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs, N and K, and assigns them to the variables N and K, respectively.
It then checks if K is equal to 1. If it is, it prints 0.
If K is not equal to 1, it subtracts K from N and prints the result.
In this case, K is 2, so the code will subtract 2 from 3 and print 1.
