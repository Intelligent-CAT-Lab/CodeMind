<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes input as a list of integers and assigns it to the variable n.
It then calculates the number of occurrences of each digit (1, 7, 9, and 4) in the list using the sum() function and a generator expression.
The result of each sum() function is either 0 or 1, depending on whether the digit is present in the list or not.
The code multiplies the results of all four sum() functions together and assigns it to the variable check.
If check is equal to 1, it means that all four digits are present in the list exactly once.
In this case, the code prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".
In the given input "1 7 9 4", all four digits are present exactly once, so the output will be "YES".
<<<Output>>>
YES
