<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string and converts it into a list of characters using the list() function.
It then checks if the character "7" is present in the list. If it is, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".
In this case, the input string is "117", and since it contains the character "7", the output will be "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
