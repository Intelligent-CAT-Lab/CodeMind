<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three inputs: a, b, and n. These inputs are then used to calculate the score.
The score is initially set to the absolute difference between a and b.
The code then enters a nested loop, where x ranges from 1 to n and y ranges from 1 to n.
For each combination of x and y, the code checks if b * x is divisible by y. If it is, it calculates a new value for a by dividing b * x by y.
The code then updates the score to be the minimum value between the current score and the absolute difference between a and the new_a.
After the nested loop finishes, the code prints the final value of the score.
