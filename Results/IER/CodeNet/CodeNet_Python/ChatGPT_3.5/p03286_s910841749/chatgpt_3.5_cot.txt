<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input and assigns it to the variable n.
If n is equal to 0, it prints 0 and exits the program.
Otherwise, it initializes an empty string variable ans.
The code then enters a loop that iterates 50 times.
In each iteration, it checks if n is divisible by 2 raised to the power of (i+1). If it is not, it subtracts (-2) raised to the power of i from n and adds '1' to the beginning of ans. Otherwise, it adds '0' to the beginning of ans.
After each iteration, it checks if n is equal to 0. If it is, it breaks out of the loop.
Finally, it checks if the first character of ans is not '0'. If it is not, it prints ans. Otherwise, it prints ans without the first character.
In this case, the input is -9.
The code enters the loop and in the first iteration, it subtracts (-2)^0 = -1 from n and adds '1' to ans. n becomes -8 and ans becomes '1'.
In the second iteration, it subtracts (-2)^1 = 2 from n and adds '0' to ans. n becomes -10 and ans becomes '01'.
In the third iteration, it subtracts (-2)^2 = -4 from n and adds '1' to ans. n becomes -6 and ans becomes '101'.
In the fourth iteration, it subtracts (-2)^3 = 8 from n and adds '0' to ans. n becomes -14 and ans becomes '0101'.
In the fifth iteration, it subtracts (-2)^4 = -16 from n and adds '1' to ans. n becomes 2 and ans becomes '10101'.
In the sixth iteration, it checks if n is equal to 0. Since it is not, it breaks out of the loop.
Finally, it checks if the first character of ans is not '0'. Since it is not, it prints ans, which is '10101'.
<<<Output>>>
10101
