<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three inputs separated by spaces and assigns them to variables a, b, and c.
Then it prints the values of c, a, and b separated by spaces.
In this case, the input is "1 2 3", so a is assigned the value "1", b is assigned the value "2", and c is assigned the value "3".
The code then prints "3 1 2".
<<<Output>>>
3 1 2
