<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called sort that takes a list A as input.
Inside the function, it first calculates the length of the list and assigns it to the variable N.
Then, it enters a nested loop that iterates over the indices of the list.
In each iteration, it compares the current element A[j] with the next element A[j+1].
If A[j] is smaller than A[j+1], it swaps the two elements using a temporary variable temp.
After the nested loop finishes, the function returns the sorted list A.
Outside the function, the code reads a list of integers from input and assigns it to the variable A.
Then, it calls the sort function with A as the argument, and converts the sorted list to a string using the map function and the str function.
Finally, it joins the elements of the string with a space separator and prints the result.
