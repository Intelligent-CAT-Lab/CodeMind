<<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the necessary libraries and initializes some variables.
Then it reads the input values for N and M.
Next, it initializes two arrays, dp_T and dp_F, with zeros and ones respectively.
The code then enters a loop that iterates M times.
Inside the loop, it updates the values of dp_T and dp_F based on the previous values.
There are four cases to consider: red-red, red-blue, blue-red, and blue-blue.
For each case, the code updates the corresponding elements of dp_T and dp_F by adding the previous values.
After updating the arrays, the code takes the modulo of each element with MOD.
Finally, it calculates the sum of all elements in dp_T and takes the modulo again to get the final answer.
The answer is then printed.
