<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input and assigns them to variables a, b, and c.
It then checks if c is greater than or equal to a and less than or equal to b.
If this condition is true, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
In this case, c is 2, which is not greater than or equal to a (1) and not less than or equal to b (3).
Therefore, the code will print "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
