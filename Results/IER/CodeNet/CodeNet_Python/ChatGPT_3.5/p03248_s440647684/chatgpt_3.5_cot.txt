<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string s and checks its length n. If the first character of s is "0" or the last character is "1", it prints -1 and exits the program.
Next, it initializes an empty list called possible, which will store the indices where the string s differs from its reverse.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n//2 (integer division). For each index i in this range, it checks if the character at index i in s is different from the character at index n-i-2 (the corresponding index in the reverse of s). If they are different, it prints -1 and exits the program.
If i is greater than 0 and the character at index i in s is "1", it appends i+1 to the possible list.
After the loop, it prints the possible list.
Next, it initializes an empty list called edges, which will store pairs of indices representing edges in a graph.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the length of the possible list. For each index i in this range, it appends pairs of indices to the edges list. The first index in each pair is in the range from cnt + 1 to possible[i], and the second index is possible[i]. If i is not the last index in the range, it also appends a pair where the first index is possible[i] and the second index is possible[i+1]. If i is the last index, it appends a pair where the first index is possible[i] and the second index is possible[i] + 1.
After this loop, it updates cnt to the last index in the possible list.
Next, it enters a loop that iterates from cnt + 2 to n + 1. For each index i in this range, it appends a pair where the first index is cnt + 1 and the second index is i to the edges list.
Finally, it prints each pair of indices in the edges list.
