<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 2.
The variable cnt is initialized to 0.
n is incremented by 1, so it becomes 3.
The code then enters a while loop that continues until n becomes 1.
In each iteration of the loop, n is divided by 2 using the floor division operator (//).
The variable cnt is incremented by 1 in each iteration.
The loop continues until n becomes 1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of cnt, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
