<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by defining two dictionaries, d1 and d2. d1 maps characters to their corresponding binary representation, while d2 maps binary strings to their corresponding characters.
The code then enters a loop that reads input from stdin line by line. For each line, it creates a StringIO object called stream and writes the binary representation of each character in the line to the stream.
After writing all the characters to the stream, it sets the stream's position to the beginning and reads the first 5 characters (bits) from the stream into the variable c.
While c is not empty, it converts c from binary to decimal, looks up the corresponding character in d2, and prints it. It then reads the next 5 characters from the stream into c.
This process continues until there are no more characters left in the stream.
