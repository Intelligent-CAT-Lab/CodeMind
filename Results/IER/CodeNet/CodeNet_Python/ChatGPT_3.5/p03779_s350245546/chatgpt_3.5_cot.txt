<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input and assigns it to the variable X.
Then, it defines a function called main.
Inside the main function, two variables t and curr are initialized to 0.
A while loop is used to iterate until curr is less than X.
In each iteration of the loop, t is incremented by 1 and curr is incremented by t.
This means that in the first iteration, t will be 1 and curr will be 1.
In the second iteration, t will be 2 and curr will be 3.
This process continues until curr becomes greater than or equal to X.
Finally, the value of t is printed.
In this case, the input X is 6.
The while loop will iterate 3 times because the value of curr becomes 6 in the third iteration.
Therefore, the output will be 3.
