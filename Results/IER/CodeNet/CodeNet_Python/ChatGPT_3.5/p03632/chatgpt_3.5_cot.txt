<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four inputs A, B, C, and D and assigns them to the variables A, B, C, and D respectively.
It then calculates the difference between the minimum of B and D and the maximum of A and C and assigns it to the variable ans.
The code then checks if ans is greater than 0. If it is, it prints ans. Otherwise, it prints 0.
In this case, the minimum of B and D is 75 and the maximum of A and C is 25. So, ans is 75 - 25 = 50.
Since ans is greater than 0, the code prints 50.
<<<Output>>>
50
