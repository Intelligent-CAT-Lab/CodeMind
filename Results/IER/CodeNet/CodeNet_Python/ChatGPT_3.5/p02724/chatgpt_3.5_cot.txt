<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input and assigns it to the variable total.
It then calculates the number of 500s that can be obtained from the total by integer division and assigns it to the variable num_500.
The code calculates the remaining amount after subtracting the value of num_500 * 500 from the total and assigns it to the variable remain.
Next, it calculates the number of 5s that can be obtained from the remaining amount by integer division and assigns it to the variable num_5.
Finally, the code prints the sum of num_500 * 1000 and num_5 * 5.
In this case, the input is 1024. The code will calculate that 1024 // 500 = 2, so num_500 will be 2. The remaining amount will be 1024 - 2 * 500 = 24. Since 24 // 5 = 4, num_5 will be 4. The final output will be 2 * 1000 + 4 * 5 = 2010.
