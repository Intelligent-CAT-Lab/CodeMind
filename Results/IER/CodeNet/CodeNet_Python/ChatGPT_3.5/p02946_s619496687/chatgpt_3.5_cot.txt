<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers, a and b, as input.
It then enters a loop that iterates from b-a+1 to b+a (inclusive).
For each iteration, it prints the current value of i, followed by a space.
After the loop finishes, the code does not print anything else.
In this case, the loop will iterate from 7-3+1 to 7+3, which is from 5 to 10.
Therefore, the code will print the numbers 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10, separated by spaces.
<<<Output>>>
5 6 7 8 9 10
