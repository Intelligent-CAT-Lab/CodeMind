<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes input from the user and stores it in variable a as a string. It then uses the strip() method to remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the input. The split() method is used to split the input string into a list of substrings, using a space as the delimiter. The resulting list is stored in variable a.

The code then creates a new list called b, which is obtained by iterating over each element in a and converting it to an integer using the int() function. The resulting list b contains the integers [1, 5, 2].

The sort() method is called on list b, which sorts the elements in ascending order. After sorting, the list b becomes [1, 2, 5].

Finally, the code prints the result of the expression b[2]*10 + b[1] + b[0]. This expression accesses the third element of list b (which is 5), multiplies it by 10, adds the second element (which is 2), and adds the first element (which is 1). The result is 52.
