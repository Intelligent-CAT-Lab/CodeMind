<<<Analysis>>>
The code compares the first four characters of the input string with the string "YAKI". If they are equal, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".
In this case, the first four characters of the input string "YAKINIKU" are "YAKI", which is equal to the string "YAKI". Therefore, the code will print "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
