<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers n and m as input.
It initializes two variables mod1 and mod2 to 10^9+7 and 998244353 respectively.
It sets the value of mod to mod1.
It calculates the value of ans as (m+1)%mod, which is the remainder when (m+1) is divided by mod.
If n is not equal to 1, it performs the following calculations:
- It calculates the value of a as m//(n-1), which is the integer division of m by (n-1).
- It updates the value of ans as ((m+1)*(a+1)+(m+1)*a-(n-1)*a*(a+1))%mod.
Finally, it prints the value of ans.

In this case, n=3 and m=9.
The code enters the if condition because n is not equal to 1.
It calculates the value of a as 9//(3-1) = 4.
It updates the value of ans as ((9+1)*(4+1)+(9+1)*4-(3-1)*4*(4+1))%mod.
Simplifying the expression, we get ans = (50+40-24)%mod = 66%mod = 66.

<<<Output>>>
66
