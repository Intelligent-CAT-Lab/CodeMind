<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four integers as input: h, w, a, and b.
It then initializes a variable MOD to 10^9+7.
Next, it creates a list called fact and initializes it with the value 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to h+w-1 (exclusive). In each iteration, it calculates the factorial of the current number and stores it in the fact list.
After that, it creates another list called inv_fact and initializes it with the inverse of the last element of the fact list. It then enters another loop that iterates from h+w-2 to 1 (inclusive) in reverse order. In each iteration, it calculates the inverse factorial of the current number and stores it in the inv_fact list.
The code then reverses the inv_fact list and stores it in a new list called inv.
Next, it defines a function called comb that takes two arguments x and y and returns the combination of x choose y using the fact and inv lists.
The code initializes a variable ans to 0.
It then enters a loop that iterates from b to w (exclusive). In each iteration, it calculates the combination of (h-a-1+x) choose x and (a-1+w-x-1) choose (a-1), multiplies them together, and adds the result to ans. It also takes the modulo of the result with MOD.
Finally, it prints the value of ans.
