<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input and assigns them to variables x1 and x2.
It then checks if x2 is greater than x1. If it is, it subtracts x1 from x2 and prints the result.
If x2 is not greater than x1, it subtracts x2 from x1 and prints the result.
In this case, x1 is 20 and x2 is 30. Since x2 is greater than x1, the code will subtract x1 from x2 and print the result, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
