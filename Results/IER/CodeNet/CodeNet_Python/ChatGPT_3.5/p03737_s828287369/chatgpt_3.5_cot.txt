<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes input as a string and splits it into a list of words using the split() function. The delimiter used for splitting is a space (' ').
The code then accesses the first character of each word in the list and concatenates them together.
Finally, it converts the concatenated string to uppercase using the upper() function and prints it.
In this case, the input string is "atcoder beginner contest", so the list S will contain three words: ["atcoder", "beginner", "contest"].
The code then accesses the first character of each word: "a", "b", "c".
These characters are concatenated together to form the string "abc".
Finally, the string "abc" is converted to uppercase, resulting in "ABC".
<<<Output>>>
ABC
