<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines two dictionaries, d1 and d2, which are used for encoding and decoding characters.
The code then enters an infinite loop, which will continue until an exception occurs.
Inside the loop, it initializes two empty strings, c and dc, which will be used to store the encoded and decoded strings, respectively.
The code reads a line of input and stores it in the variable n.
It then iterates over each character i in n and appends the corresponding binary code from d1 to c.
If the length of c is not divisible by 5, it appends zeros to make it a multiple of 5.
Next, it iterates over c in steps of 5 and appends the corresponding character from d2 to dc.
Finally, it prints dc, which is the decoded string.
The loop continues until an exception occurs, at which point the code breaks out of the loop and terminates.
