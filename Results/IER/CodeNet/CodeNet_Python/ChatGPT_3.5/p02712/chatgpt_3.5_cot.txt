The variable N is initialized to 15.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers that are not divisible by 3 or 5.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 15.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is not divisible by 5 and not divisible by 3. If this condition is true, it adds the current number i to ans.
The condition is met when i is 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 11, 13, and 14.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 60.
<<<Output>>>
60
