<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs, n and m, and initializes a list called points with n elements, all set to "0".
Then, it enters a loop that iterates from n//2 + 1 to n (exclusive). In this case, n//2 + 1 is 2, so the loop will only run once.
Inside the loop, it sets the element at index i in the points list to the string representation of m.
Finally, it joins all the elements in the points list with a space separator and prints the result.
In this case, since n is 3 and m is 100, the output will be "0 100 100".
<<<Output>>>
0 100 100
