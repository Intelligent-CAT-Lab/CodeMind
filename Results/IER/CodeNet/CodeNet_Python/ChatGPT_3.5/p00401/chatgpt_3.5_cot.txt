<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized to 54.
The variable count is initialized to 1.
The code enters a while loop that continues as long as count is less than or equal to N.
Inside the loop, count is multiplied by 2 in each iteration.
The loop continues until count becomes greater than N.
After the loop finishes, the code divides count by 2 and rounds the result to the nearest integer using the round() function.
The final value of count/2 is 64/2 = 32.
<<<Output>>>
32
