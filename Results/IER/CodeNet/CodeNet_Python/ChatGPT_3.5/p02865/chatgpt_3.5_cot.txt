<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input and assigns it to the variable n.
Then it calculates the value of (n-1)//2 and prints it.
The expression (n-1)//2 calculates the floor division of (n-1) by 2, which means it returns the largest integer that is less than or equal to (n-1)/2.
In this case, when n=4, the value of (n-1)//2 is (4-1)//2 = 3//2 = 1.
