<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads 5 integers from the input: N, A, B, C, and D. In this case, the values are 5, 1, 5, 2, and 4 respectively.
Then, it enters a loop that iterates from 0 to N-2 (inclusive), which means it will iterate 4 times.
Inside the loop, it calculates two values: l and r.
l is calculated using the formula C * i + A - D * (N - i - 1).
r is calculated using the formula D * i + A - C * (N - i - 1) + 1.
The code then checks if B is within the range [l, r). If it is, it prints "YES" and breaks out of the loop.
If the loop finishes without finding a match, it prints "NO".
In this case, the loop will not find a match because B = 5 is not within the range [l, r) for any value of i.
Therefore, the output will be "NO".
<<<Output>>>
