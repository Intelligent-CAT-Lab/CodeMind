<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by defining two functions: rem(a, b, c) and isDouble(a, b, c). These functions check if the given numbers satisfy certain conditions and return True or False accordingly.

Then, the code takes three integers a, b, and c as input.

A variable cnt is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of iterations.

Three variables fa, fb, and fc are assigned the values of a, b, and c, respectively.

The code enters a while loop that continues until a certain condition is met. Inside the loop, it checks if the current iteration is not the first iteration and if the values of fa, fb, and fc are equal to the initial values of a, b, and c, respectively. If this condition is true, it means that the numbers are not changing anymore and the loop is stuck in a cycle. In this case, the code prints -1 and exits the program.

Next, the code calculates the values of tmp1, tmp2, and tmp3 by dividing a, b, and c by 2, respectively.

The code then checks if the values of tmp1, tmp2, and tmp3 are not integers by calling the isDouble() function. If this condition is true, it means that the numbers are not divisible by 2 and the loop breaks.

If the loop continues, the code increments the value of cnt by 1 and updates the values of a, b, and c according to the given formulas.

Finally, the code checks if the updated values of a, b, and c satisfy the condition of the rem() function. If this condition is false, it means that at least one of the numbers is not divisible by 2 and the loop breaks.

After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of cnt.
