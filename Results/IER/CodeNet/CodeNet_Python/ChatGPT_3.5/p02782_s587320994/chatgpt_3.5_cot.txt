<<<Analysis>>>
The code first reads the input values for r1, c1, r2, and c2.
Then, it defines a function called cmb that calculates the combination of n choose r modulo mod.
Next, it initializes some variables and lists.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to N+1, where N is the sum of r2 and c2 plus 3.
In each iteration, it calculates the factorial, inverse factorial, and inverse modulo for the current number i and appends them to the respective lists.
After the loop, the code calculates four combinations using the cmb function and assigns them to variables a, b, c, and d.
Finally, it calculates the final answer by subtracting b, c, and d from a, and takes the modulo of the result with mod.
The answer is then printed.
