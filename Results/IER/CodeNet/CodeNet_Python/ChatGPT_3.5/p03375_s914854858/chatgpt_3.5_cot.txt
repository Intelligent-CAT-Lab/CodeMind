The variable N is initialized to 2 and the variable M is initialized to 1000000007.
Two lists, fact and rfact, are initialized with length N+1 and all elements set to 1.
A loop is then executed from 1 to N+1, where each element of fact is calculated as the product of the current index and the previous element of fact modulo M. Similarly, each element of rfact is calculated as the modular inverse of the corresponding element of fact.
A dictionary, memo, is initialized to store previously computed values of the function f.
The function f is defined, which takes two arguments N and K. It first checks if the pair (N, K) is already in the memo dictionary and returns the corresponding value if it is. Then, it checks for base cases where K is 0 or N is equal to K and returns 1 in those cases. Otherwise, it recursively calculates the value of f(N-1, K-1) and f(N-1, K) and stores the result in the memo dictionary. Finally, it returns the sum of the two calculated values modulo M.
The variable S is initialized as a list containing the value 1.
The variable rev2 is calculated as the modular inverse of 2 modulo M.
The variable base is calculated as 2 raised to the power of N modulo M.
The variable ans is initialized to 0.
A loop is executed from K = 0 to N+1. Inside the loop, the variable r is calculated as the product of fact[N], rfact[K], and rfact[N-K] modulo M. Then, r is multiplied by 2 raised to the power of 2 raised to the power of N-K modulo M-1, and the result is stored in r. The variables b and v are initialized to 1 and 0, respectively. Another loop is executed from L = 0 to K-1. Inside this loop, the variable s is calculated as the sum of S[L] and (L+1)*S[L+1] modulo M, and the result is stored in T[L+1]. The variable v is updated by adding s multiplied by b. The variable b is updated by multiplying it by base modulo M. After the loop, b is added to v. The value of T[K+1] is set to 1. The list S is updated to be equal to T. The variable r is multiplied by v modulo M. If K is odd, the value of r is subtracted from ans. Otherwise, the value of r is added to ans. Finally, ans is updated to be equal to ans modulo M.
The variable base is updated by multiplying it by rev2 modulo M.
The final value of ans is printed.
