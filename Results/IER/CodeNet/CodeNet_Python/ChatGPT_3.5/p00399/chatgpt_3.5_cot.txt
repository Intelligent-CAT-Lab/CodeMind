<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four inputs r, b, w, and g and assigns them to the variables r, b, w, and g respectively.
Then it prints the sum of r, b, w, and g.
In this case, the values of r, b, w, and g are 4, 2, 1, and 1 respectively.
So the output will be the sum of these values, which is 4 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 8.
<<<Output>>>
8
