<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a class called Vector, which represents a 2D vector. It has methods for printing the vector, adding, subtracting, multiplying, dividing vectors, and rotating the vector by a given angle.

The code also defines a function called koch, which is a recursive function that implements the Koch snowflake fractal. It takes three parameters: d (the depth of recursion), a (the starting point of the line segment), and b (the ending point of the line segment). The function recursively divides the line segment into smaller segments and rotates them to create the Koch snowflake.

In the main part of the code, it takes an integer input N, creates two Vector objects a and b, and calls the koch function with N as the depth of recursion and a and b as the starting and ending points of the line segment. It also prints the starting and ending points of the line segment.
