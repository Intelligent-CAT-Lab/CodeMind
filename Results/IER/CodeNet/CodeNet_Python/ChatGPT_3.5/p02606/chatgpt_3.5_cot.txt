<<<Analysis>>>
The variable L, variable R and variable d are initialized to 5, 10 and 2, respectively.
variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the count of numbers divisible by d.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from L to R (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 5 to 10.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is divisible by d (i%d == 0). If it is, it increments the count ans by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 3.
