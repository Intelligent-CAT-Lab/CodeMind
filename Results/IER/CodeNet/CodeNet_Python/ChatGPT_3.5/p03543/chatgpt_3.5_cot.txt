<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input N as a string.
It then assigns the individual characters of N to variables a, b, c, and d.
The code checks if either a, b, c are all equal or b, c, d are all equal.
In this case, a = 1, b = 1, c = 1, and d = 8.
Since a, b, c are all equal, the condition is met and the code prints "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
