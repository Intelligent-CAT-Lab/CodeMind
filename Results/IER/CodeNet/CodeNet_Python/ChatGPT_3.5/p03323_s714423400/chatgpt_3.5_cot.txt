<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers A and B as input and stores them in variables A and B, respectively.
Then it checks if both A and B are less than 9. If they are, it prints 'Yay!'. Otherwise, it prints ':('.
In this case, A is 5 and B is 4, both of which are less than 9. Therefore, the code will print 'Yay!'.
<<<Output>>>
Yay!
