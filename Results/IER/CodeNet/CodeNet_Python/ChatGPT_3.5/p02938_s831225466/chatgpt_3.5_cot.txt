<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers L and R as input.
It initializes a variable mod to 10^9 + 7.
It creates a 3D list DP_ini with dimensions 64x2x2, filled with zeros.
It imports the copy module.
It initializes a variable ANS to 0.

Then, it enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 63 (64 times) with the variable begin.
Inside this loop, it creates a deep copy of DP_ini and assigns it to the variable DP.
It checks if the condition L < (1<<(begin+1)) and (1<<begin) <= R is true.
If it is, it enters a nested if-else statement based on the values of L and R.

Inside the nested if-else statement, it updates the values of DP based on the conditions.
If none of the conditions are met, DP[begin][0][0] is set to 1.
If only the first condition is met, DP[begin][1][0] is set to 1.
If only the second condition is met, DP[begin][0][1] is set to 1.
If both conditions are met, DP[begin][1][1] is set to 1.

After updating DP, it enters another loop that iterates from begin-1 to 0 (inclusive) with the variable keta.
Inside this loop, it checks the values of L and R with bitwise operations.
Based on the values, it updates the values of DP[keta] using the values of DP[keta+1].

Finally, it calculates the sum of all the values in DP[0][0] and DP[0][1] and adds it to ANS.
It prints the value of ANS modulo mod.
