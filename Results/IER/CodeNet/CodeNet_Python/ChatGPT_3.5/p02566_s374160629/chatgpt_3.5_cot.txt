<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called `SuffixArray` that takes a string `S` as input and returns the suffix array and the longest common prefix (LCP) array.
The main function reads a string `S` from input and calculates the length of `S` as `N`.
Then, it calls the `SuffixArray` function passing `S` as an argument and assigns the returned suffix array to `SA` and the returned LCP array to `LCP`.
Finally, it prints the result of the expression `N * (N+1) // 2 - sum(LCP)`.

The `SuffixArray` function implements the suffix array construction algorithm. It first appends a special character `$` to the end of the input string `S` and initializes some variables.
Then, it performs the 0th sort by counting the occurrences of each character in `S` and assigning a unique number to each character.
After that, it enters a loop that doubles the length of the sorted suffixes in each iteration.
Inside the loop, it creates a new array `C_new` to store the new character numbers and a new array `P_new` to store the new sorted suffixes.
It also initializes a variable `cnt_c` to -1 and a variable `prev` to None.
Then, it iterates over the sorted suffixes in reverse order and calculates the new character number for each suffix based on the previous character numbers.
If the new character number is different from the previous one, it increments `cnt_c` and updates `prev` to the new character number.
Finally, it assigns `C_new` to `C` and `P_new` to `P`.
After the loop finishes, it calculates the rank of each suffix and initializes the LCP array.
Then, it enters another loop that calculates the LCP values by comparing adjacent suffixes.
It starts with an LCP value of 0 and decreases it by 1 in each iteration until the characters at the corresponding positions in the suffixes are different.
The calculated LCP value is assigned to the LCP array.
Finally, it returns the suffix array `P` and the LCP array.

The expression `N * (N+1) // 2 - sum(LCP)` calculates the total number of substrings of `S` and subtracts the sum of the LCP values, which represents the number of common prefixes between adjacent suffixes.
Therefore, the output of the code execution will be the number of distinct substrings of `S`.
