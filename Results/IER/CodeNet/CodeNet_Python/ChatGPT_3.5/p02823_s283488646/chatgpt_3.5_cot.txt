<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads three integers N, A, and B from the input.
It then checks if the absolute difference between A and B is divisible by 2. If it is, it prints the integer division of the difference by 2.
Otherwise, it checks if (A-1) is less than (N-B). If it is, it prints (A-1) plus 1 plus the integer division of (B-A-1) by 2.
Otherwise, it prints (N-B) plus 1 plus the integer division of (B-A-1) by 2.
In this case, N=5, A=2, and B=4.
The absolute difference between A and B is 2, which is divisible by 2. So the code prints 1.
