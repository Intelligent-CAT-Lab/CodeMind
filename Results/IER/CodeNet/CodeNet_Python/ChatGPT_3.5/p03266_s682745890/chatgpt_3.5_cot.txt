<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N and variable K are initialized to 3 and 2, respectively.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the final answer.
The code then calculates the integer division of N by K and stores it in variable a.
It adds the cube of a to ans.
The code then checks if K is divisible by 2. If it is, it calculates the integer division of (N + K/2) by K and stores it in variable b.
It adds the cube of b to ans.
Finally, it prints the final value of ans.
In this case, N/K is 1, so a is 1. The cube of 1 is 1, so ans is 1.
Since K is not divisible by 2, the code does not enter the if statement.
Therefore, the final value of ans is 1.
