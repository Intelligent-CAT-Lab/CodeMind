<<<Analysis>>>
The variable B is initialized to 2 and variable W is initialized to 1.
The code then defines a function called doubling which calculates the power of a number modulo mod.
The code also defines a function called inved which calculates the inverse of a number modulo mod.
The code initializes two lists, fact and invf, with length B+W+1, and sets all elements to 1.
The code then calculates the factorial of each number from 1 to B+W and stores it in the fact list.
The code also calculates the inverse factorial of each number from 1 to B+W and stores it in the invf list.
The code initializes two more lists, bina and invb, with length B+W+1, and sets all elements to 1.
The code then calculates the power of 2 for each number from 1 to B+W and stores it in the bina list.
The code also calculates the inverse power of 2 for each number from 1 to B+W and stores it in the invb list.
The code then checks if B is equal to W. If it is, it enters a loop that prints the inverse factorial of 2 for each number from 1 to B+W.
If B is greater than W, it enters a loop that prints the inverse factorial of 2 for each number from 1 to W.
It then calculates the value of P, which is the inverse factorial of 2.
It then enters another loop that calculates the value of F for each number from W+1 to B+1.
The value of F is calculated using the formula provided in the code.
It then prints the value of F and updates the value of P to be equal to F.
After the loop finishes, it enters another loop that calculates the value of F for each number from B+1 to B+W+1.
The value of F is calculated using the formula provided in the code.
It then prints the value of F and updates the value of P to be equal to F.
If B is less than W, it enters a loop that prints the inverse factorial of 2 for each number from 1 to B.
It then calculates the value of P, which is the inverse factorial of 2.
It then enters another loop that calculates the value of F for each number from B+1 to W+1.
The value of F is calculated using the formula provided in the code.
It then prints the value of F and updates the value of P to be equal to F.
After the loop finishes, it enters another loop that calculates the value of F for each number from W+1 to B+W+1.
The value of F is calculated using the formula provided in the code.
It then prints the value of F and updates the value of P to be equal to F.
