<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers A, B, and C as input.
It then calculates the value of ans by subtracting (A-B) from C.
If ans is greater than or equal to 0, it prints ans.
Otherwise, it prints 0.
In this case, A=6, B=4, and C=3.
So, ans = 3 - (6-4) = 1.
Since ans is greater than or equal to 0, the code will print 1.
