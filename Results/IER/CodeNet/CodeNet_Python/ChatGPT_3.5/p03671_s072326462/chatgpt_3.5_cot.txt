<<<Analysis>>>
The code imports the sys module and assigns the readline function from sys.stdin to the variable input. This allows the code to read input from the standard input.

The code then reads a line of input and splits it into a list of integers using the map function and int as the mapping function. The input is "700 600 780", so the resulting list is [700, 600, 780].

The list is then sorted in ascending order using the sort method. After sorting, the list becomes [600, 700, 780].

Finally, the code prints the sum of the first two elements of the sorted list, which is 600 + 700 = 1300.

<<<Output>>>
1300
