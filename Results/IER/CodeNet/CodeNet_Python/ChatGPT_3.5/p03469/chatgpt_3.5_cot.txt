<<<Analysis>>>
The code first prints the string '2018', and then it takes the input from the user.
The input is '2017/01/07'.
The code then uses string slicing to extract a substring from the input starting from index 4.
The substring '01/07' is then concatenated with '2018', resulting in the final output '201801/07'.
<<<Output>>>
201801/07
