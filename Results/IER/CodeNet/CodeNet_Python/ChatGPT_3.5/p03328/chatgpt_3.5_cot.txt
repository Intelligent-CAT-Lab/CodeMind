<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input and assigns them to variables a and b.
It then calculates the difference between b and a and stores it in the variable tower_dis.
Next, it calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to tower_dis (inclusive) using the formula (tower_dis * (tower_dis + 1)) // 2 and assigns it to the variable b_height.
Finally, it calculates the difference between b_height and b and assigns it to the variable ans.
The code then prints the value of ans.
In this case, the difference between 8 and 13 is 5. So, tower_dis will be 5.
The sum of numbers from 1 to 5 is 15. So, b_height will be 15.
The difference between 15 and 13 is 2. So, ans will be 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
