<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input N and initializes a variable n to 0.
It then enters a while loop that continues indefinitely until a break statement is encountered.
Inside the loop, it checks if 2^n is greater than or equal to N. If it is, the loop is terminated.
If not, it increments n by 1 and continues to the next iteration of the loop.
After the loop, the code initializes a variable P to 2^n, which is the smallest power of 2 greater than or equal to N.
It then creates a 2D list called graph with dimensions P x P, filled with zeros.
Next, it enters a nested loop that iterates over the values of i and p.
For each iteration, it calculates the value of k as 2^i and checks if p%k is less than k//2.
If it is, it calculates an offset value and updates a portion of the graph matrix with the value of i.
Finally, the code enters another nested loop that iterates over the values of i and j from 0 to N-1.
For each iteration, it prints the value of graph[i][j] followed by a space.
After each row is printed, it moves to the next line.
