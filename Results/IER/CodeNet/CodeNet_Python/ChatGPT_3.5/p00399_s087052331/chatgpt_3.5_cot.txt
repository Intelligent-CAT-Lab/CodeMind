<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes input as a string and splits it into a list of strings using the split() function. The input "4 2 1 1" will be split into the list ['4', '2', '1', '1'].
The map() function is then used to apply the int() function to each element of the list, converting them from strings to integers. The map() function returns an iterator, which is then passed to the sum() function.
The sum() function calculates the sum of all the integers in the iterator and returns the result.
Finally, the print() function is used to output the result of the sum() function.
