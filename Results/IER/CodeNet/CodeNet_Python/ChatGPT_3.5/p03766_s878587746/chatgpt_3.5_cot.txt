<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by importing the sys module and defining a function readline that reads a line from the input. It also sets the value of MOD to 10^9+7 and reads an integer N from the input.

The code then initializes four lists, dp1, Dp1, dp2, and Dp2, all of size N+3, with all elements set to 0. These lists will be used to store intermediate values during the calculation.

Next, the code sets the initial values of dp1, Dp1, dp2, and Dp2. dp1[0] and Dp1[0] are set to 1, dp2[0] and Dp2[0] are set to N-1. dp1[1] is set to N-1, dp2[1] is set to (N-1)^2. dp1[2] is set to N-1, dp2[2] is set to (N-1)^2. Dp1[1] is set to Dp1[0] + dp1[1], Dp2[1] is set to Dp2[0] + dp2[1]. Dp1[2] is set to Dp1[1] + dp1[2], Dp2[2] is set to Dp2[1] + dp2[2].

Then, the code enters a loop that iterates from 3 to N+1. In each iteration, it calculates the values of dp1[i], dp2[i], Dp1[i], and Dp2[i] based on the previous values. The formulas used are:
- dp1[i] = (dp1[i-1] + Dp1[i-3] - 1) % MOD
- dp2[i] = (dp2[i-1] + Dp2[i-3]) % MOD
- Dp1[i] = (Dp1[i-1] + dp1[i]) % MOD
- Dp2[i] = (Dp2[i-1] + dp2[i]) % MOD

Finally, the code prints the value of (Dp1[N-1] + Dp2[N-1]) % MOD.
