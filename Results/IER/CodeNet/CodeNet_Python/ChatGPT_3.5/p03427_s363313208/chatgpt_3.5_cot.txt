<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized to "100".
The code then extracts the first character of N and converts it to an integer, storing it in the variable c. In this case, c will be 1.
The code also calculates the length of N and stores it in the variable K. In this case, K will be 3.
The variable ans is then calculated as c + 9 * (K - 1) - 1. In this case, ans will be 1 + 9 * (3 - 1) - 1 = 1 + 9 * 2 - 1 = 1 + 18 - 1 = 18.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the characters of N starting from the second character. In this case, it will iterate over "00".
Inside the loop, the code checks if the current character i is not equal to "9". If it is not, it breaks out of the loop. Since the second character of N is "0", the loop breaks immediately.
After the loop, the code checks if the loop completed normally (i.e., it did not break). If it did, it increments ans by 1. In this case, the loop did break, so ans remains unchanged.
Finally, the code prints the value of ans, which is 18.
<<<Output>>>
18
