<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an input value n as a float.
It then calculates the square root of 2 multiplied by the integer value of n+1.
If this value is less than or equal to n multiplied by the square root of 2, it prints the integer value of n+1.
Otherwise, it prints the value of n multiplied by the square root of 2.
In this case, the input value is 1.000.
The square root of 2 is approximately 1.414.
The integer value of n+1 is 2.
Since 1.000 multiplied by 1.414 is less than 2, the code will print the integer value of n+1, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
