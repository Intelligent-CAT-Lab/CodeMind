<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called Base_10_to_n that converts a decimal number to a number in base n. It takes two arguments, X and n.
Inside the function, it checks if X divided by n is non-zero. If it is, it recursively calls the function with X divided by n and concatenates the remainder of X divided by n to the result.
Finally, it returns the result as a string.
The code then reads two inputs, N and K, and assigns them to variables N and K respectively.
It calls the Base_10_to_n function with the integer value of N and K as arguments, and then calculates the length of the resulting string using the len() function.
Finally, it prints the length of the string.
In this case, N is 11 and K is 2.
The Base_10_to_n function is called with 11 and 2 as arguments.
The function recursively calls itself with 5 and 2 as arguments, then with 2 and 2 as arguments, and finally with 1 and 2 as arguments.
When the function is called with 1 and 2 as arguments, it returns "1" as the result.
The length of the resulting string is 1, so the code prints 1.
