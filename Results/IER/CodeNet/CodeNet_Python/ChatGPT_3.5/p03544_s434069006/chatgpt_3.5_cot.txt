<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input and stores it in the variable n.
If n is equal to 1, it prints 1.
Otherwise, it initializes a list called ans with the values [2, 1].
Then, it enters a loop that iterates n-1 times.
In each iteration, it appends the sum of the last two elements of ans to the list.
Finally, it prints the last element of ans.
For the input 5, the code will iterate 4 times and the list ans will have the following values: [2, 1, 3, 4, 7].
Therefore, the output will be 7.
<<<Output>>>
