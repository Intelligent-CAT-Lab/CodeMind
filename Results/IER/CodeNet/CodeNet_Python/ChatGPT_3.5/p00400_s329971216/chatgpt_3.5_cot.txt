<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input and assigns it to the variable num.
It then checks if num is within the range [65, 90], which corresponds to the ASCII values of uppercase letters. If it is, it prints 1.
If num is not within the range [65, 90], it checks if it is within the range [97, 122], which corresponds to the ASCII values of lowercase letters. If it is, it prints 2.
If num is not within either of these ranges, it prints 0.
In this case, the input is 67, which is within the range [65, 90]. Therefore, the code will print 1.
