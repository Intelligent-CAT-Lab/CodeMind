<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input and assigns them to variables a and b.
The code then checks if the product of a and b is divisible by 2. If it is, it prints 'Even'. Otherwise, it prints 'Odd'.
In this case, the product of 3 and 4 is 12, which is divisible by 2. Therefore, the code will print 'Even'.
<<<Output>>>
Even
