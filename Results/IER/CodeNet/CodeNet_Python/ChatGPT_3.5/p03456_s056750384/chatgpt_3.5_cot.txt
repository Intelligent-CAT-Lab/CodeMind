<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads input from the standard input using sys.stdin. It enters a loop that iterates over each line of input.
Inside the loop, it checks if the line is None or an empty line ('\n'). If it is, the loop breaks and the code stops reading input.
If the line is not None or an empty line, it splits the line into two strings, a and b, using a space as the delimiter.
It then concatenates a and b, converts the resulting string to an integer, and assigns it to the variable temp.
The code then checks if the square of the square root of temp is equal to temp. If it is, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
In this case, the input is "1 21". The code splits it into two strings, "1" and "21". It concatenates them to get "121" and converts it to an integer. The value of temp is 121.
The square root of 121 is 11, and the square of 11 is 121, which is equal to temp. Therefore, the code prints "Yes".
