The variable mod is initialized to 11.
The variables n and k are initialized by taking input from the user.
The value of k is modified by subtracting 8 from it and then taking the modulo of mod.
The variable last is calculated as 7*n-7*2-2.
The variable idx is initialized to -1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to last+1.
For each iteration, it checks if 3*(i+i+1+i+2) modulo mod is equal to k.
If it is, it assigns the value of i to idx and breaks out of the loop.
The code then enters another loop that iterates from 1 to n+1.
For each iteration, it checks if (7*i-1-idx) modulo 11 is equal to 0.
If it is, it assigns the value of 7*i-1 to r2idx and breaks out of the loop.
The code then enters another loop that iterates from 1 to n+1.
For each iteration, it checks if (7*i-idx) modulo 11 is equal to 0.
If it is, it assigns the value of 7*i to r1idx and breaks out of the loop.
The code then checks if idx is still -1.
If it is, it prints 0 and exits the program.
If r1idx is still -1, it checks if r2idx is still -1.
If it is, it prints (last-idx)/11+1.
Otherwise, it prints (last-idx)/11+1-(last-r2idx)/(7*11)-1.
If r1idx is not -1, it checks if r2idx is still -1.
If it is, it prints (last-idx)/11+1-(last-r1idx)/(7*11)-1.
Otherwise, it prints (last-idx)/11+1-(last-r2idx)/(7*11)-1-(last-r1idx)/(7*11)-1.
