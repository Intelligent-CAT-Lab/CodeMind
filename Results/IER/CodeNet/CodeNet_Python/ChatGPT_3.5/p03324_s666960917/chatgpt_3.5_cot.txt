<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs, `a` and `b`, and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b` respectively.
Then it checks if `b` is equal to 100. If it is, it increments `b` by 1.
Finally, it prints the value of `b` multiplied by `100` raised to the power of `a`.
In this case, `a` is 0 and `b` is 5.
Since `b` is not equal to 100, the code does not increment `b`.
The code then prints `b` multiplied by `100` raised to the power of `a`, which is `5 * 100^0 = 5 * 1 = 5`.
<<<Output>>>
5
