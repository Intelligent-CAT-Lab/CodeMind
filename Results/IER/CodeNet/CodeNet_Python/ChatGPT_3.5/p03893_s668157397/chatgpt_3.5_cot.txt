<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input, converts it to an integer, and adds 2 to it. In this case, the input is 2, so the result of this operation is 4.
Then, the code calculates 2 raised to the power of 4, which is 16.
Finally, it subtracts 2 from the result, giving a final output of 14.
<<<Output>>>
14
