<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string t from the input.
It then initializes an empty list ans, which will be used to store the modified string.
The code enters a loop that iterates over each character in the string t.
For each character, it checks if it is equal to '?'. If it is, it appends 'D' to the ans list. Otherwise, it appends the character itself.
After the loop finishes, the code joins the characters in the ans list into a single string and prints it.
