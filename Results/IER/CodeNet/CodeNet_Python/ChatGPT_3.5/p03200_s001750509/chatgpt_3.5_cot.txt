<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input and assigns it to the variable s.
It then initializes two variables, cnt and total, to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates through each character in the string s.
If the current character is "B", it increments the cnt variable by 1.
If the current character is not "B", it adds the value of cnt to the total variable.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of total.
In this case, the string input is "BBW", so the cnt variable will be incremented twice (for the first two "B" characters), and the total variable will be 2.
<<<Output>>>
