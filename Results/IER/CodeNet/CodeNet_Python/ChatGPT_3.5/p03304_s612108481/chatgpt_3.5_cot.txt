<<<Analysis>>>
The code imports several modules and defines some utility functions.
Then, it reads three integers n, m, and d from the input.
The code checks if d is not equal to 0. If it is not, it calculates the expression 2*(n-d)*(m-1)/n**2 and prints the result.
If d is equal to 0, it calculates the expression (m-1)/n and prints the result.
In this case, n=2, m=3, and d=1. Since d is not equal to 0, the code calculates the expression 2*(2-1)*(3-1)/2**2, which simplifies to 2/4 = 0.5, and prints the result.
<<<Output>>>
0.5
