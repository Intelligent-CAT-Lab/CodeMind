<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four integers A, B, C, and D as input.
It calculates the number of attacks Aoki can make by dividing A by D and rounding up to the nearest integer. If A is divisible by D, the result is A // D. Otherwise, it is A // D + 1.
Similarly, it calculates the number of attacks Takahashi can make by dividing C by B and rounding up to the nearest integer. If C is divisible by B, the result is C // B. Otherwise, it is C // B + 1.
The code then checks if the number of attacks Takahashi can make is less than or equal to the number of attacks Aoki can make. If it is, it prints 'Yes'. Otherwise, it prints 'No'.
In this case, A = 10, B = 9, C = 10, and D = 10.
Aoki can make 1 attack (10 // 10 = 1).
Takahashi can make 2 attacks (10 // 9 = 1.1111, rounded up to 2).
Since Takahashi can make more attacks than Aoki, the code will print 'No'.
<<<Output>>>
No
