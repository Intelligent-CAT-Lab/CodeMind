<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input and assigns it to the variable n.
It then calculates the remainder of n divided by 1000 using the modulo operator (%).
If the remainder is not equal to 0, it subtracts the remainder from 1000 and prints the result.
If the remainder is equal to 0, it prints 0.
In this case, the input is 1900. The remainder of 1900 divided by 1000 is 900.
So the code will subtract 900 from 1000 and print the result, which is 100.
<<<Output>>>
100
