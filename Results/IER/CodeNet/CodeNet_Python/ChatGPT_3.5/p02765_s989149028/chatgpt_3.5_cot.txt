<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs, n and r, and assigns them to the variables n and r, respectively.
It then checks if n is less than 10. If it is, it prints the value of r plus 100 times the difference between 10 and n.
In this case, n is 2, which is less than 10. So the code will execute the if block.
The difference between 10 and 2 is 8, so the code will print r + 100 * 8, which is 2919 + 800 = 3719.
<<<Output>>>
3719
