<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines several input functions and initializes a variable `mod` to 10^9 + 7.
Then, it defines a function `factorize_dict(n)` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns a dictionary `fct` containing the prime factorization of `n`.
The main function starts by reading an integer `N` from input.
It then initializes a defaultdict `prime` to store the prime factorization of numbers from 1 to `N`.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to `N` (inclusive).
For each number `n` in this range, it calculates its prime factorization using the `factorize_dict` function and updates the `prime` dictionary accordingly.
After the loop finishes, the code calculates the final answer by multiplying the values in the `prime` dictionary and taking the modulo `mod` at each step.
Finally, it prints the final answer.
