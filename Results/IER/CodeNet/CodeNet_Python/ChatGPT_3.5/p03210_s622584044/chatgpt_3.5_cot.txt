<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input and assigns it to the variable x.
It then checks if x is equal to 3, 5, or 7. If any of these conditions are true, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
In this case, the input is 5. Since 5 is equal to 5, the condition x==5 is true and the code will print 'YES'.
<<<Output>>>
YES
