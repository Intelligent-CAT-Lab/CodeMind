<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input and assigns them to variables a, b, and c.
It then checks if a is less than c and c is less than b, or if a is greater than c and c is greater than b.
If either of these conditions is true, it prints 'Yes'. Otherwise, it prints 'No'.
In this case, a=3, b=8, and c=5.
Since 3 is not less than 5 and 5 is not less than 8, both conditions are false.
Therefore, the code will print 'No'.
<<<Output>>>
No
