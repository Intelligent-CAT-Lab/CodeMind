<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input: a, b, and x.
It checks if x is greater than or equal to a and less than or equal to the sum of a and b.
If the condition is true, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
In this case, x is 4, a is 3, and b is 5.
The condition x >= a and x <= a + b is true because 4 is greater than or equal to 3 and less than or equal to 8 (3 + 5).
Therefore, the code will print 'YES'.
<<<Output>>>
YES
