<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input from the user and stores it in the variable b.
It then checks if b is equal to 'A'. If it is, it prints 'T'.
If b is not equal to 'A', it checks if b is equal to 'C'. If it is, it prints 'G'.
If b is not equal to 'C', it checks if b is equal to 'G'. If it is, it prints 'C'.
If none of the above conditions are met, it prints 'A'.
In this case, the input is 'A', so the first condition is met and the code prints 'T'.
<<<Output>>>
T
