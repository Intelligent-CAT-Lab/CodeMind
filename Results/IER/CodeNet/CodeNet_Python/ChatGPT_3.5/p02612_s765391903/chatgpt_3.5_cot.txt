<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input and assigns it to the variable n.
It then checks if n is divisible by 1000 (i.e., n%1000 == 0). If it is, it assigns 0 to the variable ans.
If n is not divisible by 1000, it calculates the remainder when n is divided by 1000 (i.e., n%1000) and subtracts it from 1000. The result is assigned to the variable ans.
In this case, n = 1900. Since 1900 is divisible by 1000, the condition n%1000 == 0 is true. Therefore, ans is assigned 0.
The code then prints the value of ans, which is 0.
<<<Output>>>
0
