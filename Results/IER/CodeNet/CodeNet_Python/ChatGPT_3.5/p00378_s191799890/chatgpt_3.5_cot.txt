<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three inputs: A, B, and X.
It then calculates three values: ans1, ans2, and ans3.
ans1 is calculated by dividing X by 1000 and taking the ceiling value, then multiplying it by A.
ans2 is calculated by dividing X by 500 and taking the ceiling value, then multiplying it by B.
ans3 is calculated by dividing X by 1000 and taking the floor value, then multiplying it by A. It also calculates the remainder of X divided by 1000, divides it by 500, takes the ceiling value, and multiplies it by B. Finally, it adds these two values together.
The code then prints the minimum value among ans1, ans2, and ans3.
In this case, with A=180, B=100, and X=2400, the calculations are as follows:
ans1 = ceil(2400/1000) * 180 = 3 * 180 = 540
ans2 = ceil(2400/500) * 100 = 5 * 100 = 500
ans3 = floor(2400/1000) * 180 + ceil((2400 % 1000)/500) * 100 = 2 * 180 + ceil(400/500) * 100 = 360 + 100 = 460
The minimum value among ans1, ans2, and ans3 is 460, so the code will print 460.
<<<Output>>>
460
