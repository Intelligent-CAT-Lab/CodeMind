<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input and assigns it to the variable n.
It then calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to n using the formula (n + 1) * n / 2.
Finally, it prints the result of the calculation.
In this case, the input is 3, so the code calculates (3 + 1) * 3 / 2 = 6.
<<<Output>>>
6
