<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers H and R as input.
It then checks if the sum of H and R is equal to 0. If it is, it prints 0.
If the sum of H and R is not equal to 0, it checks if the sum is greater than or equal to 0. If it is, it prints 1.
If the sum of H and R is less than 0, it prints -1.
In this case, the sum of -3 and 3 is 0, so the code will print 0.
<<<Output>>>
