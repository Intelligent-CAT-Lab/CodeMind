<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four inputs A, B, C, and D and initializes them to 10, 9, 10, and 10 respectively.
The code then enters a while loop that continues as long as both A and C are greater than 0.
Inside the loop, it subtracts B from C and checks if C is less than or equal to 0. If it is, it prints "Yes" and breaks out of the loop.
If C is still greater than 0, it subtracts D from A and checks if A is less than or equal to 0. If it is, it prints "No" and breaks out of the loop.
The loop continues until either C becomes less than or equal to 0 or A becomes less than or equal to 0.
In this case, the loop will run once because A is initially 10 and C is initially 10.
After the first iteration, C becomes 1 and A becomes 0.
Since C is still greater than 0, the loop continues.
In the second iteration, C becomes -8 and A remains 0.
Since C is now less than or equal to 0, the code prints "Yes" and breaks out of the loop.
<<<Output>>>
