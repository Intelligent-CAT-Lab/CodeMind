<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four inputs: t1, t2, r1, and r2.
It first checks if either r1 or r2 is equal to -1. If either of them is -1, it means that the corresponding player did not play the game.
If r1 or r2 is -1, the code checks if t1 is less than t2. If it is, it prints 'Alice'. If t1 is greater than t2, it prints 'Bob'. If t1 is equal to t2, it prints 'Draw'.
If neither r1 nor r2 is -1, the code compares r1 and r2. If r1 is greater than r2, it prints 'Alice'. If r1 is less than r2, it prints 'Bob'. If r1 is equal to r2, it prints 'Draw'.
In this case, r1 is 1000 and r2 is 999. Since r1 is greater than r2, the code will print 'Alice'.

Alice
