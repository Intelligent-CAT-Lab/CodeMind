<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers A, B, and K as input.
It then calculates the value of A_th, which is equal to B+1 if A+K is greater than B+1, otherwise it is equal to A+K.
Next, it creates a list A_l that contains all the numbers from A to A_th-1 (inclusive).
Similarly, it calculates the value of B_th, which is equal to B-K+1 if B-K is greater than A-1, otherwise it is equal to A.
Then, it creates a list B_l that contains all the numbers from B_th to B (inclusive).
Next, it creates a list X_l by concatenating A_l and B_l, removing any duplicates, and sorting the resulting list in ascending order.
Finally, it iterates over each element x in X_l and prints it.

In this case, A = 3, B = 8, and K = 2.
The value of A_th is 5, so A_l is [3, 4].
The value of B_th is 6, so B_l is [6, 7, 8].
X_l is the sorted list [3, 4, 6, 7, 8].
The code then prints each element of X_l on a new line.
