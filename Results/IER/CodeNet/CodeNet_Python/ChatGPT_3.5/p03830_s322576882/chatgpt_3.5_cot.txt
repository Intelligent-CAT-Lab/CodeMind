<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by reading an integer n from the input. It then initializes a variable MOD to 10^9 + 7.
Next, it creates a list called factorial with n+1 elements, all initialized to 0. It sets the first element of factorial to 1.
Then, it enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive). For each iteration, it calculates the factorial of i and stores it in factorial[i].
After calculating the factorial, the code updates the value of n to be the factorial of n.
The code then initializes an empty list called prime_factors and a variable i to 2.
It enters another loop that continues as long as i squared is less than or equal to n. Inside this loop, it checks if n is divisible by i. If it is, it calculates the exponent of i in the prime factorization of n and appends (i, ext) to the prime_factors list, where ext is the exponent.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if n is not equal to 1. If it is not, it means that n is a prime number and it appends (n, 1) to the prime_factors list.
Next, the code initializes a variable ans to 1.
It enters a loop that iterates over the prime_factors list. For each pair (pf, num), it updates ans by multiplying it with (num + 1) and taking the modulo MOD.
Finally, the code prints the value of ans.
