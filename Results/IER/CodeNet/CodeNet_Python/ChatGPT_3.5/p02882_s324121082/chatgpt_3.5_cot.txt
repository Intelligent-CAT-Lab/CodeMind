<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three inputs: a, b, and x. These inputs are then used to calculate the value of c, which is x divided by a. 
The code then checks if c is greater than a*b/2. In this case, a*b/2 is equal to 2, so the condition is true. 
Inside the if statement, the code calculates the value of c as a*b - c, which is 2 - 2 = 0. 
Then, it calculates the value of d as c*2 divided by a, which is 0*2/2 = 0. 
Finally, it calculates the value of e as the arctangent of d/a, which is math.atan(0/2) = 0. 
The code then prints the value of e in degrees, which is math.degrees(0) = 0.
