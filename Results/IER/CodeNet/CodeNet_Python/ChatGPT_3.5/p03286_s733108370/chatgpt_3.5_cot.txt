<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input N and initializes an empty list s.
If N is equal to 0, it prints 0 and the code execution ends.
Otherwise, the code enters a while loop that continues until N becomes 1.
Inside the loop, it checks if N is divisible by 2. If it is, it appends 0 to the list s and updates N to -N//2.
If N is not divisible by 2, it appends 1 to the list s and updates N to (1-N)//2.
After the loop finishes, it appends 1 to the list s.
Finally, it prints the reversed list s with each element separated by an empty string.
In this case, since N is -9, the code enters the else block.
The while loop runs twice:
- In the first iteration, N is not divisible by 2, so it appends 1 to the list s and updates N to (1-(-9))//2 = 5.
- In the second iteration, N is divisible by 2, so it appends 0 to the list s and updates N to -5//2 = -2.
After the loop finishes, it appends 1 to the list s.
Finally, it prints the reversed list s, which is [1, 0, 1], with each element separated by an empty string.
