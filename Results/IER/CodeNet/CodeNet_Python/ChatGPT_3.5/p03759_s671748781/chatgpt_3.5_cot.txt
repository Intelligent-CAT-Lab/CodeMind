<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input and assigns them to variables a, b, and c.
It then checks if the difference between b and a is equal to the difference between c and b.
In this case, the difference between b and a is 2 and the difference between c and b is also 2.
Since the two differences are equal, the code will print "YES".
<<<Output>>>
YES
