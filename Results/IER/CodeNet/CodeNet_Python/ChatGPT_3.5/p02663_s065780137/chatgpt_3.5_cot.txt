<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes 5 inputs: H1, M1, H2, M2, and K.
H1 and M1 represent the starting time in hours and minutes.
H2 and M2 represent the ending time in hours and minutes.
K represents the duration in minutes.
The code then calculates the total minutes of the ending time (H2*60+M2) and subtracts the total minutes of the starting time (H1*60+M1) and the duration (K).
The result is then printed.
In this case, the starting time is 10:00, the ending time is 15:00, and the duration is 30 minutes.
So the code calculates (15*60+0) - (10*60+0) - 30 = 900 - 600 - 30 = 270.
<<<Output>>>
270
