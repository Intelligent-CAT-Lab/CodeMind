<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three inputs b1, b2, and b3.
It then checks the value of b1. If b1 is equal to 1, it checks the value of b2. If b2 is also equal to 1, it prints "Open". Otherwise, it prints "Close".
If b1 is not equal to 1, it checks the value of b2. If b2 is equal to 1, it prints "Close".
If b2 is not equal to 1, it checks the value of b3. If b3 is equal to 1, it prints "Open". Otherwise, it prints "Close".
In this case, b1 is 0, b2 is 0, and b3 is 1. So, the code will check the else condition of the first if statement, then the else condition of the second if statement, and finally, it will print "Open".
<<<Output>>>
Open
