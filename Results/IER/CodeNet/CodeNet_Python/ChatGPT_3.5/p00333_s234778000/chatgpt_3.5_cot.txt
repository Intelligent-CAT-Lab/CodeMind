<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three inputs: w, h, and c. These inputs are converted to integers using the map() function.
The code then calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of w and h using the math.gcd() function.
The area of the rectangle is calculated by multiplying w and h.
Finally, the code prints the product of the area, the square of the gcd, and c.
In this case, the area is 10 * 20 = 200, the gcd is 10, and c is 5.
So, the output would be 200 * 10^2 * 5 = 100000.
<<<Output>>>
100000
