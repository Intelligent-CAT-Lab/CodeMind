<<<Analysis>>>
The variable H and variable R are initialized to -3 and 3, respectively.
The code first checks if H is greater than or equal to 0. Since -3 is less than 0, this condition is not met.
The code then enters the elif block, which checks if H+R is greater than 0. Since -3+3 is equal to 0, this condition is not met.
The code then checks if H+R is equal to 0. Since -3+3 is equal to 0, this condition is met and it prints 0.
<<<Output>>>
0
