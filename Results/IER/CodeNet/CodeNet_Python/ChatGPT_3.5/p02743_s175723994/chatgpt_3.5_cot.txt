<<<Analysis>>>
The code imports the sqrt function from the math module and initializes the variable mod to 10^9 + 7.
Then, it takes three integers a, b, and c as input.
The code checks if the condition 4*a*b < (c-a-b)^2 and c-a-b > 0 is true.
If the condition is true, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
In this case, the condition is not true because 4*2*3 = 24 is not less than (9-2-3)^2 = 16 and 9-2-3 = 4 is not greater than 0.
Therefore, the code will print "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
