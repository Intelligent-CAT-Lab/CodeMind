<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string S.
It initializes two variables, cur_l and max_l, to 0.
Then it enters a loop that iterates over each character s in the string S.
If the character is 'R', it increments the value of cur_l by 1.
If the character is not 'R', it checks if the current value of cur_l is greater than the current value of max_l. If it is, it updates the value of max_l to be equal to cur_l. Then it resets the value of cur_l to 0.
After the loop finishes, it checks one more time if the current value of cur_l is greater than the current value of max_l. If it is, it updates the value of max_l to be equal to cur_l.
Finally, it prints the value of max_l.
In this case, the input string is 'RRS'. The code will increment cur_l twice when encountering the first two 'R' characters, resulting in cur_l = 2. When it encounters the 'S' character, it checks if cur_l (which is 2) is greater than max_l (which is 0), and since it is, it updates max_l to be equal to cur_l. Then it resets cur_l to 0. After the loop finishes, it checks one more time if cur_l (which is 0) is greater than max_l (which is 2), and since it is not, it does not update max_l. Finally, it prints the value of max_l, which is 2.
