<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input number and converts it into a list of integers. For example, if the input is "100", the list would be [1, 0, 0].
The code then checks the length of the list. If the length is 1, it means the input number is a single digit number, so it prints that number.
If the first digit of the list is not 9, it checks if all the remaining digits are the same and equal to 9. If they are, it calculates the sum by adding the first digit with 9 multiplied by (length - 1). Otherwise, it subtracts 1 from the first digit and adds 9 multiplied by (length - 1).
If the first digit is 9, it checks if all the digits in the list are the same. If they are, it prints 9 multiplied by the length of the list. Otherwise, it prints 9 multiplied by (length - 1) and adds 8.
In this case, the input is "100". The length of the list is 3. The first digit is not 9, so it subtracts 1 from the first digit and adds 9 multiplied by (3 - 1), which is 17.
<<<Output>>>
17
