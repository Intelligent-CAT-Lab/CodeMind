<<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the math module, which provides various mathematical operations and functions.
Then, it takes an integer input and assigns it to the variable n.
Next, it calculates the factorial of n using the math.factorial() function and assigns it to the variable s.
Finally, it calculates the remainder of s divided by 10^9 + 7 and assigns it to the variable ans.
The code then prints the value of ans.
In this case, the input is 3. So, the factorial of 3 is 3 * 2 * 1 = 6.
The remainder of 6 divided by 10^9 + 7 is 6.
Therefore, the output of the code execution would be 6.
