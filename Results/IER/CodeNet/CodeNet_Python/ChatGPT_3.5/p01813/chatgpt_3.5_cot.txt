The code defines a function `main()` that takes no arguments and returns an integer. 
The function starts by reading a string `s` from input. 
The code then initializes an empty dictionary `fm` and an empty list `a`. 
The code iterates over each character `c` in the string `s`. 
If `c` is a digit, it converts it to an integer and appends it to the list `a`. 
If `c` is not a digit, it appends it to the list `a` as it is. 
The code then defines a nested function `f(a)` that takes a list `a` as an argument and returns a list of two integers. 
The function `f(a)` first checks if the list `a` is already in the dictionary `fm`. If it is, it returns the corresponding value from the dictionary. 
If the length of the list `a` is 2, the function sets the value of `fm[key]` to `[inf, -inf]` and returns `[inf, -inf]`. 
The function then iterates over each index `i` in the range from 0 to the length of `a` minus 1. 
If the character at index `i` in `a` is not equal to `'('`, it sets `a` to `a[i:]` and breaks out of the loop. 
The function then iterates over each index `i` in reverse order from the length of `a` minus 1 to 0. 
If the character at index `i` in `a` is not equal to `')'`, it sets `a` to `a[:i+1]` and breaks out of the loop. 
If the length of `a` is 1, the function sets the value of `fm[key]` to `[a[0], a[0]]` and returns `[a[0], a[0]]`. 
The function then initializes two lists `ri` and `ra` with the value `[inf]` and `[-inf]` respectively. 
The function then calculates the length of `a` and iterates over each index `i` in the range from 1 to the length of `a` minus 1. 
If the character at index `i` in `a` is not equal to `'+'` or `'-'`, or if the character at index `i-2` in `a` is equal to `'('`, or if the character at index `i+2` in `a` is equal to `')'`, it continues to the next iteration of the loop. 
The function then calls itself recursively with the argument `a[:i]` and assigns the result to the variable `fl`. 
The function also calls itself recursively with the argument `a[i+1:]` and assigns the result to the variable `fr`. 
If the character at index `i` in `a` is `'+'`, the function appends the sum of the first element of `fl` and the first element of `fr` to the list `ri`. 
If the character at index `i` in `a` is `'-'`, the function appends the difference between the first element of `fl` and the second element of `fr` to the list `ri`. 
The function also appends the sum of the second element of `fl` and the second element of `fr` to the list `ra`. 
The function then sets the value of `fm[key]` to `[min(ri), max(ra)]` and returns `[min(ri), max(ra)]`. 
Finally, the code calls the `main()` function and prints its return value.
