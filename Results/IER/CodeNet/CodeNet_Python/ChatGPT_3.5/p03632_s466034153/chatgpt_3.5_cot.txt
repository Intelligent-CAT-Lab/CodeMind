<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four inputs A, B, C, and D and assigns them to the variables A, B, C, and D respectively.
The code then checks if the difference between the minimum of B and D and the maximum of A and C is greater than or equal to 0.
If the condition is true, it prints the difference between the minimum of B and D and the maximum of A and C.
Otherwise, it prints 0.
In this case, the minimum of B and D is 75 and the maximum of A and C is 25.
So, the difference is 75 - 25 = 50.
Therefore, the output of the code would be 50.
