<<<Analysis>>>
The variable K, variable A and variable B are initialized to 4000, 2000 and 500, respectively.
The code then checks if K is less than or equal to A. If it is, it prints 1.
If K is not less than or equal to A, the code checks if A is less than or equal to B. If it is, it prints -1.
If neither of the above conditions are met, the code calculates the value of x using the formula (K-B-1)/(A-B)+1.
Finally, the code prints the value of 2*x-1.
In this case, K is greater than A and A is greater than B, so the code calculates the value of x as (4000-500-1)/(2000-500)+1 = 3.
Therefore, the output of the code execution would be 2*3-1 = 5.
