<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called "resolve" which takes no arguments.
Inside the "resolve" function, it reads two integers n and k from input.
Then it initializes a 2D list called "dp" with dimensions (n+1) x (k+1) and fills it with zeros.
The code sets dp[0][0] to 1, which means that there is 1 way to choose 0 elements from 0 elements.

Then it enters a nested loop that iterates over i from 0 to n-1 and j from 0 to k-1.
For each pair (i, j), it calculates dp[i+1][j+1] using the formula dp[i+1][j+1] = dp[i][j] + (j + 1) * dp[i][j+1].
This formula represents the number of ways to choose j+1 elements from i+1 elements.
The code then takes the modulo of dp[i+1][j+1] with MOD to avoid overflow.

After the nested loop finishes, the code prints the value of dp[-1][-1], which represents the number of ways to choose k elements from n elements.
