<<<Analysis>>>
The variable a and variable b are initialized to 2 and 2, respectively.
The variable ans is initialized to -1, which will be used to store the final result.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 1000 (inclusive), representing the possible values of tax.
For each value of tax, it calculates the tax amount at 8% and 10% and checks if they are equal to a and b, respectively.
If the condition is met, it updates the value of ans to the current tax value and breaks out of the loop.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 25.
<<<Output>>>
25
