<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a list `a` with 100 elements, all set to 0. It then reads a list of integers from input and stores it in the list `b`.
The code then enters a loop that iterates 12 times. In each iteration, it increments the element at index `b[i]-1` in the list `a` by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code initializes a variable `c` to 0. It then enters another loop that iterates over the elements of `a`. If an element is non-zero and divisible by 4, it increments `c` by the integer division of that element by 4.
Finally, the code prints 'yes' if `c` is equal to 3, and 'no' otherwise.

In this case, the input list `b` is [1, 1, 3, 4, 8, 9, 7, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5].
The code updates the list `a` based on the values in `b`:
- a[0] is incremented by 2 (corresponding to the two occurrences of 1 in `b`).
- a[2] is incremented by 1 (corresponding to the occurrence of 3 in `b`).
- a[3] is incremented by 2 (corresponding to the two occurrences of 4 in `b`).
- a[7] is incremented by 1 (corresponding to the occurrence of 8 in `b`).
- a[8] is incremented by 1 (corresponding to the occurrence of 9 in `b`).
- a[6] is incremented by 1 (corresponding to the occurrence of 7 in `b`).
- a[4] is incremented by 3 (corresponding to the three occurrences of 5 in `b`).

After updating `a`, the code checks if any element in `a` is divisible by 4. In this case, a[4] is divisible by 4, so `c` is incremented by 3//4 = 0.
Finally, the code prints 'no' since `c` is not equal to 3.
