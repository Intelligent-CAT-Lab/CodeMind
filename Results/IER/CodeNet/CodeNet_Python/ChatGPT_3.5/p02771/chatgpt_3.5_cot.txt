<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input and assigns them to variables a, b, and c.
It then checks three conditions:
1. If a is equal to b and b is not equal to c, it prints "Yes".
2. If b is equal to c and a is not equal to b, it prints "Yes".
3. If a is equal to c and a is not equal to b, it prints "Yes".
If none of these conditions are met, it prints "No".
In this case, a is equal to c (both are 5) and a is not equal to b (5 is not equal to 7), so the code will print "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
