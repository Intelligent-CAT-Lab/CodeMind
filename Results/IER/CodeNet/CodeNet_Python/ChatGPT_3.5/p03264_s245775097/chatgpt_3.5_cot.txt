<<<Analysis>>>
The variable K is initialized to 3.
The code then calculates the value of (K // 2 + K % 2) * (K // 2).
K // 2 calculates the integer division of K by 2, which is 1.
K % 2 calculates the remainder of the division of K by 2, which is 1.
So, (K // 2 + K % 2) * (K // 2) becomes (1 + 1) * 1, which is equal to 2.
Finally, the code prints the value of 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
