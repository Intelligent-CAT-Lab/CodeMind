<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable H and variable D are initialized to 2, 2 and 1, respectively.
The variable MOD is initialized to 10^9 + 7.
The code then initializes two lists, fact and fact_cum, with the first element being 1.
Then, in a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), it calculates the factorial of each number and stores it in fact. It also calculates the cumulative sum of the factorial values and stores it in fact_cum.
Next, two lists, ap and ap_cum, are initialized with all elements set to 0, except for the first element of ap and ap_cum, which are set to 1.
In another loop that iterates from 1 to H (inclusive), it calculates the value of x based on the previous values of ap_cum and ap_cum[n-D-1]. If n is greater than D, it subtracts ap_cum[n-D-1] from x. Then, it multiplies x by fact_cum[N] and takes the modulo MOD. The result is stored in ap[n] and ap_cum[n].
After the loop finishes, the code calculates the final answer by multiplying ap[H] by fact[N], taking the modulo MOD. Then, it multiplies the result by pow(fact_cum[N],MOD-2,MOD) and takes the modulo MOD again.
Finally, the code prints the final value of ans.
