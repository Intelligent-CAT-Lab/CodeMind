The code takes an input string and splits it into a list of integers. The variables e and f are assigned the values of the 5th and 6th elements in the list, respectively.
Then, the code initializes an empty list called listx and assigns the values of the first and second elements in the list to variables a and b, respectively.
The code enters a while loop that continues until a certain condition is met. Inside the while loop, there is another while loop that continues until a certain condition is met.
The code calculates the value of x using the variables a and b, and checks if it is greater than f. If it is, the inner while loop breaks. If not, it checks if x is equal to 0. If it is, it increments the value of j and continues to the next iteration of the inner while loop. If not, it checks if x is already in the listx. If it is not, it appends x to the listx. Then, it increments the value of j and continues to the next iteration of the inner while loop.
After the inner while loop finishes, the value of i is incremented and the code continues to the next iteration of the outer while loop. This process continues until the condition for the outer while loop is met.
Next, the code initializes an empty list called listy and assigns the values of the third and fourth elements in the list to variables c and d, respectively.
The code calculates the maximum value of y that can dissolve in water using the variables f and e, and assigns it to the variable f2.
The code enters a while loop that continues until a certain condition is met. Inside the while loop, there is another while loop that continues until a certain condition is met.
The code calculates the value of y using the variables c and d, and checks if it is greater than f2. If it is, the inner while loop breaks. If not, it checks if y is already in the listy. If it is not, it appends y to the listy. Then, it increments the value of j and continues to the next iteration of the inner while loop.
After the inner while loop finishes, the value of i is incremented and the code continues to the next iteration of the outer while loop. This process continues until the condition for the outer while loop is met.
Next, the code initializes variables xy_max, y_max, and noudo_max to 0.
The code enters a nested for loop that iterates over all combinations of elements in listx and listy. Inside the nested for loop, it assigns the current values of x and y to variables x and y, respectively.
The code checks if the sum of x and y is greater than f. If it is, it continues to the next iteration of the nested for loop. If not, it calculates the ratio of y to the sum of x and y and assigns it to the variable noudo.
The code checks if noudo is greater than or equal to noudo_max. If it is, it updates the values of xy_max, y_max, and noudo_max to the current values of x+y, y, and noudo, respectively.
After the nested for loop finishes, the code converts the values of xy_max and y_max to strings and assigns them to the variable message.
Finally, the code prints the value of message.
