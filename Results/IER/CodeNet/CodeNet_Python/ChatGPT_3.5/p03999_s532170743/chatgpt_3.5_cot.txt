<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string S, which is initialized to "125".
The variable I_MAX is set to the length of S, which is 3 in this case.
The variable values is an empty list that will be used to store the calculated values.

The code defines a recursive function calc, which takes three parameters: val, add, and i.
- val represents the current calculated value.
- add represents the value to be added to val.
- i represents the current index in the string S.

The function calc has a base case: if i is equal to I_MAX, it means that we have reached the end of the string S. In this case, it adds the current value (val + add) to the list values.

If the base case is not met, the function makes two recursive calls:
- The first call adds the current value (val + add) to the next digit in the string (S[i+1]).
- The second call appends the current digit (int(S[i])) to the current value (10*add) and makes a recursive call with the next index (i+1).

The solve function is called, which initializes the calculation by calling the calc function with the first digit of the string (int(S[0])) and the next index (1).

Finally, the code prints the sum of all the values in the list values.
