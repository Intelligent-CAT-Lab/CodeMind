<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input and assigns them to variables h and r.
It then checks if the sum of h and r is equal to 0. If it is, it prints 0.
If the sum of h and r is greater than 0, it prints 1.
If neither of the above conditions are met, it means that the sum of h and r is less than 0, so it prints -1.
In this case, the sum of -3 and 3 is 0, so the code will print 0.
<<<Output>>>
0
