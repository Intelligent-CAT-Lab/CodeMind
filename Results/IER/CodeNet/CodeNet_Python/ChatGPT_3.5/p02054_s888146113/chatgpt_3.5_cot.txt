<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input and assigns them to variables a, b, and c.
It initializes a variable cnt to 0, which will be used to count the number of even numbers.
The code then checks if each of the variables a, b, and c is divisible by 2 (i.e., if it is even). If it is, it increments cnt by 1.
After checking all three variables, the code checks if cnt is greater than or equal to 2. If it is, it prints 'Tem'. Otherwise, it prints 'Hom'.
In this case, the values of a, b, and c are 1, 1, and 10, respectively. None of these numbers are even, so cnt remains 0. Therefore, the code will print 'Hom'.
<<<Output>>>
Hom
