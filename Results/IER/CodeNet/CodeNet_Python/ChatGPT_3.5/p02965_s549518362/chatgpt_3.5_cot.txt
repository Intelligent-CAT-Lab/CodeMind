<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines several functions and sets the recursion limit. Then it defines several functions A(), B(), C(), D(), E(), and F(), but only the function C() is called at the end of the code.
The function C() takes two integers n and m as input. It calculates the value of ans using the comb() function, which calculates the combination of two numbers using the fact[] and inv[] arrays. The final value of ans is printed.
The code does not take any input from the user, so the input "2 2" is not used in the code.
