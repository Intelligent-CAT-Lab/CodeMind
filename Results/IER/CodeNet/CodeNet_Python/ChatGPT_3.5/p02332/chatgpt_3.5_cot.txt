<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N and variable K are initialized to 2 and 3, respectively.
The variable MOD is initialized to 10^9 + 7.
The code then checks if K is less than N. In this case, K is not less than N, so the else block is executed.
The variable ans is initialized to 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from K to K-N (exclusive) in steps of -1. In this case, it will iterate from 3 to 1.
For each value v in this range, it multiplies ans by v and takes the modulo MOD. The result is stored back in ans.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 6.
<<<Output>>>
6
