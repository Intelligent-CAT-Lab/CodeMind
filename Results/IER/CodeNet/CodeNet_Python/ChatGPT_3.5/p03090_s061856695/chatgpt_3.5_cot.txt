<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input and assigns it to the variable num.
It then initializes a list called check_list with num*num elements, all set to 0.
The code defines a function called make_bridge that takes two arguments, island1 and island2. It checks if island1 is less than island2 and sets the corresponding element in check_list to 1. Otherwise, it sets the element in check_list to 1 based on the formula (island2-1)*num + (island1-1).
Next, the code checks if num is even or odd. If num is even, it sets sum_pair to num+1. Otherwise, it sets sum_pair to num.
The code then enters a nested loop that iterates over the range of num. The outer loop iterates from 0 to num-1, and the inner loop iterates from 0 to i-1. This loop is used to determine which elements in check_list should be set to 1. If the sum of i+1 and j+1 is not equal to sum_pair, the element at index j*num + i in check_list is set to 1.
After the loop finishes, the code initializes a variable called bridge_num to 0. It then enters another loop that iterates over the range of num*num. If the element at index i in check_list is 1, bridge_num is incremented by 1.
The code then prints the value of bridge_num.
Finally, the code enters another loop that iterates over the range of num*num. If the element at index i in check_list is 1, the code calculates the row and column indices based on the formula left = i // num and right = i % num. It then prints the row and column indices, adding 1 to each index to match the 1-based indexing used in the problem.
