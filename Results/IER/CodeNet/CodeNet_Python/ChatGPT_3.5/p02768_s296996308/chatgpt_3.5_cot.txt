<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function mod_cmb that calculates the combination of two numbers modulo p. It takes three parameters: n, k, and p. It first checks for some base cases and returns 0 or 1 accordingly. Then it calculates the combination using a loop and updates the values of c and d. Finally, it returns the calculated combination modulo p.

The main function takes input values for n, a, and b. It calculates ans as 2^n - 1 modulo mod. Then it calculates tmp_a and tmp_b using the mod_cmb function. Finally, it prints the result of (ans - tmp_a - tmp_b) modulo mod.

In this case, n = 4, a = 1, and b = 3. The code calculates ans as 2^4 - 1 = 15 modulo 1000000007, which is 15. Then it calculates tmp_a as the combination of 4 and 1 modulo 1000000007, which is 4. Similarly, tmp_b is calculated as the combination of 4 and 3 modulo 1000000007, which is 4. Finally, it prints (15 - 4 - 4) modulo 1000000007, which is 7.
