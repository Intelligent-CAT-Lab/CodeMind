<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and variable m are initialized to 3 and 8, respectively.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider values 0, 1, 2, and 3 for i.
For each value of i, it calculates the value of f using the formula 2 * i + 4 * (n - i).
The code then checks if f is equal to m. In this case, f is 8 and m is also 8, so the condition is met.
The code prints 'Yes' and breaks out of the loop.
Since the loop is broken, the else block is not executed.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
