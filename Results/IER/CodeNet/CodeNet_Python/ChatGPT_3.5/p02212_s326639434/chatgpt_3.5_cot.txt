<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four integers as input and assigns them to variables a, b, c, and d.
It then creates a list x with six elements, each element being the result of a mathematical expression involving the input variables.
The code uses the map function to apply the abs function to each element of x, and then finds the minimum value among these absolute values.
Finally, it prints the minimum value.
In this case, the input values are 2, 1, 3, and 4.
The expressions in the list x are:
- a+b-c-d = 2+1-3-4 = -4
- a+c-b-d = 2+3-1-4 = 0
- a+d-b-c = 2+4-1-3 = 2
- b+c-a-d = 1+3-2-4 = -2
- b+d-a-c = 1+4-2-3 = 0
- c+d-a-b = 3+4-2-1 = 4
The absolute values of these expressions are:
- abs(-4) = 4
- abs(0) = 0
- abs(2) = 2
- abs(-2) = 2
- abs(0) = 0
- abs(4) = 4
The minimum value among these absolute values is 0.
