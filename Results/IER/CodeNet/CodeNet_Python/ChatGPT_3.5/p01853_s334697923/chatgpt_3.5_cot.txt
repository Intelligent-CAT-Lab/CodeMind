<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers n and m as input.
It then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n-1.
Inside the loop, it checks if the current value of i is non-zero. If it is, it prints a space character.
Then it checks if the current value of i is less than or equal to n/2. If it is, it prints a "0" character.
Otherwise, it prints the value of m formatted as a string.
After the loop finishes, it prints an empty string, which results in a newline character being printed.
In this case, n=3 and m=100. So, the loop will iterate three times with i taking the values 0, 1, and 2.
For i=0, it prints "0".
For i=1, it prints " 0".
For i=2, it prints " 100".
Finally, it prints a newline character.
<<<Output>>>
0 0 100
