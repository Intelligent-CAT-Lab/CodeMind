<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers X and Y as input and assigns them to variables X and Y respectively.
The code then checks if the absolute difference between X and Y is less than or equal to 1. If it is, it prints 'Brown'. Otherwise, it prints 'Alice'.
In this case, the absolute difference between 2 and 1 is 1, which is less than or equal to 1. Therefore, the code will print 'Brown'.
<<<Output>>>
Brown
