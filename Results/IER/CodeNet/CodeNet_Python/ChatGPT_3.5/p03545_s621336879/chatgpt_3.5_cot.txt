<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an input string S, which is "1222" in this case.
It then enters a loop that iterates through all possible combinations of "+" and "-" repeated 3 times. This means it will consider all possible combinations of 3 "+" or "-" signs.
For each combination, it converts it to a list and appends an empty string to it.
It then creates a new list called sum_ that contains the sum of each corresponding character in S and the combination of signs.
Next, it uses the eval() function to evaluate the expression formed by joining the elements of sum_ as a string.
If the evaluated expression is equal to 7, it prints the expression followed by "=7" and breaks out of the loop.
Since the loop only has one iteration, it will only consider one combination of signs.
The sum_ list will be ["1+2+2+2", "1+2+2-2", "1+2+2", "1+2-2", "1+2", "1-2+2+2", "1-2+2-2", "1-2+2", "1-2-2", "1-2", "1+2+2+2", "1+2+2-2", "1+2+2", "1+2-2", "1+2", "1-2+2+2", "1-2+2-2", "1-2+2", "1-2-2", "1-2"].
The evaluated expressions will be [7, 3, 5, 1, 3, 3, -1, 1, -3, -1, 7, 3, 5, 1, 3, 3, -1, 1, -3, -1].
Since the first evaluated expression is equal to 7, the code will print "1+2+2+2=7" and break out of the loop.
<<<Output>>>
1+2+2+2=7
