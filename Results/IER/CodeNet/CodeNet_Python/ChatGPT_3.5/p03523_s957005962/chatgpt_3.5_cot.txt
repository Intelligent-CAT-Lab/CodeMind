<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string S.
It first checks if the substring "AA" is present in S. If it is, it prints "NO" and exits.
If "AA" is not present, it replaces all occurrences of "KIH" with an empty string and then replaces all occurrences of "A" with an empty string in the resulting string.
If the resulting string is equal to "BR", it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".
In this case, the input string is "KIHBR". The substring "AA" is not present in the string, so the code proceeds to the next condition.
The string "KIHBR" does not contain "KIH", so it remains unchanged. Then, it replaces all occurrences of "A" with an empty string, resulting in "KIHBR".
Since "KIHBR" is not equal to "BR", the code prints "NO".
<<<Output>>>
NO
