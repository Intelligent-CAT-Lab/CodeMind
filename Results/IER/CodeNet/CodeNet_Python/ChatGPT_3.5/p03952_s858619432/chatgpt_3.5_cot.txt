The variable n is initialized to 4 and the variable x is initialized to 4.
The code then checks if x is equal to 1 or 2 * n - 1. In this case, x is not equal to 1 or 2 * n - 1, so the condition is not met and the code continues.
The code then checks if n is equal to 2. In this case, n is not equal to 2, so the condition is not met and the code continues.
The code then checks if x is equal to 2. In this case, x is not equal to 2, so the condition is not met and the code continues.
The variable y is initialized to [x - 1, x, x + 1, x - 2], which is [3, 4, 5, 2] in this case.
The variable ANS is initialized as an empty list.
The variable i is initialized to 1.
The code then enters a while loop that continues as long as i is less than 2 * n and the length of ANS is less than 2 * n - 1.
Inside the loop, the code checks if i is in the list y. If it is, i is incremented by 4.
The code then checks if the length of ANS is equal to n - 3. In this case, the length of ANS is not equal to n - 3, so the condition is not met and the code continues.
The code appends i to the list ANS and increments i by 1.
The loop continues until the length of ANS is equal to 2 * n - 1 or i is equal to 2 * n.
After the loop finishes, the code prints "Yes" and then prints each element in the list ANS on a new line.
