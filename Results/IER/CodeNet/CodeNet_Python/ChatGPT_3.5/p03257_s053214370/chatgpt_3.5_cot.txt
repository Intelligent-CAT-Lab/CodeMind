<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by importing necessary libraries and setting up some initial variables.
It then generates a list of prime numbers up to 100000 using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm.
Next, it initializes a 2D list called 'ans' with dimensions 502x502, filled with 1s.
Then, it iterates over each element in 'ans' and performs some calculations based on the indices i and j.
If the sum of i and j is even, it calculates two positions 'pos1' and 'pos2' based on the indices and checks if the values at those positions in the 'primes' list are prime numbers. If they are, it multiplies the corresponding element in 'ans' by those prime numbers.
Next, it iterates over each element in 'ans' again, but this time only for odd values of the sum of i and j.
For each element, it multiplies it by the elements above, below, left, and right of it in 'ans', and then takes the square root of the result and adds 1 to it.
Finally, it prints the elements in 'ans' for the first N rows, excluding the first column.
