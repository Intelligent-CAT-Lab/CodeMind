<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input and assigns them to variables a and b.
It then checks three conditions:
1. If a is divisible by 3 (a%3==0)
2. If b is divisible by 3 (b%3==0)
3. If the sum of a and b is divisible by 3 ((a+b)%3==0)

If any of these conditions is true, it prints "Possible". Otherwise, it prints "Impossible".

In this case, a=4 and b=5. Neither a nor b is divisible by 3, and the sum of a and b is 9, which is divisible by 3. Therefore, the condition (a+b)%3==0 is true, and the code will print "Possible".
<<<Output>>>
Possible
