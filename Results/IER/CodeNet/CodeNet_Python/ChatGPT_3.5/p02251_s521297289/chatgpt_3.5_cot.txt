<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input and assigns it to the variable n.
The variable c is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of coins needed.
The code then performs a series of calculations to determine the number of quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies needed to represent the given amount of money.
First, it calculates the number of quarters by performing integer division of n by 25 and adds it to c. It then updates n to the remainder after dividing by 25.
Next, it calculates the number of dimes by performing integer division of n by 10 and adds it to c. It then updates n to the remainder after dividing by 10.
Then, it calculates the number of nickels by performing integer division of n by 5 and adds it to c.
Finally, it adds the remaining value of n to c, which represents the number of pennies.
The code then prints the final value of c, which represents the total number of coins needed to represent the given amount of money.
In this case, the input is 100. So, the code will calculate the number of quarters (4), dimes (0), nickels (0), and pennies (0) needed. Therefore, the output will be 4.
