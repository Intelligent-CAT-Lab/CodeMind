<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input N and assigns it to the variable N.
It then calculates the quotient and remainder when N is divided by 100 using the divmod() function.
The quotient is stored in the variable q and the remainder is stored in the variable mod.
The code checks if the remainder mod is less than or equal to the product of the quotient q and 5.
If the condition is true, it prints 1. Otherwise, it prints 0.
In this case, N is 615. When divided by 100, the quotient is 6 and the remainder is 15.
Since 15 is greater than 6 * 5, the condition is false and the code prints 0.
<<<Output>>>
0
