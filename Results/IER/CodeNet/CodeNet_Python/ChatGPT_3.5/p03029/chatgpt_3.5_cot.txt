<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, `a` and `p`, and stores them in variables.
It then calculates the expression `(3*a+p)//2` and prints the result.
In this case, `a` is 1 and `p` is 3.
So the expression becomes `(3*1+3)//2`, which simplifies to `(6)//2` and finally to `3`.
Therefore, the output of the code execution would be `3`.
