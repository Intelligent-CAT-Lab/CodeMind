<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input from the user using the input() function. The input is then converted to an integer using the int() function. In this case, the input is 5700.
The code then performs integer division of the input by 500 using the // operator. This will result in the quotient of the division, which is 11 in this case.
The quotient is then multiplied by 500 using the * operator. This will result in the value 5500.
Finally, the value is converted back to an integer using the int() function and printed using the print() function.
<<<Output>>>
5500
