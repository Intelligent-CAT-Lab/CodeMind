<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string `n` which represents a four-digit number.
It then extracts the first two digits of `n` and converts them to an integer, storing it in variable `a`.
Similarly, it extracts the last two digits of `n` and converts them to an integer, storing it in variable `b`.
The code then checks if `b` is equal to 0 or greater than 12. If either condition is true, it checks if `a` is between 1 and 12 (inclusive). If this condition is true, it prints "MMYY". If `a` is not between 1 and 12, it prints "NA".
If `b` is not equal to 0 and not greater than 12, the code checks if `a` is between 1 and 12 (inclusive). If this condition is true, it prints "AMBIGUOUS". If `a` is not between 1 and 12, it prints "YYMM".
In this case, the input is "1905". The code extracts the first two digits (19) and converts them to integer `a`. It extracts the last two digits (05) and converts them to integer `b`.
Since `b` is not equal to 0 and not greater than 12, the code checks if `a` is between 1 and 12. In this case, `a` is 19 which is not between 1 and 12.
Therefore, the code prints "YYMM".
