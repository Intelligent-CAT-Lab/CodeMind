<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes input in the form of a string and splits it into a list of integers using the map function.
The input "3 5" is split into the list [3, 5].
The code then prints the product of the first and second elements of the list, which is 3*5 = 15.
It also prints the sum of the first and second elements multiplied by 2, which is (3+5)*2 = 16.
<<<Output>>>
15 16
