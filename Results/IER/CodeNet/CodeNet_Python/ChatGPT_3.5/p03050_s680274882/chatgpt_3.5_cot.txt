<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized to 8.
The code then initializes an empty list called factors, which will be used to store the factors of N.
The variable d is calculated as the floor of the square root of N.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to d (inclusive).
For each number i in this range, it checks if N is divisible by i. If it is, it appends i and N//i to the factors list.
After the loop finishes, the code initializes a variable ans to 0.
The code then enters another loop that iterates over the factors list.
For each factor f in the list, it checks if f is equal to 1. If it is, it continues to the next iteration of the loop.
Otherwise, it calculates the quotient and remainder of dividing N by f-1 and assigns them to variables s and t, respectively.
If s is equal to t, it means that the quotient and remainder are equal, so it adds f-1 to ans.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 7.
