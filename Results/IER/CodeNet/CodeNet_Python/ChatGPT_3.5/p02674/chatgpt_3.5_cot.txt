<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a dictionary called `dic` which maps certain numbers to their corresponding values.
The code then reads an integer `n` from the input.
If `n` is a key in the dictionary `dic`, the code prints the corresponding value.
Otherwise, it prints -1.
In this case, `n` is 2, which is a key in the dictionary `dic` with a corresponding value of 1.
Therefore, the output of the code execution would be 1.
