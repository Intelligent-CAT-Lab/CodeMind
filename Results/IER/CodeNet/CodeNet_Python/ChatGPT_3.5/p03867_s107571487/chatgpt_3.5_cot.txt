<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers, n and k, from the input. It then initializes a variable M to 10^9 + 7.
The code defines a function fs(n) that enumerates the divisors of n and returns them in a sorted list.
The code calls fs(n) and stores the result in the variable ds. It also initializes a variable m to the length of ds.
The code creates an empty list called nums with m elements.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the range of m. For each iteration, it calculates a value based on k and the current divisor ds[i].
Inside this loop, there is another loop that iterates over the range of i. For each iteration, it checks if ds[i] is divisible by ds[j]. If it is, it subtracts the value of nums[j] from the current value and takes the modulus M.
After the inner loop finishes, the code assigns the calculated value to nums[i].
The code initializes a variable ans to 0 and calculates the inverse of 2 modulo M, storing it in inv2.
The code then enters another loop that iterates over the range of m. For each iteration, it checks if ds[i] is even. If it is, it adds ds[i] * nums[i] * inv2 to ans. Otherwise, it adds ds[i] * nums[i] to ans.
Finally, the code takes the modulus M of ans and prints the result.
