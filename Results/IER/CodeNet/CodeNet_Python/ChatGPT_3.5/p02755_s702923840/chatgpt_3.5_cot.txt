<<<Analysis>>>
The variable a is initialized to 2 and variable b is initialized to 2.
The code then creates a list x with 10 elements, all initialized to 0.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 9 (inclusive). For each iteration, it assigns the value b*10 + i to the i-th element of the list x. In this case, since b is 2, the values assigned to x are [20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29].
The code then enters another loop that iterates from 0 to 9 (inclusive). For each iteration, it checks if a is equal to the integer value of x[i]*0.08. In this case, x[i]*0.08 is equal to 1.6, so the condition is not met for any value of i.
Since the condition is not met for any value of i, the code executes the else block of the loop, which prints -1.
<<<Output>>>
-1
