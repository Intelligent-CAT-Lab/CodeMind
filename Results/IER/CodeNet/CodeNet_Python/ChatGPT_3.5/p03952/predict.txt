<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized to 4 and the variable x is initialized to 4.
The code then checks if x is equal to 1 or 2*N-1. In this case, x is not equal to 1 or 2*N-1, so the code continues.
The code then checks if N is not equal to 1. Since N is equal to 4, the code prints 'No' and exits.
The output is 'No'.
[Output]
No
