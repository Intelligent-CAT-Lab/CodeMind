<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input: a, b, and c.
It initializes a variable d to 0, which will be used to count the number of iterations in the while loop.
The while loop continues as long as a, b, and c are all even numbers (i.e., divisible by 2).
Inside the while loop, it checks if a, b, and c are all equal. If they are, it prints -1 and breaks out of the loop.
Otherwise, it increments d by 1 and calculates new values for a, b, and c by dividing each of them by 2 and adding the other two halves.
After the while loop finishes, it prints the value of d.
In this case, the while loop will iterate twice because a, b, and c are all initially even numbers.
On the first iteration, d becomes 1 and the new values for a, b, and c are 16, 14, and 12, respectively.
On the second iteration, d becomes 2 and the new values for a, b, and c are 13, 18, and 15, respectively.
Since a, b, and c are no longer all even numbers, the while loop condition is no longer satisfied and the code prints the final value of d, which is 2.
