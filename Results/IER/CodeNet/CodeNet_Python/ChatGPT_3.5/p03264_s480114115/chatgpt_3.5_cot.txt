<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input and assigns it to the variable k.
It then calculates the integer division of k by 2 and assigns it to the variable k1.
Next, it subtracts k1 from k and assigns the result to the variable k2.
Finally, it prints the product of k1 and k2.
In this case, since the input is 3, k1 will be 1 (3//2) and k2 will be 2 (3-1).
The code then prints the product of k1 and k2, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
