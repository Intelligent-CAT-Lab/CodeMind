<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by defining a function called `input()` which overrides the default `input()` function. This new `input()` function reads input from `sys.stdin` and strips any leading or trailing whitespace.

The code then reads an integer `N` from the input.

Next, there is a function called `sum_N(N)` which takes an integer `N` as input. This function calculates the sum of the digits of `N` by repeatedly dividing `N` by 10 and adding the remainder to a running total. The function returns the total.

The variable `ans` is initialized to a very large number, 1000000000000.

The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to `N-1`. For each iteration, it calculates the sum of the digits of `i` and the sum of the digits of `N-i` using the `sum_N()` function. It then adds these two sums together and compares the result to the current value of `ans`. If the sum is smaller than `ans`, `ans` is updated to the new smaller value.

After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of `ans`.
