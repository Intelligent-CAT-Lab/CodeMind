<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input and assigns it to the variable n.
It initializes two variables, ans and tmp, to 0 and 1 respectively.
The code then enters a while loop that continues as long as n is greater than tmp.
Inside the loop, tmp is multiplied by 3 and ans is incremented by 1.
This process continues until tmp becomes greater than or equal to n.
Finally, the code prints the value of ans, which represents the number of times tmp was multiplied by 3.
In this case, the loop will run 3 times because 1 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 27, which is greater than 8.
Therefore, the output of the code execution will be 3.

3
