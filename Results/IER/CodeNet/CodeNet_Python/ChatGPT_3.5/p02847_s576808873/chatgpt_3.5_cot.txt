<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input from the user and stores it in the variable i.
Then it checks the value of i using multiple if-elif statements.
If i is equal to "SUN", it prints "7".
If i is equal to "MON", it prints "6".
If i is equal to "TUE", it prints "5".
If i is equal to "WED", it prints "4".
If i is equal to "THU", it prints "3".
If i is equal to "FRI", it prints "2".
If none of the above conditions are met, it prints "1".
In this case, the input is "SAT", so the last condition is met and the output is "1".
