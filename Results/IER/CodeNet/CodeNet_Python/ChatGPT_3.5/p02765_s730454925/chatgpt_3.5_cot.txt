<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs, n and r, and assigns them to the variables n and r respectively.
It then checks if n is less than 10. If it is, it calculates the value of z using the formula r + (100 * (10 - n)). Otherwise, it assigns the value of r to z.
In this case, n is 2 which is less than 10, so the formula is used to calculate z.
z = 2919 + (100 * (10 - 2))
   = 2919 + (100 * 8)
   = 2919 + 800
   = 3719
Finally, the code prints the value of z, which is 3719.
<<<Output>>>
3719
