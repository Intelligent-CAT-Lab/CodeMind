<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string from the input using the input() function.
Then it calls the upper() method on the string to convert all characters to uppercase.
Finally, it prints the resulting string.
In this case, the input string is "this is a pen.".
After converting it to uppercase, the resulting string is "THIS IS A PEN.".
<<<Output>>>
THIS IS A PEN.
