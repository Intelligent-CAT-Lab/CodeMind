<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input: a, b, and x.
It calculates the difference between a and b and stores it in the variable d.
Then it calculates the maximum of 0 and (x - b) divided by d and stores it in the variable n.
Next, it calculates ans by adding x and n multiplied by b.
Finally, it prints the remainder of ans divided by 1000000007.
In this case, a = 3, b = 1, and x = 5.
The difference between a and b is 2.
The maximum of 0 and (5 - 1) divided by 2 is 2.
ans is calculated as 5 + 2 * 1, which is 7.
The remainder of 7 divided by 1000000007 is 7.
<<<Output>>>
7
