<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized to 4 and the variable k is initialized to 2.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to store the final result.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to N-2 (inclusive), which means it will iterate 3 times in this case.
In each iteration, the code updates the value of ans using the formula (ans * k + k - 1) // (k - 1).
In the first iteration, ans is updated to (0 * 2 + 2 - 1) // (2 - 1) = 1.
In the second iteration, ans is updated to (1 * 2 + 2 - 1) // (2 - 1) = 3.
In the third iteration, ans is updated to (3 * 2 + 2 - 1) // (2 - 1) = 7.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 7.
<<<Output>>>
