<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input and assigns it to the variable n.
It initializes a variable c to 0, which will be used to count the number of times the loop runs.
The code then enters a while loop that continues as long as n is greater than 1.
In each iteration of the loop, it right shifts the value of n by 1 (equivalent to dividing it by 2) and increments the value of c by 1.
This process continues until n becomes 1 or less.
Finally, the code prints the value of 1 left shifted by c, which is equivalent to multiplying 1 by 2 raised to the power of c.
In this case, the value of c will be 5, so the output will be 1 << 5 = 32.
<<<Output>>>
32
