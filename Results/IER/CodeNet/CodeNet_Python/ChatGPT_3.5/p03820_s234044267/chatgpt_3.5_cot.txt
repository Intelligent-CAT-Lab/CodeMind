<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by importing necessary libraries and defining some constants and functions.
Then, it reads the input values for N and K.
The main function is called with N and K as arguments.
Inside the main function, K is decremented by 1.
A variable U is initialized to 5000.
A 2D array C of size UxU is created and initialized with zeros.
A loop is started from 1 to U, and for each iteration, the values of C are updated based on the previous row.
Another 2D array dp of size (N+10)x(N+10) is created and initialized with zeros.
A loop is started from 1 to N+10, and for each iteration, the values of dp are updated based on the previous row and column.
Another loop is started from N+9 to 0 (in reverse order), and for each iteration, the values of dp are updated by subtracting the values of the previous row.
A variable ans is initialized to 0.
If K is equal to N-1, the function returns the sum of the last column of dp modulo MOD.
Otherwise, a loop is started from N-K to N+1, and for each iteration, the variable x is calculated based on the values of C, dp, a, and b.
The variable ans is updated by adding x.
Finally, ans is updated by taking modulo MOD and multiplying it by 2^(N-K-2) modulo MOD.
The final value of ans is returned modulo MOD.
