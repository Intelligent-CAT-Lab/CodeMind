<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input N and calculates the square root of N, storing it in the variable n.
It then initializes an empty list called plist.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n+1, and for each iteration, it checks if N is divisible by i. If it is, it appends i to plist. It also checks if i is not equal to N/i, and if it is not, it appends N/i to plist as well.
After the loop finishes, the code initializes a variable ans to 0.
The code then enters another loop that iterates over the length of plist.
For each iteration, it assigns the current element of plist to the variable x.
It calculates the value of kari by dividing N by x and subtracting 1.
If kari is equal to 0, it does nothing.
Otherwise, it calculates the values of q and r by dividing N by kari and finding the remainder.
If q is equal to r, it adds kari to ans.
Finally, the code prints the value of ans.
