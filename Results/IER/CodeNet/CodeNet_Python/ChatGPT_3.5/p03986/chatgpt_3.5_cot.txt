<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string X.
It initializes two variables, ans and memo, to 0.
Then it enters a loop that iterates over the characters of the input string X.
For each character, it checks if it is equal to "T".
If it is, it checks the value of memo.
If memo is 0, it does nothing.
If memo is not 0, it subtracts 1 from memo.
If the character is not equal to "T", it adds 1 to memo.
After the loop finishes, it prints the value of memo multiplied by 2.
In this case, the input string is "TSTTSS".
The code goes through the following steps:
- The first character is "T", memo is 0, so nothing happens.
- The second character is "S", memo becomes 1.
- The third character is "T", memo becomes 0.
- The fourth character is "T", memo becomes -1.
- The fifth character is "S", memo becomes 0.
- The sixth character is "S", memo becomes 1.
After the loop finishes, memo is 1, so the code prints 1*2 = 2.
