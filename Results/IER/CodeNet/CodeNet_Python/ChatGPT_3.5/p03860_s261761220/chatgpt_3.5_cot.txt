<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes input as a string and splits it into a list of words. In this case, the input "AtCoder Beginner Contest" will be split into ['AtCoder', 'Beginner', 'Contest'].
Then, it creates a new list by taking the first character of each word in the previous list. So, the new list will be ['A', 'B', 'C'].
Finally, it joins the elements of the new list into a single string, with no separator between them. So, the output will be "ABC".
