<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs, A and B, and assigns them to variables A and B respectively.
Then, it checks if B is greater than or equal to A. If it is, it prints the value of A.
Otherwise, it subtracts 1 from A and prints the result.
In this case, A and B are both 5, so B is equal to A. Therefore, the code will print 5.
<<<Output>>>
5
