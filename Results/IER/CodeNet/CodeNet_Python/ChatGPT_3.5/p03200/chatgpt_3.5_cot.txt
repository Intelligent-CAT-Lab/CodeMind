<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string `s`.
It initializes two variables `cnt` and `l` to 0.
Then it enters a loop that iterates over the indices of the string `s`.
For each index `i`, it checks if the character at that index is 'W'.
If it is, it adds the difference between `i` and `l` to `cnt` and increments `l` by 1.
Finally, it prints the value of `cnt`.

In this case, the input string is "BBW".
The loop iterates over the indices 0, 1, and 2.
At index 0, the character is 'B', so the condition is not met.
At index 1, the character is 'B', so the condition is not met.
At index 2, the character is 'W', so the condition is met.
The difference between `i` (2) and `l` (0) is 2, so `cnt` is incremented by 2.
The final value of `cnt` is 2.
