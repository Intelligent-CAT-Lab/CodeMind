<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string S, which is initialized to 'abac'.
A dictionary s_frq_dict is created with keys 'a', 'b', and 'c', and all values are initialized to 0.
The code then iterates over each character s in the input string S and increments the corresponding value in the dictionary s_frq_dict.
After the loop finishes, the code creates a list frqs containing the values from the dictionary s_frq_dict.
The code then checks if the difference between the maximum and minimum values in frqs is less than or equal to 1.
In this case, the maximum value is 2 and the minimum value is 1, so the condition is met.
Therefore, the code prints 'YES'.
<<<Output>>>
YES
