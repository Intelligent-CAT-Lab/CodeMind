<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function readInts() that reads a line of integers from input and returns them as a list.
The code then initializes a variable mod to 10^9 + 7.
The main function is defined, which reads two integers n and y using the readInts() function.
A variable wa is initialized to 0.
The code then enters a nested loop that iterates over all possible values of i and j from 0 to n (inclusive).
Inside the loop, the code checks if the sum of i and j is greater than n. If it is, the loop is broken.
The code then calculates the value of y1000 using the formula (y - 10000 * i - 5000 * j) // 1000.
If the sum of i, j, and y1000 is equal to n, the code prints the values of i, j, and y1000 and exits the program.
If no solution is found, the code prints -1, -1, -1 and exits the program.
In this case, the input is 9 and 45000.
The code will iterate over all possible values of i and j from 0 to 9.
For each combination of i and j, it calculates the value of y1000 using the formula (45000 - 10000 * i - 5000 * j) // 1000.
If the sum of i, j, and y1000 is equal to 9, the code will print the values of i, j, and y1000 and exit the program.
If no solution is found, the code will print -1, -1, -1 and exit the program.
