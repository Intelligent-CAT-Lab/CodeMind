<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input and assigns them to variables x and y.
It then checks if x is divisible by y using the modulo operator (%). If the result is 0, it means x is divisible by y.
In this case, it prints -1.
If x is not divisible by y, it prints the value of x.
In the given input (8 6), 8 is not divisible by 6, so the code will print 8.
<<<Output>>>
8
