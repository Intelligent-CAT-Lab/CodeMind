<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input and assigns them to variables a, b, and c.
It then checks if a is less than b and b is less than c. If this condition is true, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
In this case, the condition is not true because 1 is not less than 3. Therefore, the code will print "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
