<<<Analysis>>>
The variables W, H, w, h, x, and y are initialized to 6000, 5000, 20, 10, 400, and 300 respectively.
The code then checks if the condition x+w//2 <= W//2 and y+h//2 <= H//2 is true. In this case, it is not true, so the code moves to the else block.
Inside the else block, the code checks if x+w//2 > W//2. In this case, it is not true, so this block is skipped.
The code then checks if y+h//2 > H//2. In this case, it is not true, so this block is also skipped.
Finally, the code prints the value of y/x, which is 300/400 = 0.75.
<<<Output>>>
0.75
