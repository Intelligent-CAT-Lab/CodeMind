<<<Analysis>>>
The code first checks if the current module is the main module by comparing the value of __name__ with "__main__". If it is, the code proceeds to the next step. Otherwise, it skips the code block and does nothing.

In this case, the current module is the main module, so the code continues to execute.

The code then reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings using the split() method. The lambda function is used to convert each string in the list to an integer using the int() function. The map() function applies this lambda function to each element of the list.

The resulting list of integers is assigned to the variables a and b.

Finally, the code calculates the remainder of a divided by b using the % operator and prints the result.
