<<<Analysis>>>
The code imports necessary modules and defines some utility functions.
It then defines the main function, which takes input from the given function and processes it.
The main function reads two integers S and W from input.
It checks if S is less than or equal to W. If it is, it prints 'unsafe'. Otherwise, it prints 'safe'.
The code then calls the main function.
<<<Output>>>
