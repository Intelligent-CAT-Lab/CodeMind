<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input and assigns them to variables x and y.
Then, it checks if x is greater than y. If it is, it swaps the values of x and y.
Next, it enters a while loop that continues as long as the remainder of x divided by y is not equal to 0.
Inside the loop, it updates the values of x and y. The new value of x is the previous value of y, and the new value of y is the remainder of the previous values of x and y.
Once the loop condition is no longer satisfied, it prints the value of y, which is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of x and y.
In this case, the input is 54 and 20. Since 54 is greater than 20, the values of x and y are swapped to 20 and 54.
Then, in the while loop, the values of x and y are updated as follows:
x = 54 % 20 = 14
y = 20
Since 14 % 20 is not equal to 0, the loop continues.
Next, the values are updated again:
x = 20 % 14 = 6
y = 14
Since 6 % 14 is not equal to 0, the loop continues.
Finally, the values are updated again:
x = 14 % 6 = 2
y = 6
Since 2 % 6 is equal to 0, the loop condition is no longer satisfied and the loop exits.
The code then prints the value of y, which is 2.
