The variable H, W, a, and b are initialized to 3, 3, 2, and 2, respectively.
The code then checks if H is divisible by a or W is divisible by b. If either condition is true, it prints 'Yes' and proceeds with the calculations.
Inside the if statement, it calculates the value of k, which is the number of rectangles that can be formed with dimensions a and b in the grid of size HxW.
It then initializes a 2D list called ansss with dimensions HxW, filled with zeros.
Next, it enters two nested loops that iterate over the number of rectangles that can be formed in the grid.
For each rectangle, it sets the value of the bottom right corner to -x, where x is a constant.
After that, it enters two more nested loops that iterate over the number of rows and columns in the grid.
For each cell, it sets the value to x-1.
Finally, it prints the 2D list ansss, with each row joined by a space and each row separated by a newline character.
If H is not divisible by a or W is not divisible by b, it prints 'No'.
In this case, H is divisible by a and W is divisible by b, so the code proceeds with the calculations.
The final output is:
Yes
-1 -1 -3
-1 -1 -3
-2 -2 -3
