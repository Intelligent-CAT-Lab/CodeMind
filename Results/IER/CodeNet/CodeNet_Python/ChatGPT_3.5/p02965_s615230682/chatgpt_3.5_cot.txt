The variable o is initialized to 998244353 and the variable f is initialized to [1].
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 2500100. For each iteration, it appends the product of the last element of f and i modulo o to f. This means that f will contain the factorial values modulo o for numbers from 0 to 2500100.
The code defines a lambda function c that calculates the binomial coefficient using the factorial values stored in f.
The code then reads two integers n and m from input.
The code calculates the values of w and u, which are 3 times m and n-1, respectively.
The code calculates the value of a using the binomial coefficient function c. It subtracts n times the binomial coefficient c(n+m-2,u) from c(w+u,u).
If u is greater than m, the code enters another loop that iterates from m+1 to the minimum of w and n+1. For each iteration, it checks if the bitwise AND of w-i+1 and 1 is non-zero. If it is, it subtracts the product of the binomial coefficients c(n,i) and c((w-i)//2+u,u) from a.
Finally, the code prints the value of a modulo o.
