<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input: n, m, and k.
It initializes the variable ans to 0 and the variable INF to 10^9 + 7.
Then it checks if n is less than or equal to m. If it is, it performs some calculations and enters a nested loop.
The outer loop iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), and the inner loop iterates from i to n (inclusive).
Inside the loops, it checks if i is equal to j. If it is, it adds the value of Ms to ans. Otherwise, it calculates the difference between j and i and adds d*m^2 + M to ans.
After the loops, it imports the math module and performs some calculations on ans using the factorial function from the math module.
Finally, it prints the value of ans.

In this case, n=2, m=2, and k=2.
The code checks if n is less than or equal to m, which is true.
It performs some calculations and enters the nested loop.
The outer loop iterates from 1 to 2, and the inner loop also iterates from 1 to 2.
Inside the loops, it checks if i is equal to j, which is true when i=1 and j=1. It adds the value of Ms to ans.
After the loops, it performs some calculations on ans using the factorial function from the math module.
Finally, it prints the value of ans.
