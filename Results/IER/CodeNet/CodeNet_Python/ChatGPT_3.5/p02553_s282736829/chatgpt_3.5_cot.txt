<<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the necessary modules and defines some input functions.
Then, it reads the input values for variables a, b, c, and d.
The code calculates four products: p = a*c, q = a*d, r = b*c, and s = b*d.
Finally, it prints the maximum value among p, q, r, and s.
In this case, the input values are 1, 2, 1, and 1, respectively.
So, the code calculates p = 1*1 = 1, q = 1*1 = 1, r = 2*1 = 2, and s = 2*1 = 2.
The maximum value among these is 2, so the output will be 2.
