<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines two functions: xgcd and modinv. The xgcd function calculates the extended greatest common divisor of two numbers, while the modinv function calculates the modular inverse of a number. 

The code then initializes the variable MOD to 10^9 + 7, and reads two integers x and y from input.

The code checks if the sum of x and y is divisible by 3 and if 3*x is greater than or equal to the sum of x and y, and if 3*y is greater than or equal to the sum of x and y. If any of these conditions is not met, it prints 0 and exits the program.

If the conditions are met, the code calculates the value of n as the integer division of the sum of x and y by 3. It then subtracts n from both x and y.

The code initializes a list called fact with the first two elements as 1. It then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to n (inclusive), and for each iteration, it appends to the fact list the product of the previous element in the list and the current iteration, modulo MOD.

The code then calculates the values of factX, factY, and factN as the elements of the fact list corresponding to x, y, and n, respectively.

The code calculates the value of c as the product of factN, the modular inverse of factX modulo MOD, and the modular inverse of factY modulo MOD. It then takes the modulo of c with MOD.

Finally, the code prints the value of c.
