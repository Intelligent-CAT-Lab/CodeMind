<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers A, B, and C as input.
It then checks if the sum of A and B is less than C.
If the condition is true, it prints "No".
Otherwise, it prints "Yes".
In this case, the sum of 50 and 100 is 150, which is not less than 120.
Therefore, the code will print "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
