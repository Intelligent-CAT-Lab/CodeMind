<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called rep_pow that takes three arguments: a, k, and p. This function calculates the exponentiation of a raised to the power of k modulo p.

The code then reads two integers, m and n, from the input.

Finally, the code calls the rep_pow function with arguments m and n, and prints the result.

In this case, m is 2 and n is 3. The rep_pow function calculates 2^3 mod (10^9 + 7), which is 8.

<<<Output>>>
8
