<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by taking an integer input N, which is 15 in this case.
Then, it initializes a variable ans to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers that are not divisible by 3 or 5.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 15.
For each number i in this range, it checks if i is not divisible by 3 or 5. If it is not, it adds i to ans.
In this case, the numbers that are not divisible by 3 or 5 are 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 11, 13, and 14.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 60.
<<<Output>>>
60
