<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input and assigns it to the variable x.
It then calculates the number of hours (h) by dividing x by 3600 (the number of seconds in an hour) using integer division.
Next, it calculates the number of minutes (m) by taking the remainder of x divided by 3600 and dividing it by 60 (the number of seconds in a minute) using integer division.
Finally, it calculates the number of seconds (s) by taking the remainder of x divided by 60.
The code then prints the values of h, m, and s in the format "h:m:s".
For the input 46979, the code will calculate h = 13, m = 2, and s = 59.
<<<Output>>>
