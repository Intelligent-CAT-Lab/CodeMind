<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three inputs: a, b, and n. These inputs are then assigned to the variables a, b, and n, respectively.
The code then checks if b is less than or equal to n+1. If it is, it assigns the value of b-1 to the variable x. Otherwise, it assigns the value of n to x.
Next, the code calculates the value of g using the formula floor(a*x/b), where floor is a function from the math module that rounds down to the nearest integer.
Finally, the code prints the value of g.
In this case, a=5, b=7, and n=4. Since b is greater than n+1, x is assigned the value of n, which is 4. Then, g is calculated as floor(5*4/7), which is 2. Finally, the code prints the value of g, which is 2.
