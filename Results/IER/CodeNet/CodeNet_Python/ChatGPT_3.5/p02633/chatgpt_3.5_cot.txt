<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input and assigns it to the variable x.
Then, it enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 10^5 (exclusive).
For each iteration, it checks if 360 * i is divisible by x without any remainder.
If it is, it prints the result of the division (360 * i // x) and breaks out of the loop.
In this case, the code will find the first value of i for which 360 * i is divisible by 90 without any remainder. Since 360 is divisible by 90, the first value of i that satisfies the condition is 1.
Therefore, the output of the code execution will be 4.
