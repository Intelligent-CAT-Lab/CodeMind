<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs N and K using the map function and split method. The input is split by space and assigned to variables N and K respectively. In this case, N is assigned the value 2 and K is assigned the value 3.
The code then uses the pow function to calculate the value of K raised to the power of N, modulo 10^9+7. The result is printed.
In this case, 3 raised to the power of 2 is 9. Modulo 10^9+7, the result is 9.
<<<Output>>>
9
