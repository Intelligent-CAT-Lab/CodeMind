<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three inputs: a, b, and x. These inputs are converted to integers and assigned to the variables a, b, and x, respectively.
The code then imports the math module.
Next, it calculates the value of h by dividing x by the square of a.
The code checks if h is greater than or equal to b/2. If it is, it calculates the value of V using the formula 2*((a**2)*b - x)/a**3 and then calculates the value of ans by taking the arctangent of V and converting it to degrees.
If h is not greater than or equal to b/2, it calculates the value of V using the formula a*(b**2)/(2*x) and then calculates the value of ans by taking the arctangent of V and converting it to degrees.
Finally, the code prints the value of ans.
