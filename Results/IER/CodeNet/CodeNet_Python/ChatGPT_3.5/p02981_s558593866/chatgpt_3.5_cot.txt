<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three inputs: n, a, and b. These inputs are separated by spaces and are converted to integers using the map() function.
The code then calculates the minimum value between a*n and b.
Finally, the code prints the result of the minimum calculation.
In this case, n=4, a=2, and b=9.
The minimum value between 2*4 and 9 is 8, so the output will be 8.
<<<Output>>>
8
