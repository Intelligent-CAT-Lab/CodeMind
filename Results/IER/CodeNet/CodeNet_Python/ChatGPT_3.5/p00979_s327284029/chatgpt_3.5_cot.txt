<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads an integer n from the input.
It initializes two variables, reserved and maxspeed, to 1.
Then it enters a while loop that continues until a break statement is encountered.
Inside the loop, it checks if the sum of reserved and maxspeed multiplied by 3 is greater than n.
If it is, the loop breaks.
Otherwise, it multiplies maxspeed by 3 and adds maxspeed multiplied by 2 to reserved.
After the loop, it initializes ans to 1 and subtracts 1 from n.
Then it enters another while loop that continues until i is greater than maxspeed.
Inside the loop, it adds 2 to ans, subtracts i multiplied by 2 from n, and multiplies i by 3.
After the loop, it subtracts maxspeed from n.
Finally, it enters a third while loop that continues until i is 0.
Inside the loop, it adds the integer division of n by i to ans, subtracts the product of the integer division of n by i and i from n, and divides i by 3.
The code then writes the value of ans plus 1 to the output.
