<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input and assigns it to the variable `a`.
Then, it checks the remainder of `a` divided by 7 using the modulo operator `%`.
If the remainder is 1, it prints "fri".
If the remainder is 2, it prints "sat".
If the remainder is 3, it prints "sun".
If the remainder is 4, it prints "mon".
If the remainder is 5, it prints "tue".
If the remainder is 6, it prints "wed".
If the remainder is 0, it prints "thu".
In this case, the input is 1, so the remainder of 1 divided by 7 is 1. Therefore, the code will print "fri".
<<<Output>>>
fri
