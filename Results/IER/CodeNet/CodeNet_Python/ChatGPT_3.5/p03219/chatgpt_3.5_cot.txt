<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input and assigns them to the variables ab and bc.
Then it calculates the fare by adding ab to half of bc and assigns it to the variable fare.
Finally, it prints the value of fare.
In this case, ab is 81 and bc is 58.
So the fare will be 81 + 58/2 = 81 + 29 = 110.
<<<Output>>>
110
