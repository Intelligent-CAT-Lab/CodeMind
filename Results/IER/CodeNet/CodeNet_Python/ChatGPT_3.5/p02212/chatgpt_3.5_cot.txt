<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes input as a string of numbers separated by spaces and converts it into a list of integers using the map() and list() functions.
The list is then sorted in ascending order using the sorted() function.
The code then calculates the absolute difference between the sum of the first and last elements of the sorted list and the sum of the second and third elements.
Finally, the code prints the calculated difference.
In this case, the input is "2 1 3 4", which is converted to the list [2, 1, 3, 4].
After sorting the list, it becomes [1, 2, 3, 4].
The code then calculates the absolute difference between (1 + 4) and (2 + 3), which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
