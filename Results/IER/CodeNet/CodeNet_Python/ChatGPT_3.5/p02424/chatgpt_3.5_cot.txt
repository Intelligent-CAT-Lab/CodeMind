<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers, a and b, as input.
It then performs bitwise operations on these two numbers.
The first print statement formats the result of the bitwise AND operation between a and b as a binary string with 32 digits.
The second print statement formats the result of the bitwise OR operation between a and b as a binary string with 32 digits.
The third print statement formats the result of the bitwise XOR operation between a and b as a binary string with 32 digits.
In this case, a is 8 and b is 10.
The binary representation of 8 is 00000000000000000000000000001000.
The binary representation of 10 is 00000000000000000000000000001010.
The bitwise AND operation between 8 and 10 results in 00000000000000000000000000001000, which is 8 in decimal.
The bitwise OR operation between 8 and 10 results in 00000000000000000000000000001010, which is 10 in decimal.
The bitwise XOR operation between 8 and 10 results in 00000000000000000000000000000010, which is 2 in decimal.
