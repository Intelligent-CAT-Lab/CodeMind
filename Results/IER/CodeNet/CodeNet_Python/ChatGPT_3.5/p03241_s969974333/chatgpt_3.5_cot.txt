<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by importing the necessary modules and defining some helper functions.
Then, it reads the input values N and M.
Next, it defines a function make_divisors(n) that returns a list of divisors of n.
The code creates a list div that contains the divisors of M, including 1.
The div list is sorted in ascending order.
The code then uses the bisect_left function from the bisect module to find the index of the first element in div that is greater than or equal to N. This index is stored in the variable g.
Finally, the code prints the result of M divided by g.
In this case, N is 3 and M is 14.
The div list will be [1, 2, 7, 14].
The bisect_left function will return the index 2, since div[2] is the first element greater than or equal to 3.
Therefore, g will be 7.
The result of M divided by g is 2.
