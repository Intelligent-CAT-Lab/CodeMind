<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input and assigns them to variables X, Y, and Z.
It then calculates the value of (X-Z)//(Y+Z), which means it subtracts Z from X and then divides the result by the sum of Y and Z.
In this case, X=13, Y=3, and Z=1.
So, (X-Z)//(Y+Z) = (13-1)//(3+1) = 12//4 = 3.
Therefore, the output of the code would be 3.
<<<Output>>>
