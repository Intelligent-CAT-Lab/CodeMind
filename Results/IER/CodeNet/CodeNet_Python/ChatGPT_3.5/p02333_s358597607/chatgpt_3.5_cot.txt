<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized to 4 and variable K is initialized to 3.
The code then initializes the variable MOD to 10^9 + 7.
Next, it precomputes the factorial and inverse values using a loop from 2 to K+1.
For each value i, it calculates the factorial[i] and inverse[i] using the previous values in the lists.
After the precomputation, the code defines a function nCr(n, r) to calculate the combination of n choose r using the precomputed values.
The code then initializes the variable ans to K^N % MOD.
Next, it enters a loop from r=1 to K+1 and calculates the contribution of each r to the final answer using the inclusion-exclusion principle.
For each r, it subtracts (-1)^(r+1) * nCr(K, r) * (K-r)^N % MOD from ans.
Finally, it prints the final value of ans % MOD.
