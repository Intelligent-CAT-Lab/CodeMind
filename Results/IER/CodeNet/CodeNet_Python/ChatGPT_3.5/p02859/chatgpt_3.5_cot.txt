<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable r.
Then it calculates the square of r by raising it to the power of 2 using the ** operator.
Finally, it prints the result of the calculation, which is the square of the input number.
In this case, the input is 2, so the output will be 4.
