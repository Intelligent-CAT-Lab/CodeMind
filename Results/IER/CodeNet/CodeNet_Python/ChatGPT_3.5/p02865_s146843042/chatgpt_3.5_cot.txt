<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized to 4.
The code then checks if N is equal to 1 or 2. Since N is not equal to either of these values, the code proceeds to the else block.
Inside the else block, the code checks if N is divisible by 2. Since 4 is divisible by 2, the code enters the if block.
Inside the if block, the code calculates N divided by 2 and subtracts 1. The result is 1.
Finally, the code prints the value of 1.
