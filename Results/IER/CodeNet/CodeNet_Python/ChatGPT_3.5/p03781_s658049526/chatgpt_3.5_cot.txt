<<<Analysis>>>
The variable X is initialized to 6.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to X (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 6.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of the first i natural numbers using the formula i*(i+1)//2.
The code checks if this sum is greater than or equal to X. If it is, it prints the current value of i and breaks out of the loop.
In this case, when i is 3, the sum of the first 3 natural numbers is 6, which is equal to X. So, the code prints 3 and exits the loop.
<<<Output>>>
3
