<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three inputs: w, h, and c. The input "3 3 B" is split into three variables: w=3, h=3, and c="B".
The code then initializes the variable "end" with a string that represents the top and bottom borders of the box. It consists of a "+" sign followed by "-" signs, with a length of w-2, and ends with a "+" sign.
The variable "center" represents the middle row of the box. It consists of a "|" sign, followed by "." signs on both sides of the character c, and ends with a "|" sign. The number of "." signs on each side is calculated by subtracting 3 from w and dividing the result by 2.
The variable "common" represents the rows other than the top, bottom, and middle rows. It consists of a "|" sign, followed by "." signs, and ends with a "|" sign. The number of "." signs is equal to w-2.
The code then enters a loop that iterates h times. For each iteration, it checks if the current row is the top or bottom row, the middle row, or any other row. Based on the condition, it prints the corresponding string: "end" for the top and bottom rows, "center" for the middle row, and "common" for any other row.
In this case, the loop iterates 3 times because h=3. For the first iteration, it prints "+--+". For the second iteration, it prints "|.B.|". For the third iteration, it prints "+--+".
