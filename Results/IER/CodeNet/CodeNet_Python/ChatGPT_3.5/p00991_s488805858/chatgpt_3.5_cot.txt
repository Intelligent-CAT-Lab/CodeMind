<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by reading the values of r, c, ar, ac, br, and bc from the input. These values are 4, 4, 0, 0, 3, and 3 respectively.
The code then initializes the variable maxans to 100000007.
Next, it calculates the value of dr, which is the minimum of the absolute difference between br and ar and the difference between r and the absolute difference between br and ar. In this case, dr will be 1.
The code then checks if 2 * dr is equal to r. Since 2 * 1 is not equal to 4, the value of gainr is set to 1.
Similarly, the code calculates the value of dc, which is the minimum of the absolute difference between bc and ac and the difference between c and the absolute difference between bc and ac. In this case, dc will be 1.
Again, the code checks if 2 * dc is equal to c. Since 2 * 1 is not equal to 4, the value of gainc is set to 1.
Finally, the code calculates the value of ans using the formula factorial(dr + dc) // factorial(dr) // factorial(dc) * gainr * gainc. In this case, ans will be 2.
The code then prints the value of ans modulo maxans, which is 2.
