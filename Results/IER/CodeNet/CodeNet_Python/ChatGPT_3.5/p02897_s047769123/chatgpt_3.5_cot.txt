<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input N and assigns it to the variable N.
Then it calculates the expression 1-(N//2)/N and prints the result.
The expression N//2 calculates the integer division of N by 2.
Then, (N//2)/N calculates the division of the integer result by N.
Finally, 1 - (N//2)/N subtracts the division result from 1.
In this case, with N=4, the expression evaluates to 1 - (4//2)/4 = 1 - 2/4 = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5.
<<<Output>>>
0.5
