<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function f(n) that calculates the nth Fibonacci number modulo M (998244353 in this case) using matrix exponentiation.
The code then reads two integers n and m from input.
The code initializes a list I with two elements [1, 1].
The code calculates the value of r by calling the function f with argument m+2*n-2.
The code initializes a variable c to 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to n-1 (inclusive).
Inside the loop, the code appends a new element to the list I using a formula involving modular inverse.
The code updates the value of r by subtracting c*f(2*n-2-2*i) modulo M.
The code updates the value of c by multiplying it with (m+i)*I[i+1] modulo M.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of r modulo M.
