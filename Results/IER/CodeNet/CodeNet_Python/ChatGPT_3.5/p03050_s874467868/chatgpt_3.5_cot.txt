<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by importing necessary libraries and setting some constants.
Then, it reads an integer N from the input.
The code initializes a variable i to 1 and an empty list divs.
The code enters a loop that continues as long as i squared is less than or equal to N.
Inside the loop, it checks if N is divisible by i. If it is, it appends a tuple (i, N // i) to the divs list.
After that, it increments i by 1.
Next, the code initializes a variable ans to 0.
The code enters another loop that iterates over each tuple p in the divs list.
Inside this loop, it assigns the first element of p to the variable r and the second element of p minus 1 to the variable m.
If m is equal to 0, the code continues to the next iteration of the loop.
Otherwise, it checks if N modulo m is equal to r. If it is, it adds m to ans.
Finally, the code prints the value of ans.

In this case, N is 8.
The code finds the divisors of 8, which are (1, 8) and (2, 4).
For the first divisor (1, 8), r is 1 and m is 7. Since m is not equal to 0, the code checks if N modulo m is equal to r. Since 8 modulo 7 is not equal to 1, the condition is not met and m is not added to ans.
For the second divisor (2, 4), r is 2 and m is 3. Since m is not equal to 0, the code checks if N modulo m is equal to r. Since 8 modulo 3 is not equal to 2, the condition is not met and m is not added to ans.
Therefore, the final value of ans is 0.
