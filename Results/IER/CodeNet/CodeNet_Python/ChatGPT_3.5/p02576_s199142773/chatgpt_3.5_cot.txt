The code defines a function MI() that takes input and returns a map object containing the integers obtained by splitting the input string.
The variables N, X, and T are initialized by calling the MI() function and unpacking the map object.
The code then checks if N is not divisible by X using the modulo operator (%). If the condition is true, it means that there will be a remainder when N is divided by X, so the code calculates the number of times X can be subtracted from N (N//X) and adds 1 to it. This value is then multiplied by T to get the final answer.
If the condition is false, it means that N is divisible by X without any remainder, so the code calculates the number of times X can be subtracted from N (N//X) and multiplies it by T to get the final answer.
Finally, the code prints the value of ans, which is the final answer.
In this case, N=20, X=12, and T=6. Since 20 is not divisible by 12, the condition N%X!=0 is true. Therefore, the code calculates (20//12+1)*6 = 2*6 = 12 and assigns it to ans. The final output is 12.
