<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes input as a string and splits it into three separate strings using the split() function. It then converts each string to uppercase using the upper() function.
Next, it prints the first character of each of the three strings, which are s1, s2, and s3.
In this case, the input string is "atcoder beginner contest". After splitting and converting to uppercase, the three strings become "ATCODER", "BEGINNER", and "CONTEST". The code then prints the first character of each string, which is "ABC".
<<<Output>>>
ABC
