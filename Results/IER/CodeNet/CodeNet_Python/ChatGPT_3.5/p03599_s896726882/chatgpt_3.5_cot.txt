<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes 6 inputs: A, B, C, D, E, and F. These inputs are then used to calculate the values of x and y in a nested loop.
The code initializes a list called 'a' with one element: ['100*A', '0']. This list will store the values of x+y and y that satisfy the given conditions.
The code then enters a nested loop that iterates over four variables: i, j, k, and l. These variables range from 0 to 100.
For each combination of i, j, k, and l, the code calculates the values of x and y using the given formulas.
The code then checks two conditions:
1. If x+y is greater than F or x is equal to 0, it breaks out of the innermost loop.
2. If the ratio of y to (x+y) is less than or equal to (E*100)/(100+E), it appends the values of x+y and y to the list 'a'.
After the nested loop finishes, the code sorts the list 'a' based on the ratio of y to (x+y) in descending order. The element with the highest ratio is selected.
Finally, the code prints the selected element, which is the output of the code execution.

'200 0'
