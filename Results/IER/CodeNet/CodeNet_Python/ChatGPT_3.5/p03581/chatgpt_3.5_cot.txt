<<<Analysis>>>
The code imports the necessary libraries and defines some variables.
It reads the input values A and B.
It initializes the variable MOD to 10^9 + 7.
It initializes the variable U to 2001.
It creates a 2D array comb of size UxU, filled with zeros.
It sets the value of comb[0,0] to 1.
It enters a loop that iterates from 1 to U-1.
Inside the loop, it updates the values of comb[n,0:n] and comb[n,1:n+1] by adding the corresponding values from comb[n-1,0:n].
It takes the modulo of each element in comb[n,:n+1] with MOD.
It calculates the cumulative sum of each row in comb and stores it in comb_cum.
It creates a 2D array S of size UxU, filled with zeros.
It sets the first row of S to 1.
It calculates the cumulative sum of each row in comb_cum and stores it in S[1:,:].
It takes the modulo of each element in S with MOD.
It initializes the variable x to 0.
It enters a loop that iterates from 0 to A.
Inside the loop, it calculates comb[B-1,k] * (S[k,:A-k+1].sum() % MOD) and adds it to x.
It takes the modulo of x with MOD.
It prints the value of x.
