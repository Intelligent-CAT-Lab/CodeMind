<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three input values and assigns them to variables a, t, and r respectively.
Then it calculates the expression t * r / a and prints the result.
In this case, the values of a, t, and r are 180, 120, and 90 respectively.
So the output will be (120 * 90) / 180 = 60.
<<<Output>>>
60.0
