<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and variable m are initialized to 1 and 2, respectively.
The code initializes the variable ans as a list with two elements [0, 1].
Then it enters a loop that iterates from 1 to the minimum of n and m (exclusive), which is 1 in this case.
Inside the loop, it calculates the value of k as 1 shifted left by i (1 << i).
It then calculates the value of x as 1 shifted left by k and subtracts 1 from it ((1 << k) - 1).
The code creates a new list called slide, which is obtained by shifting each element of ans left by k.
It creates a new_ans list by performing a bitwise OR operation between each element of slide and ans.
It extends new_ans by performing a bitwise OR operation between each element of slide and the bitwise XOR operation between ans and x.
The code updates ans to be equal to new_ans.
Since n is not greater than m, it does not enter the if statement.
It then enters a loop that iterates from n to m (exclusive), which is not executed in this case since n is equal to m.
The code then performs a bitwise XOR operation between each element of ans and the next element in ans (ans[1:]).
It then performs a bitwise XOR operation between each element of ans and the result of shifting each element of ans right by 1.
Finally, it prints the elements of ans as binary strings, formatted with leading zeros to have a length of 2^m - 1.
