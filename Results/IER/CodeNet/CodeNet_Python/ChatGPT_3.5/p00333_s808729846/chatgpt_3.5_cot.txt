<<<Analysis>>>
The code imports the math module and then reads three integers from the input: w, h, and c.
It calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of w and h using the math.gcd() function and stores it in the variable size.
Then it calculates the cost by dividing w by size, multiplying it by h divided by size, and then multiplying the result by c.
Finally, it prints the value of cost.
In this case, the GCD of 10 and 20 is 10, so size is 10.
The cost is calculated as (10 // 10) * (20 // 10) * 5 = 1 * 2 * 5 = 10.
Therefore, the output will be 10.
