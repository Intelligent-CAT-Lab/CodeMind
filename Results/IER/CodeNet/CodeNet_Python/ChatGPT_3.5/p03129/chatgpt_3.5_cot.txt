<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N and variable K are initialized to 3 and 2, respectively.
The code then checks if N is divisible by 2. Since 3 is not divisible by 2, the code enters the else block.
In the else block, the code checks if N//2 + 1 is greater than or equal to K. Since 2 is less than 3, the condition is met.
Therefore, the code prints "YES".
<<<Output>>>
YES
