<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called main() which takes no arguments.
Inside the main() function, it reads two integers N and P from input and assigns them to variables N and P respectively.
It then calculates the square root of P using the math.sqrt() function and rounds it down to the nearest integer using the math.floor() function. The result is stored in the variable rt.
A dictionary called cnt is initialized to an empty dictionary.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to rt (inclusive). For each number i in this range, it checks if P is divisible by i. If it is, it enters another loop that divides P by i as long as P is divisible by i. Inside this loop, it checks if i is already a key in the cnt dictionary. If it is not, it adds i as a key with a value of 0. It then increments the value of cnt[i] by 1 and updates the value of P by dividing it by i.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if P is not equal to 1. If it is not, it means that P is a prime number greater than rt. In this case, it adds P as a key to the cnt dictionary with a value of 1.
The code then initializes a variable called ans to 1.
It enters a loop that iterates over the keys of the cnt dictionary. For each key c, it calculates c raised to the power of cnt[c] divided by N using the ** operator and integer division //. It multiplies the current value of ans by this result.
Finally, the code prints the value of ans.
