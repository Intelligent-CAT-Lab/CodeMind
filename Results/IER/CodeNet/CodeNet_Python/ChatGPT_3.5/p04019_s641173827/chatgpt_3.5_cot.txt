<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string and converts it into a list of characters. Then it removes any duplicate characters by converting the list into a set and then back into a list. In this case, the resulting list will be ['S', 'E', 'N', 'W'].

The code then initializes four variables n, w, s, and e to 0. These variables will be used to keep track of whether the characters 'N', 'W', 'S', and 'E' are present in the input string.

Next, the code enters a loop that iterates over the length of the list S. For each character in S, it checks if it is equal to 'N', 'W', 'S', or 'E'. If it is, it sets the corresponding variable (n, w, s, or e) to 1.

After the loop finishes, the code creates a list called judge that contains the values of n, w, s, and e in that order.

The code then checks if judge is equal to [1, 0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0, 1], or [1, 1, 1, 1]. If any of these conditions are true, it prints 'Yes'. Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

In this case, the values of n, w, s, and e are all 1, so judge will be [1, 1, 1, 1]. This matches one of the conditions, so the output will be 'Yes'.
