The code takes four integers as input and assigns them to variables a, s, d, and f.
It then performs some calculations to generate the values of x3, y3, x4, and y4.
x3 is calculated as d - f + s, y3 is calculated as f + d - a, x4 is calculated as a - f + s, and y4 is calculated as s + d - a.
Finally, the code prints the values of x3, y3, x4, and y4 separated by spaces.
Given the input "0 0 0 1", the calculations would be as follows:
x3 = 0 - 1 + 0 = -1
y3 = 1 + 0 - 0 = 1
x4 = 0 - 1 + 0 = -1
y4 = 0 + 0 - 0 = 0
Therefore, the output would be "-1 1 -1 0".
<<<Output>>>
-1 1 -1 0
