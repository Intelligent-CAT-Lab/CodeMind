<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string S from the input.
It then initializes two lists, sho and dai, with zeros. These lists will be used to store the lengths of increasing sequences from the left and right, respectively.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the characters of S. For each character, it updates the corresponding element in the sho list based on the character. If the character is ">", the length of the increasing sequence is set to 0. Otherwise, it is incremented by 1.
Next, the code enters another loop that iterates over the characters of S in reverse order. For each character, it updates the corresponding element in the dai list based on the character. If the character is "<", the length of the increasing sequence is set to 0. Otherwise, it is incremented by 1.
After both loops finish, the code creates a new list called seq by taking the maximum value between the corresponding elements of sho and dai.
Finally, the code prints the sum of the elements in seq.
In this case, the input string is "<>>". The sho list will be [0, 1, 0, 0] and the dai list will be [0, 0, 2, 1]. The seq list will be [0, 1, 2, 1] and the sum of its elements is 4.
