<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes input as a string of numbers separated by spaces. It then splits the string into a list of strings using the split() function. The map() function is used to convert each string element in the list to an integer. The list() function is used to convert the map object into a list. The set() function is used to remove any duplicate elements from the list. Finally, the len() function is used to get the length of the set. If the length is equal to 2, it means there are exactly 2 unique numbers in the input. In this case, the code will print 'Yes'. Otherwise, it will print 'No'.

In the given input '5 7 5', the set of unique numbers is {5, 7}. The length of this set is 2. Therefore, the code will print 'Yes'.

<<<Output>>>
Yes
