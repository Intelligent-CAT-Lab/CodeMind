<<<Analysis>>>
The code imports necessary libraries and defines some variables and functions.
The code then reads the input values N and K.
The code initializes an array called power with size N + 10 and type int64. It sets the first element of power to 1 and then calculates the remaining elements using a loop. The calculation is done using the formula power[n] = power[n - 1] * (K + 1) % MOD.
The code calculates the value of ret using the formula ret = K * (K + 1) // 2 * N * power[N - 1] % MOD.
The code initializes an array called dp with size 1 and type int64. It sets the first element of dp to 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from N to 1 (inclusive), with a step of -1. Inside this loop, it creates a new array called newdp with a size calculated based on the current value of n and the length of dp. It then enters two nested loops. The first loop iterates from 0 to K (inclusive), and the second loop iterates from 0 to the length of dp. Inside these loops, it performs some calculations and updates the elements of newdp.
Finally, the code returns the value of ret % MOD and prints it.
