<<<Analysis>>>
The variable X, variable A and variable B are initialized to 4, 3 and 6, respectively.
The variable over is calculated as B - A, which in this case is 6 - 3 = 3.
The code then checks if over is less than or equal to 0. Since over is 3, this condition is not met.
Next, the code checks if over is less than or equal to X. Since over is 3 and X is 4, this condition is met.
Therefore, the code prints 'safe'.
<<<Output>>>
safe
