<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string and iterates over its characters using a for loop. For each character at index i, it checks if the character at index i+1 is the same. If it is, it prints "Bad" and exits the program. If no adjacent characters are the same, it prints "Good" after the loop finishes.
In this case, the input string is "3776". The code compares the first character '3' with the second character '7' and finds them different. It then compares the second character '7' with the third character '7' and finds them the same. Therefore, it prints "Bad" and exits the program.
<<<Output>>>
Bad
