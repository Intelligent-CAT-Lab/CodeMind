<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called `main` which takes no arguments. Inside the function, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `k` from input using `input().split()` and assigns them to variables `a`, `b`, and `k` respectively.

Then, it enters a loop that iterates `k` times. In each iteration, it checks if the current iteration index `i` is divisible by 2 (i.e., if `i` is even). If it is, it calls the function `play` with arguments `a` and `b` and assigns the returned values to `a` and `b`. Otherwise, it calls the function `play` with arguments `b` and `a` and assigns the returned values to `b` and `a`.

The function `play` takes two arguments `a` and `b`. It returns a tuple containing two values: `a // 2` and `b + a // 2`. The `//` operator performs integer division.

After the loop finishes, the code prints the values of `a` and `b` separated by a space.
