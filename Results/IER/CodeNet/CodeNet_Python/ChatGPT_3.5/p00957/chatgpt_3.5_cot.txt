The code imports the lru_cache function from the functools module.
The code then takes two integers, l and k, as input.
The code defines a recursive function called rec, which takes two parameters: i and isBlack.
The function uses memoization by applying the lru_cache decorator to cache the results of previous function calls.
The function has three base cases:
- If i is less than 0, the function returns 0.
- If i is equal to 0 and isBlack is False, the function returns 1. Otherwise, it returns 0.
- If isBlack is True, the function recursively calls itself with i-1 and False as arguments, and adds the result to the recursive call with i-k and False as arguments.
- If isBlack is False, the function recursively calls itself with i-1 and True as arguments.
The code then calculates the sum of the function rec for each value of i from 1 to l, where isBlack is True.
Finally, the code prints the value of ans, which is the sum calculated in the previous step.
