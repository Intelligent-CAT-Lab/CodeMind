<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers X and Y as input.
It initializes a variable count to 1.
Then it enters a while loop that continues indefinitely.
Inside the loop, it multiplies the value of X by 2.
It checks if the new value of X is greater than Y. If it is, it breaks out of the loop.
Otherwise, it increments the value of count by 1.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of count.
In this case, the loop will run 5 times because the value of X will be multiplied by 2 until it becomes 48, which is greater than Y (20).
So the output will be 5.
<<<Output>>>
