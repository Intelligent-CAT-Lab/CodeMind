<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by importing the factorial function from the math module.
Then, it defines a function called comb that calculates the combination of two numbers using the factorial function.
The code then takes input values for w, h, ax, ay, bx, and by.
Next, it calculates the minimum distance in the x-direction (dx) and the minimum distance in the y-direction (dy) between the points (ax, ay) and (bx, by).
The code initializes a variable called ans to 1.
It checks if dx multiplied by 2 is equal to w. If it is, it multiplies ans by 2.
It also checks if dy multiplied by 2 is equal to h. If it is, it multiplies ans by 2.
Finally, it multiplies ans by the combination of dx+dy choose dx, which is calculated using the comb function.
The code then prints the value of ans modulo 100000007.
