<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers N and M as input.
It then initializes variables ah and bh to N*2 and M*2, respectively.
It also initializes ans1 and ans2 to 0, which will be used to store the final answer.
The code then enters a while loop that continues until a break statement is encountered.
Inside the loop, it calculates the value of ap as the minimum of N and ah, and subtracts ap from bh.
If bh becomes less than or equal to 0, the loop breaks.
Otherwise, it increments ans1 by 1 and calculates the value of bp as (bh+1)//2.
It then subtracts bp from ah and checks if ah becomes less than or equal to 0. If it does, the loop breaks.
Otherwise, it increments ans1 by 1.
After the first while loop finishes, the code initializes ah and bh to N*2 and M*2 again, and sets ans2 to 0.
It then enters another while loop with similar logic as the first loop, but with the order of calculations for ap and bp reversed.
Finally, the code prints the minimum of ans1 and ans2 as the output.
