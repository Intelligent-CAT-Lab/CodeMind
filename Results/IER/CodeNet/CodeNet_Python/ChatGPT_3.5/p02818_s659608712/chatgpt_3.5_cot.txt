<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input and assigns them to variables a, b, and c.
It then checks if a is greater than c. If it is, it prints the difference between a and c, followed by the value of b.
If a + b is less than c, it prints 0, 0.
Otherwise, it prints 0, followed by the difference between a+b and c.
In this case, a is equal to c, so the code moves to the next condition.
Since a + b is not less than c, the code prints 0, followed by the difference between a+b and c, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
0 2
