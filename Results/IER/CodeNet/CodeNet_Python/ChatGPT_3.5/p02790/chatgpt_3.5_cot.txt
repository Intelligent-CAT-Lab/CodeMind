<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input and assigns them to variables a and b.
It then checks if a is less than or equal to b. If it is, it prints the string representation of a repeated b times.
If a is greater than b, it prints the string representation of b repeated a times.
In this case, a is 4 and b is 3. Since 4 is greater than 3, the code will print "3333".
<<<Output>>>
3333
