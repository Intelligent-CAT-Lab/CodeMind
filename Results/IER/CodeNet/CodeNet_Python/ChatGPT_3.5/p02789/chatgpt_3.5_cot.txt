<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes input in the form of two integers separated by a space and stores them in a list called 'a'.
It then checks if the first element of the list (a[0]) is equal to the second element of the list (a[1]).
In this case, both elements are 3, so the condition is true and the code prints 'Yes'.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
