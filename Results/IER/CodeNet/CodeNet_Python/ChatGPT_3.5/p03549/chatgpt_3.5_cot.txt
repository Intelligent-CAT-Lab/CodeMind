<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines several helper functions for inputting data, such as getN(), getNM(), getList(), and getArray(). These functions are used to read integers, lists, and arrays from input.
The code then imports several modules and sets some variables and constants.
Next, it reads two integers N and M using the getNM() function.
The code calculates the value of total using the formula 1900 * M + 100 * (N - M).
Finally, it prints the value of total multiplied by 2 raised to the power of M.
<<<Output>>>
2900
