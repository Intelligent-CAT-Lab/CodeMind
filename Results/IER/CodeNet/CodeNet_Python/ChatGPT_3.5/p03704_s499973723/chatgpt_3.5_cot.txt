<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function f(i,d) that takes two arguments: i and d. The function calculates the number of i-digit numbers n such that r(n)-n = d, where r(n) is the sum of the differences between each digit of n and the previous digit. The function uses a dynamic programming approach to calculate the result.

The code then reads an integer d from the input.

Next, the code initializes a variable ans to 0.

The code creates two Counter objects: d1 and d2. These objects are used to count the occurrences of differences between digits in the numbers.

The code then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to 17 (inclusive). For each iteration, it calls the function f(i,d) and adds the result to ans.

After the loop finishes, the code checks if d is divisible by (10^9 - 10^8). If it is, it calculates the quotient r and adds d2[r]*(10^7)*9 to ans.

Finally, the code prints the value of ans.
