<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers n and k as input using the map function and split method. The input values are 7 and 3 in this case.
The code then checks if n%k is equal to 0. The % operator calculates the remainder when n is divided by k. If the remainder is 0, it means n is divisible by k.
If n%k is equal to 0, the code prints 0. Otherwise, it prints 1.
In this case, 7%3 is equal to 1, so the code will print 1.
