<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input and assigns it to the variable x.
Then, it enters a nested loop that iterates over the range -1000 to 1000 for both i and j.
For each combination of i and j, it checks if i^5 - j^5 is equal to x.
If the condition is true, it prints the values of i and j and breaks out of the inner loop.
If the condition is not true, it continues to the next iteration of the outer loop.
After the inner loop finishes, the code breaks out of the outer loop as well.
Therefore, the code will only print one pair of values for i and j that satisfy the condition.
