<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input and assigns them to variables a and b.
Then, it creates a dictionary called mydict with keys from 1 to 12 and corresponding values.
The code checks if the value of mydict at index a is equal to the value of mydict at index b.
In this case, mydict[1] is "a" and mydict[3] is "a", so the condition is True.
Therefore, the code will print "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
