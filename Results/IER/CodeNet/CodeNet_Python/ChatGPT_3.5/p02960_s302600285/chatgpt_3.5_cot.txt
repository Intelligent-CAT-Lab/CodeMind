<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function main() and imports the sys module for reading input. It also initializes a variable mod to 10^9 + 7.

The code then reads a string s from input and calculates its length n. It also initializes a 2D list dp with dimensions n x 13, filled with zeros.

Next, the code checks the last character of s. If it is a question mark ('?'), it sets the first element of dp to 1 for all possible digits (0-9). Otherwise, it sets the first element of dp to 1 for the specific digit.

The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n-1. In each iteration, it calculates a new value for a based on the previous value and the formula 10 * a % 13. This value of a is used in the subsequent calculations.

Inside the loop, the code checks the i-th character from the end of s. If it is a question mark, it enters another loop that iterates over all possible digits (0-9). For each digit, it calculates a new value for k based on the formula (a * j + k) % 13 and adds dp[i-1][k] % mod to dp[i][k]. This is done for all possible values of k (0-12).

If the i-th character is not a question mark, it sets j to the specific digit and enters a similar loop as before, but only for the specific digit j.

After the loop finishes, the code prints the value of dp[-1][5] % mod, which represents the number of ways to obtain a remainder of 5 when dividing the number represented by s by 13.
