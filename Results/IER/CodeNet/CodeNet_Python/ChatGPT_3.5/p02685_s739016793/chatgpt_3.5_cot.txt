<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input: n, m, and k.
It initializes a variable ans to 0.
Then, it defines a function cmb(n, r, mod) which calculates the combination of n and r modulo mod.
Next, it initializes some variables related to modulo arithmetic.
It calculates the factorial and inverse factorial values for numbers up to N.
After that, it calculates the value of color using the formula m * (m-1)^(kk-1) % mod, where kk is n-k.
Then, it enters a loop that iterates while kk is less than or equal to n.
In each iteration, it calculates the value of now using the formula color * (m-1) % mod.
It also calculates the value of cmb((n-1), (n-kk), mod) and multiplies it with now.
Then, it updates kk by incrementing it by 1.
It adds now to ans and takes the modulo of ans with mod.
Finally, it prints the value of ans.
