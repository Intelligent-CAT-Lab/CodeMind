<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines two classes: Inv and Comb. The Inv class has methods for modular exponentiation and modular inverse calculation. The Comb class has methods for calculating combinations using factorials and modular inverses.

The code then takes input values for N, A, B, and C. It initializes the MOD variable to 10^9 + 7 and creates instances of the Comb and Inv classes.

Next, it calculates the inverse list IL using the invL method of the Inv class. It also calculates the inverse of 100 - C using the invx method.

Then, it initializes two lists PA and PB with initial values of 1. It uses a loop to calculate the values of PA and PB based on the values of A and B.

After that, it initializes the ans variable to 0. It enters a loop that iterates N times. In each iteration, it calculates a partial sum and adds it to ans. The partial sum is calculated using various variables and methods, including N, i, IC, PA, PB, IL, and com.

Finally, it prints the value of ans modulo MOD.
