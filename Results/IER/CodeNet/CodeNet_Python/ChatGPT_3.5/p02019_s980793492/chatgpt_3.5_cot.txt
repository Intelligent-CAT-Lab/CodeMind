<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four inputs: N, A, B, and C.
The values of N, A, B, and C are assigned based on the input "6 3 2 1".
The code then calculates the expression N - A - B + C.
Substituting the given values, we have 6 - 3 - 2 + 1 = 2.
Therefore, the output of the code execution would be 2.
