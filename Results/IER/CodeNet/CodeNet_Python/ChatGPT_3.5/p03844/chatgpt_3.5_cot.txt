<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes input in the form of a string and splits it into three parts: A, s, and B.
A and B are then converted to integers.
The code then checks the value of s. If s is '+', it adds A and B and prints the result.
If s is '-', it subtracts B from A and prints the result.
In this case, s is '+', so the code will add 1 and 2 and print the result.
