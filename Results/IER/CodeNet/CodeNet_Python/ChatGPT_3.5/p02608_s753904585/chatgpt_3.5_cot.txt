<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by taking an integer input N.
It initializes a list d of size N with all elements set to 0.
It sets r to 100 and ii to 0.
Then it enters a loop that iterates from 1 to r-1 (99 in this case).
Inside this loop, it calculates the value of ii by adding 2*i-1 to it.
Then it enters another loop that iterates from 1 to i.
Inside this loop, it calculates the value of s by adding i and j.
It calculates the value of c by adding ii and s*j.
It sets l to 6.
If i is equal to j, it sets l to 3.
If c+1+s is greater than N, it breaks out of the loop.
Otherwise, it enters another loop that iterates from 1 to j.
Inside this loop, it calculates the value of c by adding 2*k-1+s to it.
If c is less than or equal to N, it checks if j is equal to k.
If it is, it sets l to 3.
If i is also equal to k, it sets l to 1.
It adds l to the element at index c-1 in the list d.
If c is greater than N, it breaks out of the loop.
After all the loops finish, it prints the elements of the list d separated by a newline character.
