<<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the math module.
Then it takes two integers as input and assigns them to variables a and b.
The code then checks if a is greater than b. If it is, it calculates and prints the result of the expression 2 / 3 * math.pi * a**2 * b.
If a is not greater than b, it calculates and prints the result of the expression 4 / 3 * math.pi * b**3.
In this case, a is not greater than b (1 is not greater than 2), so the code will calculate and print the result of the expression 4 / 3 * math.pi * b**3.
