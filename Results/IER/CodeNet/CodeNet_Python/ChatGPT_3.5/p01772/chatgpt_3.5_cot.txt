<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string and initializes an empty string ans. It also initializes a flag variable to False.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each character c in the input string.
Inside the loop, it checks if c is equal to "A" and if the flag is False. If both conditions are true, it sets the flag to True.
Next, it checks if c is equal to "Z" and if the flag is True. If both conditions are true, it appends "AZ" to the ans string and sets the flag to False.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if ans is still an empty string. If it is, it prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the value of ans.
In this case, the input string is "AIZUNYANPEROPERO". The code encounters "A" and sets the flag to True. It then encounters "Z" and appends "AZ" to ans. The flag is set to False. The loop continues until the end of the string.
Finally, the code prints the value of ans, which is "AZ".
<<<Output>>>
AZ
