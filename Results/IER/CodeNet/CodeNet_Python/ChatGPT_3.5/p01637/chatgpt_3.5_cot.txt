<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function f that takes three arguments a, b, and c and returns True if a*b is less than 100*c, and False otherwise.

The code then reads five integers from input and assigns them to variables m, rd, rr, cd, and cr.

Next, the code calculates the value of ex by dividing cd*100 by rd. This is equivalent to multiplying cd by 100 and then dividing the result by rd. The result is stored in ex.

The code then calls the function f with arguments ex, rd, and cd. If the function returns True, it increments the value of ex by 1.

Next, the code calculates the value of ey by dividing cr*100 by rr. This is equivalent to multiplying cr by 100 and then dividing the result by rr. The result is stored in ey.

The code then calls the function f with arguments ey, rr, and cr. If the function returns True, it increments the value of ey by 1.

Finally, the code prints the value of m minus ex minus ey, if this value is greater than or equal to 0. Otherwise, it prints -1.

<<<Output>>>
The output depends on the input values for m, rd, rr, cd, and cr. Without knowing the specific values, it is not possible to determine the exact output.
