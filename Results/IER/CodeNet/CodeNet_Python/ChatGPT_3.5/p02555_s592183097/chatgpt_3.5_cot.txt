<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by importing necessary modules and setting up some initial variables.
The function `solve` is defined, which takes an integer `S` as input and returns an integer as output.
Inside the `solve` function, there are several if statements that check the value of `S` and return a specific value based on its range.
If `S` is less than 3, the function returns 0.
If `S` is less than 6, the function returns 1.
If `S` is already in the `cache` dictionary, the function returns the value stored in the dictionary.
If none of the above conditions are met, the function enters a loop that iterates from `S - 3` down to 2 (inclusive). For each value of `remaining` in this range, the function recursively calls itself with `remaining` as the new input and adds the returned value to `ans`. The result is then modulo `M` and stored in the `cache` dictionary.
Finally, the function returns `ans`.

In the main part of the code, an integer `S` is read from input.
The `solve` function is called with `S` as the input and the result is printed.
