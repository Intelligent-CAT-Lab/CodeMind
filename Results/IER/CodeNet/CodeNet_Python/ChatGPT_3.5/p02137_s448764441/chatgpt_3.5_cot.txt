<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 5700.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of multiples of the denominations.
The list l contains the denominations in descending order: [10000, 5000, 1000, 500].
The code then enters a loop that iterates 4 times, corresponding to the 4 denominations.
For each iteration, it calculates the number of times the current denomination can be used in n by performing integer division n // l[i]. It then multiplies this result by the current denomination l[i] and adds it to ans.
After that, it calculates the remainder of n divided by the current denomination by performing modulo division n % l[i] and assigns it back to n.
This process is repeated for each denomination in the list.
Finally, the code prints the final value of ans, which is the sum of multiples of the denominations that can be used to represent the original value of n.
<<<Output>>>
5500
