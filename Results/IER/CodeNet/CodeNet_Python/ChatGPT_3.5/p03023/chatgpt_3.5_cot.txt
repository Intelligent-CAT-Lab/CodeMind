<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input and assigns it to the variable n.
It then calculates the value of s by multiplying 180 with the difference between n and 2.
Finally, it prints the value of s.
In this case, since the input is 3, the value of s would be 180 * (3 - 2) = 180.
<<<Output>>>
180
