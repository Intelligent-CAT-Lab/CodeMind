<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n, variable x and variable y are initialized to 5, 2 and 4, respectively.
The code then initializes a list called ans with n-1 elements, all set to 0.
The code then enters a nested loop that iterates over all pairs of indices (i, j) where i ranges from 0 to n-2 and j ranges from i+1 to n-1.
For each pair (i, j), it calculates the values of a and b using the given formulas.
The code then increments the element at index min(a, b)-1 in the ans list.
After the nested loop finishes, the code prints each element in the ans list, one per line.
