<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input and assigns them to variables a and b.
It then checks if the sum of a and b is equal to 15. If it is, it prints '+'. 
If the sum is not equal to 15, it checks if the product of a and b is equal to 15. If it is, it prints '*'.
If neither condition is met, it prints 'x'.
In this case, the sum of 4 and 11 is 15, so the condition a+b == 15 is true and the code will print '+'.
