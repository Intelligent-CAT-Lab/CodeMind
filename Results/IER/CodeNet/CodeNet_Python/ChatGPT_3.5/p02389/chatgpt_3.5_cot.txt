<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input and assigns them to variables a and b.
Then it prints the product of a and b, followed by the sum of a and b multiplied by 2.
For the given input of "3 5", the product of 3 and 5 is 15, and the sum of 3 and 5 is 8. 
So the output will be:
15 16
<<<Output>>>
15 16
