<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by importing necessary modules and defining some utility functions and constants.
Then, it reads the values of H and W from the input.
The variable ans is initialized to infinity.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to H (inclusive), meaning it will consider values of h from 1 to 3 in this case.
For each value of h, it calculates the areas of three rectangles: S1, S2, and S3.
It then calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum areas among S1, S2, and S3, and updates the value of ans to be the minimum of its current value and this difference.
After the loop finishes, the code swaps the values of H and W and repeats the same process.
Finally, it prints the value of ans, which is the minimum difference between the areas of the three rectangles.
