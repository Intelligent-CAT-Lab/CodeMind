<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers n and k as input.
It initializes the variable p to 998244353, which is a prime number.
Then it initializes the variable r to the built-in range function.
It initializes a list f with the value [1].
Then it enters a loop that iterates k times. In each iteration, it calculates the factorial of i+1 and appends it to the list f. The factorial is calculated using the formula (-~i*f[i]%p), where -~i is equivalent to i+1.
After the loop, it calculates the sum of a series of terms. The series iterates from 0 to n-2 (inclusive) and each term is calculated as f[k-1]*pow(f[i]*f[k-1-i],-1,p). Here, pow(a,b,c) calculates a raised to the power b modulo c. The term f[k-1]*pow(f[i]*f[k-1-i],-1,p) represents the binomial coefficient C(k-1, i) modulo p.
Finally, it takes the sum modulo p and prints the result.
