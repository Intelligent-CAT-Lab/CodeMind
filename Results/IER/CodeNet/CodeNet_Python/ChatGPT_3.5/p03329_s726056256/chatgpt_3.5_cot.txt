<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized to 127.
The code creates a list l that contains powers of 6 and 9, ranging from 6^1 to 6^6 and 9^1 to 9^5. The list is then sorted in ascending order.
The variable INF is set to 1000.
The variable dp is initialized as a list of length N+1, with the first element being 0 and the rest being INF.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive). For each value of n, it iterates over the elements in the list l.
For each element f in l, the code checks if n - f is non-negative. If it is, it updates dp[n] to be the minimum value between dp[n] and dp[n - f] + 1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the last element of dp, which is the minimum number of steps required to reach N using the elements in l.
