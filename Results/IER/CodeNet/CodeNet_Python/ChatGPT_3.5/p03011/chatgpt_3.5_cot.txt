<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input and assigns them to variables a, b, and c.
Then it calculates the maximum value among a, b, and c using the max() function.
Finally, it prints the sum of a, b, and c minus the maximum value.
In this case, the maximum value is 4, so the output will be 1 + 3 + 4 - 4 = 4.
<<<Output>>>
4
