The variable x is initialized to 1 and the variable y is also initialized to 1.
The variables X and Y are initialized to 0.
The code then enters a series of if-elif-else statements to determine the value of X based on the value of x, and the value of Y based on the value of y.
Since x is equal to 1, X is set to 300000.
Since y is equal to 1, Y is set to 300000.
The code then checks if both x and y are equal to 1. Since this condition is true, it prints the sum of X, Y, and 400000, which is 1000000.
<<<Output>>>
1000000
