<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by importing necessary libraries and defining some functions.

Then, it reads the input values N, M, and K.

Next, it initializes the variable MOD to 10^9 + 7.

The code defines a function cumprod that calculates the cumulative product of an array modulo MOD.

Then, it defines a function make_fact that generates an array of factorials and their inverses modulo MOD.

After that, it defines a function make_power that generates an array of powers of a given number modulo MOD.

The code initializes the variable U to 10^6.

Then, it calculates the arrays power2, power2_inv, power3, power3_inv, fact, and fact_inv using the make_power and make_fact functions.

Next, it initializes an array x of size N+M with zeros.

It calculates the values of x[1:] using the power2, power3_inv, fact, and fact_inv arrays.

Then, it calculates the value of x[0] using the power3_inv and power2_inv arrays.

The code calculates the cumulative sum of the x array modulo MOD.

Next, it calculates the values of x using the power3 and power2_inv arrays.

Then, it calculates the value of coef using the fact, fact_inv, and power3 arrays.

Finally, it calculates the value of answer using the coef and x arrays.

The code prints the final value of answer.
