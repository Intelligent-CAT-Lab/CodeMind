<<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the math module, which provides mathematical functions and constants.
Then, it takes three integers as input and assigns them to variables a, b, and c.
The code then calculates and prints three values:
1. 0.5*a*b*math.sin(math.radians(c)): This calculates the area of a triangle using the formula (1/2)*base*height, where the base is a and the height is b*sin(c) (converted from degrees to radians using math.radians).
2. a+b+(a**2+b**2-2*a*b*math.cos(math.radians(c)))**0.5: This calculates the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle using the Pythagorean theorem. It adds the lengths of the two sides (a and b) and the square root of the sum of their squares minus twice their product and converts it to radians using math.radians.
3. b*math.sin(math.radians(c)): This calculates the length of the side opposite to angle c in a right triangle using the formula side*sin(angle) (converted from degrees to radians using math.radians).
