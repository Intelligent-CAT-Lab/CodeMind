<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers A, B, and C as input.
It then checks if all three numbers are odd by checking if the remainder of each number divided by 2 is equal to 1.
If all three numbers are odd, it prints the minimum value among A*B, B*C, and C*A.
If any of the numbers is even, it prints 0.
In this case, all three numbers are odd, so it will print the minimum value among 3*3, 3*3, and 3*3, which is 9.
<<<Output>>>
9
