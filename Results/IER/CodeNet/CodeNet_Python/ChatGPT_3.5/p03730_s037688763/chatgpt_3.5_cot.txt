<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers a, b, and c as input.
It then uses a generator expression to iterate over the range from 1 to b+1, and for each value i, it checks if (a * i) % b is equal to c.
If any of the values satisfy this condition, it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".
In this case, the code will iterate over the range from 1 to 6 (inclusive), and check if (7 * i) % 5 is equal to 1.
The values of i that satisfy this condition are 1 and 6, so the code will print "YES".
<<<Output>>>
YES
