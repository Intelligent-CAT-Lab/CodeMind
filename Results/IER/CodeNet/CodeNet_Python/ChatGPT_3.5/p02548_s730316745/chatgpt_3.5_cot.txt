The variable n is initialized to 3.
The variable c is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of values.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 2.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the value (n-1) // i and adds it to c.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of c, which is 1.
