<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string and initializes a variable cnt to 0, which will be used to count the number of occurrences of 'h' and 'i' in the string.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the indices of the string. For each index i, it checks if i is even and the character at that index is 'h'. If both conditions are true, it increments cnt by 1. Otherwise, it checks if i is odd and the character at that index is 'i'. If both conditions are true, it increments cnt by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if the length of the string is even and cnt is equal to the length of the string. If both conditions are true, it prints 'Yes'. Otherwise, it prints 'No'.
In this case, the input string is 'hihi'. The code will increment cnt by 1 for indices 0, 1, 2, and 3 because the characters at those indices are 'h', 'i', 'h', and 'i' respectively. Since the length of the string is 4 and cnt is also 4, the code will print 'Yes'.
