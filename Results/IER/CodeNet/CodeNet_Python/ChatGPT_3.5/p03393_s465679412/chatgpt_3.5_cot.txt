<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an input string `s`.
It checks if the length of `s` is not equal to 26. If it is not, it means that some letters are missing from the input string.
In that case, it creates a set `nokori` which contains all the lowercase letters from `a` to `z` except the ones present in `s`.
Then it prints the input string `s` concatenated with the minimum letter from `nokori`.
If the length of `s` is equal to 26, it means that all the letters are present in the input string.
In that case, it enters a loop that starts from 2 and goes up to 26.
For each iteration, it checks if the current letter at position `-i` in `s` is less than or equal to the next letter at position `-i + 1`.
If it is not, it breaks out of the loop.
If the loop completes without breaking, it means that the input string is in descending order from the second last letter to the last letter, which is not allowed.
In that case, it prints -1 and exits the program.
If the loop breaks, it means that the input string is not in descending order from the second last letter to the last letter.
It then creates a sorted list `s_` containing all the letters from the position `-i + 1` to the end of `s`.
It enters another loop that iterates over each letter `j` in `s_`.
For each letter, it checks if `j` is greater than the current letter at position `-i` in `s`.
If it is, it breaks out of the loop.
After the loop, it prints the input string `s` excluding the last `i` letters, concatenated with the letter `j`.
