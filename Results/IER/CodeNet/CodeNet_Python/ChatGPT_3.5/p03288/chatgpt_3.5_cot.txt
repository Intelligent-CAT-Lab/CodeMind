<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input and assigns it to the variable n.
It then checks if n is less than 1200. If it is, it prints "ABC".
If n is not less than 1200, it checks if n is less than 2800. If it is, it prints "ARC".
If n is neither less than 1200 nor less than 2800, it prints "AGC".
In this case, the input is 1199, which is less than 1200. Therefore, the code will print "ABC".
<<<Output>>>
ABC
