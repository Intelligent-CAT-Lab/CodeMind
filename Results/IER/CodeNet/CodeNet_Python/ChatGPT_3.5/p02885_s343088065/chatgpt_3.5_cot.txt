<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input and assigns them to variables a and b.
Then it calculates the value of a - 2*b and stores it in a variable called result.
Finally, it prints the value of result.
In this case, a is 12 and b is 4, so the calculation becomes 12 - 2*4 = 12 - 8 = 4.
Therefore, the output of the code execution would be 4.
<<<Output>>>
