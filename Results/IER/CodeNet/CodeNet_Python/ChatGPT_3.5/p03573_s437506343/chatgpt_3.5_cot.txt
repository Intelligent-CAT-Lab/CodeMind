<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three inputs a, b, and c and assigns them to variables a, b, and c respectively.
The code then checks if a is equal to b. If it is, it prints the value of c.
If a is not equal to b, the code checks if a is equal to c. If it is, it prints the value of b.
If neither of the above conditions is true, it means that a is not equal to b and a is not equal to c. In this case, the code prints the value of a.
In this case, a is equal to c, so the code will print the value of b, which is 7.
<<<Output>>>
7
