<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input and assigns it to the variable n.
It then checks if n is less than or equal to 999. If it is, it prints "ABC". Otherwise, it prints "ABD".
In this case, the input is 999, which is equal to 999. Therefore, the condition is true and the code will print "ABC".
<<<Output>>>
ABC
