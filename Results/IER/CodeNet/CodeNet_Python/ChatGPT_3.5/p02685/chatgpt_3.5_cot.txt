<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers n, m, and k as input.
It initializes the variable mod to 998244353 and ans to 0.
Then, it defines a function mod_comb_k that calculates the modular combination of n and k using the fact and fact_inv lists.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to k (inclusive).
Inside the loop, it calculates ans by adding the product of m, (m-1) raised to the power of (n-1-x), and the modular combination of (n-1) and x.
The ans is then updated by taking the modulus of ans with mod.
Finally, if ans is negative, it adds mod to ans.
The code prints the final value of ans.
