<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and variable k are initialized to 1, 1 respectively.
The code then initializes variables s1, s2, s3, s4, s5, s6 based on the values of n and k.
The code then checks if the sum of s1 and s4 is less than or equal to the average of s5 and s6.
In this case, s1 + s4 = 2 and (s5 + s6)/2 = 3. Since the condition is not met, the code does not enter the if block.
Instead, it goes to the else block and prints -1.
<<<Output>>>
-1
