<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input and assigns it to the variable f.
Then it calculates the value of (f-30)//2 and prints it.
The expression (f-30)//2 subtracts 30 from f and then performs integer division by 2.
So, for the input 68, the value of (f-30)//2 would be (68-30)//2 = 38//2 = 19.
<<<Output>>>
19
