<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 4, 2 and 9, respectively.
The code then checks if the product of N and A is greater than B. In this case, 4 * 2 = 8, which is not greater than 9.
Since the condition is not met, the code executes the else block and prints the value of N * A, which is 8.
<<<Output>>>
8
