<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input character and converts it to its ASCII value using the ord() function. It then adds 1 to the ASCII value and converts it back to a character using the chr() function. Finally, it prints the resulting character.
In this case, the input character is 'a'. The ASCII value of 'a' is 97. Adding 1 to 97 gives 98, which corresponds to the character 'b'. Therefore, the output of the code would be 'b'.
<<<Output>>>
b
