<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N and variable K are initialized to 3 and 2, respectively.
variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of squares of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 3.
For each number a in this range, it checks if 2 * a % K is not equal to 0. If it is not equal to 0, it continues to the next iteration of the loop.
If 2 * a % K is equal to 0, it calculates the values of floor((N + a) / K) and ceil((a + 1) / K), and subtracts the latter from the former. It then adds 1 to this difference and squares the result. This value is added to ans.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 4.
<<<Output>>>
4
