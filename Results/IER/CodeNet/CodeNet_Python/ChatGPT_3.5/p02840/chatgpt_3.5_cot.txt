<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable X and variable D are initialized to 3, 4 and 2, respectively.
The code then checks if D is equal to 0. Since D is not equal to 0, it proceeds to the next condition.
The code checks if D is less than 0. Since D is not less than 0, it skips the if block.
The code then initializes a defaultdict named memo, which will be used to store lists of tuples.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to N (inclusive). For each iteration, it calculates the values of l and r using the formulas provided.
The code then appends the tuple (l, r) to the list in memo[l % D]. This means that the tuples are grouped based on the remainder of l divided by D.
After the loop finishes, the code initializes a variable ans to 0.
The code then iterates over the values in memo, which are the lists of tuples.
For each list of tuples, it sorts the tuples in ascending order based on the first element (l).
The code then initializes a variable cur to -INF.
The code enters another loop that iterates over the tuples in the sorted list.
For each tuple, it checks if cur is less than the left value (l). If it is, it adds the number of elements in the range (r - l) // D + 1 to ans and updates cur to the right value (r).
If cur is not less than the left value (l), it adds the number of elements in the range (r - cur) // D to ans and updates cur to the right value (r).
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans.
