<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by taking two integers N and M as input.
Then, it initializes a 2D list dp with dimensions N x N, filled with zeros.
The code sets dp[N-1][0] to 1, indicating that the last city is in state 0 (unvisited) and there are no cities in state 1 or state 2.
Next, the code enters a loop that iterates M times.
Inside this loop, a new 2D list ndp is created, also filled with zeros.
Then, there are three nested loops that iterate over the elements of dp.
The first loop checks if it is possible to move to an unvisited city. If it is, it updates ndp[i-1][j+1] by adding dp[i][j] multiplied by i (the number of unvisited cities). This represents the transition from state 0 to state 1.
The second loop checks if it is possible to move to a city in state 1. If it is, it updates ndp[i][j] by adding dp[i][j] multiplied by j (the number of cities in state 1). This represents the transition from state 1 to state 1.
The third loop updates ndp[i][0] by adding dp[i][j] multiplied by (N-i-j) (the number of cities in state 2). This represents the transition from state 1 to state 2.
After the nested loops finish, dp is updated to ndp.
Finally, the code prints dp[0][0] modulo 10^9+7.
