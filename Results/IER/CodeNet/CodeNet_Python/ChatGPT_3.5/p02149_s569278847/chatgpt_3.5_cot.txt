<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers A, B, and C as input.
It then compares the maximum of A, B, and C with each of the variables A, B, and C.
If the maximum is equal to A, it prints "A".
If the maximum is equal to B, it prints "B".
Otherwise, it prints "C".
In this case, the maximum of 1000, 900, and 850 is 1000, which is equal to A.
Therefore, the output of the code would be "A".
<<<Output>>>
A
