<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input and multiplies it by 2, storing the result in variable t.
Then, it calculates the integer division of t by 60 and the remainder of t divided by 60.
Finally, it prints the integer division and the remainder as the output.
In this case, the input is 0, so t will also be 0.
The integer division of 0 by 60 is 0, and the remainder is also 0.
Therefore, the output will be "0 0".
<<<Output>>>
0 0
