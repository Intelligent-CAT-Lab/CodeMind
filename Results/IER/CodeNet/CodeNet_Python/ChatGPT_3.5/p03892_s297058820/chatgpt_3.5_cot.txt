<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four integers as input: a, b, c, and d.
It calculates the absolute difference between c and a and stores it in variable x.
It calculates the absolute difference between d and b and stores it in variable y.
If either x or y is equal to 0, it prints 0 and exits the program.
Otherwise, it defines a function gcd(a,b) that calculates the greatest common divisor of a and b using recursion.
It then calculates the gcd of x and y and stores it in variable e.
It divides x and y by e.
Finally, it prints the result of (x+y-1) * e.
In this case, x = 2, y = 3, and e = 1.
So the output will be (2+3-1) * 1 = 4.
