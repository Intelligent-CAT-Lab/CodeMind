<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by importing necessary libraries and setting up some variables.
Then, it reads the input values for N, M, L, and R.
Next, it initializes some variables and constants, including MOD, U, fact, and fact_inv.
The code then calculates the combination values using the fact and fact_inv arrays.
After that, it calculates the values for the array P using the combination values.
Next, it calculates the value for the array Q using the fact and fact_inv arrays.
The code defines a function f(R) that calculates the total value based on the combination values, array P, and array Q.
Finally, it calculates the answer by subtracting f(L-1) from f(R) and takes the modulo MOD.
The answer is then printed.
