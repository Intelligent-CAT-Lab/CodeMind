The variable N is initialized to 4 and variable K is initialized to 2.
The variable MOD is initialized to 10^9 + 7.
The variable i is initialized to 1 and the variable M is initialized to N.
The variable div is initialized as an empty list.
The code then enters a while loop that iterates as long as i * i is less than or equal to N.
Inside the loop, it checks if N is divisible by i. If it is, it appends i to the div list and also appends N // i to the div list if N // i is not equal to i.
After that, i is incremented by 1.
The div list is then sorted in ascending order.
The variable N1 is assigned the length of the div list.
The variable num is initialized as a list of zeros with length N1 + 1.
The variable ans is initialized to 0.
The code then enters a for loop that iterates over the range N1.
Inside the loop, it calculates num[i] by taking K to the power of (div[i] + 1) // 2 modulo MOD.
Then, it enters another for loop that iterates over the range i.
Inside this loop, it checks if div[i] is divisible by div[j]. If it is, it subtracts num[j] from num[i] and adds MOD to the result. It then takes the result modulo MOD.
After that, it checks if div[i] is even. If it is, it adds div[i] * num[i] // 2 to ans and takes the result modulo MOD. Otherwise, it adds div[i] * num[i] to ans and takes the result modulo MOD.
Finally, it prints the value of ans.
