<<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the necessary modules and defines some functions for reading input.
Then, it reads the input values N and A using the read() function.
The code defines a function F(K) that takes a parameter K and calculates the minimum cost for a given value of K.
Inside the function, it calculates the value of n using the formula n = int(N**(1/K)).
Then, it iteratively adjusts the value of n to find the largest value that satisfies the condition (n-1)*n**(K-1) > N and the smallest value that satisfies the condition n * (n+1)**(K-1) < N.
Next, it performs a brute-force search to find the values of x and y that satisfy the condition n**x * (n+1)**y >= N, with y being the smallest possible value.
Finally, it calculates the cost using the formula cost = A*(K-1) + n*x + (n+1)*y and returns it.
The code then uses a list comprehension to calculate the minimum cost for each value of K from 1 to 49, and assigns the minimum value to the variable answer.
Finally, it prints the value of answer.
