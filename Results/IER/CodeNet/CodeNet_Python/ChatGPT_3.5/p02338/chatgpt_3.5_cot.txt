<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called main(). Inside the main() function, it takes two inputs N and K using the input() function and splits them into two separate variables using the map() function. The variables N and K are then compared using a conditional statement. If N is less than or equal to K, it prints 1. Otherwise, it prints 0.

In this case, the input is "5 10". The map() function splits the input into two separate variables: N = 5 and K = 10. Since 5 is not less than or equal to 10, the code prints 0.

<<<Output>>>
0
