<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input and assigns them to variables P, Q, and R.
It then creates a list called res, which contains the sums of P+Q, P+R, and Q+R.
The list res is then sorted in ascending order.
Finally, the code prints the first element of the sorted list, which is the smallest sum.
In this case, the input is 1, 3, and 4. So the sums are [4, 5, 7]. After sorting, the list becomes [4, 5, 7]. The smallest sum is 4.
<<<Output>>>
4
