<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input and assigns it to the variable n.
It then uses a conditional expression to check if n is equal to 0. If it is, it multiplies 0 by (n == 0), which will always be 1, and assigns the result to the variable sum_1.
If n is not equal to 0, it converts n to binary using the bin() function, removes the '0b' prefix from the binary string using slicing, and calculates the length of the resulting string. This length is then multiplied by (n != 0), which will always be 1, and assigned to the variable sum_1.
Finally, the code prints the value of sum_1.
In this case, the input is 0. Since n is equal to 0, the code multiplies 0 by (n == 0), which is 1, and assigns the result to sum_1. Therefore, the output will be 0.
