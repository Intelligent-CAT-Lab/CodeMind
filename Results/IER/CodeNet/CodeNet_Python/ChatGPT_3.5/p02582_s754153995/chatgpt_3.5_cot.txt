<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input from the user and assigns it to the variable s.
The code then checks if s is equal to "RRR". If it is, it prints 3.
If s is not equal to "RRR", the code checks if the substring "RR" is present in s. If it is, it prints 2.
If neither of the above conditions are met, the code checks if the character "R" is present in s. If it is, it prints 1.
If none of the above conditions are met, the code prints 0.
In this case, the input is "RRS". The substring "RR" is present in the input, so the code will print 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
