<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers X and Y as input.
It then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 10^18 (a very large number).
For each iteration, it checks if X multiplied by 2 raised to the power of i is greater than Y.
If this condition is true, it prints the value of i and breaks out of the loop.
In this case, X is 3 and Y is 20.
The loop starts with i=0 and checks if 3*2^0 = 3 is greater than 20. Since it is not, it continues to the next iteration.
In the second iteration, i=1 and it checks if 3*2^1 = 6 is greater than 20. Since it is not, it continues to the next iteration.
This process continues until i=4, where 3*2^4 = 48 is greater than 20. Therefore, it prints the value of i, which is 4, and breaks out of the loop.
