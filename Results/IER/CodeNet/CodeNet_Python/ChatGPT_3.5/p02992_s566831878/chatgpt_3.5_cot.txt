<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized to 3 and variable K is initialized to 2.
The variable LARGE is set to 10^9 + 7.

The code then calculates the square root of N and stores it in variable R.
If (R + 1) ^ 2 is equal to N, then the variable square is set to True.

The code initializes three lists: DP_S, DP_L, and N_L, all of length R.
The elements of DP_S and DP_L are set to 1, and the elements of N_L are set to 1.

If square is True, then DP_M is set to 1 and the variable L is incremented by 1.

The code then enters a loop that iterates from R to 1 (inclusive).
For each iteration, it calculates the quotient of N divided by i and stores it in variable Q.
The element at index i - 1 in DP_L and N_L is set to Q - L.
The variable L is updated to Q.

After the loop, the code enters another loop that iterates K - 1 times.
For each iteration, it calculates the sum of DP_L and DP_M and stores it in variable L.
It also calculates the sum of DP_S and stores it in variable SS.
Then, it enters a nested loop that iterates over the range R.
For each iteration, it updates the variable S by adding DP_S[i] modulo LARGE.
It updates DP_S[i] by adding L and SS modulo LARGE.
It updates L by subtracting DP_L[i] modulo LARGE.
It updates DP_L[i] by multiplying S and N_L[i] modulo LARGE.

If square is True, then DP_M is updated by adding SS modulo LARGE.

Finally, the code prints the sum of DP_L, DP_S, and DP_M modulo LARGE.
