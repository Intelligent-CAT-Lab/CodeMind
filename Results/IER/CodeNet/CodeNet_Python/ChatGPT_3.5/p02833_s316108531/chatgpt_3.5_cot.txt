<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input and assigns it to the variable n.
It then checks if n is odd (n%2==1). If it is, it prints 0 and exits.
If n is even, it initializes variables i, cnt, and n1 to 1, 0, and n respectively.
The code enters a while loop that continues until n1 becomes 0.
Inside the loop, it updates n1 by dividing it by 2*(5**i) and assigns the result back to n1.
It then adds the updated n1 to cnt and increments i by 1.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of cnt.
In this case, since n is 12, it is even. The loop runs twice, with i being 1 and 2.
In the first iteration, n1 becomes 12//(2*(5**1)) = 12//10 = 1, and cnt becomes 1.
In the second iteration, n1 becomes 12//(2*(5**2)) = 12//50 = 0, and cnt becomes 1.
Therefore, the final value of cnt is 1.
