<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads an integer n from the input.
It then calculates the value of i by dividing n by 100 and taking the integer part.
It also calculates the value of j by taking the remainder of n divided by 10.
The code then checks if i is equal to j. If they are equal, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
In this case, n is 575. So, i = 5 and j = 5. Since i is equal to j, the code will print "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
