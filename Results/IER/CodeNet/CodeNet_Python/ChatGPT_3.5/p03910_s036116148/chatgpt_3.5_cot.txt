<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 4.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers.
The variable lst is initialized as an empty list, which will be used to store the numbers.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 4.
For each number i in this range, it adds i to ans and appends i to lst.
The code checks if ans is greater than or equal to n. If it is, it breaks out of the loop.
After the loop finishes, the code calculates the difference between ans and n and stores it in the variable num.
If num is not equal to 0, it removes num from lst.
The code then prints each element in lst on a new line.
In this case, lst contains the numbers [1, 2, 3], so the output will be:
1
2
3
<<<Output>>>
1
2
