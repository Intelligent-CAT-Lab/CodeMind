<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input and assigns it to the variable k.
It initializes the variable now to 100 and the variable cnt to 0.
Then it enters a while loop that continues until the value of now becomes greater than or equal to k.
Inside the loop, it multiplies the value of now by 1.01 and then converts it to an integer using the int() function.
It also increments the value of cnt by 1 in each iteration.
Once the loop condition becomes false, it prints the final value of cnt.
In this case, the loop will iterate 4 times because the value of now will become 100.0, 101.0, 102.0, and 103.0 in the first four iterations.
After the fourth iteration, the value of now becomes 103.0 which is equal to k.
Therefore, the loop condition becomes false and the final value of cnt is 4.
