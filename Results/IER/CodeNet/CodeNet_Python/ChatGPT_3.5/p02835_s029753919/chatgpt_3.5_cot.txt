<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers A, B, and C as input and assigns them to variables A, B, and C respectively.
It then checks if the sum of A, B, and C is greater than 21. If it is, it prints 'bust'. Otherwise, it prints 'win'.
In this case, the sum of 5, 7, and 9 is 21, which is not greater than 21.
Therefore, the code will print 'win'.
<<<Output>>>
win
