<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input and assigns them to variables a and b.
The code then checks the following conditions in order:
1. If a is greater than 0, it prints 'Positive'.
2. If a is less than 0 and b is greater than 0, it prints 'Zero'.
3. If the difference between b and a is divisible by 2, it prints 'Negative'.
4. If none of the above conditions are met, it prints 'Positive'.

In this case, a is 1 and b is 3.
The first condition is not met because a is not greater than 0.
The second condition is not met because a is not less than 0.
The third condition is not met because (b-a)%2 is not equal to 0.
Therefore, the fourth condition is met and the code prints 'Positive'.
<<<Output>>>
Positive
