<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers N and K from the input.
It then checks if K is greater than the maximum number of edges in a complete graph with N vertices. If it is, it prints -1 and exits the program.
Otherwise, it calculates the number of edges needed to form a connected graph with N vertices, which is (N-1)*(N-2)//2. It subtracts K from this value and prints the result.
Next, it prints N-1 edges of the form (1, i) where i ranges from 2 to N.
Then, it enters a nested loop that iterates over all pairs of vertices (i, j) where i ranges from 2 to N-1 and j ranges from i+1 to N. It prints these edges until the number of printed edges is equal to ((N-1)*(N-2)//2) - K.
<<<Output>>>
-1
