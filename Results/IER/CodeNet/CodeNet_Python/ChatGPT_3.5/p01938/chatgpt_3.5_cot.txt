<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string S and initializes a string alpha with all uppercase letters of the alphabet.
It then initializes two variables Now and ans to 0.
The code enters a loop that iterates over each character s in the input string S.
For each character, it finds the index of that character in the string alpha and stores it in the variable Next.
If Now is less than Next, it means that the current character is in alphabetical order. In this case, the code does nothing.
If Now is greater than or equal to Next, it means that the current character is not in alphabetical order. In this case, the code increments the variable ans by 1.
Finally, the code updates the value of Now to Next for the next iteration of the loop.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which represents the number of characters in the input string that are not in alphabetical order.
In this case, the input string is "AIZU". The code compares the indices of the characters in the string alpha and increments ans whenever a character is not in alphabetical order.
The characters in "AIZU" have the following indices in alpha: 0, 8, 25, 20.
Since 0 is less than 8, the code does nothing.
Since 8 is greater than or equal to 25, the code increments ans by 1.
Since 25 is less than 20, the code does nothing.
Therefore, the final value of ans is 1.
