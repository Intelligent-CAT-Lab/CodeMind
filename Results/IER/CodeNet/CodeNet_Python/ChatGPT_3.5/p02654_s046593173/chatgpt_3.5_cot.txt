<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines several functions: mod_pow, prepare, and solve. These functions are used to calculate the solution to a specific problem.

The main part of the code reads two integers, n and a, from the input. These values represent the parameters for the problem.

The solve function is then called with the values of n and a as arguments. This function calculates the solution to the problem using the other functions defined in the code.

The solution is then printed as the output.
