<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes input values for variables h, w, x, and y.
It then calculates the product of h and w, and checks if it is odd (h*w%2==1).
It also checks if the sum of x and y is odd ((x+y)%2==1).
If both conditions are true, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
In this case, h*w is 4*5=20, which is even, and x+y is 2+3=5, which is odd.
Therefore, the condition is not met and the code will print "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
