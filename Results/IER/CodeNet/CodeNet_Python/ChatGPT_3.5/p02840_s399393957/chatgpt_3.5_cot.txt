<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by importing the necessary modules and defining a function gcd(x, y) to calculate the greatest common divisor of two numbers.

Then, it reads three integers N, X, and D from the input.

The variable ans is initialized to 0.

The code then checks for three special cases:
- If X and D are both 0, it means that the equation is always satisfied, so ans is set to 1.
- If X is 0, it means that the equation reduces to D * i = 0, where i is any integer from 1 to N. The number of solutions to this equation is N, so ans is set to N^2 - N * (N + 1) // 2 + 1.
- If D is 0, it means that the equation reduces to X = 0, where X is any integer from 1 to N. The number of solutions to this equation is N + 1, so ans is set to N + 1.

If none of the special cases apply, the code proceeds to calculate the answer using a more general approach.

First, it checks if D is negative. If it is, it negates both X and D to ensure that D is positive.

Then, it calculates the greatest common divisor of X and D using the gcd function and divides X and D by their gcd.

Next, it creates a defaultdict named LR to store the left and right endpoints of the intervals for each residue of (i * X) % D, where i ranges from 1 to N.

For each i, it calculates the left and right endpoints of the interval using the formulas (i-1) * i // 2 and i * N - i * (i + 1) // 2.

It appends the interval (Li + i * X // D, Ri + i * X // D) to the list associated with the residue (i * X) % D in the defaultdict LR.

After all intervals have been calculated, the code iterates over the values of LR.

For each list of intervals, it sorts them in ascending order based on the left endpoint.

Then, it initializes variables lp and rp to the left and right endpoints of the first interval.

It iterates over the remaining intervals and checks if the current interval overlaps with the previous one.

If there is no overlap, it adds the length of the previous interval (rp - lp + 1) to ans and updates lp and rp to the left and right endpoints of the current interval.

If there is an overlap, it updates rp to the maximum of the right endpoint of the current interval and rp.

Finally, it adds the length of the last interval (rp - lp + 1) to ans.

The final value of ans is printed as the output.
