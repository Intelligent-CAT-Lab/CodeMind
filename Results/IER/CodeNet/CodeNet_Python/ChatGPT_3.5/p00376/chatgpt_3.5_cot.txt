<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input and assigns them to variables a and b.
It then checks if a is less than b. If it is, it subtracts a from b and prints the result.
If a is not less than b, it subtracts b from a and prints the result.
In this case, 20 is less than 30, so the code will subtract 20 from 30 and print the result, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
