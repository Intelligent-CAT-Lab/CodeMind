<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string and initializes a variable ans to 0.
Then, it enters a loop that iterates over each character in the input string.
For each character, it checks if it is equal to '+' or '-'. If it is '+', it increments the value of ans by 1. If it is '-', it decrements the value of ans by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans.
In this case, the input string is '+-++'. The code will increment ans by 1 for the first '+', decrement ans by 1 for the '-', and increment ans by 1 for the remaining two '+'. Therefore, the final value of ans will be 1.
