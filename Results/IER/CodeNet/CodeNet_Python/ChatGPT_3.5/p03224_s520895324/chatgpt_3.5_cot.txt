<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input N and enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 1999. 
Inside the loop, it checks if the expression i*(i-1)//2 is equal to N. 
If it is, the code initializes a variable c to 1 and creates a 2D list X with i empty lists.
Then, it enters two nested loops to populate the lists in X. 
For each pair of indices (j, k) where j is less than k, it appends the value of c to X[j] and X[k], and increments c by 1.
After populating X, the code prints "Yes", followed by the length of X, and then prints each list in X.
Finally, it breaks out of the loop.
If the loop completes without finding a match, meaning the condition i*(i-1)//2 == N is never true for any i, the code prints "No".
In this case, the input N is 3. The loop iterates through the values of i from 0 to 1999, but it does not find a match for the condition i*(i-1)//2 == 3.
Therefore, the code prints "No".
