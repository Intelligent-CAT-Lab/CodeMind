The code defines a function inpl() that takes input from the user and returns a list of integers. This function is then used to assign values to the variables W, H, w, h, x, and y.

The code then calculates the value of variable a using the formula:
a = (min(W//2 , x + w//2) + max(-W//2, x-w//2))

The code also calculates the value of variable b using the formula:
b = (min(H//2 , y + h//2) + max(-H//2, y-h//2))

Finally, the code prints the value of b divided by a.

In this case, the values of W, H, w, h, x, and y are 6000, 5000, 20, 10, 400, and 300 respectively.

The value of a is calculated as:
a = (min(6000//2 , 400 + 20//2) + max(-6000//2, 400-20//2))
  = (min(3000 , 410) + max(-3000, 390))
  = (3000 + 390)
  = 3390

The value of b is calculated as:
b = (min(5000//2 , 300 + 10//2) + max(-5000//2, 300-10//2))
  = (min(2500 , 305) + max(-2500, 295))
  = (2500 + 295)
  = 2795

Finally, the code prints the value of b divided by a:
print(2795/3390) = 0.8247813411078717

<<<Output>>>
0.8247813411078717
