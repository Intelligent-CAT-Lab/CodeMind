<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function isPrime(n) that checks if a number n is prime or not. It does this by iterating from 2 to the square root of n and checking if any of these numbers divide n evenly. If any number divides n evenly, then n is not prime and the function returns False. If no number divides n evenly, then n is prime and the function returns True.

The code then takes an input X and enters a while loop. The loop continues until the condition not isPrime(X) is True, meaning X is not a prime number. Inside the loop, X is incremented by 1. This process continues until X becomes a prime number.

Finally, the code prints the value of X.

In this case, the input is 20. The code checks if 20 is prime, which it is not. So it increments X by 1 to become 21. It checks if 21 is prime, which it is not. So it increments X by 1 to become 22. It checks if 22 is prime, which it is not. So it increments X by 1 to become 23. It checks if 23 is prime, which it is. So the loop condition is False and the code prints 23.

<<<Output>>>
23
