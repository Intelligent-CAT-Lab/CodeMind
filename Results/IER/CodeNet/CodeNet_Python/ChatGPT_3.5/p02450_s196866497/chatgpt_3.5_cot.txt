<<<Analysis>>>
The code first reads an integer n from the input, which is 2 in this case.
It then generates all permutations of the numbers from 1 to n using the permutations function from the itertools module.
For each permutation, it converts the elements to strings and joins them with a space separator using the map and join functions.
Finally, it prints each permutation on a new line.
In this case, there are only two numbers, so there are only two permutations: (1, 2) and (2, 1).
<<<Output>>>
1 2
2 1
