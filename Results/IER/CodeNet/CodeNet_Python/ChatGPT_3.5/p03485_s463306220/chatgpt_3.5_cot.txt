<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input and assigns them to variables a and b.
It then calculates the mean of a and b by adding them and dividing by 2, and assigns the result to the variable mean.
The code then uses the math.ceil() function to round up the value of mean to the nearest integer, and assigns the result to the variable ans.
Finally, the code prints the value of ans.
In this case, the input is "1 3", so a is 1 and b is 3.
The mean of 1 and 3 is (1+3)/2 = 2.
The ceil of 2 is 2.
Therefore, the output of the code execution would be 2.
