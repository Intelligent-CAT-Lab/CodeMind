<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines three functions: inverse, comb, and fast_pow. These functions are used to calculate the inverse, combination, and fast power respectively.

The code then initializes the variables MOD, n, a, b, and c using the input values.

The code creates two lists, FACT and INVERSE_FACT, both of size n+1, and initializes the first element of each list to 1.

The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n+1. In each iteration, it calculates the factorial of the current index and stores it in FACT. It also calculates the inverse of the factorial and stores it in INVERSE_FACT.

The code initializes the variable ans to 0.

The code checks if b is odd. If it is, it prints 0 and exits the program.

The code then enters two nested loops. The outer loop iterates from 0 to the minimum of a+1 and c+1. The inner loop iterates from 0 to (c-y)//3+1.

Inside the loops, the code calculates the values of x, rest3, and cur_ans based on the current values of y and z.

The code then checks if b is 0 and rest3 is not 0. If this condition is true, it continues to the next iteration of the inner loop.

Inside the loops, the code calculates the value of cur_ans using the comb function and the values of x, y, z, and b.

The code updates the value of ans by adding cur_ans modulo MOD.

After the loops finish, the code prints the final value of ans.
