<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input and assigns it to the variable n.
It initializes the variable ret to 1 and i to 0.
The code then enters a while loop that continues until ret becomes greater than n.
Inside the loop, it calculates the value of ret as 2 raised to the power of i.
It increments the value of i by 1 in each iteration.
Once the loop exits, it prints the value of ret divided by 2.
In this case, the loop will iterate 6 times because 2^6 = 64, which is greater than 54.
Therefore, the final value of ret will be 64 and the output will be 32.
<<<Output>>>
32
