<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads four floating-point numbers from the input and assigns them to the variables x1, y1, x2, and y2.
It then calculates the distance between the points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) using the distance formula: sqrt((x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2).
Finally, it prints the calculated distance with 6 decimal places.
In this case, the distance between (0, 0) and (1, 1) is sqrt(2), which is approximately 1.414213.
<<<Output>>>
1.414213
