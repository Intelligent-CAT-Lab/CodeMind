The code first takes input as a list of integers and assigns it to the variable i.
Then, it defines a function called in_retangle that takes five arguments: w, h, x, y, and r.
Inside the function, it checks if the value of r is less than or equal to y and if y is less than or equal to h-r. It also checks if r is less than or equal to x and if x is less than or equal to w-r.
If all these conditions are true, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
Finally, the code calls the in_retangle function with the values from the input list i.
In this case, the values are w=5, h=4, x=2, y=2, and r=1.
So, the conditions are true and the output will be "Yes".
