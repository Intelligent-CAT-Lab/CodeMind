<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by initializing the variables N, M, A, and B to the values 3, 4, 4, and 2 respectively.
Then, a 2D list called ans is created with dimensions N x M, filled with '.' characters.
Next, the code checks if M is odd. If it is, it enters a loop that iterates from 0 to N-1 with a step of 2. Inside the loop, it checks if B is greater than 0. If it is, it decrements B by 1 and assigns '^' to ans[i][M-1] and 'v' to ans[i+1][M-1].
After that, the code checks if N is odd. If it is, it enters a loop that iterates from M-2 to -1 with a step of -2. Inside the loop, it checks if A is greater than 0. If it is, it decrements A by 1 and assigns '<' to ans[N-1][i] and '>' to ans[N-1][i+1].
Next, the code checks if 2 * (A + B) is equal to (N / 2) * (M / 2) * 4 and if N % 2, M % 2, A % 2 are all equal to 1. If these conditions are met, it sets the flag variable to True and increments A by 1.
After that, the code enters a loop that iterates from N-2-N%2 to -1 with a step of -2. Inside this loop, there is another loop that iterates from 0 to M-1 with a step of 2. Inside this inner loop, the code checks various conditions to determine which characters to assign to ans[i][j], ans[i+1][j], ans[i][j+1], and ans[i+1][j+1]. The conditions depend on the values of A and B.
If the flag variable is True, the code assigns '^' to ans[N-2][0], '.' to ans[N-2][1], and 'v' to ans[N-1][0]. It also sets B to 0.
Finally, the code checks if A or B are greater than 0. If either of them is, it prints "NO" and exits the program. Otherwise, it prints "YES" and then prints each row of the ans list joined into a string.
