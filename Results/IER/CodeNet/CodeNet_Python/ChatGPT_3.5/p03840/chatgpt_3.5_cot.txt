<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes 7 inputs: I, O, T, J, L, S, Z. In this case, the inputs are 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0 respectively.
The code then checks if I, J, and L are all non-zero. In this case, I and J are non-zero, but L is zero, so the condition is not met.
Since the condition is not met, the value of a is set to 0.
The value of b is calculated by summing the integer division of I, J, and L by 2, multiplying it by 2, and adding O to it. In this case, b = (2//2 + 1//2 + 0//2)*2 + 1 = 2.
Finally, the code sets the value of ans to the maximum of a and b, which is 2.
The code then prints the value of ans, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
