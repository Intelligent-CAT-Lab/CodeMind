<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called main() which takes no arguments.
Inside the main() function, it reads an integer n from input.
It initializes a list a with a single element 0.
Then it enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 50000 (inclusive).
In each iteration, it appends the sum of the current element and the previous element in a to a.
After the loop finishes, it uses the bisect_left() function from the bisect module to find the index of the first element in a that is greater than or equal to n.
It initializes a list r with t elements equal to 1, followed by t elements equal to 0, where t is the index found in the previous step.
Then it enters another loop that iterates t times.
In each iteration, it calculates the value of ai as the element in a at index t-i, and the value of ti as t+i.
If n is less than ai, it calculates the value of ts as the minimum of t and ai-n.
It swaps the values of r[ti] and r[ti-ts], and subtracts t-ts from n.
If n is greater than or equal to ai, it breaks out of the loop.
Finally, it returns a string obtained by mapping the elements of r to '()' characters and joining them together.
Outside the main() function, it calls the main() function and prints the returned value.
