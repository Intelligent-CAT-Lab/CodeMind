<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function cmb(n, r, mod) that calculates the combination of n choose r modulo mod. It uses the factorial and inverse factorial tables to calculate the combination efficiently.

The code then takes two integers X and Y as input and assigns the smaller value to x and the larger value to y.

Next, the code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to y (inclusive). For each iteration, it calculates the number of times to use 1 and 2, represented by tmp_x and tmp_y respectively. It then calculates the remaining values of x and y after using the 1s and 2s. If res_x is positive and res_y is divisible by res_x and equal to res_y divided by res_x, it assigns the values of i and res_x to n1 and n2 respectively and breaks out of the loop. If res_x is 0 and res_y is 0, it assigns the value of i to both n1 and n2 and breaks out of the loop. If res_x is negative, it assigns 0 to ans and breaks out of the loop.

If ans is not 0, it calculates the combination of n1 choose r modulo mod using the cmb function defined earlier and assigns the result to ans.

Finally, it checks if the sum of x and y is divisible by 3. If it is not, it assigns 0 to ans. It then calculates ans modulo (10^9 + 7) and prints the result.
