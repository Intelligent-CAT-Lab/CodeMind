<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called main() which takes no arguments.
Inside the main() function, it reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable n.
It then initializes the variable _debt to 100000.
Next, it enters a loop that iterates n times.
In each iteration of the loop, it calculates the interest on the debt using the formula _debt*0.05*0.001 and rounds it up to the nearest integer using the math.ceil() function.
It then multiplies the rounded interest by 1000 and adds it to the debt.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of _debt.
In this case, the loop iterates 5 times, so the interest is calculated and added to the debt 5 times.
