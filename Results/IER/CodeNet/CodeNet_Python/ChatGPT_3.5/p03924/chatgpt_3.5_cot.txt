<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers n and m as input.
It initializes a variable mod to 10^9 + 7.
It creates a 3-dimensional list dp with dimensions (2, n+1, n+1) and initializes all elements to 0.
It sets dp[0][1][1] to 1.
Then it enters a loop that iterates m times.
Inside this loop, it first sets all elements of dp[(i+1)%2] to 0.
Then it enters two nested loops. The first loop iterates from 1 to n+1 and the second loop iterates from 1 to j+1.
Inside these loops, it updates the values of dp[(i+1)%2][min(j+1,n)][k], dp[(i+1)%2][j][k], and dp[(i+1)%2][j][j] based on the values of dp[i%2][j][k].
Finally, it prints dp[m%2][n][n] % mod.
