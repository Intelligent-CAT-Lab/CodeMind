<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes input as a string and splits it into a list of strings using the split() function. The resulting list contains three elements: '4', '3', and '2'.
The code then joins the elements of the list into a single string using the join() function, resulting in the string '432'.
The code converts this string to an integer using the int() function and checks if it is divisible by 4 using the modulo operator (%).
If the integer is divisible by 4, the code prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
In this case, the integer 432 is not divisible by 4, so the code will print 'NO'.
<<<Output>>>
NO
