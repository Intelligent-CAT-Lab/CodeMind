<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four inputs: r, g, b, and n.
It initializes a variable count to 0, which will be used to count the number of combinations that satisfy the condition.
The code then enters a nested loop. The outer loop iterates from 0 to n/r (inclusive), and the inner loop iterates from 0 to (n-i*r)/g (inclusive).
Inside the inner loop, the code calculates the remaining value k by subtracting i*r and j*g from n.
If k is divisible by b (i.e., k % b == 0), it means that the combination of i, j, and k satisfies the condition, so count is incremented by 1.
After the loops finish, the code prints the final value of count, which represents the number of combinations that satisfy the condition.
In this case, the code will iterate through the following combinations:
(0, 0, 4), (0, 1, 1), (0, 2, -2), (1, 0, 1), (1, 1, -2), (2, 0, -2)
Out of these combinations, only (0, 1, 1) and (1, 0, 1) satisfy the condition, so the final value of count will be 2.
