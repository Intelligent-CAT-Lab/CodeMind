<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized to 20.
The code then calculates the value of 800*N-200*(N//15).
N//15 calculates the integer division of N by 15.
So, N//15 will be 1 for N=20.
Therefore, the expression becomes 800*20-200*1, which simplifies to 16000-200, resulting in 15800.
Finally, the code prints the value of 15800.
<<<Output>>>
15800
