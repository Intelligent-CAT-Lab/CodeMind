<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes input as a list of integers and stores it in the variable l.
Then it sorts the list in ascending order using the sort() method.
Next, it concatenates the second and third elements of the sorted list, converts it to an integer, and adds it to the first element of the list.
Finally, it prints the result.
In this case, the input list is [1, 5, 2].
After sorting, the list becomes [1, 2, 5].
The code then concatenates the second and third elements, which are 2 and 5, resulting in the string "25".
This string is converted to an integer and added to the first element of the list, which is 1.
Therefore, the final result is 26.
<<<Output>>>
