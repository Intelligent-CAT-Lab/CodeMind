<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called factorization that takes an integer n as input and returns a list of lists. Each inner list contains a prime factor of n and its corresponding exponent.
The code then reads an integer n from input.
If n is equal to 1, the code prints 0 and exits.
Otherwise, it calls the factorization function with n as the argument and stores the result in the variable nfac.
The code initializes a variable r to 0, which will be used to count the number of factors.
Then, it enters a loop that iterates over each inner list in nfac.
For each inner list, it initializes a variable c to 1, which will be used to count the number of factors of the current prime factor.
The code then enters another loop that continues until c is greater than the exponent of the current prime factor.
In each iteration of this loop, it subtracts c from the exponent of the current prime factor, adds 1 to r, and adds 1 to c.
Once c is greater than the exponent of the current prime factor, the code breaks out of the inner loop.
After the outer loop finishes, the code prints the final value of r, which represents the total number of factors of n.
