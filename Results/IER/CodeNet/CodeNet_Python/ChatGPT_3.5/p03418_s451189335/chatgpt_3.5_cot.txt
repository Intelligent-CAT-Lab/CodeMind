<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines several helper functions for inputting data, such as getN(), getNM(), getList(), and getArray(). These functions are used to read integers, lists, and arrays from input.

The code then imports several modules and sets some variables, including the value of mod.

Next, the code reads two integers N and K using the getNM() function.

The variable sum is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of the values of opt1 and opt2.

The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), with the variable b representing the current iteration.

Inside the loop, the code calculates the value of opt1, which is equal to (N // b) * max(0, (b - K)). This represents the number of times b can be divided into N, multiplied by the maximum of 0 and (b - K). If K is 0, opt1 is simply (N // b) * b, which is equal to N. Otherwise, opt1 is (N // b) * (b - K).

The code then calculates the value of opt2, which depends on the value of K. If K is 0, opt2 is equal to N % b, which is the remainder when N is divided by b. Otherwise, opt2 is equal to max(0, (N % b) - K + 1), which represents the maximum of 0 and (N % b) - K + 1.

Finally, the code adds the values of opt1 and opt2 to the variable sum.

After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum.
