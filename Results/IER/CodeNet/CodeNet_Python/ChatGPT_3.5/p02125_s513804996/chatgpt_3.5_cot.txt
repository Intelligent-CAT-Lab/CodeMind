<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input and assigns it to the variable n.
It initializes the variable ans to 0 and the variable tmp to 1.
The code then enters a while loop that continues as long as tmp is less than or equal to n+1.
Inside the loop, tmp is multiplied by 2 and ans is incremented by 1.
Once the loop condition is no longer satisfied, the code subtracts 1 from ans and prints its value.
In this case, the input is 2.
The loop will run twice because tmp starts at 1 and is multiplied by 2 each time.
The first iteration will set tmp to 2 and ans to 1.
The second iteration will set tmp to 4 and ans to 2.
Since 4 is not less than or equal to 3, the loop will exit.
Finally, the code subtracts 1 from ans and prints its value, which is 1.
