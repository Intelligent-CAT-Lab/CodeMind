<<<Analysis>>>
The variable U is initialized to 2*10^5 and the variable MOD is initialized to 10^9+7.
The code then initializes four lists: fact, fact_inv, two, and two_inv, each with length U+1.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to U+1. In each iteration, it calculates the factorial of i and stores it in fact[i]. It also calculates the power of 2 to the i and stores it in two[i].
After the loop, the code calculates the modular inverse of fact[U] and two[U] using the pow function and stores them in fact_inv[U] and two_inv[U], respectively.
The code then enters another loop that iterates from U to 0 (inclusive) in reverse order. In each iteration, it calculates the modular inverse of i and stores it in fact_inv[i-1] and two_inv[i-1].
Next, the code defines a function comb(n, k) that calculates the binomial coefficient using the fact, fact_inv, and MOD variables.
The code then reads two integers B and W from input.
The code initializes two variables p and q to 0.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to B+W+1. In each iteration, it calculates the value of ans using the formula 1 - p + q. It then calculates the modular inverse of two_inv[1] and multiplies it with ans. The result is stored in ans.
The code prints the value of ans.
The code then updates the values of p and q using the comb function and two_inv[i].
Finally, the code prints the final values of ans in each iteration of the loop.
