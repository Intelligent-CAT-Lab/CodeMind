<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three inputs separated by spaces: A, x, and C.
It then prints a string that concatenates "A", the first character of x, and "C".
In this case, the input is "AtCoder Beginner Contest", so A = "AtCoder", x = "Beginner", and C = "Contest".
The code will print "ABeginnerC".
<<<Output>>>
ABeginnerC
