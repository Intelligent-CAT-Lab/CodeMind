<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by importing necessary modules and setting some constants.
Then it reads two integers n and k from input.
The code defines three functions: comb, pow, and inv.
The comb function calculates the combination of two numbers using recursion and memoization.
The pow function calculates the power of a number using a loop and memoization.
The inv function calculates the inverse of a number using a loop and memoization.
The code initializes ans to the result of pow(k).
Then it initializes sig to -1.
The code enters a loop that iterates from k-1 to 1 (inclusive) in reverse order.
Inside the loop, it calculates the combination of k and i, multiplies it by the result of pow(i), and adds it to ans multiplied by sig.
After the loop, the code enters another loop that iterates from 1 to k (inclusive).
Inside this loop, it multiplies ans by the inverse of i.
Finally, the code prints the value of ans.
