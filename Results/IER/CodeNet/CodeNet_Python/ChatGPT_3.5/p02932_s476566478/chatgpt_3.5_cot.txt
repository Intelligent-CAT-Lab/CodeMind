The code starts by importing the necessary libraries and reading the input values N, M, L, and R.
It then initializes some variables and constants, including MOD, X, and arrays fact and fact_inv.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to X, where X is 1000 in this case.
Inside the loop, it updates the fact array by multiplying each column by the previous column and taking the modulo MOD.
After the loop, it updates the fact array by multiplying each row by the last element of the previous row and taking the modulo MOD.
The fact array is then flattened into a 1D array.
The code then enters another loop that iterates from X to 1 in reverse order.
Inside this loop, it updates the fact_inv array in a similar manner as before.
The fact_inv array is also flattened and reversed.
Next, the code initializes an array P of size R+1 with zeros.
It then iterates over the comb array, which is calculated using the fact and fact_inv arrays, and updates the P array accordingly.
After that, it subtracts the values of P from itself shifted by M positions.
The P array is then taken modulo MOD.
The code then calculates the Q array using the fact and fact_inv arrays.
Next, it defines a function f(R) that calculates the total, x, and coef values based on the fact, fact_inv, Q, and P arrays.
Finally, it calculates the answer by subtracting f(L-1) from f(R) and taking the modulo MOD.
The answer is then printed.
