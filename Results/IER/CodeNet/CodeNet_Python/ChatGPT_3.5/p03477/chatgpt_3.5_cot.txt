<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four integers as input: A, B, C, and D.
It then checks if the sum of A and B is less than the sum of C and D. If this condition is true, it prints "Right".
If the sum of A and B is equal to the sum of C and D, it prints "Balanced".
If neither of the above conditions is true, it prints "Left".
In this case, A=3, B=8, C=7, and D=1.
The sum of A and B is 3+8=11, and the sum of C and D is 7+1=8.
Since 11 is greater than 8, the condition A+B<C+D is false.
The code then checks the next condition, A+B==C+D, which is also false.
Therefore, the code prints "Left".
