<<<Analysis>>>
The input is "1 2 +". The code splits the input into a list of strings, ['1', '2', '+'].
The code initializes an empty list s, which will be used as a stack to store the numbers.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the elements of the input list.
For each element, the code checks if it is an operator (+, -, or *). If it is, it pops the top two numbers from the stack, performs the corresponding operation, and pushes the result back onto the stack.
In this case, the first element is '1', which is not an operator, so it is converted to an integer and pushed onto the stack.
The second element is '2', which is also pushed onto the stack.
The third element is '+', which is an operator. The code pops '2' and '1' from the stack, performs the addition, and pushes the result (3) back onto the stack.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final element of the stack, which is the result of the calculation. In this case, it is 3.
