<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by importing necessary modules and defining some variables.
Then it reads three integers n, h, and d from input.
It initializes a list fac with the first element as 1.
It enters a loop that appends the product of the last element of fac and the length of fac modulo mod to fac until the length of fac is equal to big.
It initializes a list cumfac with the first element as 0.
It enters a loop that appends the sum of the last element of cumfac and the current element of fac modulo mod to cumfac for each element in fac.
It initializes a list DP with h+1 elements, all set to 0.
It sets the first element of DP to fac[n].
It calculates the value of multi as cumfac[n+1] minus cumfac[1].
It initializes a variable s to 0.
It enters a loop that iterates from 1 to h-1.
For each iteration, it adds the value of DP[i-1] to s.
If i-d-1 is greater than or equal to 0, it subtracts the value of DP[i-d-1] from s.
It takes the modulo of s with mod.
It sets the value of DP[i] to the product of s and multi modulo mod.
After the loop, it sets the value of DP[h] to the sum of the elements in DP from index max(0,h-d) to h modulo mod.
Finally, it prints the last element of DP.
