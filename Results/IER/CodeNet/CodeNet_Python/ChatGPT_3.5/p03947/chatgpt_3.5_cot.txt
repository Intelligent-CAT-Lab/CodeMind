<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string S, which is initialized to "BBBWW".
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of times the adjacent characters in the string are different.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to len(S)-2, which means it will consider all characters in the string except the last one.
For each character at index i in the loop, it checks if the character at index i is different from the character at index i+1. If they are different, it increments the value of ans by 1.
In this case, the loop will iterate 4 times, comparing the characters at indices 0 and 1, 1 and 2, 2 and 3, and 3 and 4. Since the characters are different in all these cases, ans will be incremented by 4.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 4.
<<<Output>>>
4
