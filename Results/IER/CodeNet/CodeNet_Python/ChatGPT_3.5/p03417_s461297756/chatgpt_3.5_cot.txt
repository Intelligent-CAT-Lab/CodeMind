<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers n and m as input.
It then checks if both n and m are greater than or equal to 2. If they are, it calculates the area of a rectangle with sides (n-2) and (m-2) and prints the result.
If n is equal to 1 and m is greater than 1, it calculates the area of a rectangle with sides 1 and (m-2) and prints the result.
If m is equal to 1 and n is greater than 1, it calculates the area of a rectangle with sides (n-2) and 1 and prints the result.
If none of the above conditions are met, it prints 1.
In this case, n and m are both equal to 2, so the first condition is met. The code calculates the area of a rectangle with sides (2-2) and (2-2), which is 0, and prints the result.
