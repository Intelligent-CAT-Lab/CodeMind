<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called prime_factorization that takes an integer N as input and returns a list of lists. Each inner list contains two elements: the prime factor and its corresponding exponent in the prime factorization of N.

The code then initializes a variable mod to 10^9 + 7 and reads an integer N from the input.

Next, it creates a list called prime_list with N elements, all initialized to 0.

If N is equal to 1, the code prints 1 and exits.

Otherwise, it enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive). For each iteration, it calls the prime_factorization function to get the prime factorization of the current number i. The result is stored in a temporary list called tmp_list.

Then, the code iterates over the elements of tmp_list and updates the corresponding elements in prime_list by adding the exponents.

After the loop finishes, the code initializes a variable ans to 1.

Then, it enters another loop that iterates from 1 to N-1. For each iteration, it multiplies ans by the value of prime_list[i] + 1 and takes the modulo mod.

Finally, the code prints the value of ans.
