The variable E and variable Y are initialized to 0 and 2015, respectively.
The code then checks the value of E. If E is 0, it enters a nested if-else statement to determine the output based on the value of Y.
If Y is less than 1912, it prints "M" followed by the difference between Y and 1867.
If Y is between 1912 and 1926, it prints "T" followed by the difference between Y and 1911.
If Y is between 1926 and 1989, it prints "S" followed by the difference between Y and 1925.
If Y is greater than or equal to 1989, it prints "H" followed by the difference between Y and 1988.
If E is not 0, it checks the value of E and adds it to the corresponding base year (1867, 1911, 1925, or 1988) to get the final output.
In this case, E is 0 and Y is 2015. Since 1989 is greater than Y, the code enters the third condition and prints "S" followed by the difference between Y and 1925, which is 90.
