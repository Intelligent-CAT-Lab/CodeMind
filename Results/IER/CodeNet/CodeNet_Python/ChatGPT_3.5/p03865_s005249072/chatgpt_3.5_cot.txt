<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string from the input and assigns it to the variable s.
It then calculates the length of the string and assigns it to the variable n.
The code checks if the first character of the string is equal to the last character. If they are equal, it sets the variable move to 1, otherwise it sets it to 0.
The code then calculates the value of move as (n - move) % 2.
If move is equal to 1, it prints 'First', otherwise it prints 'Second'.
In this case, the first and last characters of the string are 'a', so move is set to 1.
Since move is equal to 1, the code prints 'First'.
<<<Output>>>
First
