<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 5 and variable k is initialized to 3.
The code then creates a list called edges, which contains pairs of numbers [1, i] for i in the range from 2 to n+1 (inclusive). In this case, edges will be [[1, 2], [1, 3], [1, 4], [1, 5]].
The variable cnt is calculated as (n-1)*(n-2)//2, which is 3 in this case.
The variable ans is initialized to n-1, which is 4 in this case.
The code then checks if cnt is less than k. If it is, it prints -1 and exits the program.
Otherwise, it enters a nested loop that iterates from 2 to n-1 (inclusive) and from i+1 to n (inclusive).
Inside this loop, it checks if cnt is greater than k. If it is, it subtracts 1 from cnt, adds 1 to ans, and appends the pair [i, j] to the edges list.
If cnt is not greater than k, it breaks out of the inner loop.
After the loop finishes, it prints the value of ans, which is 4.
Then it prints each pair in the edges list, separated by a space.
The output will be:
4
1 2
1 3
1 4
1 5
