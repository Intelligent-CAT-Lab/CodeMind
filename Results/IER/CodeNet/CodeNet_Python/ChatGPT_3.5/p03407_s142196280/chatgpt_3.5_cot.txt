<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers A, B, and C as input.
It then checks if the sum of A and B is greater than or equal to C.
If the condition is true, it prints 'Yes', otherwise it prints 'No'.
In this case, A=50, B=100, and C=120.
The sum of A and B is 150, which is greater than C.
Therefore, the code will print 'Yes'.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
