<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string S and initializes an empty string new_S.
Then, it iterates through each character s in S.
If s is equal to "9", it appends "1" to new_S.
If s is equal to "1", it appends "9" to new_S.
Otherwise, it appends s itself to new_S.
After iterating through all characters in S, it prints the final value of new_S.
In this case, the input string is "119".
The first character is "1", so it appends "9" to new_S.
The second character is "1", so it appends "9" to new_S.
The third character is "9", so it appends "1" to new_S.
Therefore, the final value of new_S is "991".
<<<Output>>>
991
