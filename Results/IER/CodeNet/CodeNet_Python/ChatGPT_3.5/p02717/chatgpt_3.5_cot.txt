<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to variables X, Y, and Z.
Then, it assigns the values of X, Y, and Z to variables A, B, and C, respectively.
Next, it reassigns the values of A, B, and C to B, C, and A, respectively.
Finally, it prints the values of A, B, and C.
So, the output will be "3 1 2".
<<<Output>>>
