<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes input in the form of two integers, a and b, using the map function and split method. In this case, the input is "15 25".
The code then checks if both a and b are less than or equal to 100. If this condition is true, it proceeds to the next step.
Inside the if statement, it calculates the product of a and b, divides it by 3.305785, and formats the result with 4 decimal places using f-string formatting.
Since both a and b are less than or equal to 100, the condition is true and the code prints the result of the calculation, which is "11.3964".
<<<Output>>>
11.3964
