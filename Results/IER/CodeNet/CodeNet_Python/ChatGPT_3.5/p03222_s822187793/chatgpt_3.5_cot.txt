<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function main() and imports the sys module. It then reads the input values for variables h, w, and k from the standard input. The variable mod is set to 10^9 + 7.

If w is equal to 1, the code prints 1 and returns, ending the execution.

The code initializes a list called fib with the first few Fibonacci numbers. It then appends the number 1 three times to the list.

The code creates a 2D list called dp with dimensions h x w and initializes all elements to 0. The first two elements of the first row of dp are set to fib[w-2] and fib[w-3].

The code then enters a nested loop that iterates over the rows and columns of dp. For each element dp[i][j], it calculates its value based on the values of the previous row and the Fibonacci numbers. The calculation involves multiplying and adding various Fibonacci numbers and modulo operation with mod.

Finally, the code prints the value of dp[-1][k-1], which is the last element of the last row of dp.
