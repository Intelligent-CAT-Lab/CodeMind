<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called CheckDisit(a) which takes a string as input. It initializes a variable tmp to 0 and then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 10 (inclusive). Inside the loop, it checks if the current index i is less than or equal to 4. If it is, it multiplies the integer value of the character at index i in the input string a by (6-i) and adds it to tmp. Otherwise, it multiplies the integer value of the character at index i in the input string a by (12-i) and adds it to tmp. After the loop finishes, it calculates tmp modulo 11 and stores the result in tmp. If tmp is less than or equal to 1, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it returns (11 - tmp).

The code then reads a string from input and stores it in a list called m. It checks if the character at index 11 in m is '?'. If it is, it calls the CheckDisit function with m as the argument and prints the result. Otherwise, it initializes an empty list called ans and finds the index of '?' in m and stores it in x. It then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 9 (inclusive). Inside the loop, it replaces the character at index x in m with the string representation of the current loop variable i. It checks if the integer value of the character at index 11 in m is equal to the result of calling the CheckDisit function with m as the argument. If it is, it appends i to the ans list. After the loop finishes, it checks if the length of ans is equal to 1. If it is, it prints the first element of ans. Otherwise, it prints "MULTIPLE".
