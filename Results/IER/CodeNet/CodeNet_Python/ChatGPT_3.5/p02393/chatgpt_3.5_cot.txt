<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes input as a string of numbers separated by spaces and converts it into a list of integers using the map() function.
The list s is then sorted in ascending order and stored in s1.
Finally, the code prints the first three elements of s1, separated by spaces.
In this case, the sorted list s1 would be [1, 3, 8], so the output would be "1 3 8".
<<<Output>>>
1 3 8
