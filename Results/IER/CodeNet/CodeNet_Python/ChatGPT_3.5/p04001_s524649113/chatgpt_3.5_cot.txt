<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a class called `Formula` with an `__init__` method and a `calc_sum` method. The `__init__` method initializes the instance variables `input`, `sum`, `input_len`, `input_split_pos`, and `mask`. The `calc_sum` method takes a string `S` and an integer `split_pos` as input and calculates the sum of the numbers obtained by splitting `S` at the positions specified by `split_pos`. The `main` function reads an input string `S`, creates an instance of the `Formula` class, and then iterates over all possible values of `bits` from 0 to `formula.mask`. For each value of `bits`, it calls the `calc_sum` method of the `formula` instance with `S` and `bits & formula.mask` as arguments. Finally, it prints the value of `formula.sum`.

In this case, the input string is "125". The `Formula` instance is created with `S` set to "125". The `input_len` is set to 3, and `input_split_pos` is set to 2. The `mask` is calculated as 2^2 - 1 = 3. The `bits` variable is initialized to 0. The code then enters a loop that iterates while `bits` is less than or equal to `formula.mask`. In each iteration, it calls the `calc_sum` method with `S` and `bits & formula.mask` as arguments. The `calc_sum` method splits the input string at the positions specified by the binary representation of `bits & formula.mask` and calculates the sum of the resulting numbers. The `sum` instance variable of the `Formula` instance is updated with the calculated sum. After the loop finishes, the final value of `formula.sum` is printed.
