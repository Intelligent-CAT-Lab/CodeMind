<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs, n and p, and initializes an empty list called arr.
It then defines a function called factorization that takes an integer n as input.
Inside the function, it initializes a variable called temp to the value of n.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to the square root of n (inclusive).
For each iteration, it checks if temp is divisible by i. If it is, it counts the number of times i divides temp and stores it in a variable called cnt.
The code then divides temp by i and appends a list containing i and cnt to the arr list.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if temp is not equal to 1. If it is not, it means that temp is a prime number and it appends a list containing temp and 1 to the arr list.
If the arr list is empty, it means that n is a prime number and it appends a list containing n and 1 to the arr list.
Finally, the function returns the arr list.
Outside the function, the code calls the factorization function with the input p and assigns the returned list to the variable l.
It then initializes a variable called ans to 1.
The code enters a loop that iterates over the elements of the l list.
For each element, it checks if the second element of the element (which represents the count of the prime factor) is greater than or equal to n.
If it is, it multiplies ans by the first element of the element (which represents the prime factor) raised to the power of the integer division of the count by n.
Finally, the code prints the value of ans.
