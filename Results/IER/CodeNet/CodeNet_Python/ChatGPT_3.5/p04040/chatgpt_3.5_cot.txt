<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a class COMB_MOD that calculates combinations modulo a given number. It initializes some variables and precomputes factorials, inverses, and inverse factorials using the modulo operation.

The code then takes input values for variables mod, h, w, a, and b. These values are used in the subsequent calculations.

The code initializes a variable ans to 0.

The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to h-a-1. For each iteration, it calculates two combinations using the COMB_MOD class: C.comb(b-1+i,i) and C.comb(h-1-i+w-1-b,h-1-i). It multiplies these two combinations and adds the result to ans. The modulo operation is applied to ans after each addition.

Finally, the code prints the final value of ans.
