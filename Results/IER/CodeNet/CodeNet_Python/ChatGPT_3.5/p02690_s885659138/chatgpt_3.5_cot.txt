<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input and assigns it to the variable n.
Then, it enters a loop that iterates from 0 to the integer value of the fifth root of n plus 100.
Inside the loop, it assigns the current value of i to the variable a.
It calculates the value of b by subtracting n from the fifth power of a.
Then, it calculates the absolute value of b and takes the fifth root of it, assigning it to the variable c.
If b is negative, it negates the value of c.
Finally, it checks if the fifth power of c is equal to b. If it is, it prints the values of a and c and exits the program.
If no solution is found, the program will continue to the next iteration of the loop until it reaches the end.
If the loop finishes without finding a solution, it will not print anything.
