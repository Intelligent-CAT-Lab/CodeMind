<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input N.
It first checks if the remainder of N divided by 10 is equal to 9. If it is, it prints "Yes".
If the above condition is not true, it checks if the integer division of N by 10 is equal to 9. If it is, it prints "Yes".
If both conditions are false, it prints "No".
In this case, the input N is 29. The remainder of 29 divided by 10 is 9, so the first condition is true and the code prints "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
