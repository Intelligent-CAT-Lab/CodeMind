<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by initializing the variable M to 55555 and the variable m to the square root of M plus 1. It also creates a list S of size M+1, filled with zeros.

Then, the code enters a loop that iterates from 2 to m+1. For each number i in this range, it enters another loop that iterates from i*2 to M+1 with a step size of i. In this inner loop, it sets the value of S[j] to 1, effectively marking all multiples of i as non-prime numbers.

After the sieve algorithm finishes, the code reads an input value N.

Then, the code initializes the variable cnt to 0 and enters a loop that iterates from 2 to M+1. For each number i in this range, it checks if S[i] is 0 (meaning i is a prime number) and if i%5 is equal to 1. If both conditions are true, it prints the value of i, increments cnt by 1, and checks if cnt is equal to N. If cnt is equal to N, it exits the loop using the quit() function.
