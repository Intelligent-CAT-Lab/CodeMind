<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input and assigns them to variables a and b.
It then calculates the value of c by adding b to itself, which is 4+4=8 in this case.
The code then checks if the difference between a and c is not equal to 0 and if it is greater than or equal to 0.
In this case, a-c is 12-8=4, which is not equal to 0 and is greater than 0.
So, the code prints the value of a-c, which is 4.
<<<Output>>>
4
