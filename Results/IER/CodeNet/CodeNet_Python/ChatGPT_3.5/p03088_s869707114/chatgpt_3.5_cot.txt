<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input n.
It initializes variables A, C, G, T, M, and R.
It creates a 4-dimensional list dp with dimensions (n+1) x 4 x 4 x 4 and initializes all elements to 0.
It sets dp[0][T][T][T] to 1.
Then it enters a nested loop that iterates over i, j, k, l, and m.
Inside the loop, it checks multiple conditions using if statements.
If the conditions are met, it updates dp[i][k][l][m] by adding dp[i-1][j][k][l] modulo M.
Finally, it calculates the sum of all elements in dp[n] and takes the modulo M.
The result is printed as the output.
