<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input and assigns them to variables a, b, and c.
It then checks if the difference between b and a is equal to the difference between c and b.
In this case, b-a = 4-2 = 2 and c-b = 6-4 = 2, so the condition is true.
Therefore, the code will print 'YES'.
<<<Output>>>
YES
