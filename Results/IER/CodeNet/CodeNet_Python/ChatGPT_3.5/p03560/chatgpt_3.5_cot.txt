<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by taking an integer input K.
It then initializes a list called edge with K empty lists. This list will store the edges of the graph.
Next, it enters a loop that iterates from 1 to K-1. For each iteration, it appends two tuples to the edge list.
The first tuple is ((i+1)%K, 1), which represents an edge from i to (i+1)%K with a cost of 1.
The second tuple is ((i*10)%K, 0), which represents an edge from i to (i*10)%K with a cost of 0.
After setting up the graph, the code defines a function called dijkstra that takes three parameters: fro, to, and v.
Inside the dijkstra function, it initializes a variable called MAX to a large value (1e9).
It then initializes two lists: dist and check, both of size v. The dist list will store the shortest distance from fro to each vertex, and the check list will keep track of whether a vertex has been visited or not.
The code sets the distance from fro to itself as 0 and adds (0, fro) to a priority queue called pq.
Next, it enters a loop that iterates v times. In each iteration, it finds the vertex with the smallest distance from fro that has not been visited yet.
It then updates the distances of the neighboring vertices if a shorter path is found.
Finally, the code returns the shortest distance from fro to to, plus 1.
Outside the dijkstra function, the code calls the dijkstra function with parameters 1, 0, and K, and prints the result.
