<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers N and X from the input.
It then defines several functions and constants.
The function cumprod calculates the cumulative product of an array modulo MOD.
The function make_fact generates arrays of factorials and their inverses modulo MOD.
The function F1 calculates the sum of a polynomial series for the case where the last element is less than X.
The function F2 calculates the sum of a polynomial series for the case where the last element is between X+1 and 2X-1.
The function F3 calculates the sum of a polynomial series for the case where the last element is greater than or equal to 2X and X is odd.
Finally, the code calculates the answer by summing the results of F1, F2, and F3 modulo MOD, and prints the answer.
