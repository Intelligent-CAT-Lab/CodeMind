<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input and assigns it to the variable n.
It initializes three variables: ans, sub, and sub2, all set to 1.
Then it enters a loop that iterates n times.
In each iteration, it multiplies ans by 10 and takes the modulo with (10^9 + 7).
It also multiplies sub by 9 and takes the modulo with (10^9 + 7).
Similarly, it multiplies sub2 by 8 and takes the modulo with (10^9 + 7).
After the loop finishes, it subtracts 2 * sub - sub2 from ans.
Finally, it prints the modulo of ans with (10^9 + 7).
