<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string from the input and stores it in the variable stdin.
Then, it initializes a variable ans to 0, which will be used to count the number of occurrences of the character "1" in the input string.
The code enters a loop that iterates over each character in the input string.
For each character, it checks if it is equal to "1". If it is, it increments the value of ans by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is the count of occurrences of the character "1" in the input string.
In this case, the input string is "101", and there are two occurrences of the character "1". Therefore, the output will be 2.
