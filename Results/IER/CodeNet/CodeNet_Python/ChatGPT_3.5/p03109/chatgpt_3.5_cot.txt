<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes input in the format "YYYY/MM/DD" and splits it into three parts: A, B, and C.
It then checks if the integer value of A is less than or equal to 2018. If it is, it prints "Heisei".
If A is equal to 2019, it checks if the integer values of B and C are both less than or equal to 4 and 30 respectively. If they are, it also prints "Heisei".
If none of the above conditions are met, it prints "TBD".
In this case, A is equal to 2019, B is equal to 04, and C is equal to 30. Therefore, the condition in the second if statement is met and the code will print "Heisei".
<<<Output>>>
Heisei
