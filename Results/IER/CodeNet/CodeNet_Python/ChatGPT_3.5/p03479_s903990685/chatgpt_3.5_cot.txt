<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers x and y as input.
It initializes a variable ans to 0, which will be used to count the number of iterations.
The code then enters a while loop that continues as long as x is less than or equal to y.
In each iteration of the loop, it increments ans by 1 and multiplies x by 2.
This means that x will keep doubling until it becomes greater than y.
Once x becomes greater than y, the loop will exit.
Finally, the code prints the value of ans, which represents the number of iterations it took for x to become greater than y.
