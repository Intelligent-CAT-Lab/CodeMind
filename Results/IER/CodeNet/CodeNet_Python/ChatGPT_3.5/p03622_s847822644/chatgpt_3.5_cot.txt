<<<Analysis>>>
The variable m is initialized to 998244353 and the variable M is initialized to 1000001.
Three lists, f, g, and h, are initialized with M elements, all set to 0.
The first three elements of f and g are set to 1, and the first element of h is set to 1.
Then, a loop is executed from 2 to M-1 (inclusive).
In each iteration, the value of f[i] is calculated as f[i-1] multiplied by i modulo m.
The value of h[i] is calculated as m minus h[m%i] multiplied by m divided by i modulo m.
The value of g[i] is calculated as g[i-1] multiplied by h[i] modulo m.
Next, the variables A and B are read from input and if A is less than B, their values are swapped.
The variables b and ans are initialized to 1 and 0, respectively.
Then, a loop is executed from 1 to B (inclusive).
In each iteration, the value of ans is updated by adding b multiplied by f[A+B-j] multiplied by g[B-j] multiplied by g[A] modulo m.
The value of b is updated by multiplying it by 2 modulo m.
Finally, the value of ans is updated by adding A modulo m.
The final value of ans is printed modulo m.
