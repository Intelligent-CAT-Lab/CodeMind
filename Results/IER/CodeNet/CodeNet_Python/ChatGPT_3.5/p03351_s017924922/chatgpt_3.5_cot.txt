<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four integers as input and assigns them to variables a, b, c, and d.
The code then checks two conditions:
1. If the absolute difference between a and c is less than or equal to d, it prints 'Yes'.
2. If the absolute difference between a and b is less than or equal to d and the absolute difference between b and c is less than or equal to d, it prints 'Yes'.
If neither of these conditions is true, it prints 'No'.
In this case, the absolute difference between a and c is 5, which is greater than d (3), so the first condition is not true.
The absolute difference between a and b is 3, and the absolute difference between b and c is 2, both of which are less than or equal to d (3), so the second condition is true.
Therefore, the code will print 'Yes'.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
