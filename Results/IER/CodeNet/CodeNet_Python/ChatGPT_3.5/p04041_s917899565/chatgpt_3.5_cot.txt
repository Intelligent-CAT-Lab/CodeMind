<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by importing necessary libraries and reading the input values N, X, Y, and Z.
Then, it initializes the variable MOD to 10^9 + 7.
Next, it calculates the maximum value of L, which is the maximum of 10 and the sum of X, Y, and Z.
It creates an array dp of size 2^(L+1) and initializes it with zeros.
It creates an array rng of size 2^(L+1) and initializes it with consecutive integers.
It calculates the value of x575, which is a binary number with 1s at positions Z, Y+Z, and X+Y+Z.
It creates a boolean array bad by checking if the bitwise AND of x575 and rng is equal to x575.
It sets the first element of dp to 1.
Then, it enters a loop that iterates N times.
Inside the loop, it creates a copy of dp called prev and initializes dp with zeros.
It then enters another loop that iterates from 1 to 10.
Inside this loop, it updates dp by adding the sum of elements in prev at specific positions determined by the bitwise shift operation.
After the inner loop finishes, it sets the elements of dp at positions marked as bad to 0.
Then, it takes the modulo of dp with MOD.
After the outer loop finishes, it calculates the answer by subtracting the sum of elements in dp from 10^N and taking the modulo of the result with MOD.
Finally, it prints the answer.
