<<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys and math modules and defines several lambda functions for input and output.
Then, it reads an integer n from input.
The code checks if n is divisible by 9 using the modulo operator (%). If the result is 0, it means n is divisible by 9 and the code prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
In this case, 123456789 is not divisible by 9, so the output will be "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
