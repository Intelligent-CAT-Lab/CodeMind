<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string S.
It initializes a variable ans to a large value, 10^9.
It creates a list alphabet containing all the lowercase alphabets.
It creates a set hoge containing the unique characters in the input string S.
Then, it enters a loop that iterates over each character in the alphabet.
If the current character is not present in the set hoge, it continues to the next iteration.
Otherwise, it initializes a variable tmp to 0 and creates a copy of the input string S.
Then, it enters a while loop that continues until the set of characters in the copy_s is equal to the set containing only the current character.
Inside the while loop, it creates a new list copy_s_dash and iterates over the characters in the copy_s.
If the current character or the next character is equal to the current character being considered, it appends the current character to the copy_s_dash list. Otherwise, it appends "?" to the list.
After the while loop finishes, it updates the ans variable to the minimum value between the current ans and the difference between the length of the input string S and the length of the copy_s.
Finally, it prints the value of ans.
