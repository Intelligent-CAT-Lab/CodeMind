<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string and converts it into a list of characters.
Then, it iterates over each character in the list and checks if it is equal to "?". If it is, it replaces it with "D".
After that, it initializes an empty string variable b.
Then, it iterates over each character in the modified list and appends it to the string b.
Finally, it prints the value of b, which is the modified input string with all "?" replaced by "D".
