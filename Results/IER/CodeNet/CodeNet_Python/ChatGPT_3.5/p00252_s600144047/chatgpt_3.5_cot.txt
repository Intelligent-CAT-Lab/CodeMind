<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input and assigns them to variables a, b, and c.
It then checks if the tuple (a, b, c) is equal to (1, 1, 0). If it is, it prints 'Open'.
If the tuple is not equal to (1, 1, 0), it checks if the tuple is equal to (0, 0, 1). If it is, it also prints 'Open'.
If neither of the conditions is met, it prints 'Close'.
In this case, the input is 0 0 1, so the tuple (a, b, c) is equal to (0, 0, 1).
Therefore, the code will print 'Open'.
<<<Output>>>
