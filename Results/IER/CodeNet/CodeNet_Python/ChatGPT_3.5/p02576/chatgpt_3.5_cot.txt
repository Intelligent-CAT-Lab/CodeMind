<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three inputs: N, X, and T.
It checks if N is not divisible by X using the modulo operator (%). If the condition is true, it means that there will be a remainder when N is divided by X.
In this case, the code prints the result of ((N//X)*T + T). The expression (N//X) calculates the integer division of N by X, and then multiplies it by T. The additional T is added to account for the remaining time needed to complete the task.
If the condition is false, it means that N is divisible by X without any remainder. In this case, the code prints the result of (N//X)*T, which is the total time needed to complete the task without any remaining time.
In the given input (20 12 6), 20 is not divisible by 12, so the code will execute the first branch and print ((20//12)*6 + 6) = 12 + 6 = 18.
<<<Output>>>
