<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads the input from the standard input and converts it to lowercase using the `lower()` function.
Then, it enters a loop that iterates over the range of ASCII values for lowercase letters, from 97 to 122 (inclusive).
For each ASCII value, it converts it to the corresponding character using the `chr()` function and counts the number of occurrences of that character in the input string using the `count()` method.
Finally, it prints the character and its count in the format "character : count".

In this case, the input string is "This is a pen.".
After converting it to lowercase, the string becomes "this is a pen.".
The code then counts the occurrences of each lowercase letter in the string and prints the result.
