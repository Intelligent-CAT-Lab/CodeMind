<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input and assigns them to variables a, b, and c.
It then checks if a is equal to b. If it is, it prints the value of c.
If a is not equal to b, it checks if a is equal to c. If it is, it prints the value of b.
If neither of the above conditions is true, it prints the value of a.
In this case, a is equal to c, so the code will print the value of b, which is 7.
<<<Output>>>
7
