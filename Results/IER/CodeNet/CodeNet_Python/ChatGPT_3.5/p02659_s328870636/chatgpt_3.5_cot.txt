<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs, a and b, and splits them into separate variables.
The variable a is converted to an integer, while the variable b is converted to a Decimal.
The code then multiplies a and b together and converts the result to an integer.
Finally, the code prints the integer result.
In this case, a is 198 and b is 1.10.
Multiplying them together gives 217.8, which is then converted to an integer, resulting in 217.
<<<Output>>>
217
