<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input n.
It initializes a list l with two elements [0, 1].
It also initializes variables a, b, c to 0, 1, 1 respectively.
It sets the value of p to 998244353.
Then it enters a loop that iterates from 2 to n-1.
In each iteration, it calculates a value and appends it to the list l.
The value is calculated using the formula l[p%i]*(p-int(p/i))%p.
After the loop finishes, it enters another loop that iterates from n to n//2 (integer division).
In each iteration, it calculates a value and adds it to the variable a.
The value is calculated using the formula b*c%p; b=2*b%p; c=c*i*l[n+1-i]%p.
Finally, it prints the result of the expression (pow(3,n,p)-2*a+p)%p.
