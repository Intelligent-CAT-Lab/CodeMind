<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string and converts it into a list of tokens. Each token represents a character in the input string, excluding spaces. The code then appends an empty string as the end-of-file (EOF) token.

The code defines several parsing functions: parse_formula, parse_or, parse_and, and parse_term. These functions recursively parse the tokens and evaluate the formula according to the given grammar rules.

The parse_formula function calls the parse_or function to parse the formula.

The parse_or function parses the OR operator. It first calls the parse_and function to parse the left-hand side (lhs) of the OR operator. If the current token is "|", it increments the current index (cur) and recursively calls the parse_or function to parse the right-hand side (rhs) of the OR operator. It then calculates the number of zeros and ones in the formula based on the OR operator. The number of zeros is the sum of zeros in lhs and rhs, and the number of ones is the minimum of ones in lhs and the sum of zeros in lhs and ones in rhs. Finally, it returns a tuple (zero, one) representing the number of zeros and ones in the formula.

The parse_and function parses the AND operator. It first calls the parse_term function to parse the left-hand side (lhs) of the AND operator. If the current token is "&", it increments the current index (cur) and recursively calls the parse_and function to parse the right-hand side (rhs) of the AND operator. It then calculates the number of zeros and ones in the formula based on the AND operator. The number of zeros is the minimum of zeros in lhs and the sum of ones in lhs and zeros in rhs, and the number of ones is the sum of ones in lhs and rhs. Finally, it returns a tuple (zero, one) representing the number of zeros and ones in the formula.

The parse_term function parses the term in the formula. If the current token is "?", it increments the current index (cur) and returns [1, 1] representing one zero and one one. If the current token is "(", it increments the current index (cur) and recursively calls the parse_or function to parse the sub-formula inside the parentheses. If the current token is not ")" after parsing the sub-formula, it raises an exception indicating that the parentheses are not closed. Finally, it returns the result of parsing the sub-formula.

After defining the parsing functions, the code calls the parse_formula function to parse the entire formula. It then prints the number of zeros and ones in the formula.
