<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N and variable K are initialized to 3 and 5, respectively.
The variable MOD is initialized to 10^9 + 7.
A 2D list D is created with dimensions (N+1) x (K+1), filled with 0s.
The value of D[0][0] is set to 1.
The code then enters a nested loop. The outer loop iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), representing the number of balls being considered.
For each value of n, the inner loop iterates from 1 to K (inclusive), representing the number of boxes being considered.
Inside the inner loop, the code calculates the value of D[n][k] based on the values of D[n-1][k-1] and D[n-1][k].
The value of D[n][k] is updated using the formula (D[n-1][k-1] + k * D[n-1][k]) % MOD.
After the loops finish, the code prints the sum of all elements in the last row of D, modulo MOD.
