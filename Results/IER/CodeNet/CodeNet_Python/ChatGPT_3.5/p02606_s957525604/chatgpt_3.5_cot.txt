<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three inputs: l, r, and d.
It then calculates the integer division of r by d and subtracts the integer division of (l-1) by d.
The code prints the result of this calculation.
In this case, l=5, r=10, and d=2.
The integer division of 10 by 2 is 5, and the integer division of (5-1) by 2 is 2.
So the output of the code will be 5 - 2 = 3.
<<<Output>>>
