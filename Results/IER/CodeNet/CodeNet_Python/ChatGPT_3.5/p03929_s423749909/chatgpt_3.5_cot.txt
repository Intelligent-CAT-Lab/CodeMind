<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by importing some modules and defining some constants.
Then it reads the input values for N and K.
Next, it creates a grid of numbers from 1 to 700, with each row containing 7 numbers.
The code then initializes a list called for_y with 11 zeros.
It enters a nested loop that iterates over the rows and columns of the grid.
For each position in the grid, it calculates the sum of the 3x3 subgrid centered at that position.
If the sum modulo 11 is equal to K, it increments the corresponding element in for_y.
After the loop finishes, the code subtracts 2 from N and checks if the result is less than or equal to 2.
If it is, it prints 0 and exits.
Otherwise, it calculates the number of times the pattern in for_y repeats in a sequence of length N//11, and multiplies it by the sum of for_y.
Then it calculates the number of remaining elements in the sequence (N % 11) and adds the sum of for_y for those elements.
Finally, it prints the result.
