<<<Analysis>>>
The variable num_year is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of years.
The variable t_maney is initialized to 100, which represents the current amount of money.
The code then takes an input value and assigns it to the variable x.
The code enters a while loop that continues as long as t_maney is less than x.
Inside the loop, the code increments num_year by 1 and updates the value of t_maney by multiplying it by 1.01 and taking the floor of the result using the math.floor() function.
The loop continues until t_maney is greater than or equal to x.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of num_year, which represents the number of years it took for t_maney to reach or exceed x.
