<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input and assigns them to variables a, b, and c.
It initializes the variable ans to "No".
Then it checks three conditions:
1. If the sum of a and b is equal to c, it assigns "Yes" to ans.
2. If the sum of a and c is equal to b, it assigns "Yes" to ans.
3. If the sum of b and c is equal to a, it assigns "Yes" to ans.

In this case, a = 10, b = 30, and c = 20.
None of the three conditions are true, so the value of ans remains "No".

Finally, it prints the value of ans, which is "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
