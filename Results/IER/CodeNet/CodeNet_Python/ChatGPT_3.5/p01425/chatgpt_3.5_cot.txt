<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines three functions: calc, cmp, and check. These functions are used to perform calculations and comparisons in the main code.

The main code starts by initializing some variables: g, eps, N, V, X, and Y. These variables are assigned values based on the input.

Next, an empty list called obstacles is created.

Then, a loop is executed N times, where N is the value of the variable N. In each iteration, the loop reads four integers: L, B, R, and T. These integers are used to define a rectangle representing an obstacle. If the left side of the rectangle (L) is less than the target position (X), the rectangle is added to the obstacles list.

After the loop, the code checks if the check function returns True when called with the arguments X and Y. If it does, the code prints 'Yes' and exits.

If the check function does not return True, the code enters another loop that iterates over the obstacles list. In each iteration, the loop checks if the check function returns True when called with the arguments L and T or R and T. If it does, the code prints 'Yes' and exits.

If none of the conditions above are met, the code prints 'No'.
