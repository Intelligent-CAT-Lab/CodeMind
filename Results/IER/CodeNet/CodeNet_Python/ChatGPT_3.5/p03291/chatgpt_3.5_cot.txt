<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string `s` and calculates the length of the string `n`.
It initializes a 2D list `dp` with dimensions (n+1) x 4, filled with zeros.
The code sets the value of dp[0][0] to 1.
It initializes a list `string` with the values ["A", "B", "C"].
It sets the value of `num` to 10^9 + 7.
The code then enters a nested loop, where the outer loop iterates over the indices of the string `s` and the inner loop iterates over the values 0, 1, 2, 3.
Inside the nested loop, the code initializes variables `m` and `b` to 0 and 1 respectively.
If the current character in `s` is '?', the value of `b` is set to 3.
If the current value of `j` is 0, the code checks if the current character in `s` is '?'. If it is, the value of dp[i+1][j] is set to (dp[i][j] * 3) % num, otherwise it is set to dp[i][j] % num.
If the current value of `j` is not 0, the code checks if the current character in `s` is equal to the character in `string` at index (j-1) or if it is '?'. If either condition is true, the value of `m` is set to 1.
The value of dp[i+1][j] is then calculated as (m * dp[i][j-1] + b * dp[i][j]) % num.
After the nested loop finishes, the code prints the value of dp[-1][3], which is the last element in the last row of `dp`.
