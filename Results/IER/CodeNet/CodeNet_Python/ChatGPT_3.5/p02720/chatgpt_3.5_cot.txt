<<<Analysis>>>
The variable K is initialized to 15.
A deque object named que is created with the initial values [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9].
The code then enters a loop that iterates K times.
In each iteration, it removes the leftmost element from the deque and assigns it to the variable a.
If the last digit of a is not 0, it calculates a new number by appending (a%10)-1 to the right of a*10. This new number is then appended to the deque.
It also calculates another new number by appending (a%10) to the right of a*10. This new number is also appended to the deque.
If the last digit of a is not 9, it calculates a third new number by appending (a%10)+1 to the right of a*10. This third new number is also appended to the deque.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of a, which is the last number removed from the deque in the last iteration of the loop.
