<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input and assigns them to variables a and b.
Then it calculates the remainder of a divided by b using the modulus operator (%).
In this case, 5 % 8 is 5 because 5 divided by 8 has a remainder of 5.
Finally, the code prints the result, which is 5.
<<<Output>>>
5
