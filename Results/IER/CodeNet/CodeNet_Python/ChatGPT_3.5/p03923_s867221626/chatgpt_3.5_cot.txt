<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 8 and variable a is initialized to 1.
The variable ans is initialized to a very large value, 10^18.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 40 (inclusive), with variable k taking on these values.
Inside this loop, the variables l and r are initialized to 0 and n, respectively.
The code then enters a while loop that continues until r-l is equal to 1.
Inside this while loop, the variable m is calculated as the floor division of the sum of r and l by 2.
The code then checks if m raised to the power of k+1 is greater than or equal to n.
If this condition is true, it updates the value of r to m. Otherwise, it updates the value of l to m.
After the while loop finishes, the code enters another loop that iterates from 0 to k+1 (inclusive), with variable m taking on these values.
Inside this loop, the code checks if the product of l raised to the power of m and r raised to the power of (k+1)-m is greater than or equal to n.
If this condition is true, it updates the value of ans to the minimum of its current value and the sum of k*a, l*m, and r*((k+1)-m).
After all iterations of the outer loop finish, the code prints the final value of ans.
