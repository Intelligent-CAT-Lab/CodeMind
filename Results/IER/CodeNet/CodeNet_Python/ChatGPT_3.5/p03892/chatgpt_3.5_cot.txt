<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function gcd(a,b) that calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. It returns b if a%b==0, otherwise it recursively calls itself with arguments b and a%b.

The code then defines a function main() that takes input from the user and assigns the values to variables a, b, c, and d. It calculates the absolute difference between b and d and assigns it to variable h. It also calculates the absolute difference between c and a and assigns it to variable w.

The code then checks if either h or w is equal to 0. If either of them is 0, it returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates the maximum and minimum of h and w using the max() and min() functions, and assigns them to variables m and n, respectively. It then calls the gcd() function with arguments m and n, and assigns the result to variable m.

Finally, the code returns the sum of h and w minus m.

The code then calls the main() function and prints the result.

Given the input "1 1 3 4", the values of a, b, c, and d are assigned as follows:
a = 1
b = 1
c = 3
d = 4

The value of h is calculated as abs(1-4) = 3.
The value of w is calculated as abs(3-1) = 2.

Since neither h nor w is equal to 0, the code proceeds to calculate the maximum and minimum of h and w:
m = max(3, 2) = 3
n = min(3, 2) = 2

The code then calls the gcd() function with arguments m and n:
gcd(3, 2) = gcd(2, 1) = gcd(1, 0) = 1

The final result is calculated as h + w - m = 3 + 2 - 1 = 4.
