<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by importing various modules and setting some constants.
Then, it defines some lambda functions for reading input.
After that, it defines the main function.
Inside the main function, it reads two integers n and k from input.
Then, it checks if n is greater than k. If it is, it prints 0 and exits the program.
If n is not greater than k, it calculates the factorial of k and stores it in variable a.
It also calculates the factorial of k-n and stores it in variable b.
Then, it calculates the value of a divided by b modulo MOD and stores it in variable ans.
Finally, it prints the value of ans.
