<<<Analysis>>>
The code imports the groupby function from the itertools module.
The variables a and b are initialized to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the characters in the input string.
For each character c, the code groups consecutive occurrences of the same character using the groupby function.
The length of each group is calculated and stored in the variable m.
The code then updates the value of a by adding m * (m + 1) // 2 to it. This is the sum of the first m natural numbers.
The code also subtracts min(m, b) from a if c is '>' and m is greater than b. This is to handle the case where there are consecutive '>' characters.
Finally, the value of b is updated to m for the next iteration.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of a.

In the given input string '<>>', the code will calculate the following values for m:
m = 1 for '<'
m = 2 for '>'
m = 1 for '>'

Therefore, the final value of a will be 1 * (1 + 1) // 2 + 2 * (2 + 1) // 2 + 1 * (1 + 1) // 2 = 1 + 3 + 1 = 5.
