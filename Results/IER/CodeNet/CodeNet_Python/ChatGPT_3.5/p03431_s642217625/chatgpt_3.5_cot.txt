<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function combs_mod that calculates combinations modulo a given number mod. It takes three parameters: n, k, and mod. It initializes a list inv with all elements set to 1. Then it enters a loop that iterates from 1 to k (inclusive) and calculates the inverse of each number modulo mod using the pow function. The inverses are stored in the inv list. Next, it initializes a list ans with all elements set to 1. It enters another loop that iterates from 1 to k (inclusive) and calculates the combinations using the formula ans[i] = ans[i-1] * (n+1-i) * inv[i] % mod. The function returns the ans list.

The code then defines another function solve. It initializes a variable mod to 998244353. It reads two integers N and K from input. It initializes a variable ans to 0. If K is less than N, it returns ans. Otherwise, it calls the combs_mod function with parameters K, K, and mod and stores the result in the variable com. It then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to K (inclusive) and assigns the current value to the variable r. It calculates the value of b as K-r and the difference between r and b as dif. If dif is less than 0 or r is less than N, it continues to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, it checks if dif is equal to 0. If it is, it calls the combs_mod function with parameters K-1, K-1, and mod and stores the result in the variable com2. It adds com2[r] to ans and subtracts com2[N-2] if N is greater than or equal to 2. If dif is less than N, it adds com[r] to ans and subtracts com[N-1-dif]. Otherwise, it adds com[r] to ans. Finally, it takes the modulo of ans with mod and assigns the result back to ans. After the loop finishes, it returns ans.

The code then calls the solve function and prints the result.
