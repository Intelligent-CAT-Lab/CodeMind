<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by importing necessary libraries and defining some constants.
Then it reads the input values for N, M, and K.
Next, it defines a function cumprod that calculates the cumulative product of an array.
The code initializes some arrays and calculates the cumulative products of powers of 2 and 3, as well as their inverses.
It also calculates the factorial and its inverse.
Then it initializes an array A of size N+M and performs some calculations on it using the previously calculated arrays and values.
Finally, it calculates the answer by performing some multiplications and summations on the arrays and prints it.
