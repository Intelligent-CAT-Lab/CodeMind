<<<Analysis>>>
The code imports the math module and then takes two inputs, H and A, using the map function and split method. The inputs are separated by a space and are converted to integers.
The code then calculates the division of H by A and uses the math.ceil function to round up the result to the nearest integer.
Finally, the code prints the rounded up result.
In this case, the division of 10 by 4 is 2.5, and rounding up gives 3.
