<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string and converts it into a list of integers using the map function.
It initializes a list called ans with two elements, both set to 0.
Then it enters a loop that iterates over the indices of the list S.
For each index i, it checks if i modulo 2 is equal to the value at index i in S.
If the condition is true, it increments the first element of ans by 1.
If the condition is false, it increments the second element of ans by 1.
After the loop finishes, it prints the minimum value in ans, which will be the smaller of the two elements.
In this case, the input string is "000", which means the list S will be [0, 0, 0].
The loop will iterate three times, for indices 0, 1, and 2.
At index 0, the condition i % 2 == S[i] is true, so ans[0] is incremented by 1.
At index 1, the condition i % 2 == S[i] is false, so ans[1] is incremented by 1.
At index 2, the condition i % 2 == S[i] is true, so ans[0] is incremented by 1.
After the loop finishes, ans will be [2, 1].
The code then prints the minimum value in ans, which is 1.
