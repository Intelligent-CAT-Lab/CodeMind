<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs, A and B, as strings and splits them using the space as a delimiter. In this case, A is "198" and B is "1.10".
Then, A is converted to an integer using the int() function, so A becomes 198.
B is converted to a Decimal using the Decimal() function from the decimal module, so B becomes 1.10 as a Decimal object.
The code then multiplies A and B together, resulting in 198 * 1.10 = 217.8.
Finally, the result is converted back to an integer using the int() function, so the final output is 217.
