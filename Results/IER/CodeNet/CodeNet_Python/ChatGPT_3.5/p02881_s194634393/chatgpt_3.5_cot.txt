<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 10.
The variable ans is initialized to a very large value, 10^12.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to the square root of n plus 2.
For each value of k in this range, it checks if n is divisible by k. If it is, it calculates the value of m using the formula n//k + k - 2.
If the value of m is smaller than the current value of ans, it updates ans to m.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 5.
<<<Output>>>
5
