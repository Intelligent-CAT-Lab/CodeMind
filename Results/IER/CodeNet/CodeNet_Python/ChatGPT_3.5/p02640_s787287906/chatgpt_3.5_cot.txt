<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs, X and Y, and assigns them to the variables X and Y, respectively.
The code then checks if the following conditions are true:
1. 2*X <= Y <= 4*X: This checks if Y is between 2 times X and 4 times X.
2. Y % 2 == 0: This checks if Y is divisible by 2 (i.e., Y is an even number).

If both conditions are true, the code prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".

In this case, X is 3 and Y is 8. Let's check the conditions:
1. 2*3 <= 8 <= 4*3: This is true since 6 <= 8 <= 12.
2. 8 % 2 == 0: This is true since 8 is divisible by 2.

Both conditions are true, so the code will print "Yes".

<<<Output>>>
Yes
