<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string and assigns it to the variable s.
It then uses the find() method to find the index of the first occurrence of the letter 'A' in the string s.
Next, it uses the rfind() method to find the index of the last occurrence of the letter 'Z' in the string s.
The code then uses slicing to extract the substring from the index of 'A' to the index of 'Z' (inclusive).
Finally, it uses the len() function to calculate the length of this substring and prints it.
In this case, the substring is 'ASDFZXCV', which has a length of 8.
<<<Output>>>
8
