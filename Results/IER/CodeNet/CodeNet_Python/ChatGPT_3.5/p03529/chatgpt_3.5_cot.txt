<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers N and K as input. It initializes a list called "lis" with 3300 elements, all set to 0. It also initializes a variable "mod" to 10^9+7. 

The code then enters a loop that iterates from N to 1 (inclusive). For each iteration, it creates a new list called "nlis" with 3300 elements, all set to 0. 

Inside the loop, there is another loop that iterates from 0 to K (inclusive). For each iteration of this inner loop, there is a nested loop that iterates from 0 to 3300 (exclusive). 

Inside the nested loop, there are two conditions. The first condition checks if i is less than j. If it is, it adds the value of lis[last] to nlis[last]. The second condition checks if (last+j)//i + last is less than 3300. If it is, it adds the value of lis[last] to nlis[last+(last+j)//i].

After the innermost loop finishes, the code assigns nlis to lis. 

After the outer loop finishes, the code calculates the value of ans using the formula K * (K+1) // 2 * pow(K+1,N-1,mod) * N. 

Finally, there is a loop that iterates from 0 to 3300. For each iteration, it subtracts lis[i] * i from ans and takes the modulo of ans with mod. 

The final value of ans is printed as the output.
