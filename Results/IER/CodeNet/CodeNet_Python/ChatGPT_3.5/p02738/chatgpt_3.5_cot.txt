<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by importing the numpy library and then takes two inputs, n and M, using the map function and split method. The values of n and M are 1 and 998244353, respectively.

The variable l is calculated as n*3+1, which is 4 in this case.

A 2D array d is created using the zeros function from numpy. The size of the array is (l, n*5), which is (4, 5) in this case. All elements of the array are initialized to 0.

The first element of the first row of d is set to 1.

The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to l-1 (inclusive). For each iteration, it calculates the values of j and k as i-1 and i-2, respectively.

The value of d[i] is calculated using a combination of mathematical operations on the previous rows of d. The specific operations are as follows:
- d[i-3]*k: Multiply the i-3 row of d with the value of k.
- roll(d[k],-1): Shift the elements of the k row of d one position to the left.
- roll(d[j],1): Shift the elements of the j row of d one position to the right.
- ((d[i-3]*k+roll(d[k],-1))*j+roll(d[j],1)): Multiply the result of the previous two operations with the value of j and add the result of the third operation.
- %M: Take the modulo of the result with M.

After the loop finishes, the code calculates the sum of the elements in the last row of d up to the lth column. It then takes the modulo of the sum with M.

Finally, the code prints the result.
