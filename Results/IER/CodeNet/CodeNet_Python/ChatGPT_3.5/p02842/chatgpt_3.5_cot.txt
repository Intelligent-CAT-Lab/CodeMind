<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input and assigns it to the variable n.
Then, it initializes an empty dictionary called dic.
Next, it enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 50000 (inclusive).
Inside the loop, it calculates the value of p by multiplying i with 1.08 and converting it to an integer.
Then, it adds an entry to the dictionary dic, where the key is p and the value is i.
This means that the dictionary dic will store the mapping of rounded values of i to i.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if the input n is a key in the dictionary dic.
If it is, it prints the corresponding value from the dictionary.
Otherwise, it prints ":(".
In this case, the input n is 432.
When i is 400, p is 432, so dic[432] = 400.
Therefore, the output of the code execution will be 400.
