<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by taking an integer input n.
Then, it initializes a list p with the value [2].
Next, it enters a loop that iterates from 2 to 55555 (inclusive).
Inside this loop, it checks if the current number i is divisible by any number in the list p. If it is, it breaks out of the inner loop. If it is not divisible by any number in p, it appends i to the list p.
After the loop finishes, the code initializes an empty list l.
Then, it iterates over each number i in the list p.
For each number i, it checks if i is divisible by 5 with a remainder of 1. If it is, it appends i to the list l.
Next, it creates a new list ans_list by converting each number in l to a string.
Finally, it prints the elements of ans_list separated by a space.
In this case, since the input is 5, the code will print the first 5 numbers from the list l that satisfy the condition i%5 == 1.
