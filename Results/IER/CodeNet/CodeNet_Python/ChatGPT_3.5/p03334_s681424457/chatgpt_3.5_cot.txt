<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by importing necessary modules and defining some helper functions.
Then, it reads three integers N, D1, and D2 from input.
Next, it calculates the value of NN which is 2 times N.
The code defines a function deg(x) which returns the degree of the binary representation of x.
It uses the count() function from itertools to generate an infinite sequence of numbers starting from 0 and increments by 1 each time.
The function deg(x) finds the first number i in this sequence such that the i-th bit of x is 1.
The code then uses the deg() function to calculate the values of p1 and p2, which are the degrees of D1 and D2 respectively.
Next, the code defines a function group(x, y, p) which determines whether the pair (x, y) belongs to a specific group based on the values of x, y, and p.
The function group() checks the p-th bit of x and y and returns the result of a bitwise XOR operation on these bits.
The code then creates a list of points pts that satisfy the conditions group(x, y, p1) == 0 and group(x, y, p2) == 0.
These points are generated by iterating over all possible values of x and y in the range NN and checking if they belong to the specified groups.
Finally, the code prints the first N^2 points from the list pts, each on a new line.
