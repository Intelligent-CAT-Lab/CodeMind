<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input and assigns it to the variable n.
Then, it initializes four variables: a, b, c, and p. The values of a, b, c, and p are set to 1, 1, n, and n-1 respectively.
The code then enters a loop that iterates n-1 times. In each iteration, it updates the values of p, a, b, and c according to the following formulas:
p += a - 1
a, b, c = b, c, ((n-1)**2 + p + c) % (10**9 + 7)
After the loop finishes, the code prints the value of c.

In this case, since the input is 2, the loop will iterate only once.
In the first iteration, p will be updated to 1 + 1 - 1 = 1.
Then, a will be updated to the value of b (which is 1), b will be updated to the value of c (which is 2), and c will be updated to ((2-1)**2 + 1 + 2) % (10**9 + 7) = 4 % (10**9 + 7) = 4.
Finally, the code prints the value of c, which is 4.

<<<Output>>>
4
