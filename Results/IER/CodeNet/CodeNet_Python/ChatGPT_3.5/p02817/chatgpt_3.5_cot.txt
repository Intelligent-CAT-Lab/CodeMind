<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs, S and T, and assigns them to the variables S and T, respectively.
The code then prints the concatenation of T and S, which means it will print T followed by S.
In this case, the value of S is "oder" and the value of T is "atc".
So the output will be "atcoder".
<<<Output>>>
