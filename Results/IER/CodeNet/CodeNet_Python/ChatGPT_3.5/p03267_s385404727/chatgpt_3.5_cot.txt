The code reads an integer L from the input.
It then defines a function main() which calculates the values of n and m based on the value of L.
The code initializes an empty list called edges, which will store tuples representing the edges of a graph.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n-1 (inclusive), where n is calculated as floor(log2(L)) + 1.
Inside this loop, the code appends two tuples to the edges list. The first tuple represents an edge between i and i+1 with a weight of 0, and the second tuple represents an edge between i and i+1 with a weight of 2^(i-1).
After this loop, the code calculates the value of cur as 2^(n-1) and the value of q as L - cur.
The code then enters another loop that iterates from 1 to n-1 (inclusive).
Inside this loop, the code uses the divmod() function to calculate the quotient q and remainder r when dividing q by 2.
If r is 0, the code continues to the next iteration of the loop.
Otherwise, the code appends a tuple to the edges list representing an edge between i and n with a weight of cur. It then updates the value of cur by adding 2^(i-1) to it, and increments the value of m by 1.
Finally, the code yields the values of n and m, followed by each tuple in the edges list.
The main() function is called and its output is printed.
