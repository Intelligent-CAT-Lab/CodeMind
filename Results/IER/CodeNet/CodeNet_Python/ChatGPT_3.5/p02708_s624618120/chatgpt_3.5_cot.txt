<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines two functions: coun and sigma. 
The function coun takes two parameters n and r, and returns the value of n*r+1+r-r**2.
The function sigma takes three parameters: func, frm, and too. It initializes a variable result to 0. Then it enters a loop that iterates from frm to too+2 (inclusive). For each iteration, it calls the function func with the parameters too and i, and adds the result to the variable result. Finally, it prints the value of result%mod, where mod is initialized to 10**9+7.
In the main part of the code, it reads two integers n and k from input. Then it calls the function sigma with the function coun, the value of k as frm, and the value of n as too.
