<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input N and initializes the variable MOD to 10^9 + 7. It also initializes a list called memo with N+1 empty dictionaries.

The code then defines two functions: ok and dfs. The ok function checks if a given string contains the substring "AGC" in any of its permutations. The dfs function is a recursive function that performs a depth-first search to count the number of valid strings of length N.

The dfs function takes two parameters: cur (the current position in the string) and last3 (the last 3 characters of the string). It uses memoization to store and reuse previously computed results.

If cur is equal to N, meaning we have reached the end of the string, the function returns 1.

Otherwise, the function initializes a variable ret to 0. It then iterates over the characters "ACGT" and checks if adding the current character to last3 would result in a valid string using the ok function. If it is valid, the function recursively calls dfs with cur+1 and the last 3 characters shifted by one position. The result is added to ret.

Finally, the function stores the value of ret in the memo dictionary for the current last3 and returns ret.

After defining the functions, the code calls dfs with initial values of cur=0 and last3="TTT" and prints the result.
