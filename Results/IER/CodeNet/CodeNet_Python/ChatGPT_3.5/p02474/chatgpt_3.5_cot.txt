<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes input from the user and splits it into a list of strings using the split() function. In this case, the input is "5 8", so the list will be ['5', '8'].
Then, the code converts the first element of the list to an integer using the int() function, and does the same for the second element.
Finally, it multiplies the two integers and prints the result.
So, the code will multiply 5 and 8, resulting in 40.
<<<Output>>>
40
