<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called solve that takes a single argument test.
Inside the solve function, it reads five integers from input: h1, m1, h2, m2, and k.
It then calculates the total minutes for r1 and r2 by multiplying the hours by 60 and adding the minutes.
Next, it calculates the difference between r2 and r1 and subtracts k from it. This value is stored in ans.
If the difference between r2 and r1 is less than k, ans will be negative. In that case, the code sets ans to 0.
Finally, it prints the value of ans.

In the main block, the code sets test_cases to 1 and then iterates from 1 to test_cases + 1.
For each iteration, it calls the solve function with the current value of t.
