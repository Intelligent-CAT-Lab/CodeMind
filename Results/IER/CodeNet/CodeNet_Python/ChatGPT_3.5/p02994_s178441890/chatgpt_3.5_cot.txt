<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs, n and l, and assigns them to the variables n and l, respectively.
The code then checks if l is greater than or equal to 0. If it is, it calculates and prints the value of l * (n - 1) + (n - 1) * n // 2.
If l is not greater than or equal to 0, the code checks if l + n - 1 is less than 0. If it is, it calculates and prints the value of l * (n - 1) + (n - 1) * n // 2 - (n - 1).
If neither of the previous conditions are met, the code calculates and prints the value of l * n + (n - 1) * n // 2.
In this case, n is 5 and l is 2. Since l is greater than or equal to 0, the first condition is met and the code calculates and prints the value of 2 * (5 - 1) + (5 - 1) * 5 // 2, which is 20.
<<<Output>>>
20
