<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input n and defines a function factorization that calculates the prime factorization of n.
Inside the factorization function, it initializes an empty list arr to store the prime factors and their corresponding exponents.
It then iterates from 2 to the square root of n and checks if n is divisible by i. If it is, it counts the number of times i divides n and appends [i, cnt] to arr.
After the loop, if n is not equal to 1, it means n is a prime number and it appends [n, 1] to arr.
If arr is empty, it means n is 1 and it prints 0 and exits the program.
Otherwise, it calculates the number of divisors of n using the formula (-1 + sqrt(1 + 8*k))/2, where k is the exponent of each prime factor in arr.
Finally, it prints the total number of divisors of n.

In this case, the input is 24.
The factorization of 24 is [[2, 3], [3, 1]].
The number of divisors of 24 is calculated as (-1 + sqrt(1 + 8*3))/2 + (-1 + sqrt(1 + 8*1))/2 = 7.
