<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input and assigns them to variables a and b.
The code then checks if both a and b are odd numbers (i.e., not divisible by 2) using the condition a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0.
If the condition is true, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
In this case, a is 3 and b is 1, both of which are odd numbers. Therefore, the condition is true and the code will print "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
