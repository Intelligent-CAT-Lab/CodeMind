<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes input as a list of integers and stores it in variable A.
Then, it sorts the list in ascending order.
Next, it checks if the first element of the sorted list is 5, the second element is 5, and the third element is 7.
If all these conditions are true, it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".
In this case, the input list [5, 5, 7] satisfies the conditions, so the output will be "YES".
<<<Output>>>
