<<<Analysis>>>
The code imports the lru_cache function from the functools module and the sys module. It also initializes the variable mod to 1000000007.
The code then takes input for two variables, n and k, and splits the input into a list of integers.
The code initializes a list called facts with k+1 elements, where each element is set to 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to k+1. In each iteration, it calculates the factorial of the current number i and stores it in the facts list.
Next, the code checks if n is greater than k. If it is, it prints 0 and exits the program using the sys.exit() function.
Finally, the code calculates the value of (facts[k]//facts[k-n])%mod and prints it.
