<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string and assigns it to the variable s.
It then uses the zip function to iterate over pairs of characters in the string.
For each pair of characters, it checks if they are different (a != b).
The expression a != b evaluates to True if the characters are different and False if they are the same.
The sum function is used to count the number of True values in the list of comparisons.
Finally, the code prints the sum, which represents the number of times consecutive characters are different in the string.
In this case, the input string is "BBBWW".
The code compares the following pairs of characters: ('B', 'B'), ('B', 'B'), ('B', 'W'), ('W', 'W').
The comparisons result in the following list: [False, False, True, False].
The sum of True values in this list is 1.
