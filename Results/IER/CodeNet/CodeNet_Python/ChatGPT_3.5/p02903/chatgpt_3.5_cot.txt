<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four inputs: h, w, a, and b. These inputs are integers separated by spaces.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to h-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider h rows.
For each row i, it checks if i is less than b. If it is, it prints a string consisting of a "0" repeated a times, followed by a "1" repeated w-a times. This will create a row with a consecutive block of 0s followed by a consecutive block of 1s.
If i is not less than b, it prints a string consisting of a "1" repeated a times, followed by a "0" repeated w-a times. This will create a row with a consecutive block of 1s followed by a consecutive block of 0s.
The code continues this process for each row, printing the resulting pattern.
