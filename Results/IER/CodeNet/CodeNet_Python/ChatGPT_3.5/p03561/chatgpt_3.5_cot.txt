<<<Analysis>>>
The variable K and variable N are initialized to 3 and 2, respectively.
The code checks if K is divisible by 2. In this case, K is not divisible by 2, so the else block is executed.
The code initializes a list X with N elements, each element being (K+1)//2, which is 2 in this case.
The code then enters a loop that iterates N//2 times, which is 1 in this case.
In each iteration, the code checks if the last element of X is equal to 1. If it is, it removes the last element from X.
If the last element of X is not equal to 1, it subtracts 1 from the last element of X and extends X with (N-len(X)) elements, each being K.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the elements of X separated by a space.
In this case, X is [2, 2] and the output is "2 2".
