<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four floating-point numbers as input: a, b, x, and y.
It then checks if a/2 is equal to x and b/2 is equal to y. If both conditions are true, it assigns the value 1 to the variable h. Otherwise, it assigns the value 0 to h.
Finally, it prints the product of a and b divided by 2, followed by a space and the value of h.
In this case, a=2, b=3, x=1, and y=2.
The condition a/2==x is false because 2/2 is not equal to 1.
Therefore, h is assigned the value 0.
The code then prints the value of a*b/2, which is 3, followed by a space and the value of h, which is 0.
