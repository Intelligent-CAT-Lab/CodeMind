<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes input in the form of three integers separated by spaces and stores them in a list called l.
It then checks if the first element of l is less than or equal to the third element of l, and if the sum of the first and second elements of l is greater than or equal to the third element of l.
In this case, the first element of l is 3, the second element is 5, and the third element is 4.
The condition (3 <= 4) is true and (3 + 5 >= 4) is also true.
Therefore, the code will print "YES".
<<<Output>>>
YES
