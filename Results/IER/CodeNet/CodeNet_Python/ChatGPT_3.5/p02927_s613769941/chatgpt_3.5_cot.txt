<<<Analysis>>>
The variable M and variable D are initialized to 15 and 40, respectively.
variable count is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of valid pairs (a, b).
The code then enters a nested loop. The outer loop iterates from 1 to M (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 15 as the value of a.
The inner loop iterates from 22 to D (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 22 to 40 as the value of b.
For each value of b, the code extracts the tens digit (d10) and the ones digit (d1) by converting b to a string and then converting the first and second characters to integers.
The code then checks if d10 and d1 are both greater than or equal to 2, and if their product is equal to a. If this condition is met, it increments the count by 1.
After both loops finish, the code prints the final value of count, which represents the number of valid pairs.
