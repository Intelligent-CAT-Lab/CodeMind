<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines two functions: calc and cnk. The calc function calculates the factorial and inverse factorial values up to a given number n, modulo mod. The cnk function calculates the binomial coefficient C(n, r) modulo mod, using the precalculated factorial and inverse factorial values.

The code then takes an input n and initializes the modulo value mod to 998244353. It calls the calc function to calculate the factorial and inverse factorial values up to n + 10, and stores them in variables f and inv.

Next, it initializes the answer ans to the value of 3 raised to the power of n modulo mod. It also initializes a list p with the first element as 1, and then calculates the remaining elements of p using a loop.

Finally, it enters another loop that iterates from n // 2 + 1 to n + 1. For each value of k in this range, it calculates the current term cur using the cnk function and the precalculated values f and inv. It then subtracts cur from ans and takes the modulo mod. After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of ans.

In this case, the input is 2. So, the code calculates the factorial and inverse factorial values up to 12 (n + 10). It initializes ans to 3^2 = 9. It calculates the elements of p up to n // 2 + 10 = 11. Then, it enters the loop and calculates the terms cur for k = 2. The value of cur is 2 * C(2, 2) * 2 = 8. It subtracts cur from ans, which becomes 9 - 8 = 1. Finally, it prints the value of ans, which is 1.
