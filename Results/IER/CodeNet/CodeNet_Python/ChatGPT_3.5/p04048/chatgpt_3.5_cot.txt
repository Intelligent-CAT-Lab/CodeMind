<<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the necessary modules and defines some utility functions.
Then, it defines the input and output functions to read from standard input and write to standard output.
Next, it initializes some constants and variables.
The code reads two integers N and X from input.
It then calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of N and X using the appropriate function depending on the Python version.
Finally, it prints the result of the expression (N - gcd(N, X)) * 3.
