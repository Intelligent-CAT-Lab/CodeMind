<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input N.
Then, it defines three functions: gcd, lcm, and carmichael.
The gcd function calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.
The lcm function calculates the least common multiple of two numbers using the gcd function.
The carmichael function calculates the Carmichael function value of a given number x.
Next, the code defines the solve function.
The solve function takes two parameters: x and c.
It checks if c is equal to 1, and if so, returns 1.
Then, it calculates x modulo c and assigns the result back to x.
It calculates the square root of c and adds 1 to it, assigning the result to sq.
The function initializes an empty dictionary mp.
It also initializes a variable y to 1.
The function enters a loop that iterates from 0 to sq-1.
In each iteration, it adds the current value of y as a key to the mp dictionary, with the value being the current iteration index i.
It then updates the value of y by multiplying it with x and taking the modulo c.
If y becomes equal to 1, the function returns i+1.
If y is already present as a key in the mp dictionary, the function returns -1.
After the loop, the function initializes a variable z to 1.
It enters another loop that iterates from 0 to sq-1.
In each iteration, it updates the value of z by multiplying it with y and taking the modulo c.
If the updated value of z is present as a key in the mp dictionary, the function returns sq*(i+1) minus the value associated with z in the mp dictionary.
If the loop finishes without returning, the function returns -1.
After defining the functions, the code calculates the Carmichael function value of N and assigns it to the variable c.
Then, it calls the solve function with N and c as arguments and assigns the result to the variable k.
If k is equal to -1 or if N raised to the power of k modulo c is not equal to 1 modulo c, the code prints -1.
Otherwise, it prints the value of k.

-1
