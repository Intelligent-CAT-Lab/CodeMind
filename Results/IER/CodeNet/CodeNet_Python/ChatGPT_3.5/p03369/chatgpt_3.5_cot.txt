<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input and assigns it to the variable s.
It then uses the count() method to count the number of occurrences of the letter "o" in the string s.
The count is multiplied by 100 and added to 700.
Finally, the result is printed.
In this case, the string "oxo" has 2 occurrences of "o", so the count is 2.
The result is 700 + 100*2 = 900.
<<<Output>>>
900
