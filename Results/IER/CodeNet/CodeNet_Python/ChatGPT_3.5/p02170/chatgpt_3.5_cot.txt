<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called solve() which takes no arguments.
Inside the solve() function, it reads three integers n, k, and a from input.
It initializes a list called lst with k+1 elements, all set to 0.
It sets the second-to-last element of lst to 1.
It calculates the value of A as a multiplied by the modular inverse of 100*n modulo mod.
It calculates the value of inv as the modular inverse of n modulo mod.
Then, it enters a loop that iterates from k-2 down to 0 (exclusive).
Inside the loop, it checks if k is greater than i + n. If it is, it calculates the value of lst[i] using the formula A*(lst[i+1] - lst[i+n+1]) + lst[i+1] modulo mod.
If k is not greater than i + n, it calculates the value of lst[i] using the formula A*(lst[i+1] - lst[k]) + (n-(k-i)+1)*inv + lst[i+1] modulo mod.
After the loop finishes, it prints the value of (lst[0] - lst[1]) modulo mod.
Finally, it calls the solve() function.
