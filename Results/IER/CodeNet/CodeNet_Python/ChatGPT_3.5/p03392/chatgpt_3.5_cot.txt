<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an input string `a` and strips any leading or trailing whitespace.
It then calculates the length of the string and stores it in variable `l`.
If the length of the string is less than 6, the code initializes an empty set `s` and adds the input string `a` to it.
It also initializes a queue `q` with the input string `a`.
The code then enters a while loop that continues until the queue `q` is empty.
Inside the loop, it pops an element `a` from the queue `q`.
It then iterates over the characters of `a` and checks if the current character is different from the next character.
If it is, it calculates a new string `na` by replacing the two consecutive characters with a character that is 3 minus the difference between their ASCII values.
If `na` is not already in the set `s`, it adds it to the set and appends it to the queue `q`.
After the while loop finishes, the code prints the length of the set `s`.
If the length of the input string `a` is not less than 6, the code checks if all the characters in the string are the same.
If they are, it prints 1 and returns.
Otherwise, it initializes a variable `t` with the first character of `a` repeated `l` times.
If `t` is equal to `a`, it prints 1 and returns.
The code then initializes a variable `x` to 0 and iterates over the characters of `a`.
If the current character is 'b', it increments `x` by 1. If it is 'c', it increments `x` by 2.
The code then initializes a variable `ans` to 0 and checks if all the characters in `a` are different from their adjacent characters.
If they are, it increments `ans` by 1.
The code then initializes a variable `mod` to 998244353 and a tuple `dp` with initial values (1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0).
The code then enters a for loop that iterates from 0 to `l-1`.
Inside the loop, it calculates a new value `s` by summing the last three elements of `dp` modulo `mod`.
It then updates the values of `dp` according to a specific pattern.
Finally, the code prints the result of `(ans + dp[9+x%3]) % mod`.
