<<<Analysis>>>
The variable B is initialized to "0 0 1".
The variable O is a list containing two strings: "1 1 0" and "0 0 1".
The code checks if the value of B is present in the list O. If it is, it prints "Open". Otherwise, it prints "Close".
In this case, the value of B is "0 0 1" which is present in the list O. Therefore, the code will print "Open".
<<<Output>>>
Open
