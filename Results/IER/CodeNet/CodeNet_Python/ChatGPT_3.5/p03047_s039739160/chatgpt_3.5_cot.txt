<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes input in the form of two integers N and K, separated by a space.
It then calculates the difference between N and K and adds 1 to it.
Finally, it prints the result.
In this case, N is 3 and K is 2.
So, the difference between N and K is 1 and adding 1 to it gives us 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
