<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input value and assigns it to the variable x.
Then, it converts x to an integer using the int() function and assigns the result back to x.
Next, it calculates the value of y by subtracting 30 from x and dividing the result by 2.
Finally, it prints the integer value of y.
In this case, the input value is 68.
So, x is assigned the value 68.
Then, y is calculated as (68-30)/2 = 19.
Finally, the code prints the integer value of y, which is 19.
<<<Output>>>
19
