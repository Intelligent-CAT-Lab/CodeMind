<<<Analysis>>>
The variable MOD is initialized to 1000000007.
The variables H, W, A, and B are initialized to 2, 3, 1, and 1, respectively.
The code then checks if H - A is greater than W - B. In this case, it is not, so the code continues without swapping the values of H and W, and A and B.
The code initializes a list ans1 with a single element, 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to H - A - 2 (inclusive). In this case, it iterates once.
Inside the loop, it appends a new element to ans1. The new element is calculated by multiplying the last element of ans1 with (H - A - 1 + B - i) and (i + 1) raised to the power of MOD - 2, modulo MOD.
After the loop finishes, the code initializes a variable c to 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to W - H + A - B - 1 (inclusive). In this case, it iterates once.
Inside the loop, it updates the value of c by multiplying it with (W - B - 1 + A - i) and (i + 1) raised to the power of MOD - 2, modulo MOD.
After the loop finishes, the code initializes a variable ans to the value of c.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to H - A - 2 (inclusive). In this case, it iterates once.
Inside the loop, it updates the value of c by multiplying it with (H - 1 - i) and (W - H + A - B + 1 + i) raised to the power of MOD - 2, modulo MOD.
It also updates the value of ans by adding c multiplied by the corresponding element of ans1.
Finally, the code prints the value of ans.
