<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string from the input and splits it into a list of strings using the space as a delimiter. In this case, the input string is "3 1 4", so the resulting list is ['3', '1', '4'].
The code then converts the list into a set, which removes any duplicate elements. In this case, the set will contain the elements '3', '1', and '4'.
Finally, the code prints the length of the set, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>
3
