<<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module and sets the recursion limit to a large value.
Then, it defines several lambda functions for reading input and printing debug messages.
Next, it reads two integers, n and x, from the input.
After that, it defines a function called solve.
Inside the solve function, it checks if x is equal to 1 or 2 * n - 1. If it is, it prints "No" and returns.
Otherwise, it creates a list called a with 2 * n - 1 elements, all initialized to None.
It calculates the middle index m as (2 * n - 1) // 2.
It assigns the value of x to a[m], x - 1 to a[m - 1], and x + 1 to a[m + 1].
Then, it initializes a variable y to 1.
It enters a loop that iterates over the range 2 * n - 1.
Inside the loop, it checks if the current index i is equal to m - 1, m, or m + 1. If it is, it continues to the next iteration.
Otherwise, it checks if y is equal to x - 1, x, or x + 1. If it is, it increments y by 2.
It assigns the value of y to a[i] and increments y by 1.
After the loop, it prints "Yes" and then prints the elements of list a separated by a newline character.
Finally, it calls the solve function.
