<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers n and x as input.
It initializes two lists, size and pati, with the first element as 1.
Then it enters a loop that iterates n times.
In each iteration, it calculates the next element of size and pati based on the previous elements.
After the loop, it initializes a variable ans to 0.
Then it enters another loop that iterates n times.
Inside this loop, it checks multiple conditions to determine the value of ans.
If x is equal to 1, it subtracts 1 from x and breaks the loop.
If x is equal to size[n-i], it adds pati[n-i] to ans and breaks the loop.
If x is equal to size[n-i-1]+2, it adds pati[n-i-1]+1 to ans and breaks the loop.
If x is greater than size[n-i-1]+2, it adds pati[n-i-1]+1 to ans, subtracts size[n-i-1]+2 from x, and continues the loop.
If none of the above conditions are met, it subtracts 1 from x.
After the loop, it checks if x is equal to 1. If it is, it adds 1 to ans.
Finally, it prints the value of ans.
