<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input and assigns them to variables a and b.
Then it prints the product of a and b, followed by the sum of 2 times a and 2 times b.
In this case, a is 3 and b is 5.
The product of 3 and 5 is 15, and the sum of 2 times 3 and 2 times 5 is 16.
<<<Output>>>
15 16
