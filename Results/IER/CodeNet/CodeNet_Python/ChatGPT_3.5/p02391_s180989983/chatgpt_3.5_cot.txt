<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input and assigns them to variables a and b.
It then checks if a is greater than b. If it is, it prints "a > b".
If a is not greater than b, it checks if a is less than b. If it is, it prints "a < b".
If neither of the above conditions are true, it means that a is equal to b, so it prints "a == b".
In this case, a is 1 and b is 2. Since 1 is less than 2, the condition a < b is true, so the code will print "a < b".
<<<Output>>>
a < b
