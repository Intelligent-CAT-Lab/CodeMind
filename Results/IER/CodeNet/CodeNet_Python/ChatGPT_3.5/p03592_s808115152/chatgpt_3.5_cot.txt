<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three inputs N, M, and K.
It then enters a nested loop, where the outer loop iterates from 0 to N (inclusive) and the inner loop iterates from 0 to M (inclusive).
Inside the nested loop, it calculates the value of res using the formula res = x * M + y * N - x * y * 2.
If the value of res is equal to K, it prints "Yes" and exits the program.
If the nested loop finishes without finding a value of res equal to K, it prints "No".
In this case, N = 2, M = 2, and K = 2.
The code will iterate through the following combinations of x and y: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2).
For each combination, it calculates the value of res and checks if it is equal to K.
The value of res for each combination is as follows:
(0,0): 0 * 2 + 0 * 2 - 0 * 0 * 2 = 0
(0,1): 0 * 2 + 1 * 2 - 0 * 1 * 2 = 2
(0,2): 0 * 2 + 2 * 2 - 0 * 2 * 2 = 4
(1,0): 1 * 2 + 0 * 2 - 1 * 0 * 2 = 2
(1,1): 1 * 2 + 1 * 2 - 1 * 1 * 2 = 2
(1,2): 1 * 2 + 2 * 2 - 1 * 2 * 2 = 4
(2,0): 2 * 2 + 0 * 2 - 2 * 0 * 2 = 4
(2,1): 2 * 2 + 1 * 2 - 2 * 1 * 2 = 6
(2,2): 2 * 2 + 2 * 2 - 2 * 2 * 2 = 4
The value of res is equal to K for the combinations (0,1) and (1,1).
Therefore, the code will print "Yes" and exit.
