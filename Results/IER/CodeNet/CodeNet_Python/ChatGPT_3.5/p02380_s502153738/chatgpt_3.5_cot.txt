<<<Analysis>>>
The code imports the sqrt, sin, cos, and pi functions from the math module.
The variables a, b, and C are initialized to 4.0, 3.0, and 90.0, respectively.
The code then converts the angle C from degrees to radians by multiplying it by pi/180.
Next, it calculates the length of the side c using the cosine rule.
Then, it calculates the height of the triangle using the sine of the angle C.
After that, it calculates the area of the triangle using the formula (1/2) * base * height.
Finally, it calculates the perimeter of the triangle by adding the lengths of all three sides.
The code prints the area, length, and height of the triangle, each formatted to 8 decimal places.
