<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes input as a string of numbers separated by spaces and converts it into a list of integers using the map() function and the int() function. The input "3 8 1" will be converted into the list [3, 8, 1].
The code then sorts the list in ascending order using the sort() method. After sorting, the list becomes [1, 3, 8].
Finally, the code prints the first three elements of the sorted list, which are 1, 3, and 8, separated by spaces.
<<<Output>>>
1 3 8
