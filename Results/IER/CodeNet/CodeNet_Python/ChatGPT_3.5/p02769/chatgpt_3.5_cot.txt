<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines two input functions i1() and i2() which are used to take integer and list inputs respectively.
The code then initializes a variable mod to 10^9 + 7.
The code defines a function bp(a,n) which calculates the power of a raised to n modulo mod using binary exponentiation.
The code takes input values for n and k using the i2() function.
The code then checks if n is less than or equal to k. If it is, it enters the if block.
Inside the if block, the code initializes variables x and y to 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to n-2 (inclusive).
Inside the loop, it multiplies x by 2*n-1-i and takes the modulo mod.
Inside the loop, it multiplies y by i+1 and takes the modulo mod.
After the loop, the code calculates the value of (x * bp(y,10^9+5)) % mod and prints it.
If n is greater than k, the code enters the else block.
Inside the else block, the code initializes variables x, y, and t to 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to k-1 (inclusive).
Inside the loop, it multiplies t by i+1 and takes the modulo mod.
Inside the loop, it multiplies y by n-1-i and takes the modulo mod.
Inside the loop, it multiplies y by n-i and takes the modulo mod.
Inside the loop, it calculates the value of bp(t,10^9+5) and assigns it to variable c.
Inside the loop, it adds y * c * c to x and takes the modulo mod.
After the loop, the code prints the value of x.
