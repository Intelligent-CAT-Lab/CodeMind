<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called solve, which takes no arguments. Inside the function, it reads two integers M and D from input and initializes a variable ans to 0.
Then, it enters a loop that iterates from 12 to D (inclusive). For each number i in this range, it extracts the first and second digits of i and assigns them to variables a and b, respectively.
The code checks if both a and b are greater than 1. If they are, it checks if their product a*b is less than or equal to M. If this condition is true, it increments the variable ans by 1.
After the loop finishes, the function returns the value of ans.
Outside the function, the code calls the solve function and prints its return value.

Given the input "15 40", the code will execute as follows:
- M is assigned the value 15 and D is assigned the value 40.
- ans is initialized to 0.
- The loop iterates from 12 to 40.
  - For each iteration, it extracts the first and second digits of i.
  - It checks if both digits are greater than 1.
  - If they are, it checks if their product is less than or equal to M.
  - If the condition is true, it increments ans by 1.
- After the loop finishes, the function returns the value of ans, which is the final output.
- The code then prints the output, which is the value returned by the solve function.
