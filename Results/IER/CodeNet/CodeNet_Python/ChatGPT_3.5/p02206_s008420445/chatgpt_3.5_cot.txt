<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs, n and k, and initializes variables l and r to 0 and k+1 respectively.
The code then enters a while loop that continues until r-l is greater than 1.
Inside the loop, it calculates the midpoint m as the integer division of (l+r) by 2.
It then initializes variables res and t to the value of m.
The code then enters a for loop that iterates n-1 times.
Inside the loop, it divides t by 2 and adds the result to res.
If t becomes 0, the loop breaks.
After the for loop, the code checks if res is greater than k.
If it is, it updates r to m.
Otherwise, it updates l to m.
The loop continues until r-l is no longer greater than 1.
Finally, the code prints the value of l.

In this case, n=1 and k=1.
The code initializes l=0 and r=2.
The while loop condition is true, so it enters the loop.
Inside the loop, it calculates m as (0+2)//2 = 1.
It initializes res and t to 1.
The for loop is skipped because n-1 is 0.
After the for loop, res is 1 and it is not greater than k=1.
So, l is updated to 1.
The while loop condition is false now, so it exits the loop.
Finally, the code prints the value of l, which is 1.
