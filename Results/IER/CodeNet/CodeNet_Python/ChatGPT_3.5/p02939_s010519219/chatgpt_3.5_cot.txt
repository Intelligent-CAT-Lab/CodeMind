<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string s, which is initialized to 'aabbaa'.
It then initializes an empty string t and two variables k and prev to 0 and '', respectively.
The code then enters a loop that iterates through the characters of s.
For each character, it appends it to t and checks if t is different from prev.
If t is different from prev, it increments k by 1, updates prev to t, and resets t to an empty string.
This process continues until all characters of s have been processed.
Finally, the code prints the value of k, which is the number of distinct substrings in s.
In this case, the distinct substrings are 'a', 'ab', 'abb', 'abba', 'aab', 'aabb', 'aabba', and 'aabbaa', so the output would be 8.
<<<Output>>>
8
