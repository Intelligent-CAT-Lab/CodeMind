<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string `n` and converts each character of the string to an integer. It assigns the first character to variable `a`, the second character to variable `b`, the third character to variable `c`, and the fourth character to variable `d`.

Then, the code checks various conditions to see if the sum or difference of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` equals 7. If a condition is met, it prints the equation in the format `a + b + c + d = 7` or `a + b + c - d = 7` or `a + b - c + d = 7` or `a + b - c - d = 7` or `a - b + c + d = 7` or `a - b + c - d = 7` or `a - b - c + d = 7` or `a - b - c - d = 7`.

In this case, the input is `1222`. So, `a` is 1, `b` is 2, `c` is 2, and `d` is 2. The condition `(a+b+c+d) == 7` is met, so the code will print `1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 7`.

<<<Output>>>
1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 7
