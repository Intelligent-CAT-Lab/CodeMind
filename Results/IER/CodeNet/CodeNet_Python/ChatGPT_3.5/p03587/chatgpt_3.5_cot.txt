<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input and assigns it to the variable s.
Then it uses the count() method to count the number of occurrences of the substring "1" in the string s.
Finally, it prints the count.
In this case, the input string is "111100", and the count of "1" in the string is 4.
<<<Output>>>
4
