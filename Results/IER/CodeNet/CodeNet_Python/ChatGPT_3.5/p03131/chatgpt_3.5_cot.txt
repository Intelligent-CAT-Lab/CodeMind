<<<Analysis>>>
The variable K, variable A and variable B are initialized to 4, 2 and 6, respectively.
The code checks if the difference between B and A is less than or equal to 2. In this case, the difference is 4, so the condition is not met.
The code then calculates the value of first_num_exchanges, which is A + 1, so it is 3.
It also calculates the value of rest_num_exchanges, which is K - first_num_exchanges, so it is 1.
The code calculates the value of gain_per_two_manipulation, which is B - A, so it is 4.
The code then calculates the value of num_cookies using the formula: rest_num_exchanges // 2 * gain_per_two_manipulation + B. Since rest_num_exchanges is 1, the formula becomes 1 // 2 * 4 + 6, which simplifies to 0 * 4 + 6, which is 6.
Since rest_num_exchanges is odd (1 % 2 == 1), the code adds 1 to num_cookies, so it becomes 7.
Finally, the code prints the value of num_cookies, which is 7.
<<<Output>>>
7
