<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input and assigns them to variables a and b.
It initializes two variables, total and ans, to 1 and 0 respectively.
The code then enters a while loop that continues until the value of total is greater than or equal to b.
Inside the loop, it increments the value of ans by 1 and updates the value of total by adding a-1 to it.
The loop continues until the value of total becomes greater than or equal to b.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans.
In this case, the loop will run 3 times because the initial value of total is 1 and the value of a is 4.
On each iteration, the value of total will be updated as follows: 1+4-1=4, 4+4-1=7, 7+4-1=10.
So, the loop will terminate when total becomes equal to or greater than 10.
The final value of ans will be 3.
