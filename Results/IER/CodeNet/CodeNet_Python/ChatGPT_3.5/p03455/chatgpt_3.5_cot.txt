<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input and assigns them to variables a and b.
It then calculates the product of a and b and assigns it to variable c.
The code checks if c is odd by checking if c modulo 2 is equal to 1.
If c is odd, it prints 'Odd'. Otherwise, it prints 'Even'.
In this case, the product of 3 and 4 is 12, which is even.
Therefore, the code will print 'Even'.
<<<Output>>>
Even
