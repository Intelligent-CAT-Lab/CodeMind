<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input and assigns them to variables a and b.
It then checks if both a and b are less than or equal to 8. If they are, it prints 'Yay!', otherwise it prints ':('.
In this case, a is 5 and b is 4, both of which are less than or equal to 8.
Therefore, the code will print 'Yay!'.
<<<Output>>>
Yay!
