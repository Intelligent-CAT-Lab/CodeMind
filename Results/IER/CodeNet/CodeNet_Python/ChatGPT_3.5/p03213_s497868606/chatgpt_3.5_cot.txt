<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input n.
If n is equal to 1, it prints 0 and exits the program.
Otherwise, it imports the math module and defines a function div(m) that calculates the prime factorization of a number m and returns a dictionary with the prime factors as keys and their frequencies as values.
The code then initializes an empty dictionary D to store the prime factors and their frequencies for all numbers from 2 to n.
It enters a loop that iterates from 2 to n (inclusive) and calculates the prime factorization of each number using the div() function.
For each prime factor and its frequency in the prime factorization, it updates the dictionary D accordingly.
Next, the code initializes five empty sets: A, B, P, Q, and R.
It iterates over the prime factors and their frequencies in the dictionary D.
If the frequency is greater than or equal to 74, the prime factor is added to set R.
If the frequency is greater than or equal to 24, the prime factor is added to set P.
If the frequency is greater than or equal to 14, the prime factor is added to set Q.
If the frequency is greater than or equal to 4, the prime factor is added to set B.
If the frequency is greater than or equal to 2, the prime factor is added to set A.
Next, the code initializes a variable ans to 0 and a variable b to the length of set B.
It enters a loop that iterates over the prime factors in set A.
If a prime factor is not in set B, it adds b*(b-1)//2 to ans.
Otherwise, it adds (b-1)*(b-2)//2 to ans.
Then, it initializes a variable p to the length of set P.
It enters a loop that iterates over the prime factors in set A.
If a prime factor is not in set P, it adds p to ans.
Otherwise, it adds p-1 to ans.
Next, it initializes a variable q to the length of set Q.
It enters a loop that iterates over the prime factors in set B.
If a prime factor is not in set Q, it adds q to ans.
Otherwise, it adds q-1 to ans.
Finally, it adds the length of set R to ans and prints the final value of ans.
