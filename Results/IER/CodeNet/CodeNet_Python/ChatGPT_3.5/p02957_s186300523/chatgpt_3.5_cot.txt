<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input and assigns them to variables a and b.
It then calculates the sum of a and b and stores it in the variable buf.
The code checks if buf is divisible by 2 (i.e., buf % 2 == 0). If it is, it prints the integer division of buf by 2 (i.e., buf // 2). Otherwise, it prints the string "IMPOSSIBLE".
In this case, a is 2 and b is 16. The sum of a and b is 18. Since 18 is divisible by 2, the code will print 9.
<<<Output>>>
9
