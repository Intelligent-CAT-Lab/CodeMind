<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines two functions: gcd(a, b) and lcm(a, b).
The gcd(a, b) function uses the Euclidean algorithm to calculate the greatest common divisor of a and b.
The lcm(a, b) function calculates the least common multiple of a and b by dividing their product by their greatest common divisor.
The code then reads two integers A and B from input.
Finally, it calls the lcm(A, B) function and prints the result.
In this case, A is 2 and B is 3.
The gcd(2, 3) function is called, which returns 1.
Then, the lcm(2, 3) function is called, which calculates 2 * 3 // 1 = 6.
The result, 6, is printed.
<<<Output>>>
