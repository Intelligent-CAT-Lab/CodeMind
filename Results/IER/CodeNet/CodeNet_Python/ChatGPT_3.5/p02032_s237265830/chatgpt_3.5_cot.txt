<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function make_divisors(n) that takes an integer n as input and returns a list of its divisors.
The main() function is then defined, which takes an integer N as input.
Inside the main() function, the make_divisors() function is called with N as the argument, and the result is stored in the variable yakusu.
The variable max_times is initialized to the length of yakusu minus 1, and the variable min_times is initialized to 0.
The variable result is initialized as an empty list.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the elements of yakusu in reverse order, excluding the last element.
For each element i in this loop, the code checks if i is already in the result list. If it is, the loop continues to the next iteration.
If i is not in the result list, the make_divisors() function is called with i as the argument, and the result is added to the result list using the extend() method.
The min_times variable is incremented by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the values of min_times and max_times.
