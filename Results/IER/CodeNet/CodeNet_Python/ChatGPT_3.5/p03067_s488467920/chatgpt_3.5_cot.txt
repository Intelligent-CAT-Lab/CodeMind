<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three inputs A, B, and C and checks if C is between A and B (exclusive) or if C is between A and B (exclusive) in reverse order. If either of these conditions is true, it prints 'Yes'. Otherwise, it prints 'No'.
In this case, A = 3, B = 8, and C = 5. Since 3 < 5 < 8, the first condition is true. Therefore, the code will print 'Yes'.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
