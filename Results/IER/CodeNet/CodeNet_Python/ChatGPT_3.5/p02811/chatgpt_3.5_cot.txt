<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs, K and X, and stores them in variables.
It then checks if 500*K is greater than or equal to X. If it is, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
In this case, 500*2 is equal to 1000, which is greater than 900. Therefore, the code will print "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
