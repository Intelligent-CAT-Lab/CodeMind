<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input and assigns them to variables a and b.
Then it calculates the expression (b+a-1)//a, which means it adds b and a, subtracts 1, and then performs integer division by a.
In this case, a is 3 and b is 5, so the expression becomes (5+3-1)//3 = 7//3 = 2.
Finally, the code prints the result, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
2
