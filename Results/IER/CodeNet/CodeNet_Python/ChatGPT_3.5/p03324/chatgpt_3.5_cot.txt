<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs, D and N, and assigns them to variables D and N respectively.
The code then checks if N is not equal to 100. If it is not, it calculates the result as 100 raised to the power of D, multiplied by N. 
If N is equal to 100, it calculates the result as 100 raised to the power of D, multiplied by (N+1).
In this case, D is 0 and N is 5, so N is not equal to 100. Therefore, the result is 100^0 * 5, which is 5.
<<<Output>>>
5
