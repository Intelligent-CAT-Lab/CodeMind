The variable k is initialized to 2.
The variable ans is calculated as (k+1)*k//2, which is 3.
A 2D list tttt is created with dimensions (k+1) x (k+1), filled with zeros.
The code then enters a nested loop that iterates from 1 to k (inclusive) for both i and j.
Inside this loop, it checks if i is equal to j. If they are equal, it continues to the next iteration.
Otherwise, it checks if the value of tttt[i][j] is not equal to 0. If it is not zero, it assigns the value to variable g and adds 3*g to ans.
If tttt[i][j] is zero, it calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of i and j using the fr.gcd() function from the fractions module. It assigns the gcd value to variable g and updates tttt[i][j] and tttt[j][i] with the gcd value. It also adds 3*g to ans.
After this nested loop, there is another nested loop that iterates from 1 to k-1 for i, from i+1 to k for j, and from j+1 to k+1 for l.
Inside this loop, it assigns the value of tttt[i][j] to variable temp and the value of tttt[temp][l] to variable temp2.
It adds 6*temp2 to ans.
Finally, it prints the value of ans, which is 15.
