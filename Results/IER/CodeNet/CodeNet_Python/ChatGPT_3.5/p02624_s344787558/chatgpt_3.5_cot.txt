<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by taking an integer input and storing it in the variable n.
Then, it creates a list called nums which contains numbers from 1 to n (inclusive).
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of the current sums.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each number in the nums list.
For each number num, it calculates the number of times num can be divided into n and stores it in the variable cnt.
Then, it calculates the sum of the arithmetic series starting from num and ending at cnt*num, with a common difference of num.
This sum is stored in the variable curr_sum.
Finally, the code adds curr_sum to ans.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans.

In this case, the input is 4.
The nums list will be [1, 2, 3, 4].
For num = 1, cnt = 4, and curr_sum = 4*(2*1 + (4-1)*1)//2 = 4*(2+3)//2 = 20//2 = 10.
For num = 2, cnt = 2, and curr_sum = 2*(2*2 + (2-1)*2)//2 = 2*(4+2)//2 = 12//2 = 6.
For num = 3, cnt = 1, and curr_sum = 1*(2*3 + (1-1)*3)//2 = 1*(6+0)//2 = 6//2 = 3.
For num = 4, cnt = 1, and curr_sum = 1*(2*4 + (1-1)*4)//2 = 1*(8+0)//2 = 8//2 = 4.
The final value of ans is 10 + 6 + 3 + 4 = 23.

<<<Output>>>
23
