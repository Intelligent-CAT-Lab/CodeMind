<<<Analysis>>>
The code imports the necessary modules and initializes some constants.
Then it takes three integers as input: A, B, and DEGREE.
It calculates the radian value of DEGREE using the math.radians() function.
Next, it calculates the area of the triangle using the formula A*B*sin(rad)/2.0 and stores it in the variable S.
It calculates the length of the third side of the triangle using the formula sqrt(A^2 + B^2 - 2*A*B*cos(rad)) and stores it in the variable C.
It calculates the height of the triangle using the formula 2*S/A and stores it in the variable h.
Finally, it prints the values of S, A+B+C, and h with 10 decimal places using the "%.10f" format specifier.
<<<Output>>>
6.0000000000 10.0000000000 1.5000000000
