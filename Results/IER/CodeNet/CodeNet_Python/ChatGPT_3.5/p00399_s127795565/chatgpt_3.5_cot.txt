<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four inputs: r, b, w, and g. These inputs are separated by spaces and are converted to integers using the map() function.
The code then calculates the sum of r, b, w, and g and prints the result.
In this case, the inputs are 4, 2, 1, and 1. So the sum would be 4 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 8.
<<<Output>>>
8
