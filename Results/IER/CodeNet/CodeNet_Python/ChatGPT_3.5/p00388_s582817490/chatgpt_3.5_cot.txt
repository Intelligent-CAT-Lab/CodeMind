<<<Analysis>>>
The variable H, variable A and variable B are initialized to 100, 2 and 4, respectively.
variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of values of i that divide H evenly.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from A to B (inclusive), meaning it will consider values of i from 2 to 4.
For each value of i in this range, it checks if H is divisible by i (i.e., H % i == 0). If it is, it increments the value of ans by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
