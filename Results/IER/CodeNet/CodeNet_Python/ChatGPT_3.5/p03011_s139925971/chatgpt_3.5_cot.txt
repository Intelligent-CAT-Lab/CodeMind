<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers P, Q, and R as input and assigns them to the variables P, Q, and R respectively.
Then it calculates the sum of P+Q, Q+R, and R+P and stores them in a list.
Finally, it prints the minimum value from the list.
In this case, the sum of P+Q is 1+3=4, the sum of Q+R is 3+4=7, and the sum of R+P is 4+1=5.
Therefore, the minimum value is 4, so the output will be 4.
<<<Output>>>
4
