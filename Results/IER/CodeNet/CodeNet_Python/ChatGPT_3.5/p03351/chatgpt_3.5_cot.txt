<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four integers as input and assigns them to variables a, b, c, and d.
It then uses a conditional expression to check if either of the following conditions is true:
1. The absolute difference between a and c is less than or equal to d.
2. The absolute difference between a and b is less than or equal to d, and the absolute difference between b and c is less than or equal to d.

If either of these conditions is true, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".

In this case, the absolute difference between a and c is 5, which is greater than d (3). The absolute difference between a and b is 3, which is equal to d. However, the absolute difference between b and c is 2, which is less than d. Therefore, the condition is not met and the code prints "No".

<<<Output>>>
No
