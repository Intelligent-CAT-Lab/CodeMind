<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function inpl() that reads a line of integers from input and returns them as a list.
The variables N, A, B, C, D are initialized by calling the inpl() function on the input line.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to N (inclusive), assigning the current value to the variable k.
Inside the loop, it calculates the value of j as N-1-k.
The code then checks if the inequality D*k - C*j >= B-A >= C*k - D*j is true. If it is, it prints 'YES' and breaks out of the loop.
If the loop finishes without finding a solution, it prints 'NO'.
In this case, the inequality is true for k = 1 and j = 3, so the output will be 'YES'.
<<<Output>>>
YES
