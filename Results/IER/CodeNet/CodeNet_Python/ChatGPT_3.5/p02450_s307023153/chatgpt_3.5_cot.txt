<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input n and creates a list nl containing the numbers from 1 to n as strings.
Then, it defines a recursive function perm that takes a list nl as input.
The function perm has three base cases:
- If the length of nl is 0, it returns an empty list.
- If the length of nl is 1, it returns a list containing nl.
- Otherwise, it initializes an empty list l and iterates over the indices of nl.
  - For each index i, it selects the element at that index and stores it in m.
  - It creates a new list rest by removing the element at index i from nl.
  - It recursively calls perm with rest as input and iterates over the permutations returned by the recursive call.
    - For each permutation p, it appends [m] + p to the list l.
  - After the loop, it returns the list l.

Finally, the code enters a loop that iterates over the permutations returned by perm(nl).
For each permutation i, it prints the elements joined by a space.
