<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs, `a` and `b`, using the `input().split()` function. In this case, the inputs are 'H' and 'H'.
The code then checks if `a` is equal to 'H'. Since `a` is indeed 'H', the code enters the first if statement and prints the value of `b`, which is 'H'.
Therefore, the output of the code execution would be 'H'.
<<<Output>>>
H
