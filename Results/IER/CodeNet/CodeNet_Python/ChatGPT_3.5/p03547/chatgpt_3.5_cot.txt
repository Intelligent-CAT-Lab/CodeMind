<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes variables A, B, C, D, E, and F to the values 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15, respectively.
Then it reads two inputs N and M.
The code then checks if N is greater than M. If it is, it prints ">".
If N is not greater than M, it checks if N is equal to M. If it is, it prints "=".
If neither of the above conditions is true, it prints "<".
<<<Output>>>
The output depends on the values of N and M. Without knowing the specific values of N and M, we cannot determine the exact output.
