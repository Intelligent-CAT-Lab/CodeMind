<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called solve that takes three arguments: n, d, and x.
Inside the function, there is a while loop that runs as long as n is not zero.
In each iteration of the loop, the code updates the value of ans by adding d + (2 * n - 1) * x / 2 to it.
Then, it updates the value of d by calculating ((n + 1) * d + 5 * x / 2) / n.
Next, it updates the value of x by multiplying it with (n + 2) / n.
Finally, it decreases the value of n by 1.
After the loop finishes, the function returns the value of ans.
Outside the function, the code reads a line of input, splits it into three parts, converts them to float, and passes them as arguments to the solve function.
The result of the function is then printed with 10 decimal places.
