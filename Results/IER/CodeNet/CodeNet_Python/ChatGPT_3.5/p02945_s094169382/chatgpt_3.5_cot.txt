<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers A and B as input and stores them in variables A and B, respectively.
Then it calculates three values: A+B, A-B, and A*B.
Finally, it prints the maximum value among these three calculated values.
In this case, A is -13 and B is 3.
So, A+B = -13+3 = -10, A-B = -13-3 = -16, and A*B = -13*3 = -39.
The maximum value among these three is -10.
<<<Output>>>
-10
