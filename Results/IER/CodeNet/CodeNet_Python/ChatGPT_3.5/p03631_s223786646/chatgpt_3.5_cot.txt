<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes input as a string and assigns it to the variables a, b, and c.
Then it checks if the first character of the string (a) is equal to the third character of the string (c).
If they are equal, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".
In this case, the first character of the input string is '5' and the third character is '5', so they are equal.
Therefore, the code will output "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
