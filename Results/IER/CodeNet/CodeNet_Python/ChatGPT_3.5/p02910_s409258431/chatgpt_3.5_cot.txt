<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string S.
It initializes a variable a to 0, which will be used to count the number of times the condition is met.
The code then enters a loop that iterates through the indices of the string S.
For each index i, it checks if i is even or odd using the modulo operator (%).
If i is even, it checks if the character at index i in S is 'L'. If it is, it increments the variable a by 1.
If i is odd, it checks if the character at index i in S is 'R'. If it is, it increments the variable a by 1.
After the loop finishes, it checks if the value of a is 0. If it is, it prints 'Yes'. Otherwise, it prints 'No'.
In this case, the string S is 'RUDLUDR'.
The code checks the following indices:
- Index 0: 'R' is not 'L', so a remains 0.
- Index 1: 'U' is not 'R', so a remains 0.
- Index 2: 'D' is not 'L', so a remains 0.
- Index 3: 'L' is 'L', so a is incremented to 1.
- Index 4: 'U' is not 'R', so a remains 1.
- Index 5: 'D' is not 'L', so a remains 1.
- Index 6: 'R' is 'R', so a is incremented to 2.
The final value of a is 2, so the code prints 'No'.
