<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by initializing the variable MOD to 10^9 + 7 and the variable list_size to 20000001.
Then, it creates two lists, f_list and f_r_list, both of size list_size, and initializes them with 1.
Next, it enters a loop that iterates from 0 to list_size-2. In each iteration, it calculates the factorial of the current index i+1 and stores it in f_list.
After that, it calculates the modular inverse of the last element of f_list and stores it in the last element of f_r_list.
Then, it enters another loop that iterates from list_size-2 to 0 (inclusive), with a step of -1. In each iteration, it calculates the modular inverse of the current index i+1 and stores it in f_r_list.
Next, it reads three integers h, w, and k from input.
The code then calculates the value of ans using various formulas and arithmetic operations.
Finally, it prints the value of ans.
