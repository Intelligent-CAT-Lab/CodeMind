<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string and assigns it to the variable target.
It then uses the swapcase() method to convert the case of each character in the string. Uppercase characters are converted to lowercase and vice versa.
The result is stored in the variable Ans.
Finally, the code prints the value of Ans.
In this case, the input string is "fAIR, LATER, OCCASIONALLY CLOUDY.".
After applying the swapcase() method, the string becomes "Fair, later, occasionally cloudy.".
<<<Output>>>
Fair, later, occasionally cloudy.
