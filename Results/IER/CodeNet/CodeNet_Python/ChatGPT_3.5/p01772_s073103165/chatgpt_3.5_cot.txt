<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string and initializes an empty list called outputStrings to store the output.
It also initializes a boolean variable isNextA to True, which indicates whether the next character should be "A" or "Z".
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each character in the input string.
Inside the loop, it checks if isNextA is True and the current character is "A". If both conditions are true, it appends the character to outputStrings and sets isNextA to False.
If isNextA is False and the current character is "Z", it appends the character to outputStrings and sets isNextA to True.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if outputStrings is not empty. If it is not empty, it checks if the last character in outputStrings is "A". If it is, it removes the last character.
The code then initializes an empty string called output and enters another loop that iterates over each character in outputStrings. Inside the loop, it concatenates each character to output.
Finally, the code checks the length of output. If it is greater than 1, it prints output. Otherwise, it prints "-1".
