<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input n.
It initializes an empty list s.
Then it enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 2^n - 1 (inclusive), which means it will consider all possible combinations of n bits.
Inside this loop, it appends the string representation of the current number i followed by a colon to the list s.
Then it enters another loop that iterates from 0 to n-1 (inclusive).
Inside this loop, it checks if the j-th bit of i is set (i & 1 << j). If it is, it appends a space followed by the value of j to the list s.
After the inner loop finishes, it appends a newline character to the list s.
After the outer loop finishes, it prints the concatenation of all elements in the list s, with an empty string as the separator, and sets the end parameter of the print function to an empty string to prevent a newline character from being printed at the end.
