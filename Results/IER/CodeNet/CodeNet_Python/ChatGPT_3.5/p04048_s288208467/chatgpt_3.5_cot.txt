<<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module and sets the input function to read from sys.stdin.readline. It also sets the recursion limit to 10^7.

Then, it reads two integers N and X from input, which are 5 and 2 in this case.

Next, it defines a recursive function F(x, y) that calculates the distance between two points in a parallelogram. The function takes two parameters x and y, representing the lengths of the sides of the parallelogram. It first checks if x is greater than y, and if so, swaps the values of x and y. Then, it calculates the quotient and remainder of y divided by x using the divmod function. If the remainder is 0, it returns (2*q-1)*x, where q is the quotient. Otherwise, it returns 2*q*x plus the result of calling the function recursively with x and y%x.

After defining the function, the code calculates the answer by adding N to the result of calling F(X, N-X). In this case, it calculates F(2, 3) and adds 5 to the result.

Finally, it prints the answer, which is 10.
