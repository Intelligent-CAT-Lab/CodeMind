  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes in two integers n and m as input, where n and m are separated by a space.
The code then checks if n is less than 1, and if so, it checks if m is less than 1. If both conditions are true, it prints the values of n and m and quits the program.
If n is less than 1 but m is not, it prints "Impossible" and quits the program.
If neither condition is true, the code checks if m is greater than n. If it is, it sets min to m and max to n + m - 1. If m is not greater than n, it sets min to n and max to n + m - 1. If m is equal to 0, it sets max to n.
Finally, the code prints the values of min and max.
