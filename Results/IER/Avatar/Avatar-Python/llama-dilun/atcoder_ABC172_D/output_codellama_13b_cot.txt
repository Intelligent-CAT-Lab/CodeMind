  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first reads an integer n from the input.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of the required values.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to n.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the value of the expression i * ( 1 + n // i ) * i // 2.
The code then adds this value to ans.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans.
