<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user and splits it into a tuple of integers using the map() function.
The tuple is assigned to the variable ABC.
The code then checks if the tuple contains exactly two 5s using the count() method.
If the condition is met, the code calculates the sum of the elements in the tuple using the sum() function.
If the sum is equal to 17, the code prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'.
If the condition is not met, the code prints 'NO'.

In this case, the input is '5 5 7', which is split into a tuple (5, 5, 7).
The count() method returns 2, indicating that the tuple contains exactly two 5s.
The sum() function calculates the sum of the elements in the tuple, which is 17.
Therefore, the output of the code is 'YES'.
<<<Output>>>
YES
