  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input from the user and splits it into two parts using the "." as the delimiter.
The first part is stored in the variable num[0] and the second part is stored in the variable num[1].
The code then checks if the last digit of the first part is equal to 9. If it is, it prints "GOTO Vasilisa".
If the last digit is not equal to 9, the code checks if the first digit of the second part is greater than or equal to 5. If it is, it prints the sum of the first part and 1. If it is not, it prints the first part.
