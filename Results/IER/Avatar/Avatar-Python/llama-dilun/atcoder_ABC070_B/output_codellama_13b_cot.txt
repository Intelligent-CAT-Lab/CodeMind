<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in four integers as input, which are assigned to variables a, b, c, and d.
The code then calculates the difference between the maximum of a and c, and the minimum of b and d.
The result is then passed to the max function, which returns the larger of the two values.
The final result is then subtracted from 0, which is the minimum value that can be returned.

<<<Output>>>
50
