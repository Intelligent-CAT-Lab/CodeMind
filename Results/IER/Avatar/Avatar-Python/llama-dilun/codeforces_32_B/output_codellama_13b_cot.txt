  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string input from the user and initializes an empty string result.
It then enters a while loop that iterates over the characters of the input string.
For each character, it checks if it is a dot (.) and if it is, it appends a 0 to the result string.
If the character is not a dot, it increments the loop counter i by 1 and checks if the next character is a dot.
If it is, it appends a 1 to the result string.
If the next character is not a dot, it appends a 2 to the result string.
The loop continues until the end of the input string is reached.
The final result string is then printed.
