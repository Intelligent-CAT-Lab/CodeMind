  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user and splits it into a list of strings using the split() method.
The list is then converted to a list of integers using the int() function.
The code then calculates the minimum value in the list and prints it.
The code then checks if the difference between the first and second elements of the list is greater than or equal to 2. If it is, it prints the absolute value of the difference divided by 2. If not, it prints 0.
<<<Output>>>
45  0
