  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, a and b, and initializes c to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates twice.
In each iteration, the code calculates the maximum of a and b and adds it to c.
The code then checks if a is greater than or equal to b. If it is, it subtracts 1 from a. Otherwise, it subtracts 1 from b.
The loop continues until a and b are equal.
The code then prints the final value of c, which is 12.
<<<Output>>>
12
