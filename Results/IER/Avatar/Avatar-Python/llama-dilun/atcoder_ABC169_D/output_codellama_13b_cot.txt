  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input from the user and stores it in the variable x.
The function factorization is defined, which takes an integer n as input and returns an array of arrays, where each subarray contains two elements: the first element is a prime factor of n, and the second element is the power to which that prime factor is raised.
The function factorization first initializes an empty array arr.
It then iterates from 2 to the square root of n, and for each integer i in this range, it checks if n is divisible by i. If it is, it increments a counter cnt and divides n by i until it is no longer divisible by i.
It then appends the prime factor i and its power to the array arr.
If n is not divisible by any prime factor, it is added to the array arr as a prime factor with power 1.
The function factorization then returns the array arr.
The code then calls the function factorization with the input x, and stores the result in the variable l.
It then sorts the array l in ascending order of the first element of each subarray.
It then initializes a variable ans to 0.
It then iterates over the array l and for each subarray [p, k], it checks if p is equal to 1. If it is, it skips the subarray and continues to the next iteration.
If p is not equal to 1, it initializes a variable s to 0 and a variable num to k.
It then iterates from 1 to num and for each integer j in this range, it adds j to s and checks if s is equal to num. If it is, it breaks out of the loop. If it is not, it checks if s is greater than num. If it is, it decrements j and breaks out of the loop.
It then adds the value of j to the variable ans.
Finally, the code prints the value of ans.

<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will be 10.
