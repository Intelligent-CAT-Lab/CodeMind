  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input as a string and converts it into a list of characters using the list() function.
The code then initializes a dictionary called dt to store the frequency of each character in the input string.
The code then iterates over the list of characters and checks if each character is already present in the dictionary. If it is, it increments the value of the character in the dictionary. If it is not, it adds the character to the dictionary with a value of 1.
The code then initializes a variable cnt to 0 and sets x to True.
The code then iterates over the dictionary and checks if the value of each character is odd. If it is, it increments cnt by 1. If cnt is greater than 1, it sets x to False and breaks out of the loop.
Finally, the code prints "First" if x is True, "Second" if x is False and the length of the input string is even, or "First" if x is False and the length of the input string is odd.
<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will depend on the input string. If the input string is "ocvxailppytfwwqmfsaabdpzewzkziyhlywwwtcefmyoonfyfzwnrvttjfxxioctfnhmnrxptxtbearaqppopkokscggenenigwkpnyqkvcoldlcvybyqofnopaumykogqxhsovcfdbaiysqrmahasbcqaywvshdxlwkwvosxbrcwfewqcjqmqutebrrywxsrmuyeztlchlegzbbiojbdoycocqxgduswebgkzeuqkcmkyhfmimegfygxglwqowj...", the output will be "First" because the length of the input string is odd and there is only one character with an odd frequency.
