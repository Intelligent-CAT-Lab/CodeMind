  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input sentence from the user.
It then initializes two variables, start and letter, to -1 and an empty string, respectively.
The code then enters a while loop that iterates until the condition is met.
The condition is met when the character at the start index of the sentence is not a space or a question mark.
If the condition is met, the code sets the letter variable to the character at the start index of the sentence and breaks out of the loop.
If the condition is not met, the code decrements the start index by 1 and continues the loop.
The code then checks if the letter is a vowel (a, e, i, o, u, or y).
If it is, the code prints "YES".
If it is not, the code prints "NO".

<<<Output>>>
NO
