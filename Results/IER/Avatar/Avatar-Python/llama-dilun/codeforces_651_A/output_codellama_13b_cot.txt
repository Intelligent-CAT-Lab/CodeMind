  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs, a1 and a2, and initializes t to 0.
The code checks if a1 and a2 are both equal to 1, and if so, it prints 0 and exits.
If a1 and a2 are not both equal to 1, the code enters a while loop that continues until a1 and a2 are both equal to 0.
In each iteration of the loop, the code checks if a1 is greater than a2. If it is, it adds 1 to a2 and subtracts 2 from a1. If a2 is greater than or equal to a1, it subtracts 2 from a2 and adds 1 to a1.
The code increments t by 1 in each iteration of the loop.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of t, which is the number of iterations the loop ran for.
