  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes input from the user and converts it to its ASCII code using the ord() function. It then adds 1 to the ASCII code and converts it back to a character using the chr() function.

<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will be the next character in the ASCII table after the input character.

For example, if the input is 'a', the output will be 'b'.
