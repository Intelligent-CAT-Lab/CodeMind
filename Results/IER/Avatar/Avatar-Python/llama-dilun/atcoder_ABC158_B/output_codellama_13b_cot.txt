  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input as a string and splits it into three parts using the space character as a delimiter.
It then converts each part into an integer using the map function.
The code then calculates the quotient of N by A+B and stores it in ans.
The code then calculates the remainder of N by A+B and stores it in rem.
The code then adds the minimum of rem and A to ans.
The code finally prints the value of ans.
