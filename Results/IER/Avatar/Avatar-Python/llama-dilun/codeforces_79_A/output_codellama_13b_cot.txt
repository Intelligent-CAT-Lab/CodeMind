  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes the input as two integers x and y.
The variable CielWon is initialized to False, which will be used to determine the winner of the game.
The code enters a while loop that iterates while y is greater than 1 and x * 10 + y is greater than 21.
The loop calculates the minimum of x and 2, and subtracts it from x.
The loop calculates the minimum of 2 and y // 10, and subtracts it from y.
The loop checks if y is less than 2 or if 10 * x + y is less than 22. If either of these conditions is met, the loop breaks and CielWon is set to True.
The loop then subtracts 2 from y and 2 - t from x.
The loop repeats until the while loop condition is no longer met.
The code then prints 'Ciel' if CielWon is True, and 'Hanako' otherwise.
<<<Output>>>
Ciel
