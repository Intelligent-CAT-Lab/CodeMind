  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input from the user and stores it in the variable s.
The variable t is initialized to a string containing the characters ',.?! '
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the characters in t.
For each character i in t, the code replaces all occurrences of i in s with i followed by three spaces.
The code then splits s into a list of words using the split() method and joins the list back into a string using the join() method.
The code then enters another loop that iterates over the characters in t.
For each character i in t, the code replaces all occurrences of' '+ i in s with i.
The code then prints the final value of s.

<<<Output>>>
a  !   n  ,   t   o
