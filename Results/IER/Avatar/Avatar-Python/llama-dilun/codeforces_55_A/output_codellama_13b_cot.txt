<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input n from the user.
The while loop checks if n is divisible by 2. If it is, it divides n by 2.
The loop continues until n is no longer divisible by 2.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if n is equal to 1. If it is, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

In this case, the input is 512. The loop will divide 512 by 2 9 times, resulting in 512 / 2^9 = 1.
Since 1 is equal to 1, the code will print 'YES'.
<<<Output>>>
YES
