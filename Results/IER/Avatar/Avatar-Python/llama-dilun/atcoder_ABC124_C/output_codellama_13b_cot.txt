  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string input s from the user.
The code then initializes two variables cnt1 and cnt2 to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the length of the string s.
For each iteration, the code checks if the current index i is even or odd.
If i is even, the code checks if the character at index i is '0'. If it is, it increments cnt1 by 1. If it is not, it increments cnt2 by 1.
If i is odd, the code checks if the character at index i is '0'. If it is, it increments cnt2 by 1. If it is not, it increments cnt1 by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the minimum value of cnt1 and cnt2.
<<<Output>>>
0
