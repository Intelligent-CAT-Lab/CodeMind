  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes in two inputs, n and m, and splits them into two variables, n and m.
The code then calculates the quotient and remainder of n divided by m, and stores them in variables q and r, respectively.
The code then initializes a list a with q copies of q.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to r-1, and for each iteration, it adds 1 to the corresponding element of a.
The code then enters another loop that iterates from 0 to m-1, and for each iteration, it prints the corresponding element of a, followed by three spaces.
