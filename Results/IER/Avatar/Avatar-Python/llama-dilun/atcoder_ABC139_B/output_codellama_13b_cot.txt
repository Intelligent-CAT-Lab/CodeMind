<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in two integers t and h as input, separated by a space.
The code then calculates the difference between h and 2, and then divides the result by the difference between t and 1.
The result is then rounded up to the nearest integer using the // operator.
Finally, the code adds 1 to the result.

The input given is 8 8.
The code will calculate (8 - 2) // (8 - 1) + 1, which is 6 // 7 + 1, which is 1.

<<<Output>>>
1
