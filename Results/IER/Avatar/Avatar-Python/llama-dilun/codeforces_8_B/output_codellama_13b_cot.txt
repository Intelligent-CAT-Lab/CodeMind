  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first initializes a set called coord with the value (0,0).
It then takes the input path and iterates through each character in the path.
For each character, it checks if it is 'L', 'R', 'U', or 'D'.
If it is 'L', it moves the current position to the left by 1.
If it is 'R', it moves the current position to the right by 1.
If it is 'U', it moves the current position up by 1.
If it is 'D', it moves the current position down by 1.
It then checks if the new position is in the set coord.
If it is, it prints 'BUG' and exits.
If it is not, it adds the new position to the set coord and adds it to a queue called que.
It then removes the first element from the queue and checks if it is in the set coord.
If it is, it removes it from the set coord and adds its neighbors to the queue.
It then repeats this process until the queue is empty.
If the queue has more than one element, it prints 'BUG' and exits.
If the queue has only one element, it prints 'OK'.
<<<Output>>>
OK
