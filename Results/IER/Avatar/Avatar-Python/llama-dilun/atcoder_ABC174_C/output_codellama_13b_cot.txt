  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys and collections modules.
The variable K is initialized to the input value 260522.
The variable cnt is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of iterations.
The variable now is initialized to 0.
The code checks if K is even, and if it is, it prints -1 and exits the program.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 10^6 (1000000).
For each iteration, the code increments cnt by 1.
The code then calculates the value of now as (now * 10 + 7) % K.
The code checks if now is equal to 0, and if it is, it prints the value of cnt and exits the program.
The code continues to iterate until the loop finishes, at which point it prints -1.
<<<Output>>>
1000000
