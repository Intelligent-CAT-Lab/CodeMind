<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input from the user and stores it in variable a.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from a to 0 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 733035 to 0.
For each number i in this range, the code checks if a is divisible by i. If it is, it prints i and sets a to i.
The loop will terminate when a becomes 1, because 1 is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by all positive integers less than or equal to it.
<<<Output>>>
733035  315  105  35  15  5  1
