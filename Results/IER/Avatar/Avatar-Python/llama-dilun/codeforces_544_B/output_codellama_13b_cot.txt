  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user and splits it into a list of integers. The first element of the list is 100, and the second element is 10000.
The code then initializes a few variables:
* start is set to 0
* arr is initialized as an empty list
* count is set to 0
* i is set to 0
* j is set to 0
* string is set to an empty string
* next is set to start

The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to the first element of the input list (100). For each iteration, it sets string to an empty string and next to start.
The code then enters another loop that iterates from 0 to the first element of the input list (100). For each iteration, it checks if count is less than the second element of the input list (10000). If it is, it checks if j is equal to next. If it is, it adds " L " to string, increments count by 1, increments next by 2, and sets start to 1 if start is 0, and sets start to 0 if start is 1. If j is not equal to next, it adds " S " to string.
After the inner loop finishes, the code appends string to arr.
The code then checks if count is less than the second element of the input list (10000). If it is, it prints " NO ". Otherwise, it prints " YES ". It then prints each element of arr on a new line.
<<<Output>>>
YES
