  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module and defines a main function that takes a list of lines as input.
The first line of the input is split into three integers using the split() method and the map() function.
The first integer is assigned to the variable w, the second integer is assigned to the variable m, and the third integer is assigned to the variable k.
The code then initializes the variable max_length to 0 and calculates the available digits using the integer division of w by k.
The code enters a while loop that iterates until the available digits are 0.
In each iteration, the code calculates the current cost per number using the length of the string representation of m.
The code then calculates the usable numbers using the same_cost_until variable, which is calculated as 10 to the power of the current cost per number.
The code then calculates the use_digits variable, which is the product of the usable numbers and the current cost per number.
The code then updates the value of m to the same_cost_until variable and checks if the available digits are greater than or equal to the use_digits variable.
If they are, the code updates the value of max_length and subtracts the use_digits variable from the available digits.
If they are not, the code updates the value of max_length by dividing the available digits by the current cost per number and sets the available digits to 0.
The code then prints the final value of max_length.
