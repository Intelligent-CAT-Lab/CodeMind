<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs from the user, separated by a space.
The first input is a string, and the second input is a float.
The code then splits the first input into two parts: the first character and the rest of the string.
The code then converts the first character to an integer and the rest of the string to a float.
The code then multiplies the two numbers and divides the result by 100.
<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will be 81479361334739500.
