<<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module, which is not used in the code.
The code then defines a function called main, which takes no arguments.
The function first maps the input to two variables S and W, which are integers.
The function then prints "unsafe" if S is less than or equal to W, and "safe" otherwise.
The code then checks if the name of the current module is "__main__", which is the name of the module that is executed when the script is run directly. If it is, the function main is called.
The code then ends with a colon, which is not necessary.
<<<Output>>>
