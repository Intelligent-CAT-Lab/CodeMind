  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the Decimal class from the decimal module and sets the precision to 200.
The code then maps the input to the variables n, d, and x, which are the number of terms, the denominator, and the numerator, respectively.
The code then initializes the variable ans to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider terms from 1 to 1000.
For each term i, the code calculates the value of the term using the formula (n-i+1)/i * (d+x*((n*2-1)/2)).
The code then adds the value of the current term to ans.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans.
<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will be a decimal number with 200 digits.
