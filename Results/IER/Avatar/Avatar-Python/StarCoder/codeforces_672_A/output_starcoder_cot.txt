Instruction: I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
For example:

Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
20 2 5
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
Consider the following code:

li = [ ]
ind = 0
for i in range ( 1, 371 ) :
    temp = [ ]
    p, q = i, i
    count = 0
    while p!= 0 :
        p //= 10
        count += 1
    if count == 1 :
        li. append ( i )
    if count == 2 :
        temp = [ ]
        while q!= 0 :
            x = q % 10
            q //= 10
            temp. append ( x )
        li = li + temp [ : : - 1 ]
    if count == 3 :
        temp = [ ]
        while q!= 0 :
            x = q % 10
            q //= 10
            temp. append ( x )
        li = li + temp [ : : - 1 ]
li. pop ( )
li. pop ( )
n = int ( input ('' ) )
print ( li [ n - 1 ] )


What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
952

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The code first initializes a list li to an empty list.
The code then initializes a variable ind to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 371 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 371.
For each number i in this range, it initializes two variables p and q to i.
It then initializes a variable count to 0.
The code then enters a while loop that iterates while p is not equal to 0.
It divides p by 10 and adds the result to count.
The code then checks if count is equal to 1. If it is, it appends i to li.
The code then checks if count is equal to 2. If it is, it initializes a list temp to an empty list.
It then enters a while loop that iterates while q is not equal to 0.
It divides q by 10 and stores the remainder in x.
It then divides q by 10 again and stores the remainder in q.
It then appends x to temp.
It then reverses the order of elements in temp and appends them to li.
The code then checks if count is equal to 3. If it is, it initializes a list temp to an empty list.
It then enters a while loop that iterates while q is not equal to 0.
It divides q by 10 and stores the remainder in x.
It then divides q by 10 again and stores the remainder in q.
It then appends x to temp.
It then reverses the order of elements in temp and appends them to li.
The code then pops the last two elements of li.
The code then initializes a variable n to the value of the input.
