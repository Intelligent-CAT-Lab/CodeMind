Instruction: I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
For example:

Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
20 2 5
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
Consider the following code:

ip = input ( )
st = " "
if len ( ip )!= 1 :
    if ip [ 0 ] == "9" :
        st = "9"
        ip = ip [ 1 : ]
    for i in ip :
        if int ( i ) > 4 :
            n = 9 - int ( i )
            st += str ( n )
        else :
            st += i
else :
    st = ip
print ( int ( st ) )


What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
5728

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The code reads the input and stores it in the variable ip.
The code checks if the length of ip is not equal to 1. If it is, it checks if the first character of ip is 9. If it is, it sets the variable st to 9 and removes the first character from ip.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the characters of ip.
For each character i in ip, it checks if its numerical value is greater than 4. If it is, it calculates the difference between 9 and the numerical value of i and stores it in the variable n.
The code then appends the string representation of n to the variable st.
If the numerical value of i is not greater than 4, it appends the string representation of i to the variable st.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of st, which is 9999.

The output of code execution is:
9999
