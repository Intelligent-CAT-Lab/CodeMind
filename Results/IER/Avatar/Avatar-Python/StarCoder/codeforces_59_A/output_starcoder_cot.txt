Instruction: I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
For example:

Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
20 2 5
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
Consider the following code:

txt = input ( )
out = " "
cap = 0
small = 0
for t in txt :
    if t. islower ( ) :
        small += 1
    else :
        cap += 1
if small >= cap :
    for t in txt :
        out += t. lower ( )
else :
    for t in txt :
        out += t. upper ( )
print ( out )


What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
CDOZDPBVVVHNBJVBYHEOXWFLJKRWJCAJMIFCOZWWYFKVWOGTVJcuusigdqfkumewjtdyitveeiaybwrhomrwmpdipjwiuxfnwuz

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable txt is initialized to "CDOZDPBVVVHNBJVBYHEOXWFLJKRWJCAJMIFCOZWWYFKVWOGTVJcuusigdqfkumewjtdyitveeiaybwrhomrwmpdipjwiuxfnwuz".
The variable out is initialized to " ", which will be used to store the output.
The variable cap is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of capital letters.
The variable small is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of small letters.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each character in txt.
If the character is a small letter, it adds 1 to the variable small.
If the character is a capital letter, it adds 1 to the variable cap.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if small is greater than or equal to cap.
If it is, it enters a loop that iterates over each character in txt again.
If the character is a small letter, it adds it to the variable out in lowercase.
If the character is a capital letter, it adds it to the variable out in uppercase.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of out, which is "cdozdpbvvvhnbjvbyheoxwfljkrwjcajmifcozwwyfkvwogtvjcuusigdqfkumewjtdyitveeiaybwrhomrwmpdipjwiuxfnwuz".

The output of code execution is:
cdozdpbvvvhnbjvbyheoxwfljkrwjcajmifcozwwyfkvwogtvjcuusigdqfkumewjtdyitveeiaybwrhomrwmpdipjwiuxfnwuz
