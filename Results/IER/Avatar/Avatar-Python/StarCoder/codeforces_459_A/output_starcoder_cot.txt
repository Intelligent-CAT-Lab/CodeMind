Instruction: I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
For example:

Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
20 2 5
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
Consider the following code:

anti, b, c, d = map ( int, input ( ). split ( ) )
l = abs ( anti - c ) ; m = abs ( b - d )
if anti == c : print ( anti + m, b, c + m, d )
elif b == d : print ( anti, b + l, c, d + l )
elif l!= m : print ( - 1 )
else : print ( anti, d, c, b )


What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
4 0 0 4

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable anti is initialized to 4, variable b is initialized to 0, variable c is initialized to 0, variable d is initialized to 4.
The variable l is initialized to the absolute value of anti - c, which is 4.
The variable m is initialized to the absolute value of b - d, which is 4.
The code checks if anti == c. Since anti == c, the code prints the values of anti + m, b and c + m, d, which are 8, 0 and 8, 4, respectively.
The code checks if b == d. Since b == d, the code prints the values of anti, b + l, c and d + l, which are 4, 4, 0 and 8, respectively.
The code checks if l!= m. Since l!= m, the code prints -1.
The code checks if l == m. Since l == m, the code prints the values of anti, d, c and b, which are 4, 4, 0 and 0, respectively.

The output of code execution is:
8 0 8 4
