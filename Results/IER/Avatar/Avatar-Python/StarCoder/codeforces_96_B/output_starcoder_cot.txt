Instruction: I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
For example:

Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
20 2 5
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
Consider the following code:

l = [ ]
limit = 10000000000
def gen ( number, four, seven ) :
    if ( number > limit ) :
        return
    if ( number > 0 and four == seven ) :
        l. append ( number )
    gen ( number * 10 + 4, four + 1, seven )
    gen ( number * 10 + 7, four, seven + 1 )
def main ( ) :
    gen ( 0, 0, 0 )
    l. sort ( )
    n = int ( input ( ) )
    ans = 0
    for val in l :
        if ( val >= n ) :
            ans = val
            break
    print ( ans )
main ( )


What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
77777777

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The code first initializes a list l to store the generated numbers.
The code then initializes a variable limit to 10000000000, which is the maximum value that the generated numbers can reach.
The code then defines a function gen that takes three parameters: number, four and seven.
The function first checks if number is greater than limit. If it is, the function returns.
The function then checks if number is greater than 0 and four equals seven. If it is, the function appends number to l.
The function then calls itself recursively with the following parameters: number * 10 + 4, four + 1, seven.
The function then calls itself recursively with the following parameters: number * 10 + 7, four, seven + 1.
The code then calls the function main.
The function main first calls the function gen with the following parameters: 0, 0, 0.
The function gen then calls itself recursively with the following parameters: 4, 1, 0.
The function gen then calls itself recursively with the following parameters: 7, 0, 1.
The function gen then appends 4 to l.
The function gen then appends 7 to l.
The function gen then appends 47 to l.
The function gen then appends 44 to l.
The function gen then appends 444 to l.
The function gen then appends 4444 to l.
The function gen then appends 44444 to l.
The function gen then appends 444444 to l.
The function gen then appends 4444444 to l.
The function gen then appends 44444444 to l.
The function gen
