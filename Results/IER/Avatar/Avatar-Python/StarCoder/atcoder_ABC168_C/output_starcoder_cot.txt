Instruction: I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
For example:

Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
20 2 5
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
Consider the following code:

import math
a, b, h, m = map ( int, input ( ). split ( ) )
theta_h = 2.5 * math. pi - ( 2 * math. pi * ( ( h + ( m / 60 ) ) / 12 ) )
theta_m = 2.5 * math. pi - ( 2 * math. pi * ( m / 60 ) )
x_h = a * math. cos ( theta_h )
y_h = a * math. sin ( theta_h )
x_m = b * math. cos ( theta_m )
y_m = b * math. sin ( theta_m )
print ( ( ( x_h - x_m ) ** 2 + ( y_h - y_m ) ** 2 ) ** 0.5 )


What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
1 2 9 49

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The code imports the math module.
The variables a, b, h and m are initialized to 1, 2, 9 and 49, respectively.
The code calculates theta_h, theta_m, x_h, y_h, x_m and y_m.
The code prints the final value of the distance between the two points, which is 1.4142135623730951.

The output of code execution is:
1.4142135623730951
