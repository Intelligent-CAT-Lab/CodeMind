Instruction: I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
For example:

Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
20 2 5
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
Consider the following code:

A, B, C, D = map ( int, input ( ). split ( ) )
m = 998244353
d = [ [ 0 ] * ( D + 1 ) for _ in range ( C + 1 ) ]
d [ A ] [ B ] = 1
for i in range ( A, C + 1 ) :
    for j in range ( B, D + 1 ) :
        d [ i ] [ j ] += ( d [ i ] [ j - 1 ] * i + d [ i - 1 ] [ j ] * j - d [ i - 1 ] [ j - 1 ] * ( i - 1 ) * ( j - 1 ) ) % m
print ( d [ C ] [ D ] )


What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
2 1 3 4

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable A, B, C and D are initialized to 2, 1, 3 and 4, respectively.
The variable m is initialized to 998244353.
The variable d is initialized to a 2D array of size C+1 x D+1, where C+1 and D+1 are the values of C and D, respectively.
The value of d [ 2 ] [ 1 ] is set to 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from A to C (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 2 to 3.
For each number i in this range, it enters another loop that iterates from B to D (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 4.
For each number j in this range, it calculates the value of d [ i ] [ j ] as follows:
d [ i ] [ j ] = ( d [ i ] [ j - 1 ] * i + d [ i - 1 ] [ j ] * j - d [ i - 1 ] [ j - 1 ] * ( i - 1 ) * ( j - 1 ) ) % m
The value of d [ 3 ] [ 4 ] is then printed.

The output of code execution is:
10
