Instruction: I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
For example:

Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
20 2 5
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
Consider the following code:

n, m = map ( int, input ( ). split ( ) )
if n < 1 :
    if m < 1 :
        print ( n, m )
        quit ( )
    print ( " Impossible " )
    quit ( )
if m > n :
    min = m
    max = n + m - 1
    print ( min, max )
if m <= n :
    min = n
    max = n + m - 1
    if m == 0 :
        max = n
    print ( min, max )


What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
59 96

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable n is initialized to 59, and variable m is initialized to 96.
The code checks if n is less than 1. Since it is, the code checks if m is less than 1. Since it is, the code prints n and m, and quits.
The code then checks if m is less than 1. Since it is not, the code prints "Impossible" and quits.
The code then checks if m is greater than n. Since it is not, the code calculates min and max as follows:
min = m
max = n + m - 1
The code then prints min and max, which is 96 and 155, respectively.
The code then checks if m is less than or equal to n. Since it is, the code calculates min and max as follows:
min = n
max = n + m - 1
The code then checks if m is equal to 0. Since it is, the code sets max to n.
The code then prints min and max, which is 59 and 155, respectively.

The output of code execution is:
96 155
