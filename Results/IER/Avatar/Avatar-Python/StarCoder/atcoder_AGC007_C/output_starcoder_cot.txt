Instruction: I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
For example:

Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
20 2 5
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
Consider the following code:

from decimal import Decimal, getcontext
getcontext ( ). prec = 200
n, d, x = map ( Decimal, input ( ). split ( ) )
ans = 0
for i in range ( 1, int ( n ) + 1 ) :
    i = Decimal ( str ( i ) )
    ans += Decimal ( str ( ( int ( n ) - int ( i ) + 1 ) ) ) / Decimal ( str ( i ) ) * ( d + x * Decimal ( str ( int ( n ) * 2 - 1 ) ) / Decimal ( "2" ) )
print ( ans )


What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
1000 100 100

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The code first initializes the variables n, d and x to 1000, 100 and 100, respectively.
The variable ans is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of the series.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 1000.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84

# Solution

from decimal import Decimal, getcontext
getcontext ( ). prec = 200
n, d, x = map ( Decimal, input ( ). split ( ) )
ans = 0
for i in range ( 1, int ( n ) + 1 ) :
    i = Decimal ( str ( i ) )
    ans += Decimal ( str ( ( int ( n ) - int ( i ) + 1 ) ) ) / Decimal ( str ( i ) ) * ( d + x * Decimal ( str ( int ( n ) * 2 - 1 ) ) / Decimal ( "2" ) )
print ( ans )
