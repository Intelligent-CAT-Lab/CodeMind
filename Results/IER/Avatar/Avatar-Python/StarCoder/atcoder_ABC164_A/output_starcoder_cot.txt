Instruction: I want to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
For example:

Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
20 2 5
Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
Consider the following code:

import sys
def main ( ) :
    S, W = map ( int, input ( ). split ( ) )
    print ( " unsafe " ) if ( S <= W ) else print ( " safe " )
if __name__ =='_ _ main _ _':
    main ( )


What would be the output of the code execution given the following input:
1 100

Print the answer and end your response with "END-OF-OUTPUT":
The code imports the sys module, which is a standard library module that provides access to some variables used or maintained by the interpreter and to functions that interact strongly with the interpreter.
The main function is defined, which is the entry point of the program.
The main function takes no arguments and returns no value.
The main function first reads two integers from the standard input using the map function, which is a built-in function that takes a function and an iterable as arguments and returns a list of the results after applying the function to each element of the iterable.
The main function then prints the string "unsafe" if the first integer is less than or equal to the second integer, and prints the string "safe" otherwise.
The code execution is as follows:
unsafe
