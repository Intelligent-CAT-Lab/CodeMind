  <<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes the variables A, B, C, and D to 2, 1, 3, and 4, respectively.
The code initializes the variable m to 998244353 and the variable d to a 2D list with dimensions (C+1) x (D+1).
The code sets d[A][B] to 1.
The code enters a nested loop that iterates over the range [A, C+1) and [B, D+1).
For each iteration, the code calculates the value of d[i][j] using the formula:
d[i][j] = (d[i][j-1] * i + d[i-1][j] * j - d[i-1][j-1] * (i-1) * (j-1)) % m
The code then prints the value of d[C][D].
