  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs, a and b, and initializes x to a, h to 0, and s to 0.
The code then enters a while loop that iterates while x is greater than 0.
For each iteration, the code decrements x by 1, increments h by 1, and increments s by 1.
The code then enters another while loop that iterates while s is divisible by b.
For each iteration, the code increments h by 1, subtracts b from s, and adds 1 to s.
The code then prints the final value of h.
