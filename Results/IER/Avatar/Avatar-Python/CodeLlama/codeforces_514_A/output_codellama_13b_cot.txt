  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input from the user and stores it in the variable ip.
The variable st is initialized to a space character.
The code checks if the length of the input is not equal to 1. If it is not, it means that the input is a number with more than one digit.
The code then checks if the first digit of the input is 9. If it is, it sets the variable st to 9 and removes the first digit from the input.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each digit of the input.
For each digit, it checks if it is greater than 4. If it is, it calculates the difference between 9 and the digit and adds the result to the variable st.
If the digit is less than or equal to 4, it adds the digit to the variable st.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of st, which is 5728.
<<<Output>>>
5728
