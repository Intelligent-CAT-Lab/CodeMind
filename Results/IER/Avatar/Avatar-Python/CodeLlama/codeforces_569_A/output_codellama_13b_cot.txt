  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first initializes the variables T, s, and q to 100000, 3125, and 2, respectively.
The variable v is then calculated as (q-1)/q, which is 1/2 in this case.
The variable tm is initialized to 1.
The variable t is calculated as s/(1-v), which is 3125/(1-1/2) = 3125/1 = 3125.
The code then enters a loop that iterates while the condition (T-s)/v-t is greater than 0.
The condition is met when (T-s)/v-t is greater than 0, which is true when T-s is greater than 0.
The loop body increments tm by 1 and updates s and t as follows:
s += v*t
t = s/(1-v)
The loop continues until the condition is no longer met, which occurs when (T-s)/v-t is less than or equal to 1e-10.
The final value of tm is 100000/3125 = 31.25.
<<<Output>>>
31.25
