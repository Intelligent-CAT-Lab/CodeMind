<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user and splits it into a list of integers using the map() function.
The list is then iterated over using the enumerate() function, which returns a tuple containing the index and value of each element in the list.
The code checks if the value of each element is equal to 0, and if it is, it prints the index of that element plus 1 and breaks out of the loop.
Since the input contains 0, the code will print 5 and then break out of the loop.
<<<Output>>>
5
