  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in a string input from the user, and then splits the string into three parts using the ' ' character as a delimiter.
The first part is assigned to variable a, the second part is assigned to variable b, and the third part is assigned to variable k.
The code then calculates the difference between a and k, and stores the result in variable res.
If res is less than 0, the code sets a to 0 and adds res to b.
If res is greater than or equal to 0, the code sets a to res.
The code then prints the values of a and b.

<<<Output>>>
0 2000000000000
