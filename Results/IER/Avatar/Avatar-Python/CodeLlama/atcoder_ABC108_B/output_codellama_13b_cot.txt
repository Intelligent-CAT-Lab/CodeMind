The code takes in four integers as input, which are assigned to variables x1, y1, x2, and y2, respectively.
The code then calculates the difference between x2 and x1, which is stored in variable a.
The code then calculates the difference between y2 and y1, which is stored in variable b.
The code then prints the values of x2 - b, y2 + a, x1 - b, and y1 + a.
