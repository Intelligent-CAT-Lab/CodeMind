<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user and stores it in a variable called stdin.
The variable s is then initialized to the value of stdin.
The code then checks if the string "A" and "B" are present in the string s.
If they are, the code prints "Yes" to the console.
If they are not, the code prints "No" to the console.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
