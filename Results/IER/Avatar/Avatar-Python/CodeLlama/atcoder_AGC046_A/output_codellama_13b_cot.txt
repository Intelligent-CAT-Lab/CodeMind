<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input X from the user.
The variable i is initialized to 1, which will be used to count the number of iterations.
The variable a is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of X.
The code then enters an infinite loop.
In each iteration, the code adds X to a and checks if a is divisible by 360.
If it is, the code prints the value of i and breaks out of the loop.
The loop will continue until the condition is met.
