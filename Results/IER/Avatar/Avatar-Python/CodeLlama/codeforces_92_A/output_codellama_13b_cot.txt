  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module and uses it to read input from the standard input stream.
It then maps the input to two variables n and m, which are integers.
The code then initializes a variable i to 0 and enters a while loop.
The loop continues until i + 1 is greater than m.
If this condition is met, the code sets the variable ans to m and breaks out of the loop.
If the condition is not met, the code subtracts i + 1 from m and increments i.
The code then takes the remainder of i divided by n and assigns it to i.
The code then prints the value of ans.
