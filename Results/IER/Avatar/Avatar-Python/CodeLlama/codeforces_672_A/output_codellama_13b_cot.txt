  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first initializes an empty list li and sets the index ind to 0.
It then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 371 (inclusive).
For each number i in this range, it calculates the number of digits in i using the count variable.
If count is 1, the number i is added to the list li.
If count is 2, the digits of i are extracted and added to the list li in reverse order.
If count is 3, the digits of i are extracted and added to the list li in reverse order.
After the loop finishes, the code removes the last two elements from the list li using the pop() method.
The code then prompts the user to enter a number n and prints the n-th element of the list li.

<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will depend on the input provided by the user.
If the user enters 952, the code will print the 952-th element of the list li, which is 952.
