  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the calendar module.
The variable y is initialized to 2096, which is the input given to the code.
The code then checks if the year 2096 is a leap year using the isleap function from the calendar module.
The variable is_run is set to the result of this check, which is True.
The code then calculates the weekday of January 1st, 2096 using the weekday function from the calendar module.
The variable week is set to the result of this calculation, which is 3 (Wednesday).
The code then enters an infinite loop.
In each iteration of the loop, the variable y is incremented by 1.
The code then checks if the year y is a leap year and if its January 1st is the same weekday as the year 2096.
If both conditions are met, the code prints the value of y and breaks out of the loop.
The code will continue to iterate until it finds a year that meets these conditions.
