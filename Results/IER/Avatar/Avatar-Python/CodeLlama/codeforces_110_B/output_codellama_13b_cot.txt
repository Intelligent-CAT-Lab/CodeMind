  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports several modules from the Python standard library, including collections, functools, heapq, bisect, math, and threading.
It then defines two functions: solution and main.
The solution function takes no arguments and prints the string "abcd" repeated n/4 times, where n is the input integer, followed by the string "abc" with the last character removed.
The main function takes no arguments and sets the recursion limit to 1 << 30 and the thread stack size to 1 << 27. It then creates a new thread and starts it.
The thread runs the solution function.
<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will be the string "abcd" repeated 100/4 times, followed by the string "abc" with the last character removed.
