<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user and stores it in the variable s.
The code then initializes two variables num_0 and num_1 to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over the length of the input string s.
For each character in the input string, the code checks if it is equal to "0". If it is, it increments the variable num_0 by 1. If it is not, it increments the variable num_1 by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the minimum of num_0 and num_1 multiplied by 2.
<<<Output>>>
0
