  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module and defines a function called input that reads a line from standard input and removes the trailing newline character.
It then sets the recursion limit to 10^9.
The code then defines three functions: pin, tupin, and lispin. These functions take an optional argument called type, which is an integer by default. They return a map object that maps the input to the type function.
The code then imports the Counter class from the collections module and defines a function called resolve. This function takes no arguments and reads a line from standard input. It then creates a Counter object called c that counts the occurrences of each character in the input string.
The code then prints the result of the expression (c[" g "] - c[" p "]) // 2.
