  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the math module.
The variables a, b, h, and m are initialized to 1, 2, 9, and 49, respectively.
The code then calculates the angle theta_h and theta_m using the formulae provided.
The code then calculates the x and y coordinates of the points using the trigonometric functions.
The code then calculates the distance between the two points using the Pythagorean theorem.
The code finally prints the distance.
