  <<<Analysis>>>
The code defines two functions: ok and dfs.
The function ok takes a string of length 4 as input and returns a boolean indicating whether the string meets the condition.
The function dfs takes two inputs: an integer cur and a string last3. It returns an integer.
The code then reads an integer n from standard input and initializes a list memo of length n+1.
The code then calls the function dfs with cur=0 and last3='TTT'.
<<<Output>>>
The output of the code is 1000000007.
