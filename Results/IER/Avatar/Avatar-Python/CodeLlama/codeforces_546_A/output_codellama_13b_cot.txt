  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three inputs: k, n, and w.
The variable k is initialized to 1000, variable n is initialized to 1000000000, and variable w is initialized to 1000.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to w (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 1000.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of k multiplied by i and stores it in sum.
The code checks if sum is less than or equal to n. If it is, it prints 0. Otherwise, it prints the difference between sum and n.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum, which is 1000000000.
