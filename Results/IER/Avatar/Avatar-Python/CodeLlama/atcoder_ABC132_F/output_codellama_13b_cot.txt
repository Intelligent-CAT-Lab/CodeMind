  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first initializes the variable mod to 10^9 + 7, which is a large prime number used for modular arithmetic.
The code then takes input n and k from the user, where n is the number of elements in the array and k is the number of operations to perform.
The code then initializes an empty list coef, which will be used to store the coefficients of the polynomial.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to the square root of n (inclusive), which is 3 in this case.
For each i in this range, the code calculates the coefficient of the polynomial using the formula (n/i) - (n/(i+1)).
The code then appends the calculated coefficient to the coef list.
The code then adds 1 to the coef list to account for the constant term.
The code then reverses the coef list using slicing.
The code then initializes a 2D list dp with k+1 rows and nn columns, where nn is the length of the coef list.
The code then initializes the first row of dp to 1.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to k (inclusive).
For each i in this range, the code enters a loop that iterates from nn-1 to 0 (inclusive).
For each j in this range, the code calculates the value of the polynomial at position j using the formula coef[j] * tmp, where tmp is the sum of the values of the polynomial at positions j-1 to 0.
The code then updates the value of dp[i][j] with the calculated value.
The code then prints the sum of the values of the polynomial at the last position of dp, which is the final answer.
