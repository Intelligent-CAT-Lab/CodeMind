<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input n from the user.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to n.
For each number i in this range, it converts it to a string s and checks if the length of s is odd.
If it is, it increments the variable cnt by 1.
The loop finishes and the code prints the final value of cnt.

<<<Output>>>
5000
