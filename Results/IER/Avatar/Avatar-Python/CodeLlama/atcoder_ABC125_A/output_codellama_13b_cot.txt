<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in three integers A, B, and T as input.
The variable ans is initialized to the result of the expression (T // A) * B.
The expression (T // A) calculates the integer division of T by A, and then multiplies the result by B.
The code then prints the value of ans.

In this case, the input is 20, 20, and 19, respectively.
The expression (19 // 20) * 20 evaluates to 0, so the output is 0.
