  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs from the user, separated by a space.
The first input is assigned to variable a, and the second input is assigned to variable b.
The code then reverses the string in variable b using the slicing operator [: : -1].
The reversed string is then converted to an integer using the int() function.
The code then prints the sum of the two integers, which is the result of adding the integer representation of variable a to the integer representation of variable b.
<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will be the sum of the two integers, which is the result of adding the integer representation of variable a to the integer representation of variable b.
