  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes in four integers as input, which are stored in the variables anti, b, c, and d.
The code calculates the absolute difference between anti and c, and stores it in l.
The code calculates the absolute difference between b and d, and stores it in m.
The code checks if anti is equal to c, and if so, it prints the values of anti, b, c, and d with the difference between them added to each value.
The code checks if b is equal to d, and if so, it prints the values of anti, b, c, and d with the difference between them added to each value.
The code checks if l is not equal to m, and if so, it prints -1.
The code prints the values of anti, d, c, and b if none of the above conditions are met.
