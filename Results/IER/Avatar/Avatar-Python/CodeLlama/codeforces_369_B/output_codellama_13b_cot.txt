  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the math module.
The variable arr is initialized to a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string on spaces.
The variable rem is initialized to 0, which will be used to store the remainder.
The variable ones is initialized to 0, which will be used to store the number of ones in the input.
The variable string is initialized to an empty list, which will be used to store the output.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to arr[1], which is 1 in this case.
For each iteration, the code appends the result of the floor division of arr[-1] by arr[1] to string, along with a 1 if ones is greater than 0.
The code then subtracts 1 from ones.
If arr[0] is not equal to arr[1], the code enters another loop that iterates from arr[1] to arr[0].
For each iteration, the code appends the result of the floor division of rem by (arr[0] - arr[1]) to string, along with a 1 if ones is greater than 0.
The code then subtracts 1 from ones.
Finally, the code prints the contents of string, separated by spaces.
