  <<<Analysis>>>
The code defines two functions, GCD and LCM. GCD takes two integers a and b and returns their greatest common divisor. LCM takes two integers a and b and returns their least common multiple.
The code then takes input from the user and splits it into four integers x, y, a, and b.
The code then calculates the least common multiple of x and y using the LCM function.
The code then calculates the number of multiples of the least common multiple that are between a and b, inclusive.
The code then prints this number.

<<<Output>>>
1000000000
