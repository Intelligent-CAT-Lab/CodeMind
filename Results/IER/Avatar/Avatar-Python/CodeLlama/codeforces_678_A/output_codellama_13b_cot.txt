<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs, vamshi and z, from the user.
vamshi is an integer, and z is also an integer.
The code then calculates the result of the expression (vamshi // z + 1) * z.
The // operator is the integer division operator, which returns the integer part of the result.
The + 1 is added to the result of the integer division to ensure that the result is always greater than or equal to the input.
The final result is then multiplied by z to get the final output.
<<<Output>>>
1000000000
