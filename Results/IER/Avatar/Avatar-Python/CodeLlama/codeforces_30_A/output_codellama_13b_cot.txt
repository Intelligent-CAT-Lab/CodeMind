  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first splits the input into a list of integers using the split() method with a space as the delimiter.
The list is then assigned to the variable M.
The code then extracts the first element of the list, which is 7, and assigns it to the variable a.
The code then extracts the second element of the list, which is 896, and assigns it to the variable b.
The code then extracts the third element of the list, which is 7, and assigns it to the variable n.
The code then checks if a is not equal to 0.
If a is not equal to 0, the code checks if b is divisible by a.
If b is divisible by a, the code divides b by a and assigns the result to b.
The code then initializes x and y to 0 and -2000, respectively.
The code then checks if b is greater than or equal to 0.
If b is greater than or equal to 0, the code enters a while loop that iterates until y is greater than or equal to b.
During each iteration, the code calculates y = x^n and increments x by 1.
If y is greater than b, the code prints "No solution".
If y is less than or equal to b, the code prints x - 1.
If b is less than 0, the code checks if n is odd.
If n is odd, the code prints "No solution".
If n is even, the code initializes x to -1 and y to 2000.
The code then enters a while loop that iterates until y is less than or equal to b.
During each iteration, the code calculates y = x^n and decrements x by 1.
If y is less than b, the code prints "No solution".
If y is greater than or equal to b, the code prints x + 1.
If a is equal to 0, the code checks if b is equal to 0.
If b is equal to 0, the code prints 5.
If b is not equal to 0, the code prints "No solution".
<<<Output>>>
No solution
