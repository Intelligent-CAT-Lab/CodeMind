  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the math module, which provides mathematical functions.
The variable N is initialized to the input value, which is 9552 in this case.
The function hoge is defined, which takes an integer n as input and returns True if n is a prime number, and False otherwise.
The function hoge first checks if n is equal to 2, and returns True if it is.
If n is not equal to 2, the function enters a loop that iterates from 2 to the square root of n (rounded up to the nearest integer).
For each integer x in this range, the function checks if n is divisible by x. If it is, the function returns False.
If the loop completes without finding a divisor, the function returns True.
The while loop continues to execute until the function hoge returns True for the input value N.
When this happens, the function prints the value of N and exits the program.
