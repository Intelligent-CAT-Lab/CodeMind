  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input from the user and stores it in a variable s.
The variable my_str is initialized to a single space character.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each character in the string s.
For each character c in s, the code checks if c is either '0' or '1'. If it is, it appends c to the end of my_str.
If c is not '0' or '1', the code checks if c is 'B' and if the length of my_str is not 0. If both conditions are met, the code removes the last character from my_str.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of my_str.
