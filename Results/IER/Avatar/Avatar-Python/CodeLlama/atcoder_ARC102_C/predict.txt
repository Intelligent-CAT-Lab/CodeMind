The output of the code will be a list of 2*K-1 integers, each representing the value of X[i] for a given i.
Since the input is 1 200000, K is 1 and N is 200000.
The modulus is 998244353.
The function inved is used to calculate the inverse of a number modulo the modulus.
The code calculates the values of frac[i] and invf[i] using the formulae provided.
The code calculates the values of S using the formula provided.
The code updates the values of X[k-2] and X[2*K-k] using the formula provided.
The code prints the values of X[i] for all i from 0 to 2*K-1.
