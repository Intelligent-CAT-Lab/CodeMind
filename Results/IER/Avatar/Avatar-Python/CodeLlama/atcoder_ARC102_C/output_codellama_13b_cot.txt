  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes in two inputs, K and N, and initializes the modulus to 998244353.
The function inved is defined, which is used to calculate the inverse of a number modulo the modulus.
The code then initializes two lists, X and frac, with 0 and 1, respectively.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N + K, and calculates the value of frac[i] using the formula (i+1)*frac[i-1] mod mod.
The code then enters another loop that iterates from 1 to N + K + 1, and calculates the value of invf[i] using the formula inved(frac[i]).
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to K + 2, and calculates the value of S using the formula (sign * (frac[l] * frac[N + K - 2 * m - 1]) * invf[m] * invf[l - m] * invf[N - 2 * m] * invf[K - 1]) mod mod.
The code then updates the values of X[k-2] and X[2*K-k] using the formula S.
The code then prints the values of X[i] for all i from 0 to 2*K-1.
<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will be a list of 2*K-1 integers, each representing the value of X[i] for a given i.
Since the input is 1 200000, K is 1 and N is 200000.
The modulus is 998244353.
