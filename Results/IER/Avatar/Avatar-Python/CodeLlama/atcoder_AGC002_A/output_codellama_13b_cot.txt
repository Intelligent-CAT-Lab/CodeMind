  <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, a and b, and splits them into separate variables.
The code then checks if a is less than or equal to 0 and if 0 is less than or equal to b. If both conditions are true, the code prints "Zero".
If a is less than 0 and the difference between b and a is even, the code prints "Negative".
Otherwise, the code prints "Positive".

In this case, the input is -1000000000 -1.
The code will first check if -1000000000 is less than or equal to 0, which is true.
It will then check if 0 is less than or equal to -1, which is also true.
Therefore, the code will print "Zero".

<<<Output>>>
Zero
