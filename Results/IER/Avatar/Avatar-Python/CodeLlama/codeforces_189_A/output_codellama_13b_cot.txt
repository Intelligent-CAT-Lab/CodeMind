  <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes the input as a string and splits it into a list of integers using the split() method.
The list is then sorted in ascending order using the sorted() method.
The code then checks if the length of the ribbon is divisible by the first element of the sorted list.
If it is, the code prints the result of dividing the length of the ribbon by the first element of the sorted list.
If it is not, the code checks if the first two elements of the sorted list are equal.
If they are, the code iterates through the range of possible values of the third element of the sorted list and checks if the length of the ribbon minus the product of the third element and the current value of the third element is divisible by the first element of the sorted list.
If it is, the code prints the maximum value of the current value of the third element and the current value of the first element of the sorted list.
If it is not, the code iterates through the range of possible values of the third element of the sorted list and checks if the length of the ribbon minus the product of the third element and the current value of the third element is divisible by the first element of the sorted list.
If it is, the code prints the maximum value of the current value of the third element and the current value of the first element of the sorted list.
If it is not, the code prints 0.
