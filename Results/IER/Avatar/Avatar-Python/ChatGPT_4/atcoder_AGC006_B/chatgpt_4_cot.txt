<<<Analysis>>>
The variables N and x are initialized to 2 and 1, respectively.
The code checks if x is equal to 1 or 2*N - 1, which would be 3 in this case. Since x is 1, the condition is true.
Therefore, the code prints "No" and does not execute the else block.
Since the condition is met and "No" is printed, the rest of the code inside the else block is not executed.
<<<Output>>>
No
