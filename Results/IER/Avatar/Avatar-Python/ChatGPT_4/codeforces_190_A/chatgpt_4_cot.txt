<<<Analysis>>>
The variables n and m are initialized to 59 and 96, respectively.
The first if condition checks if n is less than 1, which is not the case here, so it is skipped.
The second if condition checks if m is greater than n, which is true (96 > 59).
Since m is greater than n, the code sets min to m (96) and max to n + m - 1, which is 59 + 96 - 1 = 154.
The code then prints the values of min and max, which are 96 and 154, respectively.
The subsequent if conditions are not evaluated because the first condition that was true has already been executed and the program has printed the output.
<<<Output>>>
96 154
