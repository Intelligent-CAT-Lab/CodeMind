<<<Analysis>>>
The input is split by the character ' ▁ ' and converted to integers, initializing the list M with the values [7, 896, 7].
The variables a, b, and n are assigned the values 7, 896, and 7, respectively.
The first if condition checks if a is not equal to 0, which is true (a is 7).
The second if condition checks if b modulo a is not equal to 0. Since 896 % 7 is 0, the condition is false, and the else block is executed.
b is then divided by a, resulting in b becoming 128 (896 // 7).
The variables x and y are initialized to 0 and -2000, respectively.
Since b is greater than or equal to 0, the code enters the first inner if block.
A while loop is executed to find the smallest x such that y (which is x to the power of n) is not less than b.
The loop continues until y is not less than b (128). Since n is 7, the loop is looking for the smallest integer x such that x^7 is at least 128.
The loop finds that when x is 2, y becomes 128 (2^7 = 128), which is equal to b.
Since y is not greater than b, the condition y > b is false, and the else block is executed.
The program prints x - 1, which is 2 - 1, resulting in 1.
