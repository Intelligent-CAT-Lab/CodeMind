The variable N is initialized to 9.
The function dsum(x) is defined to calculate the sum of the digits of a given number x.
The variable ans is initialized to infinity (INF), which will be used to find the minimum sum of digits.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 8.
For each number a in this range, it calculates the corresponding b such that a + b = N, which in this case is b = 9 - a.
For each pair (a, b), the code calculates the sum of digits of a and b using the dsum function and updates ans with the minimum of the current ans and the sum of the digits of a and b.
The loop will consider the following pairs and their digit sums:
- a=1, b=8: dsum(a) + dsum(b) = 1 + 8 = 9
- a=2, b=7: dsum(a) + dsum(b) = 2 + 7 = 9
- a=3, b=6: dsum(a) + dsum(b) = 3 + 6 = 9
- a=4, b=5: dsum(a) + dsum(b) = 4 + 5 = 9
- a=5, b=4: dsum(a) + dsum(b) = 5 + 4 = 9
- a=6, b=3: dsum(a) + dsum(b) = 6 + 3 = 9
- a=7, b=2: dsum(a) + dsum(b) = 7 + 2 = 9
- a=8, b=1: dsum(a) + dsum(b) = 8 + 1 = 9
Since all pairs give the same digit sum of 9, ans will be updated to 9 on the first iteration and will remain unchanged.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is 9.
