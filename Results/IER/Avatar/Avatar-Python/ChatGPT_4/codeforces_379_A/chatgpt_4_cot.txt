The variables a and b are initialized to 80 and 970, respectively.
The variable x is set to the value of a, which is 80.
The variables h and s are initialized to 0.

The first while loop will decrement x until it reaches 0, and for each decrement, it increments both h and s by 1. Since x starts at 80, both h and s will be 80 after this loop.

The second while loop is supposed to run as long as s divided by b is not equal to 0. However, since s is 80 and b is 970, s is less than b, and s // b will be 0 from the start. This means the second while loop will not execute at all.

After the loops, the code prints the value of h, which is 80.

<<<Output>>>
80
