<<<Analysis>>>
The variable stdin is initialized with the input string 'BBA'.
The variable s is assigned the value of stdin, which is 'BBA'.
The variable result is assigned "Yes" if both "A" and "B" are present in the string s, otherwise it is assigned "No".
Since both "A" and "B" are present in the string 'BBA', the condition ("A" in s and "B" in s) evaluates to True.
Therefore, result is assigned the value "Yes".
Finally, the value of result, which is "Yes", is printed.
<<<Output>>>
Yes
