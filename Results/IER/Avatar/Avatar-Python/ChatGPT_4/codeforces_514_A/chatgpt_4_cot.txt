<<<Analysis>>>
The variable ip is initialized with the string "5728".
The variable st is initialized with a single space " ".
The length of ip is not 1, so the code proceeds to the next condition.
The first character of ip is not "9", so the code skips the inner if block.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each character in ip.
For the first character '5', since 5 is greater than 4, it calculates 9 - 5, which is 4, and appends it to st, resulting in st = " 4".
For the second character '7', since 7 is greater than 4, it calculates 9 - 7, which is 2, and appends it to st, resulting in st = " 42".
For the third character '2', since 2 is not greater than 4, it appends '2' to st, resulting in st = " 422".
For the fourth character '8', since 8 is greater than 4, it calculates 9 - 8, which is 1, and appends it to st, resulting in st = " 4221".
The loop ends, and the code prints the integer value of st, which is 4221, after converting it from a string.
<<<Output>>>
4221
