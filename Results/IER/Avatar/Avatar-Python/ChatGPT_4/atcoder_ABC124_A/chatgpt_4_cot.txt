<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a and b are initialized to 6 and 6, respectively.
The variable c is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of the maximum values of a and b.
The code then enters a loop that iterates 2 times.
In the first iteration:
- The maximum of a and b (which are both 6) is added to c, so c becomes 6.
- Since a is equal to b, a is decreased by 1, so a becomes 5 and b remains 6.
In the second iteration:
- The maximum of a and b is now b (6), so another 6 is added to c, making c become 12.
- Since a is less than b, b is decreased by 1, so b becomes 5.
The loop ends as it was only meant to iterate 2 times.
The code prints the final value of c, which is 12.
<<<Output>>>
12
