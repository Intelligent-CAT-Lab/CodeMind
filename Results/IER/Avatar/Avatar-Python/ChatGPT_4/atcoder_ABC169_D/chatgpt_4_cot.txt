The variable x is initialized to 366735600000.
The function factorization is defined to factorize the given number n into its prime factors and their respective counts.
The function is called with x as the argument, and the result is stored in the variable l.
The factorization of 366735600000 is calculated as follows:
- The prime factor 2 appears 5 times (since 2^5 = 32 is a factor of 366735600000, and 366735600000 / 32 = 11460550000, which is not divisible by 2).
- The prime factor 3 appears 3 times (since 3^3 = 27 is a factor of 11460550000, and 11460550000 / 27 = 424834074, which is not divisible by 3).
- The prime factor 5 appears 5 times (since 5^5 = 3125 is a factor of 424834074, and 424834074 / 3125 = 135947, which is not divisible by 5).
- The prime factor 7 appears 2 times (since 7^2 = 49 is a factor of 135947, and 135947 / 49 = 2774, which is not divisible by 7).
- The prime factor 2774 appears 1 time (since it is the remaining number and is not divisible by any other prime number).

So, the factorization result is [[2, 5], [3, 3], [5, 5], [7, 2], [2774, 1]].
The list l is sorted, but since it is already sorted by the prime factors, it remains the same.
The variable ans is initialized to 0.
The code then enters a loop to calculate a certain sum for each prime factor based on its count.
For the prime factor 2 with count 5, the sum of the sequence 1+2+3+... that equals 5 is 1+2=3 (since 1+2+3=6 which is greater than 5).
For the prime factor 3 with count 3, the sum of the sequence 1+2+3+... that equals 3 is 1+2=3.
For the prime factor 5 with count 5, the sum of the sequence 1+2+3+... that equals 5 is 1+2=3 (since 1+2+3=6 which is greater than 5).
For the prime factor 7 with count 2, the sum of the sequence 1+2+3+... that equals 2 is 1 (since 1+2=3 which is greater than 2).
For the prime factor 2774 with count 1, the sum of the sequence 1+2+3+... that equals 1 is 1.
The variable ans accumulates the sum of these values: ans = 3 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 11.
Finally, the code prints the value of ans, which is 11.
