<<<Analysis>>>
The variables A and B are initialized to 75 and 25, respectively.
The variable ans is calculated as A - 2 * B, which is 75 - 2 * 25 = 75 - 50 = 25.
The if statement checks if ans is less than 0, which it is not, so the value of ans remains unchanged.
The code prints the value of ans, which is 25.
<<<Output>>>
25
