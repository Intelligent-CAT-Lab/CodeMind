The variables a, b, c, and d are initialized with the values 418379342, 802780784, -790013317, and -445130206, respectively.
The code calculates the products of a*c, a*d, b*c, and b*d, which are:
- a * c = 418379342 * (-790013317) = -330474555780726174
- a * d = 418379342 * (-445130206) = -186208273599957172
- b * c = 802780784 * (-790013317) = -634226203593258848
- b * d = 802780784 * (-445130206) = -357400433324012224

Since all the products are negative, the maximum value will be the one with the smallest absolute value, which is the product of a and d.
Therefore, the maximum value (ans) is -186208273599957172.

<<<Output>>>
-186208273599957172
