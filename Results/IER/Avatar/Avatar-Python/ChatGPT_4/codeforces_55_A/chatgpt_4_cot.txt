<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 512.
The code enters a while loop that continues to execute as long as n is even (n % 2 == 0).
Inside the loop, n is divided by 2. This process will continue until n becomes odd.
For the input 512, the loop will run as follows:
- First iteration: n = 512 / 2 = 256
- Second iteration: n = 256 / 2 = 128
- Third iteration: n = 128 / 2 = 64
- Fourth iteration: n = 64 / 2 = 32
- Fifth iteration: n = 32 / 2 = 16
- Sixth iteration: n = 16 / 2 = 8
- Seventh iteration: n = 8 / 2 = 4
- Eighth iteration: n = 4 / 2 = 2
- Ninth iteration: n = 2 / 2 = 1
After the ninth iteration, n becomes 1, which is odd, so the loop stops.
The code then checks if n is equal to 1, which it is.
Since n is equal to 1, the code prints ' YES '.
<<<Output>>>
 YES
