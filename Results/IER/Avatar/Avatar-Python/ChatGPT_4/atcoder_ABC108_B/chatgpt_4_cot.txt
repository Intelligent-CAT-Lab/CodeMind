<<<Analysis>>>
The variables x1, y1, x2, and y2 are initialized to 2, 3, 6, and 6, respectively.
The variable a is calculated as x2 - x1, which is 6 - 2, resulting in 4.
The variable b is calculated as y2 - y1, which is 6 - 3, resulting in 3.
The code then prints the following values in order:
- x2 - b, which is 6 - 3, resulting in 3.
- y2 + a, which is 6 + 4, resulting in 10.
- x1 - b, which is 2 - 3, resulting in -1.
- y1 + a, which is 3 + 4, resulting in 7.
These values represent the coordinates of the third and fourth corners of a rectangle, given the coordinates of the first two corners (x1, y1) and (x2, y2).
