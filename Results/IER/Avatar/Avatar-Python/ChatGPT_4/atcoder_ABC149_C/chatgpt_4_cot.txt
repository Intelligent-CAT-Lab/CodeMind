The variable N is initialized to 9552.
The function hoge(n) is defined to determine if a number n is prime.
The function first checks if n is 2, which is a prime number, and returns True if it is.
If n is not 2, it then checks for divisibility of n by any number from 2 up to the square root of n (inclusive). If any such divisor is found, the function returns False, indicating n is not prime.
If no divisors are found, the function returns True, indicating n is prime.
The while loop starts and will continue indefinitely until a prime number is found.
The loop calls hoge(N) to check if N is prime. If N is not prime, N is incremented by 1 and the loop continues.
If N is prime, the loop prints N and exits.
The first prime number greater than or equal to 9552 is 9553, which is the next immediate number.
Therefore, the output will be 9553, as it is the first prime number encountered by the loop starting from 9552.

9553
