<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a, b, c, and d are initialized to 0, 50, 50, and 100, respectively.
The code calculates the maximum of 0 and the result of the expression min(b, d) - max(a, c).
min(b, d) is the minimum of 50 and 100, which is 50.
max(a, c) is the maximum of 0 and 50, which is 50.
The result of min(b, d) - max(a, c) is 50 - 50, which is 0.
Since the maximum of 0 and 0 is 0, the code will print 0.
<<<Output>>>
