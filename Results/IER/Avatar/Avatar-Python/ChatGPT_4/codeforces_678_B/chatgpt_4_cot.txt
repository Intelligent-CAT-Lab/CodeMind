<<<Analysis>>>
The variable y is initialized to 2096.
The variable is_run is set to the result of calendar.isleap(y), which checks if the year 2096 is a leap year. Since 2096 is divisible by 4 and not by 100 (or divisible by 400), it is indeed a leap year, so is_run is True.
The variable week is set to the result of calendar.weekday(y, 1, 1), which returns the day of the week for January 1st, 2096. January 1st, 2096 is a Monday, so week is 0 (where Monday is 0, Tuesday is 1, ..., Sunday is 6).
The code enters an infinite loop, incrementing y by 1 each iteration, checking for the next year that is a leap year and has January 1st on the same day of the week as the year 2096.
The year 2104 is the next leap year after 2096, and January 1st, 2104 is also a Monday. Therefore, the conditions are met, and the loop breaks.
The code prints the year 2104 and exits.
<<<Output>>>
2104
