<<<Analysis>>>
The input string '814793613347395 1.99' is split into two parts: '814793613347395' and '1.99'.
The variable 'a' is assigned the first part as a string, and 'b' is assigned the second part as a string.
The string 'b' is then modified to remove the decimal point, resulting in '199'.
Both 'a' and 'b' are converted to integers.
The integer value of 'a' is 814793613347395, and the integer value of 'b' is 199.
The code then calculates the product of 'a' and 'b', which is 814793613347395 * 199.
The result of the multiplication is then divided by 100 using integer division (//), which effectively shifts the decimal point two places to the left.
The final result of the calculation is printed.
