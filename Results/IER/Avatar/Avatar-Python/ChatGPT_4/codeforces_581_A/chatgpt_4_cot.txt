<<<Analysis>>>
The input string "45 99" is split into a list of strings ['45', '99'].
The for loop converts each string in the list to an integer, resulting in the list x = [45, 99].
The variables a and b are assigned the values 45 and 99, respectively.
The min function is called on the list x, which returns 45, the smallest value in the list.
The print function prints 45 followed by a space and an underscore "▁" without a newline due to the end parameter.
The if statement checks if the absolute difference between a and b is greater than or equal to 2, which is true (abs(45 - 99) = 54).
Since the condition is true, it calculates the integer division of the absolute difference by 2, which is 54 // 2 = 27.
The print function then prints 27.
<<<Output>>>
45 ▁ 27
