<<<Analysis>>>
The variables anti, b, c, and d are initialized to 4, 0, 0, and 4, respectively.
The variables l and m are calculated as the absolute differences between anti and c, and b and d, respectively. So, l = abs(4 - 0) = 4 and m = abs(0 - 4) = 4.
The code then checks if anti equals c, which is not the case (4 != 0).
Next, it checks if b equals d, which is also not the case (0 != 4).
Then, it checks if l is not equal to m. Since l equals m (both are 4), it does not print -1.
Since none of the above conditions are met, the code executes the last line: print(anti, d, c, b).
This prints the values of anti, d, c, and b, which are 4, 4, 0, and 0, respectively.
<<<Output>>>
4 4 0 0
