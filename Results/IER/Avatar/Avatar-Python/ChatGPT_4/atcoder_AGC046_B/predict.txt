The variables A, B, C, and D are initialized to 2, 1, 3, and 4, respectively.
The variable m is set to 998244353, which is a large prime number often used in modular arithmetic to avoid overflow in competitive programming.
A 2D list 'd' is created with dimensions (C+1) x (D+1), which is (3+1) x (4+1) = 4 x 5. All elements are initialized to 0.
The element at position (A, B) in the list 'd', which is (2, 1), is set to 1.
The code then enters a nested loop that iterates over the range from A to C (inclusive) for the outer loop and from B to D (inclusive) for the inner loop. This means it will consider the range from 2 to 3 for i and from 1 to 4 for j.
For each pair (i, j), the code updates the value of d[i][j] using the formula provided, which involves the values to the left (d[i][j-1]), above (d[i-1][j]), and diagonally above to the left (d[i-1][j-1]), multiplied by the current indices i and j, and then taking the modulo m.
The formula is: d[i][j] += (d[i][j-1] * i + d[i-1][j] * j - d[i-1][j-1] * (i-1) * (j-1)) % m
After the loops finish, the code prints the final value of d[C][D], which is d[3][4].

Let's calculate the values step by step:
- d[2][1] is already set to 1.
- For i = 2 and j = 2:
  d[2][2] = (d[2][1] * 2 + d[1][2] * 2 - d[1][1] * 1 * 1) % m
           = (1 * 2 + 0 * 2 - 0 * 1 * 1) % m
           = 2 % m
           = 2
- For i = 2 and j = 3:
  d[2][3] = (d[2][2] * 2 + d[1][3] * 2 - d[1][2] * 1 * 1) % m
           = (2 * 2 + 0 * 2 - 0 * 1 * 1) % m
           = 4 % m
           = 4
- For i = 2 and j = 4:
  d[2][4] = (d[2][3] * 2 + d[1][4] * 2 - d[1][3] * 1 * 1) % m
           = (4 * 2 + 0 * 2 - 0 * 1 * 1) % m
           = 8 % m
           = 8
- For i = 3 and j = 1:
  d[3][1] = (d[3][0] * 3 + d[2][1] * 1 - d[2][0] * 2 * 0) % m
           = (0 * 3 + 1 * 1 - 0 * 2 * 0) % m
           = 1 % m
           = 1
- For i = 3 and j = 2:
  d[3][2] = (d[3][1] * 3 + d[2][2] * 2 - d[2][1] * 2 * 1) % m
           = (1 * 3 + 2 * 2 - 1 * 2 * 1) % m
           = (3 + 4 - 2) % m
           = 5 % m
           = 5
- For i = 3 and j = 3:
  d[3][3] = (d[3][2] * 3 + d[2][3] * 3 - d[2][2] * 2 * 2) % m
           = (5 * 3 + 4 * 3 - 2 * 2 * 2) % m
           = (15 + 12 - 8) % m
           = 19 % m
           = 19
- For i = 3 and j = 4:
  d[
