<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 9.
The variable x is initialized to 1, which will be used to count the number of iterations.
The code enters a while loop that continues as long as the base-2 logarithm of n is not an integer.
In the first iteration, math.log2(9) is approximately 3.1699, which is not an integer, so the loop continues.
The largest power of 2 less than 9 is 2^3 = 8, so n is updated to n - 2^3 = 9 - 8 = 1.
x is incremented by 1, so x becomes 2.
In the second iteration, math.log2(1) is 0, which is an integer, so the loop terminates.
The code prints the final value of x, which is 2.
