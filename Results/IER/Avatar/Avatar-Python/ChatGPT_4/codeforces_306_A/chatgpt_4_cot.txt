<<<Analysis>>>
The variables n and m are initialized to 87 and 34, respectively.
The variable q is calculated as the integer division of n by m, which is 87 // 34, resulting in 2.
The variable r is calculated as the remainder of the division of n by m, which is 87 % 34, resulting in 19.
An array a is created with m elements, all initialized to the value of q, which is 2. So a = [2, 2, 2, ..., 2] (34 times).
The code then enters a loop that iterates r times, which is 19 times. In each iteration, it increments the ith element of array a by 1. This means the first 19 elements of a will be incremented to 3.
After the loop, the array a will look like this: [3, 3, 3, ..., 3, 2, 2, ..., 2] (19 threes and 15 twos).
Finally, the code prints each element of array a followed by a space and a special character '▁'. The output will be 19 threes followed by a space and '▁', and then 15 twos followed by a space and '▁'.
