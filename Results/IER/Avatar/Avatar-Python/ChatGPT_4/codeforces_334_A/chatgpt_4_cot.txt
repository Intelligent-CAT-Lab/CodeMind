<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 6.
The variables i and j are initialized to 1 and 36 (6 * 6), respectively.
The code enters a while loop that will continue as long as i is less than j.
During each iteration of the loop, it prints the current values of i and j, then increments i by 1 and decrements j by 1.
The loop will continue until i is no longer less than j, which will happen after the 17th iteration when i is 18 and j is 19.
The pairs of numbers printed will be (1, 36), (2, 35), (3, 34), ..., (17, 20).
After the 17th iteration, i will be 18 and j will be 19, so the condition i < j will no longer be true, and the loop will terminate.
The code will not print the pair (18, 19) because the condition i < j is not met.
