<<<Analysis>>>
The input is a list of six integers, all of which are 1. This list is stored in the variable `arr`.

The variable `rem` is initialized to 0, and `ones` is initialized to 0 as well. A list named `string` is also initialized to store the output values.

The value of `ones` is updated to be the remainder of the last element of `arr` divided by the second last element, which in this case is `1 % 1`, resulting in `ones` being 0.

A for loop is then executed with a range from 0 to the second last element of `arr` (which is 1). Inside the loop, the floor division of the last element by the second last element is calculated, which is `1 // 1` resulting in 1. Since `ones` is 0, `(ones > 0)` evaluates to False, which is equivalent to 0. Therefore, `1 + 0` is appended to the `string` list. The value of `ones` is then decremented by 1, but since it's already 0, it remains 0.

The condition `if not arr[0] == arr[1]` checks if the first and second elements of `arr` are not equal. Since they are equal (both are 1), the code inside this block is not executed.

Finally, the for loop at the end iterates over the `string` list and prints each element followed by a space and the character "▁". Since `string` contains only one element, which is 1, the output will be "1 ▁".
