<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function `main` which reads two integers `S` and `W` from the input.
It then checks if `S` is less than or equal to `W`.
If `S` is less than or equal to `W`, it prints " unsafe ".
Otherwise, it prints " safe ".
The `if __name__ == '__main__':` block is intended to call the `main` function when the script is run directly. However, there is a typo in the code: `' _ _ main _ _ '` should be `'__main__'`.
Since the code is being executed as if it were running directly, we will assume that the `main` function is called despite the typo.
Given the input `1 100`, `S` is 1 and `W` is 100.
Since `S` (1) is less than `W` (100), the condition `(S <= W)` is True.
Therefore, the code will print " unsafe ".
