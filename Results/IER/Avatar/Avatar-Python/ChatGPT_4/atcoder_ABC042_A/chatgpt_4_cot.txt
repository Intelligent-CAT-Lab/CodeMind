<<<Analysis>>>
The input '5 5 7' is split into three integers and stored in the tuple ABC.
The code checks if the number 5 appears exactly twice in the tuple ABC.
Since the input contains two 5s, the condition ABC.count(5) == 2 is True.
Next, the code checks if the sum of the numbers in the tuple ABC is equal to 17.
The sum of the numbers in the tuple (5, 5, 7) is 17.
Since both conditions are met, the code prints 'YES'.
<<<Output>>>
YES
