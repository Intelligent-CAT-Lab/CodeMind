The function cutRibbon is defined and then called without any arguments. It takes its input from the standard input.

The input `29 27 18 2` is read and split into an array of integers: arr = [29, 27, 18, 2].

The variable 'length' is assigned the first element of the array, which is 29.

The rest of the array is sorted in non-decreasing order to get arr = [2, 18, 27].

The code first checks if the length of the ribbon (29) is divisible by the smallest piece size (2). Since 29 is not divisible by 2, it does not print and return at this point.

The code then checks if the smallest and the second smallest piece sizes are equal, which they are not (2 != 18), so it skips the first conditional block and moves to the else block.

In the else block, two nested loops are used to try different combinations of cutting the ribbon into pieces of size arr[2] (27) and arr[1] (18), while the remainder of the length should be divisible by arr[0] (2).

The outer loop variable 'i' represents how many pieces of size 27 can be cut from the ribbon. It goes from 0 to int(29/27) + 1, which is 0 to 2.

The inner loop variable 'j' represents how many pieces of size 18 can be cut from the ribbon. It goes from 0 to int(29/18) + 1, which is 0 to 2.

For each combination of i and j, the code calculates 'check', which is the remaining length of the ribbon after cutting i pieces of 27 and j pieces of 18.

If 'check' is non-negative and divisible by 2, the code calculates 'k', which is the number of pieces of size 2 that can be cut from the remaining length.

The code keeps track of the maximum number of total pieces 'ans' that can be cut from the ribbon.

After trying all combinations, the maximum number 'ans' is printed.

Let's calculate the combinations:
- For i = 0, j = 0: check = 29 - 0*27 - 0*18 = 29 (not divisible by 2)
- For i = 0, j = 1: check = 29 - 0*27 - 1*18 = 11 (not divisible by 2)
- For i = 0, j = 2: check = 29 - 0*27 - 2*18 = -7 (negative, invalid)
- For i = 1, j = 0: check = 29 - 1*27 - 0*18 = 2 (divisible by 2, k = 1)
- For i = 1, j = 1: check = 29 - 1*27 - 1*18 = -16 (negative, invalid)
- For i = 2, j = 0: check = 29 - 2*27 - 0*18 = -25 (negative, invalid)

The only valid combination is i = 1, j = 0, which gives us k = 1. So the maximum number of pieces 'ans' is 1 (from size 27) + 1 (from size 2) = 2.

Therefore, the output will be 2.
