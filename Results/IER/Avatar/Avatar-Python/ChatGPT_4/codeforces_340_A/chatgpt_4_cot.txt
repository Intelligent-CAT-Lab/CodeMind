The input string `1 1 1 1000000000` is split into a list of strings using the ' ‚ñÅ ' delimiter. The resulting list is `['1', '1', '1', '1000000000']`.
The variables x, y, a, and b are initialized to 1, 1, 1, and 1000000000, respectively, by converting each string in the list to an integer.
The function GCD is defined to calculate the greatest common divisor of two numbers a and b using the Euclidean algorithm.
The function LCM is defined to calculate the least common multiple of two numbers a and b using the formula lcm(a, b) = a * b // GCD(a, b).
The lcm of x and y is calculated using the LCM function, which in this case is LCM(1, 1) = 1 * 1 // GCD(1, 1) = 1.
The final print statement calculates the number of multiples of lcm between a and b (inclusive). Since lcm is 1, it's essentially counting the numbers from a to b.
The calculation is b // lcm - (a - 1) // lcm, which simplifies to 1000000000 // 1 - (1 - 1) // 1 = 1000000000 - 0 = 1000000000.
Therefore, the output will be 1000000000.
