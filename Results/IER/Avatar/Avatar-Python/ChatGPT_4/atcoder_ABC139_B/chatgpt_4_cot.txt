<<<Analysis>>>
The variables t and h are initialized to 8 and 8, respectively.
The expression `(h - 2) // (t - 1)` calculates the integer division of `6` (which is `8 - 2`) by `7` (which is `8 - 1`).
The result of the integer division `6 // 7` is `0` because integer division returns the floor of the division.
Then `1` is added to the result, so the final result is `0 + 1`.
The code prints the final result, which is `1`.
