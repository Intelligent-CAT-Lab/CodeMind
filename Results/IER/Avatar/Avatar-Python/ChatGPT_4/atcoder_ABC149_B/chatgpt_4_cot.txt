<<<Analysis>>>
The input string "1000000000000 1000000000000 1000000000000" is split into three integers a, b, and k, each with the value 1000000000000.
The variable res is calculated as a - k, which is 1000000000000 - 1000000000000, resulting in 0.
Since res is not less than 0, the if condition is not satisfied, and the else block is executed.
In the else block, a is set to the value of res, which is 0.
The print statement outputs the values of a and b, which are 0 and 1000000000000, respectively.
<<<Output>>>
