<<<Analysis>>>
The variables N, A, and B are initialized to 501719768609305159, 370614275896614890, and 131105492712690269, respectively.
The variable ans is calculated by dividing N by the sum of A and B, and then multiplying the result by A. This effectively calculates how many full cycles of A+B fit into N and then multiplies the number of cycles by A to get the total contribution of A in those cycles.
The variable rem is calculated as the remainder of N divided by the sum of A and B. This represents the part of N that does not complete a full cycle of A+B.
The value of ans is then incremented by the minimum of rem and A. This is because, after the full cycles are accounted for, there might be a partial cycle where A contributes partially (up to its full value) to the final answer.
Finally, the code prints the value of ans.

Let's calculate the values step by step:
1. ans = N // (A + B) * A
   ans = 501719768609305159 // (370614275896614890 + 131105492712690269) * 370614275896614890
   ans = 501719768609305159 // 501719768609305159 * 370614275896614890
   ans = 1 * 370614275896614890
   ans = 370614275896614890

2. rem = N % (A + B)
   rem = 501719768609305159 % 501719768609305159
   rem = 0

3. ans += min(rem, A)
   ans += min(0, 370614275896614890)
   ans += 0

4. The final value of ans is printed, which is 370614275896614890.
