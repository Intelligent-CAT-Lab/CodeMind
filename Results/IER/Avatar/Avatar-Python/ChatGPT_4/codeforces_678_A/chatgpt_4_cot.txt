<<<Analysis>>>
The variables `vamshi` and `z` are initialized to `999999999` and `1`, respectively.
The expression `(vamshi // z + 1) * z` is evaluated as follows:
- `vamshi // z` performs integer division of `vamshi` by `z`, which results in `999999999 // 1` equal to `999999999`.
- Adding `1` to the result gives `999999999 + 1`, which equals `1000000000`.
- Multiplying this result by `z` (`1000000000 * 1`) gives `1000000000`.
The code then prints the result of the expression, which is `1000000000`.
<<<Output>>>
1000000000
