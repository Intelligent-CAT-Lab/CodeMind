<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 999999991.
The code checks if n is divisible by 3 using the modulo operator. Since 999999991 % 3 is not equal to 0, it does not enter the first if block.
The code then checks if n is less than 3. Since 999999991 is greater than 3, it does not enter the elif block.
The code proceeds to the else block and executes the print statement.
It calculates n // 3, which is the integer division of 999999991 by 3, resulting in 333333330.
It then multiplies this by 2, resulting in 666666660.
Finally, it adds 1 to this result, yielding 666666661.
The code prints this final result.
<<<Output>>>
666666661
