<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a single character as input, which is 'c'.
The ord() function is used to get the ASCII value of the input character 'c', which is 99.
Then 1 is added to this ASCII value, resulting in 100.
The chr() function is used to convert this ASCII value back to a character, which corresponds to 'd'.
The print() function then outputs this character.
<<<Output>>>
