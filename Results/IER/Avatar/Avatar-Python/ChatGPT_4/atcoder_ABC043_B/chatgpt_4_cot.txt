<<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized with the input string '0000000000'.
The variable my_str is initialized with a single space ' '.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each character c in the string s.
For each character c, it checks if c is '0' or '1'. If it is, it appends c to my_str.
The input string does not contain any '1' or ' B ', so the condition for removing the last character in my_str is never met.
Since all characters in the input string are '0', the loop will append '0' to my_str ten times.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of my_str, which will be a space followed by ten '0's.
<<<Output>>>
 0000000000
