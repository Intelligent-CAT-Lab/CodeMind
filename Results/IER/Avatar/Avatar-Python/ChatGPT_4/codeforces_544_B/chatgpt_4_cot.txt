<<<Analysis>>>
The input `100 10000` initializes the `numbers` list with two elements: `100` and `10000`.
The variable `start` is initialized to `0`.
An empty list `arr` is created to store strings.
The variable `count` is initialized to `0`, which will be used to count the number of 'L's added to the strings.

The code enters a loop that iterates from `0` to `numbers[0]` (which is `100`), meaning it will iterate 100 times to create 100 strings.
For each iteration `i`, it initializes an empty string `string`.
The variable `next` is set to the value of `start`.

Another loop is nested inside, which also iterates 100 times.
If `count` is less than `numbers[1]` (which is `10000`), the code checks if the current index `j` is equal to `next`.
If it is, it appends ' L ' to `string`, increments `count` by `1`, and updates `next` by adding `2` to it.
If `next` becomes greater than or equal to `numbers[0]`, `start` is toggled between `0` and `1`.
If `j` is not equal to `next`, it appends " S " to `string`.

If `count` becomes greater than or equal to `numbers[1]`, it only appends " S " to `string`.

After the inner loop, the `string` is appended to the `arr` list.

After the outer loop, the code checks if `count` is less than `numbers[1]`.
If it is, it prints " NO ".
If `count` is greater than or equal to `numbers[1]`, it prints " YES " and then prints each string in `arr`.

In this case, since `numbers[1]` is `10000`, and we are adding 'L' every alternate position in a 100x100 grid, we will have `50` 'L's in each row. After `200` rows, we will have `50 * 200 = 10000` 'L's, which is the required count. However, we only have `100` rows, so we will not reach `10000` 'L's.

Therefore, the output will be " NO " because we cannot place `10000` 'L's in a 100x100 grid by placing 'L' every alternate position.
