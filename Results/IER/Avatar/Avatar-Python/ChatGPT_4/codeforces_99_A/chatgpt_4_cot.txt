<<<Analysis>>>
The input string '8.3' is split into a list ['8', '3'] using the split method with the delimiter " . ".
The first element of the list is '8', and its last character is '8' (since it's a single-digit number).
The condition int(num[0][-1]) == 9 checks if the last digit of the first part of the number (before the decimal point) is 9. In this case, it is not, since the last digit is '8'.
Therefore, the first if condition is not satisfied, and the code moves to the else block.
In the else block, the first character of the second element of the list is '3'.
The condition int(num[1][0]) >= 5 checks if this character, when converted to an integer, is greater than or equal to 5. Since '3' is less than 5, this condition is also not satisfied.
Therefore, the code prints the first element of the list, which is '8'.
<<<Output>>>
8
