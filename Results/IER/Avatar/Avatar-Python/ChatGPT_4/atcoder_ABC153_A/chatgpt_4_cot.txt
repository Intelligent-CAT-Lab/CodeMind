<<<Analysis>>>
The variables h and a are initialized to 10000 and 1, respectively.
The code uses the math.ceil function to calculate the smallest integer greater than or equal to the division of h by a.
Since h is 10000 and a is 1, the division h/a is 10000.0.
The math.ceil function will return the smallest integer greater than or equal to 10000.0, which is 10000.
The code then prints this value.
<<<Output>>>
10000
