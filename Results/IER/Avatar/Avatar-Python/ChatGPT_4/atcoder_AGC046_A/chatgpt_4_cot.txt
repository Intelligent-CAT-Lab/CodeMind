The variable X is initialized to 1.
The variable i is initialized to 1, which will be used to count the iterations.
The variable a is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of X.

The code enters an infinite loop with the condition `True`:
- In each iteration, X (which is 1) is added to a.
- The code then checks if a is divisible by 360 (i.e., a % 360 == 0).
- Since X is 1, a will be equal to 1, 2, 3, ..., incrementing by 1 each iteration.
- The loop will continue until a is a multiple of 360.
- Since 360 is the first multiple of 360, the loop will terminate when i is 360.
- When the condition is met, the code prints the current value of i and breaks out of the loop.

Therefore, the output will be the number of iterations it takes for the accumulated sum a to be a multiple of 360, which in this case is 360 itself since we are adding 1 each time.
