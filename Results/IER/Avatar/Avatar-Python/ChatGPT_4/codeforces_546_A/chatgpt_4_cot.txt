The variables k, n, and w are initialized to 1000, 1000000000, and 1000, respectively.
The variable sum is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the total cost of bananas.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to w (inclusive), meaning it will consider the cost of 1 to 1000 bananas.
For each banana i in this range, it calculates the cost of the ith banana (k * i) and adds it to sum. The cost of each banana increases linearly with i.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if the total cost (sum) is less than or equal to the amount of money the soldier has (n).
If sum is less than or equal to n, it prints 0, meaning the soldier has enough money and doesn't need to borrow any.
If sum is greater than n, it prints the difference (sum - n), which is the amount of money the soldier needs to borrow.
In this case, the total cost of bananas is calculated as the sum of an arithmetic series: sum = k * (1 + 2 + ... + w) = k * w * (w + 1) / 2 = 1000 * 1000 * (1000 + 1) / 2 = 1000 * 1000 * 1001 / 2 = 500500000.
Since 500500000 is less than 1000000000, the soldier has enough money and does not need to borrow any.
