<<<Analysis>>>
The variables x and y are initialized to 1 and 20, respectively.
The variable CielWon is initialized to False, which will be used to determine the winner.
The code enters a while loop with the condition that y is greater than 1 and x * 10 + y is greater than 21.

In the first iteration:
- The minimum of x and 2 is calculated, which is 1, and stored in t.
- x is decreased by t, so x becomes 0.
- y is decreased by (2 - t) * 10 + 2, which is 12, so y becomes 8.
- The if condition checks if y is less than 2 or 10 * x + y is less than 22. Since 10 * 0 + 8 is 8, which is less than 22, CielWon is set to True and the loop breaks.

Since CielWon is True, the code prints 'Ciel'.

<<<Output>>>
Ciel
