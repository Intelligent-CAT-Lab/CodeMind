<<<Analysis>>>
The code imports several modules and defines some utility functions.
It then defines a function called solve, which takes no arguments.
Inside the solve function, it reads an integer n from input.
It initializes a variable ans to 0.
Then it enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive).
For each iteration, it calculates the value of x, which is the integer division of n by i.
It then updates the value of ans by adding i * (1 + x) * x // 2 to it.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of ans.
The code then checks if it is being run as the main module, and if so, it calls the solve function.
