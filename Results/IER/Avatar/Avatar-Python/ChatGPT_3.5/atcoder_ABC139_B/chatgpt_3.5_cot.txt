<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs, t and h, and assigns them to the variables t and h respectively.
Then it calculates the expression (h - 2) // (t - 1) + 1 and prints the result.
In this case, t = 8 and h = 8, so the expression becomes (8 - 2) // (8 - 1) + 1 = 6 // 7 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1.
Therefore, the output of the code execution would be 1.
