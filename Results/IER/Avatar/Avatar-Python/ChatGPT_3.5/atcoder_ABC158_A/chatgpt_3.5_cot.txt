<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input from the user and assigns it to the variable `stdin`.
Then, it assigns the value of `stdin` to the variable `s`.
Next, it checks if the string "A" is present in `s` and if the string "B" is present in `s`.
If both conditions are true, it assigns the string "Yes" to the variable `result`.
Otherwise, it assigns the string "No" to `result`.
Finally, it prints the value of `result`.
In this case, the input is "BBA", which contains both "A" and "B", so the condition is true and the value of `result` is "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
