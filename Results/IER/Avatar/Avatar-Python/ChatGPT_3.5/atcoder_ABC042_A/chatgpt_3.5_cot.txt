<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes input in the form of three integers and stores them in a tuple called ABC.
It then checks if the count of the number 5 in the tuple ABC is equal to 2.
If the count is indeed 2, it checks if the sum of all the elements in ABC is equal to 17.
If both conditions are true, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'.
In this case, the count of 5 in ABC is 2, but the sum of the elements is 17, so the code will print 'YES'.
<<<Output>>>
YES
