<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs, `a` and `b`, which are separated by a space. In this case, `a` is "814793613347395" and `b` is "1.99".
The code then modifies `b` by taking the first character and concatenating it with the substring starting from the third character. This removes the decimal point and leaves only the integer part of `b`. So `b` becomes "199".
Next, `a` and `b` are converted to integers using the `int()` function.
Finally, the code calculates the product of `a` and `b`, and then performs integer division by 100. The result is printed.
