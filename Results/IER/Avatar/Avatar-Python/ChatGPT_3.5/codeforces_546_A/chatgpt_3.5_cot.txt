<<<Analysis>>>
The variable k, n, and w are initialized to 1000, 1000000000, and 1000, respectively.
The variable sum is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of k * i for each i in the range [1, w].
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to w (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 1000.
For each number i in this range, it calculates k * i and adds it to sum.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if sum is less than or equal to n. If it is, it prints 0. Otherwise, it prints the difference between sum and n.
In this case, the sum is 1000 * (1 + 2 + ... + 1000) = 500500000, which is greater than n. Therefore, the code will print the difference between sum and n, which is 500500000 - 1000000000 = -499500000.
<<<Output>>>
-499500000
