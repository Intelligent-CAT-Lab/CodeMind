<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string and uses the `replace()` method to replace all occurrences of the comma (",") with a space character ("▁"). The `replace()` method returns a new string with the replacements made.
The code then uses the `print()` function to output the modified string.
In this case, the input string is "pnxnn,muduhzn,aquud". The code replaces the comma with a space character, resulting in the string "pnxnn▁muduhzn▁aquud".
<<<Output>>>
pnxnn▁muduhzn▁aquud
