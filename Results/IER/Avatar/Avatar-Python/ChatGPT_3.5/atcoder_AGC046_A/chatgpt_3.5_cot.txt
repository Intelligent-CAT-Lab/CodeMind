The variable X is initialized to 1.
The variable i is initialized to 1, which will be used to count the number of iterations.
The variable a is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the value of X.
The code enters a while loop that will continue indefinitely until a break statement is encountered.
In each iteration of the loop, the code adds the value of X to a.
Then it checks if a is divisible by 360 (i.e., a % 360 == 0).
If it is, the code prints the value of i and breaks out of the loop.
If it is not, the code increments the value of i by 1 and continues to the next iteration of the loop.
In this case, since X is 1, the value of a will keep increasing by 1 in each iteration.
The first time a becomes divisible by 360 is when a is equal to 360.
Therefore, the code will print 1 and terminate.
