<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input and assigns it to the variable n.
The variables l and r are initialized to 1 and n respectively.
The code then enters a while loop that continues until l is less than r.
Inside the loop, it calculates the middle value using the formula mid = l + (r - l) // 2.
It then calculates the index count using the formula idxcnt = mid * (mid + 1) / 2.
If idxcnt is less than n, it updates the value of l to mid + 1.
Otherwise, it updates the value of r to mid.
After the loop finishes, it subtracts idxcnt from n and assigns the result to l.
Finally, it prints the value of l as the output.
In this case, the loop will iterate a few times until it finds the correct value of l.
