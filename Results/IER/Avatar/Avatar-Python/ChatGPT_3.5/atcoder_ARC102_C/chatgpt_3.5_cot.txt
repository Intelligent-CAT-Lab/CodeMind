<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs, K and N, and initializes the variable mod to 998244353.
Then, it defines a function inved(a) which calculates the inverse of a modulo mod using the extended Euclidean algorithm.
Next, it initializes a list X with 2*K-1 elements, all set to 0.
It also initializes a list frac with one element, which is 1.
Then, it enters a loop that iterates from 0 to N+K-1 (inclusive).
In each iteration, it appends the product of (i+1) and the last element of frac to frac, modulo mod.
After that, it initializes an empty list invf.
Then, it enters another loop that iterates from 0 to N+K (inclusive).
In each iteration, it appends the result of calling the inved function on the corresponding element of frac to invf.
Next, it enters another loop that iterates from 2 to K+1 (inclusive).
In each iteration, it initializes the variable S to 0, and the variable sign to 1.
It also calculates the value of l as k//2.
Then, it enters another loop that iterates from 0 to the minimum of l+1 and N//2+1.
In each iteration, it calculates the product of several elements from frac and invf, and adds it to S.
After the inner loop finishes, it updates the values of X[k-2] and X[2*K-k] to S.
Finally, it enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 2*K-2.
In each iteration, it prints the corresponding element of X.
