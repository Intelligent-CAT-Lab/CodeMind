<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 99999.
The variable cnt is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the numbers that have an odd number of digits.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 99999.
For each number i in this range, it converts it to a string and checks if the length of the string is odd. If it is, it increments cnt by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of cnt, which is the count of numbers with an odd number of digits.
<<<Output>>>
50000
