<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers A and B as input.
It then calculates the value of ans by subtracting 2 times B from A.
If the value of ans is less than 0, it sets ans to 0.
Finally, it prints the value of ans.
In this case, A is 75 and B is 25.
So, ans = 75 - 2 * 25 = 75 - 50 = 25.
Since ans is not less than 0, the value of ans remains 25.
<<<Output>>>
25
