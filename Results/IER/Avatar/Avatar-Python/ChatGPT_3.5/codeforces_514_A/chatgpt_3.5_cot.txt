<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string `ip` and initializes an empty string `st`.
If the length of `ip` is not equal to 1, it checks if the first character of `ip` is "9". If it is, it assigns "9" to `st` and removes the first character from `ip`.
Then, for each character `i` in `ip`, it checks if `i` is greater than 4. If it is, it subtracts `i` from 9 and appends the result to `st`. Otherwise, it appends `i` to `st`.
If the length of `ip` is 1, it assigns `ip` to `st`.
Finally, it converts `st` to an integer and prints the result.
In this case, the input is "5728". The first character is not "9", so the code enters the loop. For each character in "5728", it checks if it is greater than 4. The first character "5" is greater than 4, so it subtracts 5 from 9 and appends "4" to `st`. The second character "7" is also greater than 4, so it subtracts 7 from 9 and appends "2" to `st`. The third character "2" is not greater than 4, so it appends "2" to `st`. The fourth character "8" is greater than 4, so it subtracts 8 from 9 and appends "1" to `st`. The final value of `st` is "4241". It is converted to an integer and printed as the output.
