<<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the math module.
Then it takes two inputs, h and a, and assigns them to variables h and a respectively.
The code then calculates the division of h by a and uses the math.ceil() function to round up the result to the nearest integer.
Finally, it prints the rounded up result.
In this case, h is 10000 and a is 1, so the division result is 10000 and the rounded up result is also 10000.
<<<Output>>>
10000
