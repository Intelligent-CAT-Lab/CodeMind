<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four integers as input: a, b, c, and d.
It then calculates the maximum value between 0 and the minimum value between b and d minus the maximum value between a and c.
In this case, the input values are 0, 50, 50, and 100.
The minimum value between 50 and 100 is 50, and the maximum value between 0 and 50 is 50.
Therefore, the output of the code execution would be 50.
<<<Output>>>
50
