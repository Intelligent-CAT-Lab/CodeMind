<<<Analysis>>>
The variable K is initialized to 260522.
The code checks if K is divisible by 2. If it is, it prints -1 and exits the program.
If K is not divisible by 2, the code enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 10^6.
In each iteration, it increments the variable cnt by 1 and updates the variable now by multiplying it by 10, adding 7, and taking the modulo K.
The code then checks if now is equal to 0. If it is, it prints cnt and exits the program.
If the loop finishes without finding a value of now equal to 0, it prints -1.
In this case, since K is not divisible by 2, the code enters the loop and finds a value of now equal to 0 after 260522 iterations. Therefore, the output will be 260522.
