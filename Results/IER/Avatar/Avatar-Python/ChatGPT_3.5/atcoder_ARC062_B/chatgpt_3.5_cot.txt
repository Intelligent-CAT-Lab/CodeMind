<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by importing necessary modules and defining some helper functions.
Then, it reads a string input S.
The code uses the Counter class from the collections module to count the occurrences of each character in the string S.
It then calculates the difference between the count of character 'g' and the count of character 'p' and divides it by 2.
Finally, it prints the result.
In this case, the input string is "2 2", so the count of 'g' is 0 and the count of 'p' is 0. Therefore, the result is 0.
<<<Output>>>
0
