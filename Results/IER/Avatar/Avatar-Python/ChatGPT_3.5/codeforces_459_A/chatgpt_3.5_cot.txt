<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four integers as input: anti, b, c, and d.
It then calculates the absolute difference between anti and c and stores it in variable l.
It also calculates the absolute difference between b and d and stores it in variable m.
The code then enters a series of if-elif-else statements to determine the output.
If anti is equal to c, it prints the values anti+m, b, c+m, d.
If b is equal to d, it prints the values anti, b+l, c, d+l.
If l is not equal to m, it prints -1.
Otherwise, it prints the values anti, d, c, b.
In this case, anti=4, b=0, c=0, and d=4.
Since anti is equal to c, the code will print 4+4, 0, 0+4, 4, which is 8 0 4 4.
<<<Output>>>
8 0 4 4
