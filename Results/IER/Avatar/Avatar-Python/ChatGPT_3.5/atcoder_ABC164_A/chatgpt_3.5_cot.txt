<<<Analysis>>>
The code defines a function called main, which takes no arguments.
Inside the main function, it reads two integers S and W from input and assigns them to variables S and W.
Then, it checks if S is less than or equal to W. If this condition is true, it prints "unsafe". Otherwise, it prints "safe".
Finally, outside the main function, the code checks if the current module is being run as the main program. If it is, it calls the main function.
In this case, the input is "1 100". So, S is assigned the value 1 and W is assigned the value 100.
The condition S <= W is true, so the code prints "unsafe".
<<<Output>>>
