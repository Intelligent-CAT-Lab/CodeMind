<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, n and m.
It first checks if n is less than 1. If it is, it checks if m is also less than 1. If both conditions are true, it prints n and m and then quits the program.
If n is less than 1 but m is not less than 1, it prints "Impossible" and quits the program.
If n is not less than 1, it checks if m is greater than n. If it is, it calculates the minimum value as m and the maximum value as n + m - 1. It then prints the minimum and maximum values.
If m is not greater than n, it calculates the minimum value as n and the maximum value as n + m - 1. If m is equal to 0, it sets the maximum value as n. It then prints the minimum and maximum values.
In this case, n = 59 and m = 96. Since n is not less than 1 and m is greater than n, the minimum value is 96 and the maximum value is 59 + 96 - 1 = 154.
<<<Output>>>
96 154
