<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input in the form of a string and splits it at the "." character. The result is stored in the variable "num" as a list with two elements: the integer part and the decimal part.
The code then checks if the last digit of the integer part is equal to 9. If it is, it prints "GOTO Vasilisa." In this case, the last digit of the integer part is 8, so this condition is not met.
If the condition is not met, the code checks if the first digit of the decimal part is greater than or equal to 5. If it is, it adds 1 to the integer part and prints the result. In this case, the first digit of the decimal part is 3, so this condition is not met either.
If neither of the previous conditions is met, the code simply prints the integer part as it is.
<<<Output>>>
8
