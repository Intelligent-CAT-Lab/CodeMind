<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input and assigns them to variables a and b.
The code then checks the following conditions:
1. If a is less than or equal to 0 and b is greater than or equal to 0, it prints "Zero".
2. If a is less than 0 and the absolute difference between b and a or -a is even, it prints "Negative".
3. If none of the above conditions are met, it prints "Positive".

In this case, a is -1000000000 and b is -1.
The first condition is not met because a is less than 0.
The second condition is met because the absolute difference between b and a is 999999999, which is odd.
Therefore, the code will print "Positive".

<<<Output>>>
Positive
