<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four integers A, B, C, and D as input.
It initializes the variable m to 998244353 and creates a 2D list d with dimensions (C+1) x (D+1), filled with zeros.
It then sets the value of d[A][B] to 1.
The code then enters two nested loops. The outer loop iterates from A to C (inclusive), and the inner loop iterates from B to D (inclusive).
For each iteration, the code updates the value of d[i][j] using the formula:
d[i][j] = (d[i][j-1] * i + d[i-1][j] * j - d[i-1][j-1] * (i-1) * (j-1)) % m
After the loops finish, the code prints the value of d[C][D].
