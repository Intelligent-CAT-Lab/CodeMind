<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three inputs: r, D, and x. These inputs are converted to integers using the map() function.
The code then enters a loop that iterates 10 times. In each iteration, it updates the value of x using the formula r*x - D and prints the updated value.
The initial value of x is 2.
In the first iteration, x = 2*2 - 1 = 3.
In the second iteration, x = 2*3 - 1 = 5.
In the third iteration, x = 2*5 - 1 = 9.
In the fourth iteration, x = 2*9 - 1 = 17.
In the fifth iteration, x = 2*17 - 1 = 33.
In the sixth iteration, x = 2*33 - 1 = 65.
In the seventh iteration, x = 2*65 - 1 = 129.
In the eighth iteration, x = 2*129 - 1 = 257.
In the ninth iteration, x = 2*257 - 1 = 513.
In the tenth iteration, x = 2*513 - 1 = 1025.
So, the output of the code would be:
3
5
9
17
33
65
129
257
513
1025
