<<<Analysis>>>
The code imports several modules and sets some variables and constants.
It then reads an integer N from the input.
The code defines a function dsum(x) that calculates the sum of the digits of a number x.
The variable ans is initialized to infinity.
The code enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N-1 (inclusive), assigning the current value to variable a.
For each value of a, it calculates the value of b by subtracting a from N.
The code then calculates the sum of the digits of a and b using the dsum() function, and adds them together.
If this sum is smaller than the current value of ans, it updates ans with the new sum.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of ans, which is the minimum sum of digits for all possible values of a and b.
