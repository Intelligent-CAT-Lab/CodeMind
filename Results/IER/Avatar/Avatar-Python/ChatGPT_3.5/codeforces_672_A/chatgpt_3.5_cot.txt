<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes an empty list `li` and a variable `ind` to 0.
Then it enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 371 (inclusive).
For each number `i` in this range, it calculates the number of digits in `i` and stores it in the variable `count`.
If `count` is 1, it appends `i` to the list `li`.
If `count` is 2 or 3, it extracts the digits of `i` and appends them in reverse order to the list `li`.
After the loop finishes, it removes the last two elements from the list `li`.
Then it takes an input `n` and prints the `n-1`th element from the list `li`.
In this case, the input is 952, so it will print the 951st element from the list `li`.

<<<Output>>>
951
