<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input and assigns it to the variable x.
Then, there is a function called factorization that takes an integer n as input.
Inside the function, an empty list arr is initialized.
A temporary variable temp is assigned the value of n.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 2 to the square root of n (inclusive).
For each iteration, it checks if temp is divisible by i. If it is, it counts the number of times i divides temp and stores it in the variable cnt.
The code then divides temp by i until it is no longer divisible by i.
The pair [i, cnt] is appended to the list arr.
After the loop, if temp is not equal to 1, it means that temp is a prime number and it is appended to arr with a count of 1.
If arr is empty, it means that n is a prime number and it is appended to arr with a count of 1.
The function returns the list arr.
Outside the function, the variable l is assigned the result of calling the factorization function with the input x.
The list l is then sorted in ascending order.
The variable ans is initialized to 0.
The code enters a loop that iterates over the indices of the list l.
For each index i, it checks if the first element of the pair at index i in l is equal to 1. If it is, it continues to the next iteration.
Otherwise, it initializes the variable s to 0 and assigns the value of the second element of the pair at index i in l to the variable num.
If num is equal to 1, it assigns the value 1 to the variable j.
Otherwise, it enters a loop that iterates from 1 to num-1 (inclusive).
For each iteration, it adds the value of j to s.
If s is equal to num, it breaks out of the loop.
If s is greater than num, it subtracts 1 from j and breaks out of the loop.
After the loop, it adds the value of j to ans.
Finally, it prints the value of ans.
