<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string and stores it in the variable s.
The variable t is initialized to ' , . ? ! ', which contains the punctuation marks that need to be replaced.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each character in t.
For each character i in t, it replaces all occurrences of i in s with i + ' ▁ ', where ' ▁ ' is a special character.
After the loop finishes, the code replaces all occurrences of ' ▁ ' with a space character.
Then, it strips any leading or trailing spaces from s and splits it into a list of words.
The code then joins the words in the list with ' ▁ ' as the separator.
Finally, it enters another loop that iterates over each character in t.
For each character i in t, it replaces all occurrences of ' ▁ ' + i with just i.
The final value of s is then printed.
<<<Output>>>
a ▁ ! n ▁ , ▁ to ▁ ?
