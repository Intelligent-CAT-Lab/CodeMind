<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string and converts it into a list of characters.
It then initializes a dictionary dt to store the count of each character in the list.
The code iterates through each character in the list and updates the count in the dictionary.
Next, it initializes a counter variable cnt to 0 and a boolean variable x to True.
The code then iterates through the key-value pairs in the dictionary dt.
If the value is odd and cnt is less than 1, it increments cnt by 1.
If the value is odd and cnt is already 1 or more, it sets x to False and breaks out of the loop.
After the loop, the code checks the value of x.
If x is True, it prints "First".
If x is False and the length of the input string is even, it prints "Second".
If x is False and the length of the input string is odd, it prints "First".
In this case, the length of the input string is 500, which is even, so the output will be "Second".
<<<Output>>>
