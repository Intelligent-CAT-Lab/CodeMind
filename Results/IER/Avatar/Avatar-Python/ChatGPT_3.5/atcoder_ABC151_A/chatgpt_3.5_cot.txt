<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input character and converts it to its ASCII value using the ord() function. It then adds 1 to the ASCII value and converts it back to a character using the chr() function. Finally, it prints the resulting character.
In this case, the input character is 'c'. The ASCII value of 'c' is 99. Adding 1 to 99 gives 100, which corresponds to the character 'd'.
Therefore, the output of the code execution would be 'd'.
