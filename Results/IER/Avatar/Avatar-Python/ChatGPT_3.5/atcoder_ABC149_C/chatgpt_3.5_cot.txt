<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by importing the math module and then reads an integer N from the input.
Next, there is a function definition for hoge(n). This function checks if a number n is prime or not. It returns True if n is equal to 2, otherwise it checks if n is divisible by any number from 2 to the square root of n + 2. If it is divisible by any number, it returns False. Otherwise, it returns True.
After the function definition, there is a while loop that runs indefinitely. Inside the loop, it checks if the current value of N is prime by calling the hoge() function. If it is prime, it prints the value of N and exits the program. If it is not prime, it increments the value of N by 1 and continues to the next iteration of the loop.
In this case, the input value is 9552. The code will start by checking if 9552 is prime. Since it is not prime, it will increment N by 1 and check if 9553 is prime. This process will continue until a prime number is found.

9553
