<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three inputs: N, A, and B. In this case, N = 501719768609305159, A = 370614275896614890, and B = 131105492712690269.
The code then calculates the integer division of N by the sum of A and B, and multiplies it by A. This value is stored in the variable ans.
Next, it calculates the remainder of the division of N by the sum of A and B, and stores it in the variable rem.
The code then adds the minimum value between rem and A to ans.
Finally, it prints the value of ans.
