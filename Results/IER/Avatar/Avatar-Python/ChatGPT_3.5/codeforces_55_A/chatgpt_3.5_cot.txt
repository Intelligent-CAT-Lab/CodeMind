<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input integer n and enters a while loop. The loop continues as long as n is divisible by 2. In each iteration, n is divided by 2. This means that the loop will continue until n becomes an odd number.
After the loop, the code checks if n is equal to 1. If it is, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
In this case, the input is 512. The code will divide 512 by 2 repeatedly until it becomes an odd number. The division will happen 9 times, resulting in n becoming 1. Therefore, the output will be 'YES'.
<<<Output>>>
YES
