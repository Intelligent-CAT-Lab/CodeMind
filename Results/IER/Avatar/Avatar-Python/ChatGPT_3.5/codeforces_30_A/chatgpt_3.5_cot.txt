<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input: a, b, and n. In this case, a=7, b=896, and n=7.
The code then checks if a is not equal to 0. Since a is not 0, it proceeds to the next if statement.
The code checks if b modulo a is not equal to 0. In this case, 896 modulo 7 is not 0, so it enters the first branch of the if statement and prints "No solution".
Therefore, the output of the code execution would be "No solution".
<<<Output>>>
No solution
