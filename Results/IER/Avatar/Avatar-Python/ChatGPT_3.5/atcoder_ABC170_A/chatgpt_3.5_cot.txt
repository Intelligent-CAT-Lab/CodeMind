<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes input as a string of space-separated numbers and converts it into a list of integers using the map() function.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each element in the list. For each element, it checks if the element is equal to 0.
If the element is equal to 0, it prints the index of that element plus 1 (since the index starts from 0) and breaks out of the loop.
In this case, the element 0 is at index 4, so the code will print 5 and exit the loop.
<<<Output>>>
5
