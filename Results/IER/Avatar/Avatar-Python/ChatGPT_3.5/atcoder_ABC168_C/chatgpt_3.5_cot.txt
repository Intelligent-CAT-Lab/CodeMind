<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four inputs: a, b, h, and m. These inputs are then used to calculate the values of theta_h and theta_m.
theta_h is calculated by taking the current hour (h) and minute (m) and converting it into radians. It is then subtracted from 2.5 * pi.
theta_m is calculated by taking the current minute (m) and converting it into radians. It is then subtracted from 2.5 * pi.
The code then calculates the x and y coordinates for both the hour and minute hands using the formulas:
x_h = a * cos(theta_h)
y_h = a * sin(theta_h)
x_m = b * cos(theta_m)
y_m = b * sin(theta_m)
Finally, the code calculates the distance between the two points (x_h, y_h) and (x_m, y_m) using the distance formula and prints the result.
