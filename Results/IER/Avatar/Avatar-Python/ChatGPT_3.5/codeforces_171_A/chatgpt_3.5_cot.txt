<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs, `a` and `b`, which are separated by a space.
The code then reverses the string `b` using slicing (`b[::-1]`) and converts it to an integer.
Next, it converts the string `a` to an integer.
Finally, it adds the two integers together and prints the result.
In this case, `a` is 35005211 and `b` is 521595368. Reversing `b` gives 863595125.
Adding `a` and `b` together gives 898600336.
