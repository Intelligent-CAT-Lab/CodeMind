<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers, n and m, from the input. In this case, n is 24 and m is 7440.
The code initializes i to 0 and enters a while loop that continues indefinitely.
Inside the loop, the code checks if i + 1 is greater than m. If it is, it assigns the value of m to the variable ans and breaks out of the loop.
If i + 1 is not greater than m, the code subtracts i + 1 from m, increments i by 1, and takes the modulus of i with n.
The loop continues until the condition i + 1 > m is met.
Finally, the code prints the value of ans, which is the last assigned value of m.
