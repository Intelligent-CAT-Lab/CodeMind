<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized to 6.
The code then enters a while loop that continues as long as i is less than j.
Inside the loop, it prints the values of i and j.
Then, it increments i by 1 and decrements j by 1.
This process continues until i becomes equal to j.
In this case, the loop will iterate 3 times, printing the following pairs of values:
1 36
2 35
3 34
<<<Output>>>
1 36
2 35
3 34
