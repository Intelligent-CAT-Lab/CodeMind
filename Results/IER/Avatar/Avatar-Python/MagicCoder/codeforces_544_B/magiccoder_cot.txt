I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
[Question]
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:

<<<Output>>>

[Answer]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
numbers = list ( map ( int , input ( ) . split ( ) ) )
start = 0
arr = [ ]
count = 0
for i in range ( 0 , numbers [ 0 ] ) :
    string = " "
    next = start
    for j in range ( 0 , numbers [ 0 ] ) :
        if count < numbers [ 1 ] :
            if j == next :
                string += ' L '
                count += 1
                next += 2
                if next >= numbers [ 0 ] :
                    start = 1 if start == 0 else 0
            else :
                string += " S "
        else :
            string += " S "
    arr . append ( string )
if count < numbers [ 1 ] :
    print ( " NO " )
else :
    print ( " YES " )
    for i in arr :
        print ( i )

[Question]
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```100 10000```

First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

<<<Analysis>>>
The variable numbers is initialized to [100, 10000].
variable start is initialized to 0, which will be used to determine the direction of the next step.
variable arr is initialized to an empty list, which will be used to store the output.
variable count is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of steps.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to numbers[0] (exclusive), meaning it will create a 100x100 grid.
For each number i in this range, it creates a string of 'L' and 'S' based on the count and next variables.
If the count is less than numbers[1], it appends the string to arr.
If the count is not less than numbers[1], it prints "NO" and stops.
If the count is less than numbers[1], it prints "YES" and then prints each string in arr.
<<<Output>>>
NO
