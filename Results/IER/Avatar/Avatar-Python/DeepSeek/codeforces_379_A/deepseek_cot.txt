### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
a , b = map ( int , input ( ) . split ( ) )
x = a
h = 0
s = 0
while x > 0 :
    x -= 1
    h += 1
    s += 1
while s // b != 0 :
    h += 1
    s = s - b + 1
print ( h )


<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `80 970`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs a and b from the user. The variable a is the initial number of apples, and b is the number of apples that can be eaten in one bite. The variable h is used to count the number of bites, and the variable s is used to keep track of the remaining apples.

The first while loop subtracts 1 from the initial number of apples (a) and adds 1 to the number of bites (h). It also adds 1 to the number of apples eaten (s). This loop continues until there are no apples left (s == 0).

The second while loop checks if the number of apples eaten (s) is divisible by b. If it is, it adds 1 to the number of bites (h) and subtracts b + 1 from the number of apples eaten (s). This loop continues until there are no apples left to eat (s // b == 0).

Finally, the code prints the number of bites (h).

Given the input `80 970`, the code will eat 80 apples in the first bite, then eat 81 apples in the second bite, and so on until there are no apples left. The number of bites will be 970.

So, the output of the code will be 970.

<<<Output>>>
970
