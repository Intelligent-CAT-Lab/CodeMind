### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
numbers = list ( map ( int , input ( ) . split ( ) ) )
start = 0
arr = [ ]
count = 0
for i in range ( 0 , numbers [ 0 ] ) :
    string = " "
    next = start
    for j in range ( 0 , numbers [ 0 ] ) :
        if count < numbers [ 1 ] :
            if j == next :
                string += ' L '
                count += 1
                next += 2
                if next >= numbers [ 0 ] :
                    start = 1 if start == 0 else 0
            else :
                string += " S "
        else :
            string += " S "
    arr . append ( string )
if count < numbers [ 1 ] :
    print ( " NO " )
else :
    print ( " YES " )
    for i in arr :
        print ( i )


<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `100 10000`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The input given is `100 10000`. The first number `100` is the length of the sequence and the second number `10000` is the number of steps.

The code first initializes an empty list `arr` to store the sequence, a variable `start` to keep track of the current direction (0 for left and 1 for right), a variable `count` to keep track of the number of steps, and a variable `next` to keep track of the next position to place a 'L'.

Then it enters a loop that iterates `numbers[0]` times. In each iteration, it creates a string of length `numbers[0]` with 'S's and 'L's. If `count` is less than `numbers[1]`, it places a 'L' at the position `next` in the string and increments `count` and `next`. If `next` is greater than or equal to `numbers[0]`, it resets `next` to 1 and `start` to the opposite of its current value.

After the loop, if `count` is less than `numbers[1]`, it prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES" and the sequence stored in `arr`.

<<<Output>>>
The output of the code will depend on the input. If `numbers[1]` is less than or equal to `numbers[0]`, the output will be "YES" followed by the sequence. If `numbers[1]` is greater than `numbers[0]`, the output will be "NO".
