### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
anti , b , c , d = map ( int , input ( ) . split ( ) )
l = abs ( anti - c ) ; m = abs ( b - d )
if anti == c : print ( anti + m , b , c + m , d )
elif b == d : print ( anti , b + l , c , d + l )
elif l != m : print ( - 1 )
else : print ( anti , d , c , b )


<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `4 0 0 4`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The input is four integers: anti, b, c, and d. The variables anti and c represent the x-coordinates of two points, while b and d represent the y-coordinates of two points. The task is to find the coordinates of the other two points.

The code first calculates the absolute differences between the x-coordinates (anti and c) and the y-coordinates (b and d). If the x-coordinates are equal, it means the two points are on the same vertical line. In this case, the y-coordinates of the other two points are the same as the original points, but with the x-coordinate increased by the absolute difference between the y-coordinates.

If the y-coordinates are equal, it means the two points are on the same horizontal line. In this case, the x-coordinates of the other two points are the same as the original points, but with the y-coordinate increased by the absolute difference between the x-coordinates.

If the absolute differences between the x-coordinates and the y-coordinates are not equal, it means the two points are not on the same line. In this case, the code prints -1.

If none of the above conditions are met, it means the two points are on the same line. In this case, the code prints the coordinates of the other two points. The x-coordinates of the other two points are the same as the original points, and the y-coordinates are the same as the original points, but with the x-coordinate and y-coordinate swapped.

Given the input `4 0 0 4`, the two points have the same x-coordinate (4), so the code prints `4 4 4 0`.

<<<Output>>>
4 4 4 0
