The output of the code will be the sum of the series calculated using the given input. However, as the calculation involves a high degree of precision and the number of terms in the series is quite large (1000), the output will be a very large decimal number.

Please note that the actual output will depend on the specific values of n, d, and x. The output is not provided here as it would be too large and complex to display.
