### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import math
N = int ( input ( ) )
def hoge ( n ) :
    if n == 2 :
        return True
    for x in range ( 2 , int ( math . sqrt ( n ) + 2 ) ) :
        if n % x == 0 :
            return False
    return True
while True :
    if hoge ( N ) :
        print ( N )
        exit ( )
    N += 1


<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `9552`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by importing the math module. The function hoge is defined to check if a number is a prime number. It checks if the number is divisible by any number from 2 to the square root of the number plus 2. If it is, it returns False, indicating that the number is not a prime number. If it is not divisible by any of these numbers, it returns True, indicating that the number is a prime number.

The code then enters an infinite loop. In each iteration of the loop, it checks if the current value of N is a prime number by calling the hoge function. If it is, it prints the number and exits the program. If it is not, it increments N by 1 and continues the loop.

The input given is `9552`. This number is not a prime number, so the code will continue to increment N until it finds a prime number.

The prime numbers after `9552` are `9553`, `9557`, `9561`, `9565`, `9569`, `9574`, `9578`, `9582`, `9586`, `9590`, `9594`, `9598`, `9602`, `9606`, `9610`, `9614`, `9618`, `9622`, `9626`, `9630`, `9634`, `9638`, `9642`, `9646`, `9650`, `9654`, `9658`, `9662`, `9666`, `9670`, `9674`, `9678`, `9682`, `9686`, `9690`, `9694`, `9698`, `9702`, `9706`, `9710`, `9714`, `9718`, `9722`, `9726`, `9730`, `9734`, `9738`, `9742`, `9746`, `9750`, `9754`, `9758`, `9762`, `9766`, `9770`, `9774`, `9778`, `9782`, `9786`, `9790`, `9794`, `9798`, `9802`, `9806`, `9810`, `9814`, `9818`, `9822`, `9826`, `9830`, `9834`, `9838`, `9842`, `9846`, `9850`, `9854`, `9858`, `9862`, `9866`, `9870`, `9874`, `9878`, `9882`, `9886`, `9890`, `9894`, `9898`, `9902`, `9906`, `9910`, `9914`, `9918`, `9922`, `9926`, `9930`, `9934`, `9938`, `9942`, `9946`, `9950`, `9954`, `9958`, `9962`, `9966`, `9970`, `9974`, `9978`, `9982`, `9986`, `9990`, `9994`, `9998`.

So, the output of the code given the input `9552` would be `9553`.

<<<Output>>>
9553
