The output of the code will be 50, which is the maximum interval between the two sets of numbers.

Here is the Python code that calculates the output:

```python
a , b , c , d = map ( int , input ( ) . split ( ) )
print ( max ( 0 , min ( b , d ) - max ( a , c ) ) )
```

Input: 0 50 50 100
Output: 50
