### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
x1 , y1 , x2 , y2 = map ( int , input ( ) . split ( ) )
a = x2 - x1
b = y2 - y1
print ( x2 - b , y2 + a , x1 - b , y1 + a )


<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `2 3 6 6`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The input is four integers x1, y1, x2, y2. The code calculates the differences between the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of the two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) respectively. It then prints the coordinates of the other two points.

The code first calculates the difference between x2 and x1 and stores it in the variable 'a'. It then calculates the difference between y2 and y1 and stores it in the variable 'b'.

The code then prints the x-coordinate of the other point as x2 - b and the y-coordinate of the other point as y2 + a. The x-coordinate of the third point is calculated as x1 - b and the y-coordinate of the third point is calculated as y1 + a.

The code finally prints the x-coordinate of the fourth point as x1 - b and the y-coordinate of the fourth point as y1 + a.

The input `2 3 6 6` means that the two points are (2, 3) and (6, 6).

<<<Output>>>
The output of the code would be: `6 9 4 7`
