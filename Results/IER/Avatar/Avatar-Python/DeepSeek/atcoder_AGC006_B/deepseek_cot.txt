### Instruction
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)
</Code>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
N , x = map ( int , input ( ) . split ( ) )
if x == 1 or x == 2 * N - 1 :
    print ( " No " )
else :
    print ( " Yes " )
    l = [ i for i in range ( 1 , 2 * N ) ]
    l . remove ( x - 1 )
    l . remove ( x )
    l . remove ( x + 1 )
    for i in range ( N - 2 ) :
        print ( l [ i ] )
    print ( x - 1 )
    print ( x )
    print ( x + 1 )
    for i in range ( N - 2 ) :
        print ( l [ N - 2 + i ] )


<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `2 1`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response
<<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes two inputs N and x from the user. N is the number of elements in the sequence, and x is the position of the element to be removed.

If x is 1 or 2 * N - 1, the code prints "No". This is because these positions are the ends of the sequence, and removing them would leave no elements in the sequence.

If x is not 1 or 2 * N - 1, the code prints "Yes". Then it creates a list l of numbers from 1 to 2 * N - 1. It removes the elements at positions x - 1, x, and x + 1 from the list.

The code then prints the remaining elements of the list in the order they were in the original sequence, except for the removed elements. It prints the elements at positions x - 1, x, and x + 1, and then prints the remaining elements in the order they were in the original sequence.

The output of the code given the input `2 1` would be:
```
No
```
Because x is 1, which is the first element in the sequence. Removing it would leave no elements in the sequence.

<<<Output>>>
No
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

I hope this helps you understand how the code works and what the output will be for the given input.
