 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the math module.
Then it takes four input values, a, b, h, and m, separated by spaces.
The values are then converted to integers using the map() function.
The code then calculates theta_h and theta_m using the formula 2.5 * pi - (2 * pi * (h + (m/60))/12)
It then calculates x_h and y_h using the formula a * cos(theta_h) and a * sin(theta_h)
It calculates x_m and y_m using the formula b * cos(theta_m) and b * sin(theta_m)
Finally, it calculates the distance between the two points using the formula (x\_h - x\_m) ** 2 + (y\_h - y\_m) ** 2
The return value of the code is the square root of the distance between the two points.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is 49.0.
