 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs, N and x, where N is an integer and x is either 1 or 2N-1.
The code first checks if x is equal to 1 or 2N-1. If it is, it prints "No". Otherwise, it prints "Yes".
If x is not equal to 1 or 2N-1, the code creates a list l by iterating from 1 to 2N-1, and then removes x-1, x and x+1 from the list.
The code then prints the elements of the list l in the order of N-2, N-1, N, N-1, N, N-2, N-1, N-2, N-1, N-2.
Finally, the code prints x-1, x and x+1.
