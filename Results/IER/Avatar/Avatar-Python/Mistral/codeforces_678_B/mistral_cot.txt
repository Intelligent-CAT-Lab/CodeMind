 <<<Analysis>>>
The code imports the calendar module and prompts the user to enter a year. The input is stored in the variable y.
The code then checks if the year is a leap year using the isleap() function from the calendar module. The result is stored in the variable is\_run.
The code then uses the weekday() function from the calendar module to determine the day of the week for January 1st of the current year. The result is stored in the variable week.
The code then enters a while loop that continues until the year is 2096.
Inside the loop, the code checks if the current year is a leap year and if the day of the week for January 1st is the same as the one stored in the variable week. If both conditions are met, the current year is printed and the loop is broken.
Since the year 2096 is not a leap year, the loop will not be broken and the code will continue to run indefinitely.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is not defined, as the loop will continue to run indefinitely until the year 2096.
