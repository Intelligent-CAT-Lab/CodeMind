 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input, k, n and w. k is 1000, n is 1000000000 and w is 1000.
The variable sum is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to w (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 1000.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of k and i and stores it in sum.
The code checks if sum is less than or equal to n, which is 1000000000 in this case. If it is, it prints 0. Otherwise, it prints the difference between sum and n.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum, which is 1000000000.
<<<Output>>>
1000000000
