The function `cutRibbon` takes an input of four integers, which are stored in the list `arr`. The length of the ribbon is stored in the variable `length`. The function then sorts the list `arr[1:4]` in ascending order.
The function then checks if the length of the ribbon is divisible by the first element of the sorted list. If it is, it prints the number of times the first element can be used to cut the ribbon.
If the length is not divisible by the first element, the function checks if the first and second elements of the sorted list are equal. If they are, it uses a nested loop to check if the length can be cut into pieces of size 2 and 2, or 2 and 1, or 1 and 1. If it can, it prints the number of ways to cut the ribbon.
If the first and second elements of the sorted list are not equal, the function uses two nested loops to check if the length can be cut into pieces of size 2 and 1, or 1 and 1. If it can, it prints the number of ways to cut the ribbon.
For the input `29 27 18 2`, the function first sorts the list `arr[1:4]` to get `[18, 27, 29]`. The length of the ribbon is 29. Since 29 is not divisible by 18, the function checks if 29 can be cut into pieces of size 2 and 2, or 2 and 1, or 1 and 1. Since 29 is not divisible by 27, the function uses two nested loops to check if 29 can be cut into pieces of size 2 and 1, or 1 and 1. Since 29 is not divisible by 18, the function uses two nested loops to check if 29 can be cut into pieces of size 2 and 1, or 1 and 1. Since 29 is not divisible by 18, the function uses two nested loops to check if 29 can be cut into pieces of size 2 and 1, or 1 and 1. Since 29 is not divisible by 18, the function uses two nested loops to check if 29 can be cut into pieces of size 2 and 1, or 1 and 1. Since 29 is not divisible by 18, the function uses two nested loops to check if 29 can be cut into pieces of size 2 and 1, or 1 and 1. Since 29 is not divisible by 18, the function uses two nested loops to check if 29 can be cut into pieces of size 2 and 1, or 1 and 1. Since 29 is not divisible by 18, the function uses two nested loops to check if 29 can be cut into pieces of size 2 and 1, or 1 and 1. Since 29 is not divisible by 18, the function uses two nested loops to check if 29 can be cut into pieces of size 2 and 1, or 1 and 1. Since 29 is not divisible by 18, the function uses two nested loops to check if 29 can be cut into pieces of size 2 and 1, or 1 and 1. Since
