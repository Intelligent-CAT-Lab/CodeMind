 <<<Analysis>>>
The code imports the math module, which provides mathematical functions.
The input is read from the user and split into two variables, h and a, using the split() method.
The input is a string of the form "10000 1", which is split into two parts "10000" and "1".
The ceil() function from the math module is then called with the argument h/a, which is 10000/1 = 10000.
The ceil() function returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to the argument, which is 10000.
<<<Output>>>
10000
