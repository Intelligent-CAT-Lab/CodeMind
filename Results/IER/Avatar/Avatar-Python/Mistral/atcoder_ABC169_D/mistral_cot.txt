The code first takes an integer input `x` from the user.
Then it defines a function `factorization(n)` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list of tuples.
The function first initializes an empty list `arr` to store the prime factors of `n`.
It then initializes a variable `temp` to `n` and starts a loop that iterates from 2 to the square root of `n` (inclusive).
For each number `i` in this range, it checks if `temp` is divisible by `i`. If it is, it initializes a variable `cnt` to 0 and starts another loop that divides `temp` by `i` and increments `cnt` until `temp` is no longer divisible by `i`.
It then appends a tuple `(i, cnt)` to the `arr` list.
After the loop finishes, it checks if `temp` is not equal to 1. If it is not, it appends a tuple `(temp, 1)` to the `arr` list.
If the `arr` list is empty, it appends a tuple `(n, 1)` to the `arr` list.
Finally, the function returns the `arr` list.
The code then calls the `factorization(x)` function and stores the result in the variable `l`.
It then sorts the `l` list in ascending order of the first element of each tuple.
It initializes a variable `ans` to 0 and starts a loop that iterates over each element in the `l` list.
For each element, it checks if the first element of the tuple is equal to 1. If it is, it skips the element and moves on to the next one.
Otherwise, it initializes a variable `s` to 0 and starts a loop that iterates from 1 to the second element of the tuple (inclusive).
For each number `j` in this range, it adds `j` to `s` and checks if `s` is equal to the second element of the tuple. If it is, it breaks out of the loop.
If `s` is greater than the second element of the tuple, it decrements `j` by 1 and breaks out of the loop.
Finally, it adds `j` to the `ans` variable.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the value of `ans`.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code based on the input `366735600000` would be 1000000000000.
This is because the prime factorization of `366735600000` is `2^13 * 3^10 * 5^10 * 7^10 * 11^10 * 13^10 * 17^10 * 19^10 * 23^10 * 29^10 * 31^10 * 37^10 * 41^10 * 43^10 * 47^10 * 53^10 * 59^10 * 61^10 * 67^10 * 71^10 * 73^10 * 79^10 * 83
