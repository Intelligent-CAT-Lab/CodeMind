 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes two integers as input, x and y, using the `input()` function. The input is split using the `split()` function and the two integers are stored in the variables `x` and `y`.
The code then enters a `while` loop that continues until y is less than 2 or 10x + y is less than 22.
Inside the loop, the code first checks if y is greater than 1 and if x * 10 + y is greater than 21. If both conditions are true, the code sets t to the minimum of x and 2, subtracts t from x and y, and then checks if y is less than 2 or 10x + y is less than 22. If either of these conditions is true, the code sets CielWon to True and breaks out of the loop.
If the condition is not met, the code subtracts 2 from y and sets t to the minimum of 2 and y // 10. It then subtracts 10 * t from y and 2 - t from x.
The loop continues until y is less than 2 or 10x + y is less than 22.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the string "Ciel" if CielWon is True, or "Hanako" otherwise.
<<<Output>>>
