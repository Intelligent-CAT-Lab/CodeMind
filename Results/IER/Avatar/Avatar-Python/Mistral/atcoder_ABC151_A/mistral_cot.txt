<<<Analysis>>>
The code first prompts the user to enter a character using the `input()` function. The input is then converted to its ASCII value using the `ord()` function.
The ASCII value is then added 1 to get the next character in the ASCII table.
The resulting ASCII value is then converted back to a character using the `chr()` function.
The resulting character is then printed to the console using the `print()` function.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code would be the next character in the ASCII table after the input character.
For example, if the input character is 'a', the output would be 'b'.
If the input character is 'z', the output would be 'a'.
If the input character is 'A', the output would be 'B'.
If the input character is 'Z', the output would be 'a'.
