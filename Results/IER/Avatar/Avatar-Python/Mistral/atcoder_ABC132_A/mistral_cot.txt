 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first reads input from the user using the `input()` function and stores it in the variable `s`.
The `sorted()` function is then called on `s` to sort the elements in ascending order.
The code then checks if the first element of the sorted list is equal to the second element, and if the second element is equal to the third element. However, it also checks if the first element is not equal to the third element.
If all these conditions are met, the code prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
