 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input as a string, which is then split using the split() method to create a list of integers. The list is stored in the variable `a`.
The code then uses a for loop to iterate over each element in the list `a`. The loop variable `e` is used to keep track of the index of the current element in the list, and `i` is the current element itself.
Inside the loop, the code checks if the current element `i` is equal to 0. If it is, the code prints the value of `e + 1`, which is 1 in this case, and then breaks out of the loop using the `break` statement.
