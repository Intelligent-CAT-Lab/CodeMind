 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three integers as input, r, D and x.
The variable r is assigned the value 2, D is assigned the value 1 and x is assigned the value 2.
The code then enters a loop that iterates 10 times.
For each iteration, it calculates the value of x by multiplying r by x and subtracting D.
The value of x is then printed.
The final value of x after 10 iterations is 1024.
<<<Output>>>
1024
