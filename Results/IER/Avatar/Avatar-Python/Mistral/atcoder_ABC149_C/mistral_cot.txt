 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the math module.
It then prompts the user to enter a number N, which is 9552 in this case.
The function hoge is defined, which takes an integer n as input and returns True if n is prime, and False otherwise.
The function hoge checks if n is equal to 2, in which case it returns True.
If n is not equal to 2, it checks if n is divisible by any number x in the range [2, int(math.sqrt(n)+2)]. If it is, it returns False.
If none of these conditions are met, it returns True.
The while loop continues until hoge returns True for N.
In this case, the loop continues until N is 9553, at which point hoge returns True for N=9552, and the loop exits.
<<<Output>>>
9552
