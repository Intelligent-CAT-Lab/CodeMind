 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes two inputs separated by a space, which are stored in the variables a and b.
The variable b is then converted to an integer by removing the last character, which is a space, using slicing.
Finally, the code adds the integer value of a to the integer value of b and prints the result.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code would be 521595368 + 35005211 = 871144279.
