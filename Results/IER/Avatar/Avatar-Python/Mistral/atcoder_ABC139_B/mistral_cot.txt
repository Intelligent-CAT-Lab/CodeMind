 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, t and h.
The code first calculates the difference between h and 2, which is 6.
Then it calculates the difference between t and 1, which is 7.
Finally, it divides the difference between h and 2 by the difference between t and 1, which gives 0.
Since division by zero is undefined, the code will raise a ZeroDivisionError.
<<<Output>>>
ZeroDivisionError
