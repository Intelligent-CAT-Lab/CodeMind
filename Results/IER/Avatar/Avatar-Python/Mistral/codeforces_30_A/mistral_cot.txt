 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first converts the input string into a list using the `map()` function and the `int()` function. The list is stored in the variable `M`.
The code then extracts the first three elements of the list, which are stored in the variables `a`, `b`, and `n`.
The code then checks if `a` is not equal to 0. If it is not, it checks if `b` is divisible by `a`. If it is not, it prints "No solution". If it is, it calculates the remainder of `b` divided by `a` and stores it in the variable `b`.
The code then enters a loop that iterates until `y` is greater than or equal to `b`. For each iteration, it calculates the value of `y` using the formula `y = x^n` and increments `x` by 1.
If `y` is greater than `b`, it prints "No solution". Otherwise, it prints `x - 1`, which is the solution.
If `a` is equal to 0, the code prints 5.
If `b` is equal to 0, the code prints 5.
If `b` is not equal to 0 and `a` is not equal to 0, the code prints "No solution".
If `b` is not equal to 0 and `a` is equal to 0, the code prints "No solution".
If `b` is not equal to 0 and `a` is not equal to 0, the code prints the solution.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is 1.
