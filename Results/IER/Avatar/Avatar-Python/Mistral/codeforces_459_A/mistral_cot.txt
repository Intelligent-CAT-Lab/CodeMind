 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four integers as input, anti, b, c, and d.
It calculates the absolute difference between anti and c, and between b and d, and stores them in l and m, respectively.
Then it checks the conditions:
- If anti is equal to c, it prints anti + m, b, c + m, and d.
- If b is equal to d, it prints anti, b + l, c, and d + l.
- If l is not equal to m, it prints -1.
- If none of the above conditions are met, it prints anti, d, c, and b.
In this case, anti is 4, b is 0, c is 0, and d is 4.
l is 4, and m is 4.
Since anti is not equal to c, the code prints -1.
<<<Output>>>
-1
