 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an input string `number` and splits it into a list of integers using the `split()` method with the delimiter `'   '`. The resulting list is then converted to a list of integers using a list comprehension.
The variables `a`, `b`, and `k` are then assigned the values of the first, second, and third elements of the list, respectively.
The variable `res` is then calculated by subtracting `k` from `a`.
The code then checks if `res` is less than 0. If it is, it sets `a` to 0 and adds `res` to `b`. If `b` becomes negative, it is set to 0.
If `res` is not less than 0, it sets `a` to `res`.
Finally, the values of `a` and `b` are printed.
<<<Output>>>
