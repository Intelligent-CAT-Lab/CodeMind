 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports several modules, including `sys`, `heapq`, `bisect`, `math`, `itertools`, `string`, `queue`, and `datetime`.
It also sets the recursion limit to 10^8.
The `INF` variable is defined as the value of infinity.
The `mod` variable is defined as 10^9 + 7.
The `inpl` function takes a string input and returns a list of integers by splitting the string and converting each element to an integer.
The `inpls` function takes a string input and returns a list of integers by splitting the string.
The `N` variable is read from the input.
The `dsum` function takes an integer `x` and returns the sum of its digits by converting `x` to a string, splitting it into a list of characters, and then summing the list of characters.
The `ans` variable is initialized to infinity.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N-1.
For each iteration, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current number `a` and the sum of the digits of the remaining number `b` (N-a).
It then compares this sum with the current value of `ans` and updates `ans` if the new sum is smaller.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of `ans`.
