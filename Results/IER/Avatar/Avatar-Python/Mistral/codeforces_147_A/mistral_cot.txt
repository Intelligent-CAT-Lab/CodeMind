 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an input string `s` from the user.
It then defines a string `t` containing the characters `, . ? !`.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each character in `t`. For each character, it replaces all occurrences of `i` in `s` with `i + '   '`.
For example, if `i` is `,`, the string `s` will be replaced with `s.replace(',', ',' + '   ').
After the loop finishes, the code removes any leading or trailing spaces from `s` using the `strip()` method.
It then splits the string into a list of words using the `split()` method.
The code then enters another loop that iterates over each word in the list. For each word, it replaces any occurrences of `'   ' + i` with just `i`.
For example, if the word is `'   ' + ','`, it will be replaced with `','`.
After the loop finishes, the code joins the list of words back into a string using the `join()` method.
Finally, the code prints the resulting string.
