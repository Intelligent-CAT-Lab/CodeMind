 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, n and m, separated by a space. In this case, n is 87 and m is 34.
The code calculates the quotient q by dividing n by m, which is 2 in this case.
The remainder r is calculated by taking the modulo of n and m, which is 7 in this case.
The code then creates a list a of length m, initialized with the value of q.
The code then iterates over the remainder r, which is 7, and increments the value of a[i] by 1 for each i in the range [0, 6].
Finally, the code iterates over the list a and prints each element, separated by a space.
<<<Output>>>
2  2  2  2  2  2  2
