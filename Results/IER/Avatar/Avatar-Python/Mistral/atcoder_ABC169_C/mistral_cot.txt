 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes two inputs separated by a space, which are then split using the `split()` method. The resulting list is assigned to the variable `a`.
The variable `b` is then assigned the value of the first element of the list (which is `814793613347395`) plus all the elements of the list starting from the second element (which is `1.99`).
The variable `a` is then converted to an integer using the `int()` function.
The variable `b` is also converted to an integer using the `int()` function.
Finally, the result is printed by multiplying `a` and `b` and dividing by 100.
