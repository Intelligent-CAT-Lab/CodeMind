 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes two integers as input, a and b, separated by a space. In this case, a and b are both 6.
The variable c is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the maximum value of a and b.
The code then enters a loop that iterates twice.
For each iteration, it calculates the maximum value of a and b and adds it to c.
Since a and b are equal in this case, the maximum value is always a.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if a is greater than or equal to b. Since a and b are equal, this condition is not met.
Therefore, the code does not perform any subtraction operation.
The final value of c is 12.
<<<Output>>>
12
