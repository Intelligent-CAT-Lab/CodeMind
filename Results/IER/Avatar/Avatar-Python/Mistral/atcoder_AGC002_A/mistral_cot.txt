 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two inputs, a and b, separated by a space. The inputs are then converted to integers using the `map()` function.
The code then checks if a is less than or equal to 0 and b is less than or equal to 0. If both conditions are true, it prints "Zero".
If a is less than 0 and the absolute value of b - a is even, it prints "Negative".
If neither of the above conditions are true, it prints "Positive".
The input `-1000000000 -1` would result in a being -1000000000 and b being -1.
Since a is less than 0 and the absolute value of b - a is even, the code will print "Negative".
<<<Output>>>
Negative
