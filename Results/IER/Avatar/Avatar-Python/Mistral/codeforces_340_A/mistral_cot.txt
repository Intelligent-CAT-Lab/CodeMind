 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first defines two functions, GCD and LCM, which are used to calculate the greatest common divisor and the least common multiple of two numbers, respectively.
The code then reads four integers from the user, which are stored in the variables x, y, a and b.
The code calculates the least common multiple of x and y using the LCM function and stores the result in the variable lcm.
Finally, the code calculates the expression (b/lcm - (a-1)/lcm) and prints the result.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is 0.
