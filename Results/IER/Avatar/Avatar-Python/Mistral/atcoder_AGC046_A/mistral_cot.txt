 <<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by prompting the user to enter a value for X using the input() function. The value entered by the user is then converted to an integer using the int() function and stored in the variable X.
The variable a is initialized to 0 and the variable i is initialized to 1.
The code then enters an infinite loop using a while True statement.
Inside the loop, the value of X is added to the variable a and the remainder of a divided by 360 is checked using the modulo operator (%). If the remainder is 0, the value of i is printed and the loop is broken using the break statement.
If the remainder is not 0, the value of i is incremented by 1.
The loop continues until the remainder of a divided by 360 is 0.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is the value of i when the remainder of a divided by 360 is 0. In this case, the remainder of 0 divided by 360 is 0, so the value of i that is printed is 1.
Therefore, the return value of the code is 1.
