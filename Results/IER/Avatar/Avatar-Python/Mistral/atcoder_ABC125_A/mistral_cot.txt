 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three inputs separated by spaces, which are then converted to integers using the `map()` function. The variables `A`, `B`, and `T` are assigned the values `20`, `20`, and `19`, respectively.
The code then calculates the answer by dividing `T` by `A` and multiplying the result by `B`. The answer is `190`.
<<<Output>>>
190
