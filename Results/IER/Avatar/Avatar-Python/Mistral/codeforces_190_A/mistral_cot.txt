 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes two integers as input, n and m. In this case, n is 59 and m is 96.
The code then checks if n is less than 1, which is not true in this case.
Since n is not less than 1, the code checks if m is less than 1. This is also not true in this case.
Since neither n nor m is less than 1, the code proceeds to the next condition, which is if m is greater than n. In this case, m is greater than n, so the code sets min to m and max to n + m - 1.
The code then prints the values of min and max, which are 96 and 155, respectively.
<<<Output>>>
96 155
