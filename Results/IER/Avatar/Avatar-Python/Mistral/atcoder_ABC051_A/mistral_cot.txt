 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes input from the user and uses the `replace()` method to replace all occurrences of the substring `", "` with the substring `"   "`.
The `replace()` method returns a new string with all occurrences of the old substring replaced by the new substring.
In this case, the input string is `pnxnn,muduhzn,aquud`. The `replace()` method replaces all occurrences of the substring `", "` with the substring `"   "`, resulting in the string `pnxnn   muduhzn   aquud`.
<<<Output>>>
pnxnn   muduhzn   aquud
