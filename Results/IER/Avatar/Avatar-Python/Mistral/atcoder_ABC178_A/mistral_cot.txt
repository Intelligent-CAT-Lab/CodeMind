<<<Analysis>>>
The code prompts the user to enter a value for x using the input() function, which reads a line from the console and returns the value as an integer.
The code then checks if x is equal to 1 using an if-else statement.
If x is equal to 1, the code prints 0. Otherwise, it prints 1.
<<<Output>>>
0
