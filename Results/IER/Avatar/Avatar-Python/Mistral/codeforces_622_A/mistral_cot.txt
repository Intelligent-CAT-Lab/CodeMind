 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the `cmd` module, which is used to create a command-line interface.
The variable `n` is initialized to the input value, which is 99992.
The variable `l` is initialized to 1, and the variable `r` is initialized to `n`.
The code then enters a while loop that continues until `l` is less than `r`.
Inside the loop, the variable `mid` is calculated as the average of `l` and `r`.
The variable `idxcnt` is then calculated as the number of unique ASCII characters in the range `mid` to `mid+1`.
If `idxcnt` is less than `n`, the value of `l` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the value of `r` is decremented by 1.
After the loop finishes, the variable `idxcnt` is calculated again as the number of unique ASCII characters in the range `l` to `l+1`.
Finally, the code prints the value of `n - idxcnt`, which is 99991.
<<<Output>>>
99991
