 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input from the user using the `input()` function and stores it in the variable `n`.
The code then enters a `while` loop that continues to execute as long as `n` is even.
Inside the loop, `n` is divided by 2 using the `/=` operator, effectively removing the last digit from the number.
The loop continues until `n` is equal to 1, at which point the loop exits.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if `n` is equal to 1. If it is, the code prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".
<<<Output>>>
NO
