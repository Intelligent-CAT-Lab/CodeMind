 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes two integers as input, a1 and a2, which are 100 and 25, respectively.
The variable t is initialized to 0, which will be used to keep track of the number of iterations.
The code then checks if a1 is equal to 1 and a2 is equal to 1. Since this condition is not met, the code enters the while loop.
Inside the while loop, the code compares a1 and a2. If a1 is greater than a2, the code subtracts 2 from a1 and adds 1 to a2. If a1 is less than a2, the code subtracts 1 from a2 and adds 2 to a1.
The code continues to iterate until a1 is equal to 1 and a2 is equal to 1. At this point, the while loop terminates and the code prints the value of t, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
