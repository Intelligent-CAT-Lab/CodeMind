 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module, which provides a way to interact with the Python interpreter.
The main function is defined, which takes two arguments, S and W, which are integers.
The function then uses the input() function to get two integers separated by a space, which are then converted to integers using the map() function.
The function then checks if S is less than or equal to W. If it is, it prints "unsafe", otherwise it prints "safe".
The code then calls the main() function, passing the input values as arguments.
<<<Output>>>
safe
