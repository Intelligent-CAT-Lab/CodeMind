 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string input from the user and initializes two variables, num\_0 and num\_1, to 0.
It then iterates through each character in the string using a for loop.
If the current character is "0", it increments num\_0 by 1. Otherwise, it increments num\_1 by 1.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the minimum of num\_0 and num\_1 multiplied by 2.
<<<Output>>>
0
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
The return value of the code is 0 because the input string is empty.
