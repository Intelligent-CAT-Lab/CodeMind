 <<<Analysis>>>
The code reads input from the standard input (stdin) and stores it in the variable s.
It then checks if the string "A" and "B" are present in s using the "in" operator.
If both "A" and "B" are present in s, the result is set to "Yes". Otherwise, the result is set to "No".
The code then prints the result.
<<<Output>>>
No
