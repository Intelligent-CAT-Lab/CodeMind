 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes an integer input from the user using the `input()` function and stores it in the variable `N`.
The code then checks if `N` is even by using the modulo operator `%` and checking if the remainder is 0. If it is, the code prints 0.5.
If `N` is odd, the code calculates the average of `N` and 1 by dividing `N + 1` by `N` and then dividing the result by 2. The code then prints the result.
For the input `64`, the code first checks if `64` is even. Since it is, the code prints 0.5.
<<<Output>>>
0.5
