 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes two integers as input, separated by a space. The input is `75 25`.
The first integer is assigned to variable A and the second integer is assigned to variable B.
The variable ans is then calculated as A - 2 * B.
The value of ans is then checked to see if it is less than 0. If it is, it is set to 0.
Finally, the value of ans is printed to the console.
<<<Output>>>
0
