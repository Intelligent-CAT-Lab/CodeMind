 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three input values, T, s and q, which are 100000, 3125 and 2 respectively.
The variable v is calculated as (q - 1) / q, which is 1.
The variable tm is initialized to 1.
The variable t is calculated as s / (1 - v), which is 3125.
The code enters a while loop that continues until the condition (T - s) / v - t > 0 is no longer true.
Inside the loop, the code checks if the condition (T - s) / v - t < 1e-10 is true. If it is, the loop breaks.
If the condition is not true, the code updates the values of s and t using the formula s += v \* t and t = s / (1 - v).
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of tm, which is 1.
