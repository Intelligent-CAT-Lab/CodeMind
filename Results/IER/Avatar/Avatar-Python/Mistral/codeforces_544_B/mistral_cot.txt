 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes a list of integers as input, which is `[100, 10000]`.
It initializes the variables `start`, `arr`, and `count` to 0.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to 100 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 100.
For each number i in this range, it initializes a string variable `string` to an empty string.
It then enters another loop that iterates from 0 to 100 (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 0 to 100.
For each number j in this range, it checks if the current count is less than the second number in the input list (which is 10000). If it is, it checks if j is equal to the current next number. If it is, it adds " L " to the string and increments the count and next number. If it is not, it adds " S " to the string.
After the inner loop finishes, it appends the string to the `arr` list.
After the outer loop finishes, it checks if the count is less than the second number in the input list. If it is, it prints " NO ". Otherwise, it prints " YES " and then prints each element of the `arr` list.
In this case, the count is 100, which is less than 10000, so the code prints " NO ".
