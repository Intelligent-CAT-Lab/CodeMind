 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first prompts the user to enter a sentence using the `input()` function. The input sentence is stored in the variable `sentence`.
The variable `start` is initialized to -1 and the variable `letter` is initialized to an empty string.
The code then enters a `while` loop that continues until the `start` variable is less than 0.
Inside the loop, the code checks if the character at the `start` index of the `sentence` string is not a space or a question mark. If it is not, it assigns the character to the `letter` variable and breaks out of the loop.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if the `letter` variable is in the set of vowels ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'y']. If it is, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'.
<<<Output>>>
NO
