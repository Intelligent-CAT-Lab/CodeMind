 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys and collections modules.
It then reads an integer K from the user, which is 260522.
The variable cnt is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of times the loop runs.
The variable now is initialized to 0, which will be used to keep track of the current value of the loop counter.
The code then checks if K is even. If it is, it prints -1 and exits the program.
If K is odd, it enters a loop that iterates from 1 to 10^6 (inclusive).
For each iteration of the loop, it increments cnt and updates the value of now by multiplying it by 10 and adding 7, then taking the remainder when dividing by K.
If now is 0, it means that the loop counter has reached a multiple of K, so it prints the value of cnt and exits the program.
After the loop finishes, it prints -1 because the loop counter did not reach a multiple of K.
<<<Output>>>
-1
