 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three input values separated by spaces, which are 501719768609305159, 370614275896614890 and 131105492712690269.
The variable N is assigned the value of the first input, which is 501719768609305159.
The variable A is assigned the value of the second input, which is 370614275896614890.
The variable B is assigned the value of the third input, which is 131105492712690269.
The variable ans is initialized to 0.
The code then calculates ans using the formula ans = N // ( A + B ) \* A.
The variable rem is assigned the value of N % ( A + B ).
The code then calculates ans += min ( rem , A ).
Finally, the code prints the value of ans.
