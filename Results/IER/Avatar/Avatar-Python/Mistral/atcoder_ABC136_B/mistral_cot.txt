 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an integer input n and initializes a variable cnt to 0.
It then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to n+1.
For each number i in this range, it converts i to a string and checks if its length is odd. If it is, it increments cnt.
The condition is met when i is 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 39, 41, 43, 45, 47, 49, 51, 53, 55, 57, 59, 61, 63, 65, 67, 69, 71, 73, 75, 77, 79, 81, 83, 85, 87, 89, 91, 93, 95, 97, 99.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of cnt, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
