 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input as a string, which is then split using the split() method to create a list of integers. The list of integers is then converted to a tuple using the map() function and the int() function. The resulting tuple is stored in the variable ABC.
The code then checks if the count of the number 5 in the tuple ABC is equal to 2. In this case, it is not, so the code moves on to the next condition.
The code then checks if the sum of the elements in the tuple ABC is equal to 17. In this case, it is not, so the code returns 'NO'.
<<<Output>>>
NO
