 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module and sets the input function to read from standard input.
It also defines three lambda functions: ii, mi, and li, which are used to read input from the user.
The code then reads the input from the user and stores it in the variables d, t, a, b, da, and db.
The solve function is then called, which iterates through all possible combinations of i and j within the range of t.
For each combination, it checks if the condition a - da \* i + b - db \* j == d or a - da \* i == d or b - db \* j == d or d == 0 is met.
If the condition is met, it prints "YES" and returns. If not, it prints "NO" and continues to the next combination.
For the given input of 3 1 20 15 17 5, the condition is met when i = 1 and j = 1, so the function prints "YES" and returns.
<<<Output>>>
YES
