 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input as a string and splits it using the split() method. The resulting list contains two elements, vamshi and z.
The code then converts both vamshi and z to integers using the map() function.
The code then calculates the quotient of vamshi and z, which is 999999999.
The code then adds 1 to the quotient, which gives 999999999.
Finally, the code multiplies the result by z, which is 1.
Therefore, the final result is 999999999.
<<<Output>>>
999999999
