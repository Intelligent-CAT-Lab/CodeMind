 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes four integers as input, separated by spaces. These integers are stored in the variables a, b, c and d.
The code then uses the max() function to find the maximum of 0 and the minimum of b and d, minus the maximum of a and c.
The max() function returns the maximum value among its arguments, while the min() function returns the minimum value among its arguments.
The final expression is:
max(0, min(b, d) - max(a, c))
Substituting the values of a, b, c and d from the input, we get:
max(0, min(50, 100) - max(50, 50))
Simplifying this expression, we get:
max(0, 50 - 100)
max(0, -50)
Therefore, the return value of the code is 0.
