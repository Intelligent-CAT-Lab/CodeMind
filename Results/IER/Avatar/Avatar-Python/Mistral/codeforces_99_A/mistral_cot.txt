 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes input from the user, which is a string in the format "8.3". The input is then split using the " . " delimiter, resulting in a list with two elements: "8" and "3".
The code then checks the last element of the first element of the list, which is "8". Since it is not equal to 9, the code moves on to the next condition.
The code then checks the first element of the second element of the list, which is "3". Since it is not greater than or equal to 5, the code prints the first element of the list, which is "8".
<<<Output>>>
8
