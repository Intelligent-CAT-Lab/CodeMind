 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first takes four integers as input, separated by spaces. These integers are stored in the variables x1, y1, x2 and y2.
The variables a and b are then calculated as the difference between x2 and x1, and y2 and y1, respectively.
Finally, the code prints the values of x2 - b, y2 + a, x1 - b and y1 + a.
