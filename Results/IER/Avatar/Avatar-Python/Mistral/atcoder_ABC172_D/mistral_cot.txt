 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports several modules, including `collections`, `heapq`, `bisect`, `sys`, `random`, `itertools`, and `math`.
It also sets the recursion limit to 10^5.
The `input` variable is set to `sys.stdin.readline`, which allows the program to read input from the standard input stream.
The `sqrt` function is defined using the `math.sqrt` function.
The `LI`, `LF`, `LI_`, `II`, `IF`, `S`, `LS`, `IR`, `LIR`, `FR`, `LFR`, `LIR_`, and `SR` functions are defined as helper functions to parse input and perform various operations.
The `mod` and `inf` variables are defined as constants.
The `solve` function is the main function that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the answer.
The function first calculates the value of `ans` by iterating over all possible values of `i` from 1 to `n`.
For each value of `i`, it calculates the value of `x = n // i` and adds `i * (1 + x) * x // 2` to `ans`.
Finally, the function prints the value of `ans`.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is the value of `ans`, which is 9995083.
