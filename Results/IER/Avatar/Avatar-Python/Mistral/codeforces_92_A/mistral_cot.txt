 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the sys module, which provides access to some system-specific information and functions.
The input function is then redirected to sys.stdin.readline, which reads a line from standard input.
The input is then split using the split() method, which splits the input string into a list of words based on the specified delimiter (in this case, a space).
The first two words are then converted to integers using the map() function and assigned to the variables n and m.
The variable i is initialized to 0 and enters an infinite loop.
Inside the loop, the code checks if i + 1 is greater than m. If it is, the loop breaks and the variable ans is set to m.
If i + 1 is not greater than m, the code subtracts i + 1 from m and increments i by 1. The remainder of i divided by n is then calculated using the modulo operator (%).
The loop continues until i + 1 is greater than m.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the value of ans.
