Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
a, b = input ( ). split ( )
b = b [ 0 ] + b [ 2 : ]
a = int ( a )
b = int ( b )
print ( a * b // 100 )


<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
814793613347395 1.99

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable a and variable b are initialized to 814793613347395 and 1.99, respectively.
The variable b is modified to remove the decimal point and the last two digits, which are 99.
The variable a is converted to an integer.
The variable b is converted to an integer.
The code calculates the quotient of a and b, which is 514793613347395.
The code then divides this quotient by 100, which is 51479361334739.5.
The code rounds this result down to the nearest integer, which is 51479361334739.
The code then prints the final value of this rounded result, which is 51479361334739.

The output of code execution is:
51479361334739
END-OF-OUTPUT
