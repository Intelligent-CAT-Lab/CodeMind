Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
a, b = map ( int, input ( ). split ( ) )
x = a
h = 0
s = 0
while x > 0 :
    x -= 1
    h += 1
    s += 1
while s // b!= 0 :
    h += 1
    s = s - b + 1
print ( h )


<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
80 970

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable a and variable b are initialized to 80 and 970, respectively.
The variable x is initialized to a, which is 80.
The variable h is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the number of times the loop is executed.
The variable s is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of the digits of x.

The first while loop executes until x becomes 0. In each iteration of the loop, x is decremented by 1, and h is incremented by 1. At the end of the loop, h will contain the number of times the loop is executed.

The second while loop executes until s is divisible by b. In each iteration of the loop, h is incremented by 1, and s is updated by subtracting b and adding 1. At the end of the loop, h will contain the minimum number of times the loop is executed to get a sum of digits that is divisible by b.

The final value of h is printed as the output of the code execution.

The output of code execution is:
1
