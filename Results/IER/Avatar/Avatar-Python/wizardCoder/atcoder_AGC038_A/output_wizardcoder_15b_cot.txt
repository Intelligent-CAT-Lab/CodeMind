Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
import sys
def solve ( H : int, W : int, A : int, B : int ) :
    answer = [ [ "0" ] * W for _ in range ( H ) ]
    for i in range ( H ) :
        for j in range ( W ) :
            if i < B :
                if j < A :
                    answer [ i ] [ j ] = "0"
                else :
                    answer [ i ] [ j ] = "1"
            else :
                if j < A :
                    answer [ i ] [ j ] = "1"
                else :
                    answer [ i ] [ j ] = "0"
    for i in range ( H ) :
        print (''. join ( answer [ i ] ) )
    return
def main ( ) :
    def iterate_tokens ( ) :
        for line in sys. stdin :
            for word in line. split ( ) :
                yield word
    tokens = iterate_tokens ( )
    H = int ( next ( tokens ) )
    W = int ( next ( tokens ) )
    A = int ( next ( tokens ) )
    B = int ( next ( tokens ) )
    solve ( H, W, A, B )
if __name__ =='_ _ main _ _':
    main ( )


<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
1000 1000 0 0

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The code is a solution to the problem of painting a rectangle with alternating colors. The input is the height and width of the rectangle, and the starting and ending positions of the rectangle. The output is the rectangle with alternating colors.

The code first initializes a 2D list of size H x W, where H is the height of the rectangle and W is the width of the rectangle. It then iterates through the rows of the rectangle and sets the color of each cell based on whether the row is within the range [B, H-B] or not. If the row is within the range [B, H-B], it sets the color of each cell based on whether the column is within the range [A, W-A] or not. If the column is within the range [A, W-A], it sets the color of the cell to "1", otherwise it sets the color of the cell to "0".

After the coloring is done, the code iterates through the rows of the rectangle and prints each row as a space-separated string.

The output of code execution is:

END-OF-OUTPUT
