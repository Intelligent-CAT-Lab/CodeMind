Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
from cmd import IDENTCHARS
n = int ( input ( ) )
l = 1
r = n
while ( l < r ) :
    mid = l + ( r - l ) // 2
    idxcnt = mid * ( mid + 1 ) / 2
    if ( idxcnt < n ) :
        l = mid + 1
    else :
        r = mid
l -= 1
idxcnt = l * ( l + 1 ) / 2
print ( int ( n - idxcnt ) )


<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
99992

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable n is initialized to 99992.
The variable l is initialized to 1, and variable r is initialized to n.
The code enters a while loop that continues as long as l is less than r.
The variable mid is calculated as the average of l and r, rounded down to the nearest integer.
The variable idxcnt is calculated as the sum of integers from 1 to mid, inclusive.
If idxcnt is less than n, then the code sets l to mid + 1, and continues the loop.
If idxcnt is greater than or equal to n, then the code sets r to mid, and continues the loop.
After the loop finishes, the code sets l to l - 1, and calculates the new value of idxcnt as l * ( l + 1 ) / 2.
The code then subtracts n from idxcnt and prints the result, which is 99992 - 99992 = 0.

The output of code execution is:
0
