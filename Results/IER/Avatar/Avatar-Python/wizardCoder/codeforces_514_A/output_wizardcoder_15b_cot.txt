Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
ip = input ( )
st = " "
if len ( ip )!= 1 :
    if ip [ 0 ] == "9" :
        st = "9"
        ip = ip [ 1 : ]
    for i in ip :
        if int ( i ) > 4 :
            n = 9 - int ( i )
            st += str ( n )
        else :
            st += i
else :
    st = ip
print ( int ( st ) )


<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
5728

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable ip is initialized to "5728".
The variable st is initialized to " ".
The code checks if the length of ip is not equal to 1. If it is not, it checks if the first character of ip is "9". If it is, it sets st to "9" and removes the first character of ip using slicing.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each character i in ip.
If the integer value of i is greater than 4, it calculates the difference between 9 and the integer value of i and appends the result as a string to st.
If the integer value of i is less than or equal to 4, it simply appends i as a string to st.
After the loop finishes, the code converts the string st to an integer using the int() function and prints the result.

The output of code execution is:
5728
END-OF-OUTPUT
