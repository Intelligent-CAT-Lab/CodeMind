Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
txt = input ( )
out = " "
cap = 0
small = 0
for t in txt :
    if t. islower ( ) :
        small += 1
    else :
        cap += 1
if small >= cap :
    for t in txt :
        out += t. lower ( )
else :
    for t in txt :
        out += t. upper ( )
print ( out )


<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
CDOZDPBVVVHNBJVBYHEOXWFLJKRWJCAJMIFCOZWWYFKVWOGTVJcuusigdqfkumewjtdyitveeiaybwrhomrwmpdipjwiuxfnwuz

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable txt is initialized to "CDOZDPBVVVHNBJVBYHEOXWFLJKRWJCAJMIFCOZWWYFKVWOGTVJcuusigdqfkumewjtdyitveeiaybwrhomrwmpdipjwiuxfnwuz".
The variable out is initialized to " ", which will be used to accumulate the output string.
The variables cap and small are initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of capital and lowercase letters, respectively.
The code then enters a loop that iterates over each character t in the input string txt.
If the character t is lowercase, it increments the variable small.
If the character t is uppercase, it increments the variable cap.
After the loop finishes, the code checks if small is greater than or equal to cap.
If it is, the code enters another loop that iterates over each character t in the input string txt.
For each character t, it converts it to lowercase and appends it to the output string out.
If small is less than cap, the code enters another loop that iterates over each character t in the input string txt.
For each character t, it converts it to uppercase and appends it to the output string out.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of out, which is "cdozdpbvvvhnbjvbyheoxwfljkrwjcajmifcozwwyfkvwogtvjcuusigdqfkumewjtdyitveeiaybwrhomrwmpdipjwiuxfnwuz".

The output of code execution is:
cdozdpbvvvhnbjvbyheoxwfljkrwjcajmifcozwwyfkvwogtvjcuusigdqfkumewjtdyitveeiaybwrhomrwmpdipjwiuxfnwuz
