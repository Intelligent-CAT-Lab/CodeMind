Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
anti, b, c, d = map ( int, input ( ). split ( ) )
l = abs ( anti - c ) ; m = abs ( b - d )
if anti == c : print ( anti + m, b, c + m, d )
elif b == d : print ( anti, b + l, c, d + l )
elif l!= m : print ( - 1 )
else : print ( anti, d, c, b )


<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
4 0 0 4

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variables anti, b, c, and d are initialized to 4, 0, 0, and 4, respectively.
The variables l and m are initialized to the absolute difference between anti and c and b and d, respectively.
The code checks if anti is equal to c. If it is, it prints the sum of anti and m, b, and the sum of c and m.
If anti is not equal to c, the code checks if b is equal to d. If it is, it prints the values of anti, the sum of b and l, c, and the sum of d and l.
If l is not equal to m, the code prints -1.
If l is equal to m, the code prints the values of anti, d, c, and b.

The output of code execution is:
0 4 4 0
END-OF-OUTPUT
