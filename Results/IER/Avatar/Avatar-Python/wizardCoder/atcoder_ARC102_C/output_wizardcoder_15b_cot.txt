Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
K, N = map ( int, input ( ). split ( ) )
mod = 998244353
def inved ( a ) :
    x, y, u, v, k, l = 1, 0, 0, 1, a, mod
    while l!= 0 :
        x, y, u, v = u, v, x - u * ( k // l ), y - v * ( k // l )
        k, l = l, k % l
    return x % mod
X = [ 0 for i in range ( 2 * K - 1 ) ]
frac = [ 1 ]
for i in range ( N + K ) :
    frac. append ( ( ( i + 1 ) * frac [ i ] ) % mod )
invf = [ ]
for i in range ( N + K + 1 ) :
    invf. append ( inved ( frac [ i ] ) )
for k in range ( 2, K + 2 ) :
    S = 0
    sign = 1
    l = k // 2
    for m in range ( min ( l + 1, N // 2 + 1 ) ) :
        prod = ( sign * ( frac [ l ] * frac [ N + K - 2 * m - 1 ] ) ) % mod
        prod *= ( invf [ m ] * invf [ l - m ] ) % mod
        prod %= mod
        prod *= ( invf [ N - 2 * m ] * invf [ K - 1 ] ) % mod
        prod %= mod
        S += prod
        S %= mod
        sign *= - 1
    X [ k - 2 ], X [ 2 * K - k ] = S, S
for i in range ( 2 * K - 1 ) :
    print ( X [ i ] )


<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
1 200000

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable K and variable N are initialized to 1 and 200000, respectively.
The variable mod is initialized to 998244353, which is a prime number.

The function inved(a) takes an integer a as input and returns its inverse modulo mod. It uses the extended Euclidean algorithm to compute the inverse.

The variables X and frac are initialized to a list of zeros and a list of ones, respectively. The variable invf is initialized to an empty list.

The loop iterates from 0 to N+K, which is 200000+1=200001. For each iteration, the variable frac is updated by multiplying it with the next element of the sequence. The variable invf is updated by computing its inverse using the function inved(a).

The loop iterates from 2 to K+2, which is 1+2=3. For each iteration, the variable S is initialized to 0. The variable sign is initialized to 1. The variable l is initialized to k//2. The loop iterates from 0 to min(l+1,N//2+1), which is 0 to min(1+1,200000//2+1)=100000. For each iteration, the variable prod is computed as follows:

prod = sign * ( frac[l] * frac[N+K-2*m-1] ) % mod
prod *= ( invf[m] * invf[l-m] ) % mod
prod %= mod
prod *= ( invf[N-2*m] * invf[K-1] ) % mod
prod %= mod

The variable S is updated by adding prod to it. The variable sign is updated by multiplying it with -1.

The variables X and X[2*K-k] are updated by swapping their values.

The loop iterates from 0 to 2*K-1, which is 0 to 200000-1=199999. For each iteration, the variable X[i] is printed.

The output of code execution is:
0
1
