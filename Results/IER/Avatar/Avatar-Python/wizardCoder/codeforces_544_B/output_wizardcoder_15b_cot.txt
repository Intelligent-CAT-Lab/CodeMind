Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
I want you to act as a Python code executor. I will give you a piece of Python code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
Consider the following code:
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
sum_1 = 0
for i in range(1,N+1):
    sum_order = 0
    i_str = str(i)
    n = len(i_str)
    for j in range(0,n):
        sum_order += int(i_str[j])
    if A <= sum_order <= B:
        sum_1 += i
print(sum_1)

<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized to 20, 2 and 5, respectively.
variable sum_1 is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the sum of numbers meeting the condition.
The code then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive), meaning it will consider numbers from 1 to 20.
For each number i in this range, it calculates the sum of its digits and stores it in sum_order.
The code checks if sum_order is within the range [A, B], which is [2, 5] in this case. If it is, it adds the current number i to sum_1. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, the code prints the final value of sum_1, which is 84.


The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
numbers = list ( map ( int, input ( ). split ( ) ) )
start = 0
arr = [ ]
count = 0
for i in range ( 0, numbers [ 0 ] ) :
    string = " "
    next = start
    for j in range ( 0, numbers [ 0 ] ) :
        if count < numbers [ 1 ] :
            if j == next :
                string +='L '
                count += 1
                next += 2
                if next >= numbers [ 0 ] :
                    start = 1 if start == 0 else 0
            else :
                string += " S "
        else :
            string += " S "
    arr. append ( string )
if count < numbers [ 1 ] :
    print ( " NO " )
else :
    print ( " YES " )
    for i in arr :
        print ( i )


<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
100 10000

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable numbers is initialized to a list of integers, where the first element is 100 and the second element is 10000.
The variable start is initialized to 0, which will be used to keep track of the starting position of the next L in the pattern.
The variable arr is initialized to an empty list, which will be used to store the pattern.
The variable count is initialized to 0, which will be used to keep track of the number of L's in the pattern.

The code then enters a loop that iterates from 0 to numbers[0]-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider 100 positions in the pattern.
For each position i in this range, it creates a string variable called "string" that will be used to store the pattern for this position.
The variable next is initialized to start, which will be used to keep track of the next L position in the pattern.
The code then enters another loop that iterates from 0 to numbers[0]-1 (inclusive), meaning it will consider 100 positions in the pattern.
For each position j in this range, it checks if count is less than numbers[1]. If it is, it checks if j is equal to next. If it is, it adds a L to the string and increments count by 1. It then increments next by 2 and checks if next is greater than or equal to numbers[0]. If it is, it sets start to 1 if start is 0, or to 0 if start is 1. This ensures that the pattern alternates between L's and S's. If j is not equal to next, it adds a S to the string. If count is equal to numbers[1], it adds a S to the string regardless of the value of j.
After the inner loop finishes, the code appends the string to the arr list.

After the outer loop finishes, the code checks if count is less than numbers[1]. If it is, it prints "NO" and stops. If count is equal to numbers[1], it prints "YES" and then prints each string in the arr list.

The output of code execution is:
YES
