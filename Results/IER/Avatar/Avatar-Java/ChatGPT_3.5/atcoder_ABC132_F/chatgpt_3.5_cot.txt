<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and variable k are initialized with 10 and 3 respectively according to the input. And variable mod is initialized with 1000000007.
It creates a Scanner object to read the input.
It initializes an ArrayList called len to store the lengths of the intervals.
It initializes a variable l with 1.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until l is less than or equal to n.
Inside the while loop, it calculates the value of r as n divided by (n / l).
It adds the difference between r and l plus 1 to the ArrayList len.
It updates the value of l to r + 1.
After the while loop finishes, it calculates the size of the ArrayList len and stores it in the variable q.
It initializes an array called dp with a length of k * (q + 1).
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to q.
Inside the for loop, it assigns the value of len.get(j - 1) plus dp[j - 1] to dp[j].
After the for loop finishes, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 1 to k - 1.
Inside the nested for loop, it assigns the value of dp[i * (q + 1) + j - 1] plus dp[(i - 1) * (q + 1) + q - j + 1] multiplied by len.get(j - 1) to dp[i * (q + 1) + j].
It takes the modulo of dp[i * (q + 1) + j] with mod.
After the nested for loop finishes, it prints the value of dp[k * (q + 1) - 1] as output.
