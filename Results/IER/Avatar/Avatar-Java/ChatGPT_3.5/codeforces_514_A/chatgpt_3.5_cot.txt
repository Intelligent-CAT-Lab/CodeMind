<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input number x and initializes an empty list called "list". It then enters a while loop that continues until x becomes 0. Inside the loop, it calculates the remainder of x divided by 10 and stores it in variable r. It then checks if 9 - r is less than r. If it is, it adds 9 - r to the list. Otherwise, it adds r to the list. After that, it updates the value of x by dividing it by 10.

After the while loop, it initializes two variables: pow with 0 and newNumber with 0. It then enters a for loop that iterates through the elements of the list. Inside the loop, it calculates the newNumber by adding the product of the current element of the list and 10 raised to the power of pow. It then increments the value of pow.

Finally, it prints the value of newNumber as the output.

In this case, the input number is 5728. The while loop will iterate 4 times, and the list will contain the elements [1, 2, 7, 4]. The for loop will iterate 4 times as well, and the newNumber will be calculated as 1 * 10^0 + 2 * 10^1 + 7 * 10^2 + 4 * 10^3, which is equal to 4721.
