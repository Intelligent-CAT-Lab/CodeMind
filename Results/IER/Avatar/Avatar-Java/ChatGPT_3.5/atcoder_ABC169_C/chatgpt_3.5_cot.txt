<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two inputs: a long integer and a double. The long integer is assigned to variable a and the double is assigned to variable b. 
Then, the code multiplies variable b by 100 and rounds it to the nearest long integer using Math.round(). The result is assigned to variable c.
Next, the code multiplies variable a by variable c and assigns the result to variable d.
Finally, the code divides variable d by 100 and prints the result as output.

In this case, the input values are 814793613347395 and 1.99.
Variable a is assigned the value 814793613347395.
Variable b is assigned the value 1.99.
Variable c is assigned the value 199.
Variable d is assigned the value 161932677114000.
The code then divides variable d by 100 and prints the result, which is 1619326771140.

<<<Output>>>
1619326771140
