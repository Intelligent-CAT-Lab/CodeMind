<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads four integers x1, y1, x2, y2 from the input. It then checks four conditions:
1. If x1 is equal to x2, it calculates the difference between y1 and y2 and adds it to x1. It then prints the values of x1, y1, x1, and y2.
2. If y1 is equal to y2, it calculates the difference between x1 and x2 and adds it to y1. It then prints the values of x1, y1, x2, and y2.
3. If the absolute difference between x1 and x2 is equal to the absolute difference between y1 and y2, it prints the values of x1, y2, x2, and y1.
4. If none of the above conditions are met, it prints -1.
In this case, x1 is equal to x2 and y1 is equal to y2, so the first condition is met. The code calculates the difference between y1 and y2 (4 - 0 = 4) and adds it to x1 (4 + 4 = 8). It then prints the values 8, 0, 8, and 4.
<<<Output>>>
8 ▁ 0 ▁ 8 ▁ 4
