<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers A and B from the input using the Scanner class.
Then it calculates the value of A - (B * 2) and checks if it is greater than 0.
If the result is greater than 0, it prints the result. Otherwise, it prints 0.
In this case, A = 75 and B = 25.
So the calculation would be 75 - (25 * 2) = 75 - 50 = 25.
Since 25 is not greater than 0, the code will print 0 as the output.
<<<Output>>>
0
