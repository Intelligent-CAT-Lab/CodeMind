<<<Analysis>>>
The variable number is initialized with 77777777 according to the input. And variable ans is initialized with -1, variable value is initialized with 0 and variable mask is initialized with 2.
It enters a while loop and it continues to execute the loop until the value of variable value is greater than or equal to the value of variable number.
Inside the while loop, it generates a binary string representation of the current value of variable mask and removes the first character from the string. Then it counts the number of zeros in the string and stores it in variable zeros.
It checks if the number of zeros is equal to the number of ones in the string. If it is not equal, it continues to the next iteration of the loop.
If the number of zeros is equal to the number of ones, it replaces all the zeros in the string with 4 and all the ones with 7. Then it converts the modified string to a long value and stores it in variable value.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable value as output.
<<<Output>>>
