<<<Analysis>>>
The variables x, y, a, and b are initialized with the values 5, 5, 3, and 2 respectively according to the input.
An ArrayList called res is created to store the results.
There is a nested for loop that iterates through the values of i and j. The outer loop iterates from a to x, and the inner loop iterates from b to y.
Inside the loop, it checks if i is less than or equal to j. If it is, it continues to the next iteration.
If i is greater than j, it adds the string representation of i and j to the res ArrayList.
After the loop finishes, it prints the size of the res ArrayList, which is the number of elements in the list.
Then it prints each element of the res ArrayList on a new line.
<<<Output>>>
3
3 ▁ 2
4 ▁ 2
4 ▁ 3
