The variable n is initialized with 29, and the array a is initialized with [27, 18, 2] according to the input. The array a is then sorted in ascending order.
The variable max is initialized with 0, and the array d is initialized with size n+1 and all elements set to -500.
The first element of d is set to 0.
Then, there is a nested for loop. The outer loop iterates from 0 to n, and the inner loop iterates from 0 to 2.
Inside the inner loop, it checks if the current value of i minus the current value of a[j] is greater than or equal to 0, and if the value of d[i - a[j]] is not equal to -1.
If the condition is true, it updates the value of d[i] to the maximum of its current value and the value of d[i - a[j]] plus 1.
After the loop finishes, it prints the value of d[n] as the output.
