<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four integers as input: a, b, c, and d. The input values are 0, 50, 50, and 100 respectively.
An array of size 101 is created.
The first for loop iterates from a (0) to b (50) and increments the value at each index of the array by 1.
The second for loop iterates from c (50) to d (100) and increments the value at each index of the array by 1.
After the two for loops, the array will have a value of 2 at indices 50 to 99 (inclusive).
The third for loop iterates through the array and counts the number of indices with a value of 2.
Finally, the value of ans is printed, which is the count of indices with a value of 2, which is 50.
<<<Output>>>
50
