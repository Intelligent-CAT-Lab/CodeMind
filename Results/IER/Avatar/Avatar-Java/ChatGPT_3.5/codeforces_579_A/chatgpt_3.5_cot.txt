<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 9 according to the input. The variable s is initialized with a space character " ".
It enters a while loop and it repeatedly divides n by 2 and calculates the remainder x. The remainder x is then concatenated to the string s.
After the while loop finishes, it initializes the variable ans with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates through each character in the string s. If the current character is '1', it increments the variable ans.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable ans as output, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>
