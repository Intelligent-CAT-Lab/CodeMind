The variable a is initialized with 8 and variable b is also initialized with 8 according to the input. And variable kuti is initialized with 1 and variable tap is initialized with 0.
It enters a while loop and it keeps iterating until the value of variable kuti is greater than or equal to variable b. Inside the loop, it updates the value of variable kuti by subtracting 1 and adding the value of variable a. And it increments the value of variable tap by 1 in each iteration.
In the first iteration, the value of variable kuti becomes 8 and the value of variable tap becomes 1.
In the second iteration, the value of variable kuti becomes 15 and the value of variable tap becomes 2.
In the third iteration, the value of variable kuti becomes 22 and the value of variable tap becomes 3.
Since the value of variable kuti is now greater than or equal to variable b, the loop terminates.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable tap as output, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>
