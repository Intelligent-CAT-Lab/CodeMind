<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string as input and initializes an array of characters, ar, with size 26. It then iterates through each character in the input string and increments the corresponding index in the ar array by 1. The index is calculated by subtracting the ASCII value of 'a' (97) from the ASCII value of the current character.

After counting the occurrences of each character, the code initializes a variable cntod to 0. It then iterates through the ar array and checks if the count of a character is odd (not divisible by 2). If it is, cntod is incremented by 1.

Finally, the code checks the value of cntod. If it is 0, it prints "First". Otherwise, it checks if cntod is divisible by 2. If it is, it prints "Second". Otherwise, it prints "First".

In this case, the input string is very long and not provided. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the output without the input string.

Cannot determine the output without the input string.
