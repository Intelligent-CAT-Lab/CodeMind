<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, `a` and `b`. It then checks three conditions:
1. If `a` is equal to `b`, it returns the value of `a` multiplied by 2.
2. If `a` is greater than `b`, it returns the value of `a` multiplied by 2 and subtracts 1.
3. If `a` is less than `b`, it returns the value of `b` multiplied by 2 and subtracts 1.

In this case, `a` and `b` are both 6, so the first condition is true. Therefore, the output will be 6 * 2 = 12.
<<<Output>>>
12
