<<<Analysis>>>
The variable a is initialized with 45 and variable b is initialized with 99 according to the input. And variable count is initialized with 0.
It enters a while loop and it continues to execute the loop until the condition becomes false. Inside the loop, it checks if both a and b are greater than 0. If they are, it increments the count variable by 1 and decrements both a and b by 1. This process continues until either a or b becomes 0.
After the loop finishes, it calculates the value of ans by dividing a by 2 and b by 2 and adding them together.
Finally, it prints the value of count and ans as output, which is "45 ▁ 21".
<<<Output>>>
45 ▁ 21
