<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 100 and variable count is initialized with 10000 according to the input.
Then it calls the method printIsland with the values of n and count as arguments.
Inside the method printIsland, it calculates the values of variables a and b based on the values of n.
Then it calculates the maximum possible count of 'L' characters that can be printed on the island using the formula a * a + b * b.
If the given count is greater than the maximum possible count, it prints "NO" and returns.
Otherwise, it prints "YES" and proceeds to create the island pattern.
It uses a nested for loop to iterate through each cell of the island.
If the sum of the row index and column index is even and the count is greater than 0, it appends 'L' to the StringBuilder and decrements the count.
Otherwise, it appends 'S' to the StringBuilder.
After the loops finish, it prints the final island pattern.
<<<Output>>>
YES
