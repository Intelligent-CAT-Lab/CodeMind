<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and variable k are initialized with 24 and 7440 respectively according to the input. And variable i and variable req are initialized with 1 and 1 respectively.
It enters a while loop and it checks if the difference between k and req is greater than or equal to 0. If it is, it subtracts req from k and assigns the result back to k. Otherwise, it breaks out of the loop.
Inside the loop, it increments i by 1. Then it checks if i modulo n is not equal to 0. If it is not, it assigns the value of i modulo n to req. Otherwise, it assigns the value of n to req.
The loop continues until the condition k - req >= 0 is no longer satisfied.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of k as output.
