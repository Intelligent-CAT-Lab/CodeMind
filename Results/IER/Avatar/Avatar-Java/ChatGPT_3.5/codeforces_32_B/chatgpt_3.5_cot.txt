<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes a string input and initializes an empty string variable str.
It then iterates through each character of the input string using a for loop.
Inside the loop, it checks if the current character is a '.'. If it is, it appends '0' to the str variable.
If the current character is '-' and the next character is '.', it appends '1' to the str variable.
Otherwise, it appends '2' to the str variable and increments the loop variable i by 1.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of the str variable as output.
In this case, the input string ".." has two '.' characters, so the output will be "00".
