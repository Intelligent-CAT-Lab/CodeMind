<<<Analysis>>>
The variable i is initialized with 1 according to the input. The variables k and j are initialized with 360 and 1 respectively. A Scanner object sc is created to read input from the user.
It checks if the input is an integer. If it is not, it prints an error message.
Then it parses the input as an integer and assigns it to variable i.
It checks if the value of i falls within the range [1, 179]. If it does, it enters a while loop.
Inside the while loop, it checks if the product of i and j is divisible by k. If it is not, it increments the value of j by 1 and continues the loop.
Once the condition is met, it prints the value of j as output, which is 360.
<<<Output>>>
360
