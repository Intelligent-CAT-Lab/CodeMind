The variable h, w, a, and b are initialized with 1000, 1000, 0, and 0 respectively according to the input. 
A StringBuilder object sb is created to store the output.
It enters a nested for loop to iterate through each row and column of the grid.
Inside the nested loop, it checks if the current column j is less than a XOR the current row i is less than b.
If the condition is true, it assigns the value 1 to variable x. Otherwise, it assigns the value 0 to variable x.
The value of x is appended to the StringBuilder object sb.
After the inner loop finishes, a new line character is appended to the StringBuilder object sb.
After the outer loop finishes, the final content of the StringBuilder object sb is printed as the output.
Since the input values of a and b are both 0, the condition j < a XOR i < b will always be false. Therefore, the value of x will always be 0.
As a result, the output will be a grid of 0s with dimensions 1000x1000.
<<<Output>>>
A grid of 0s with dimensions 1000x1000
