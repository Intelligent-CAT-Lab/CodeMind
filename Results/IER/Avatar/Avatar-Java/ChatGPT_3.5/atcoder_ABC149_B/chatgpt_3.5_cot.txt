<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three long integers as input: A, B, and K. It then calculates the value of n as A - K.
There are three possible scenarios:
1. If A + B is less than or equal to K, it prints "0 ▁ 0".
2. If n is less than 0, it prints "0 ▁ (A + B - K)".
3. Otherwise, it prints "n ▁ B".

In this case, A = 1000000000000, B = 1000000000000, and K = 1000000000000.
Since A + B is equal to K, the first condition is true and it will print "0 ▁ 0".

<<<Output>>>
0 ▁ 0
