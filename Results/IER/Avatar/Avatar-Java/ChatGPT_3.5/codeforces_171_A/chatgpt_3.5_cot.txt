<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers as input, a and b. It then calls the getNum() method and passes a and b as arguments. Inside the getNum() method, it initializes a variable reverseB to 0. It then enters a while loop where it repeatedly divides b by 10 and adds the remainder to reverseB after multiplying it by 10. This effectively reverses the digits of b. Once the loop finishes, it returns the sum of a and reverseB. Finally, the main method prints the value returned by getNum().

In this case, the input values are a = 35005211 and b = 521595368. The getNum() method reverses the digits of b, which becomes 863595125. The sum of a and reverseB is 35005211 + 863595125 = 898600336.
