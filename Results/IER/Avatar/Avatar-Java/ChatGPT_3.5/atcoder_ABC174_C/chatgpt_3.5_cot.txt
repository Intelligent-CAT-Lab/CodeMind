<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with the input value 260522. The variable num is initialized with 7 and the variable res is initialized with 1.
In the first while loop, it keeps multiplying num by 10 and adding 7 until num becomes greater than or equal to n. In this case, num becomes 777777.
The variable res is incremented each time the loop iterates, so res becomes 6.
Then, a HashSet named set is created.
In the second while loop, it checks if num is divisible by n. If it is, the loop breaks. Otherwise, it performs the following steps:
- num is updated to the remainder of num divided by n.
- res is incremented.
- It checks if num is already present in the set. If it is, it means that the loop is in an infinite cycle and res is set to -1. Then the loop breaks.
- If num is not present in the set, it is added to the set.
- num is updated by multiplying it by 10 and adding 7.

In this case, the loop breaks when num becomes 0, and res remains 6.

Finally, the value of res is printed as the output, which is 6.
