<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes three inputs from the user and stores them in variables num_1, num_2, and num_3 respectively.
Then it checks if num_1 is equal to 7. If it is, it checks if num_2 is equal to 5 and num_3 is equal to 5. If both conditions are true, it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".
If num_1 is not equal to 7, it checks if num_2 is equal to 7. If it is, it checks if num_1 is equal to 5 and num_3 is equal to 5. If both conditions are true, it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".
If num_2 is not equal to 7, it checks if num_3 is equal to 7. If it is, it checks if num_2 is equal to 5 and num_1 is equal to 5. If both conditions are true, it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".
In this case, num_3 is equal to 7 and num_1 and num_2 are equal to 5, so the condition in the third if statement is true and it prints "YES".
<<<Output>>>
YES
