<<<Analysis>>>
The variables A, B, and N are initialized with the values 7, 896, and 7 respectively according to the input. The variables bigA and bigB are initialized as BigInteger objects with the values of A and B respectively.

Then, a for loop is executed from -1000 to 1000. In each iteration, the code checks if the value of x raised to the power of N, multiplied by bigA, is equal to bigB. If it is, the value of x is printed and the program returns.

If no solution is found within the loop, the code prints "No solution".

In this case, the loop will not find a solution and the output will be "No solution".
<<<Output>>>
No solution
