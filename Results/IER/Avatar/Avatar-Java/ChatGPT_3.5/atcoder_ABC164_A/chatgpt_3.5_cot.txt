<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads the input using a Scanner object and stores each line of input in an ArrayList called scList. It continues reading input until an exception occurs, which happens when there is no more input to read.

Then, it splits the first line of input, which is "1 100", into an array of strings called numlist using the delimiter " ‚ñÅ ". The first element of numlist is assigned to the variable Sheep and the second element is assigned to the variable Wolve.

Finally, it checks if Wolve is greater than or equal to Sheep. If it is, it prints "unsafe". Otherwise, it prints "safe".

In this case, Wolve is not greater than or equal to Sheep, so the output would be "safe".
