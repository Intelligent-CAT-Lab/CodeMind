<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two long integers as input: monsterHP and servalATK.
It calculates the remainder of monsterHP divided by servalATK and stores it in the variable mod.
Then it calculates the integer division of monsterHP by servalATK and stores it in the variable ans.
If the remainder mod is greater than 0, it increments ans by 1.
Finally, it prints the value of ans as the output.
In this case, monsterHP is 10000 and servalATK is 1.
The remainder of 10000 divided by 1 is 0, so mod is 0.
The integer division of 10000 by 1 is 10000, so ans is 10000.
Therefore, the output would be 10000.
