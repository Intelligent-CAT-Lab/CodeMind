<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n, k, l, r, sAll, and sk are initialized with 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, and 1 respectively according to the input.
The code then calls the getPoints() method passing the input values as arguments.
Inside the getPoints() method, an array called ans is initialized with size n and all elements are filled with the value of l (which is 1).
Then, the variable sAll is updated by subtracting sk and (n-k)*l from it. In this case, sAll = 1 - 1 - (1-1)*1 = 0.
The variable sk is also updated by subtracting k*l from it. In this case, sk = 1 - 1*1 = 0.
Since sk is 0, the while loop that increments the elements of ans until sk becomes 0 is not executed.
Then, the while loop that increments the elements of ans until sAll becomes 0 is also not executed because sAll is already 0.
Finally, the array ans is returned.
The returned array is then printed in the main method using a for-each loop. Since the array has only one element and it is 1, the output will be 1.
