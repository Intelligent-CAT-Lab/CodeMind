<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads an integer n from the input. It initializes variables sum, total, and i with 0, and checks if n is equal to 2. If it is, it prints 1 and returns from the main method.
If n is not equal to 2, it enters a while loop. In each iteration of the loop, it subtracts 1 from n and checks if n is greater than 0. If it is, it enters an if statement.
Inside the if statement, it checks if n is greater than or equal to 2. If it is, it increments the variable total by 1. Then, it subtracts 2 from n.
After the if statement, it increments the variable total by 1.
The loop continues until n becomes 0. Then, it prints the value of total as the output.
In this case, since n is 999999991, the loop will iterate 499999995 times, and the value of total will be 499999996.
<<<Output>>>
499999996
