<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input from the user using the Scanner class. It then checks if the input string is equal to "AAA" or "BBB". If it is, it prints "No". Otherwise, it prints "Yes".
In this case, the input string is "BBA". Since it is not equal to "AAA" or "BBB", the code will print "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
