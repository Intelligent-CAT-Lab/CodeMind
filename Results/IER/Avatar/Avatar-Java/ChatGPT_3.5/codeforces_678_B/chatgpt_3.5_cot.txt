The variable y is initialized with 2096 according to the input. And variable leap is initialized with the result of calling the check_leap() method with y as argument. Variable sum is initialized with 0 and variable mod is initialized with 0.

It enters a for loop and it iterates from y+1 to infinity. In each iteration, it checks if the current year i is a leap year by calling the check_leap() method. If it is a leap year, it adds 366 to the variable sum. Otherwise, it adds 365 to the variable sum.

Then it checks if the variable sum is divisible by 7. If it is, it checks if the current year i is a leap year and the variable leap is also true, or if the current year i is not a leap year and the variable leap is also false. If the condition is met, it prints the current year i and returns from the main method. Otherwise, it continues to the next iteration of the loop.

Since there is no termination condition for the loop, it will continue to iterate until it finds a year that satisfies the condition.
