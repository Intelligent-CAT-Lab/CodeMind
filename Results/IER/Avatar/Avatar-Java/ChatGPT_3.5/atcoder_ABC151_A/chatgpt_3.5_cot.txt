<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes an input string using the Scanner class and stores it in the variable `s`. Then it extracts the first character of the string using the `charAt()` method and stores it in the variable `c`. Finally, it increments the value of `c` by 1 and prints the result.

In this case, the input string is "c". So, the value of `c` will be 'c'. When we increment 'c' by 1, it becomes 'd'. Therefore, the output will be "d".

<<<Output>>>
d
