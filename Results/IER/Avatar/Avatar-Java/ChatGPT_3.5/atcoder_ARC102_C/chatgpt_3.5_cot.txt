<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a 2D array nchoosek with size 4001x4001 and sets the values of the first column and diagonal to 1.
Then it iterates through the array and calculates the values of the remaining elements using the formula nchoosek[i][j] = nchoosek[i-1][j] + nchoosek[i-1][j-1] % mod.
After that, it reads two integers k and n from the input.
Then it enters a for loop that iterates from 2 to 2*k.
Inside the loop, it calculates the number of pairs and the number of active elements based on the value of i.
Then it calculates the total using a nested for loop and the values from the nchoosek array.
Finally, it prints the value of total.
The loop runs for each value of i and prints the corresponding total.
