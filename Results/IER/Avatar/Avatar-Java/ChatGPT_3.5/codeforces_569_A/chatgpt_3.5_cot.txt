<<<Analysis>>>
The variable t, variable s and variable q are initialized with 100000, 3125 and 2 respectively according to the input. And variable sum is initialized with 0.
It enters a while loop and it keeps multiplying the value of variable s by q until s becomes greater than or equal to t. In each iteration, it increments the value of variable sum by 1.
The loop stops when s becomes greater than or equal to t. In this case, the loop runs for 5 times and the value of sum becomes 5.
After the loop finishes, it print the final value of variable sum as output, which is 5.
<<<Output>>>
5
