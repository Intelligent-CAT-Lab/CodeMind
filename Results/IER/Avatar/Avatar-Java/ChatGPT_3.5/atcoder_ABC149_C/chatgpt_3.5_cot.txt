<<<Analysis>>>
The variable X is initialized with 9552 according to the input. And variable prime is initialized with X, variable mid is initialized with X/2 and variable flag is initialized with false.
It enters a while loop and it keeps iterating until a prime number is found. Inside the while loop, it enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to mid to check if the current number prime is divisible by any number i in this range. If it is divisible, it sets flag to true and breaks the loop.
After the for loop, it checks if flag is false. If it is false, it means the current number prime is a prime number, so it breaks the while loop. Otherwise, it sets flag to false and increments prime by 1.
Finally, it prints the value of prime as output, which is the next prime number after X.
<<<Output>>>
9553
