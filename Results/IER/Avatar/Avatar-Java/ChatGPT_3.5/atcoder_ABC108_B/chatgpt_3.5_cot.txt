The code takes four integers as input: x1, y1, x2, and y2. It then performs some calculations to find the values of x3, y3, x4, and y4. 

x3 is calculated by adding the difference between y1 and y2 to x2. 
y3 is calculated by subtracting the difference between x1 and x2 from y2. 
x4 is calculated by subtracting the difference between y2 and y1 from x1. 
y4 is calculated by adding the difference between x2 and x1 to y1. 

Finally, the code prints the values of x3, y3, x4, and y4 separated by spaces. 

In this case, the input is 2 3 6 6. 
So, x1 = 2, y1 = 3, x2 = 6, and y2 = 6. 

x3 = 6 + (3 - 6) = 6 - 3 = 3
y3 = 6 - (2 - 6) = 6 - 4 = 2
x4 = 2 - (6 - 3) = 2 - 3 = -1
y4 = 3 + (6 - 2) = 3 + 4 = 7

Therefore, the output would be "3 ▁ 2 ▁ -1 ▁ 7".
