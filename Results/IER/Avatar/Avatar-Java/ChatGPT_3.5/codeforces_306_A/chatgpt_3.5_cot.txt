The variable n and variable m are initialized with 87 and 34 respectively according to the input. 
It creates an OutputStreamWriter object osr and a PrintWriter object o using osr.
It creates a FastReader object fr.
It then enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to m - (n % m) - 1. Inside the loop, it prints the integer division of n by m followed by a space.
After the first loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from m - (n % m) to m - 1. Inside the loop, it prints the ceiling value of n divided by m followed by a space.
Finally, it closes the PrintWriter object o.
