<<<Analysis>>>
The variable num1 is initialized with 100 and variable num2 is initialized with 25 according to the input. And variable counter is initialized with 0.
It enters a while loop and it continues to execute the loop until either num1 or num2 becomes 0. Inside the loop, it checks if both num1 and num2 are equal to 1. If they are, it breaks out of the loop.
If num1 is less than or equal to num2, it increments num1 by 1 and decrements num2 by 2. Otherwise, it decrements num1 by 2 and increments num2 by 1.
After each iteration of the loop, it increments the counter by 1.
When either num1 or num2 becomes 0, it prints the final value of counter as output, which is 37.
<<<Output>>>
37
