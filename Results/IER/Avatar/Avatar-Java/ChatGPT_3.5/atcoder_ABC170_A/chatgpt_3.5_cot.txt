<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes an integer array called count with size 5 and all elements are initialized to 0. It also initializes an integer variable called answer to 0.
Then it enters a for loop that iterates 5 times. In each iteration, it reads an integer from the input and stores it in a variable called x. Then it adds the value of x to the corresponding element in the count array.
After that, it checks if the value of the current element in the count array is 0. If it is, it updates the value of the answer variable to the current index i.
Finally, it prints the value of the answer variable plus 1 as the output.

In this case, the input is "1 2 3 4 0". So, in the first iteration, x will be 1 and it will add 1 to the first element in the count array. Then it checks if the count[0] is 0, which is not the case. In the second iteration, x will be 2 and it will add 2 to the second element in the count array. Again, it checks if count[1] is 0, which is not the case. This process continues for the remaining iterations. In the last iteration, x will be 0 and it will add 0 to the fifth element in the count array. Since count[4] is 0, it updates the value of the answer variable to 4. Finally, it prints the value of the answer variable plus 1, which is 5.
