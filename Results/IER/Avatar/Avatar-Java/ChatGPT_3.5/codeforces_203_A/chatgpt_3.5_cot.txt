<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads the input values and assigns them to variables points, t, a, b, ta, and tb.
Then it enters a nested for loop, where the outer loop iterates t times and the inner loop also iterates t times.
Inside the nested loop, it checks four conditions:
1. If points is equal to a - i * ta + b - j * tb, it prints "YES" and returns.
2. If points is equal to 0, it prints "YES" and returns.
3. If points is equal to a - ta * i, it prints "YES" and returns.
4. If points is equal to b - tb * j, it prints "YES" and returns.

If none of the conditions are met, it prints "NO" after the nested loop finishes.

In this case, the nested loop only runs once because t is 1. So it checks the first condition and since it is not true, it prints "NO".

<<<Output>>>
NO
