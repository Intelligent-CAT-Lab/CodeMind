<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 2 and variable x is initialized with 1 according to the input.
It enters a while loop and checks if there is more input. Since there is input, it continues to execute the code inside the loop.
It checks if x is equal to 1 or 2 * N - 1. In this case, x is equal to 1, so the condition is true. It prints "No" and breaks out of the loop.
Therefore, the output would be "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
