<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with the value 9995083 according to the input. The variable ans is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 9995083 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of ans by multiplying i with the floor division of n by i, then multiplying it with the sum of the floor division of n by i and the floor division of n by i plus 1, and finally dividing it by 2.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of ans as output.
