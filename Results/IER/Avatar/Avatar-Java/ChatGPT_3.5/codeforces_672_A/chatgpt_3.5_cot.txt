The variable n is initialized with 952 according to the input. And variable s is initialized with a space character " ".
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 952. In each iteration, it concatenates the current integer i to the string s.
After the loop finishes, it prints the character at index (n-1) of the string s as output. Since the index is 0-based, the character at index 951 will be printed.
