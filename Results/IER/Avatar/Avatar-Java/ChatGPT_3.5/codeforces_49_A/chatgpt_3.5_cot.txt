<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input from the user and trims any leading or trailing whitespace. It then extracts the last character of the input string and stores it in the variable 'ch'. 
An array of vowels is defined as {"A", "E", "I", "O", "U", "Y"}. The code checks if the last character 'ch' is present in the array of vowels, ignoring case sensitivity. 
If the last character is a vowel, it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".
In this case, the last character is '?', which is not a vowel. Therefore, the output will be "NO".
<<<Output>>>
NO
