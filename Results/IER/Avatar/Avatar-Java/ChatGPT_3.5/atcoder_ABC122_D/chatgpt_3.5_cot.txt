The variable N is initialized with 99 according to the input. The variable MOD is initialized with 1000000007L. The variable TOKENS is initialized with an array of strings {"A", "C", "G", "T"}. The variable memo is initialized as an array of maps, where each map is initialized as an empty HashMap. 

The constructor reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable N. It also initializes the memo array with N+1 maps.

The calc() method calls the dfs() method with initial parameters 0 and "TTT" and returns the result.

The isOK() method checks if the given string last4 contains the substring "AGC". If it does, it returns false. Otherwise, it checks if any of the three adjacent characters can be swapped to form the substring "AGC". If it can, it returns false. Otherwise, it returns true.

The dfs() method checks if the memo array already contains a value for the current index and last3 string. If it does, it returns the stored value. If the current index is equal to N, it returns 1. Otherwise, it initializes the result variable as 0. It iterates over each string in the TOKENS array and checks if the last3 string concatenated with the current string is valid according to the isOK() method. If it is, it recursively calls the dfs() method with the current index incremented by 1 and the last3 string updated by removing the first character and adding the current string. It adds the result of the recursive call to the result variable. Finally, it stores the result in the memo array and returns the result.

The main method creates an instance of the Main class and calls the calc() method. It prints the result of the calc() method.
