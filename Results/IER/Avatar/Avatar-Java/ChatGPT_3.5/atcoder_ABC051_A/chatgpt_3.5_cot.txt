<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read input from the standard input. It sets the delimiter to "," using the `useDelimiter` method.
Then it reads three strings from the input using the `next` method of the Scanner object and assigns them to variables a, b, and c respectively.
Finally, it prints the concatenation of the three strings separated by " ▁ ".

In this case, the input is "pnxnn,muduhzn,aquud". The Scanner object will split the input at each "," and assign the substrings to variables a, b, and c.
So, a = "pnxnn", b = "muduhzn", and c = "aquud".
The output will be the concatenation of the three strings separated by " ▁ ", which is "pnxnn ▁ muduhzn ▁ aquud".

<<<Output>>>
pnxnn ▁ muduhzn ▁ aquud
