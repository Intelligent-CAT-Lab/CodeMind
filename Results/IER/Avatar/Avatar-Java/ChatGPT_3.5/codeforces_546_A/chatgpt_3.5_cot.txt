<<<Analysis>>>
The variable o, variable g and variable n are initialized with 1000, 1000 and 1000000000 respectively according to the input. And variable x is initialized with 0 and variable borrow is initialized with 0.
It reads the input values using the Scanner class.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 1000. In each iteration, it calculates the value of x by adding i multiplied by o to the current value of x.
After the loop finishes, it calculates the value of borrow by subtracting n from x.
Then it checks if borrow is less than or equal to 0. If it is, it prints 0. Otherwise, it prints the value of borrow.
In this case, borrow is greater than 0, so the output will be the value of borrow, which is 999999000.
<<<Output>>>
999999000
