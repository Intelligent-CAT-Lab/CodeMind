<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integers n and m as input. It then checks for different conditions and prints the output accordingly.

First, it checks if n is equal to 0. If it is, then it checks if m is also not equal to 0. If m is not equal to 0, it prints "Impossible". Otherwise, it prints "0 ▁ 0" and returns.

If n is not equal to 0, it checks if m is less than or equal to n. If it is, then it checks if m is equal to 0. If m is equal to 0, it assigns m the value 1. Then it prints "n ▁ (m + n - 1)" and returns.

If none of the above conditions are met, it prints "m ▁ (m + n - 1)".

In this case, n = 59 and m = 96. Since n is not equal to 0, it goes to the next condition. m is greater than n, so it prints "m ▁ (m + n - 1)".

<<<Output>>>
96 ▁ 154
