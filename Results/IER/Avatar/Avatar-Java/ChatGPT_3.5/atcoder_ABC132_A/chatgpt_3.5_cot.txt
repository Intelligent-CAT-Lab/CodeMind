<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input from the user and stores it in variable s.
Then it creates a set called chars and adds all the individual characters of the string to the set.
Next, it checks the size of the set. If the size is 2, it means that there are only 2 distinct characters in the string. In this case, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
In this case, the input string is "STOP", which has 4 distinct characters. Therefore, the output will be "No".
<<<Output>>>
No
