<<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four integers A, B, C, and D as input. It initializes a 2D array dp with size DxC and a 2D array sum with size DxC. It also initializes a constant variable MOD with the value 998244353. 

Then, it sets the value of sum[B-1][A-1] to 1.

Next, it enters a nested for loop. The outer loop iterates from A to C-1, and the inner loop iterates from B to D-1. Inside the loop, it calculates the value of dp[i][j] and sum[i][j] based on the previous values in the arrays. The calculations involve multiplication, addition, and modulo operations.

After the nested loop finishes, it initializes two variables ans and powC to 0 and 1 respectively.

Then, it enters another nested for loop. The outer loop iterates from D-1 to B, and the inner loop iterates from C-1 to A. Inside the loop, it calculates the value of ans based on the values in dp, powC, and powI. The calculations involve multiplication and modulo operations.

After the nested loop finishes, it calculates the final value of ans by adding the product of powC and sum[B-1][C-1] modulo MOD.

Finally, it prints the value of ans as the output.
