<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with the value 512 according to the input.
The code checks if the bitwise AND operation between n and (n-1) is equal to 0.
If the bitwise AND operation is equal to 0, it means that n is a power of 2.
In this case, n is 512 which is 2^9, so the condition is true.
Therefore, the code will print "YES" as the output.
<<<Output>>>
YES
