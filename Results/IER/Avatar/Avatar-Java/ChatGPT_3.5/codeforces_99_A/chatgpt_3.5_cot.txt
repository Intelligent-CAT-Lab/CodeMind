<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads a string input from the user, which is "8.3". It then finds the index of the decimal point in the string using the `indexOf()` method, which is 1. 
Next, it extracts the digit after the decimal point and stores it in the variable `d`, which is 3. It also extracts the digit before the decimal point and stores it in the variable `i`, which is 8.
Then it checks if `i` is equal to 9. Since `i` is not equal to 9, it moves to the next condition.
It checks if `d` is greater than or equal to 5. Since `d` is 3, which is less than 5, it moves to the else block.
In the else block, it writes the substring of the input string from index 0 to index `index`, which is "8", to the output.
Finally, it writes a new line character to the output.
