provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
I want to act as a Java code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Consider the following code:
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(System.in);
            BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(isr);
            String strArr[] = br.readLine().split(" ");

            int n = Integer.parseInt(strArr[0]);
            int a = Integer.parseInt(strArr[1]);
            int b = Integer.parseInt(strArr[2]);
            int answer = 0;

            for (int i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) {
                int num = i;
                int sum = 0;

                while (num!= 0) {
                        sum += num % 10;
                        num /= 10;
                }

                if (sum >= a && sum <= b ) {
                        answer = answer + i;
                }
            }
            System.out.println(answer);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

}
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable `n`, variable `a` and variable `b` are initialized with 20, 2 and 5, respectively. And variable `answer` is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 20 to check each integer `i` in this range.
In each iteration, the value of variable `i` is passed to variable `num` and variable `sum` is first initialized with 0.
Then it calculates the sum of the digits of the variable `num` by repeatedlly extracting the digits of `num` with a while loop and adding it to variable `sum`.
After that it checks if the calculated variable `sum` fall within the range [2, 5]. If it does, it adds the value of variable `i` to variable `answer`. The condition is met when `i` is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
When the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable `answer` as output, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
import java.util.Scanner;

public class JavaApplication38 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int num1 = sc.nextInt();
        int num2 = sc.nextInt();
        int counter = 0;
        
        while (num1!= 0 && num2!= 0) {
            if (num1 == 1 && num2 == 1) {
                break;
            }
            
            if (num1 <= num2) {
                num1++;
                num2 -= 2;
            } else {
                num1 -= 2;
                num2++;
            }
            
            counter++;
        }
        
        System.out.println(counter);
    }
}
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
100 25

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable `num1` and `num2` are initialized with 100 and 25, respectively. And variable `counter` is initialized with 0.
It enters a while loop and it continues until `num1` and `num2` are both equal to 0 or until the condition `num1 == 1 && num2 == 1` is met.
In each iteration, it checks if `num1` is less than or equal to `num2`. If it is, it increments `num1` by 1 and decrements `num2` by 2. If it is not, it decrements `num1` by 2 and increments `num2` by 1.
It also increments the value of variable `counter` by 1 in each iteration.
When the loop finishes, it print the final value of variable `counter` as output, which is 10.

The output of code execution is:
10
