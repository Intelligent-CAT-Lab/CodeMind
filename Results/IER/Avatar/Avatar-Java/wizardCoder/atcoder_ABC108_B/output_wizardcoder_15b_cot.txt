Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that
provides further context.  Write a response that appropriately completes
the request.

### Instruction:
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
I want to act as a Java code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Consider the following code:
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(System.in);
            BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(isr);
            String strArr[] = br.readLine().split(" ");

            int n = Integer.parseInt(strArr[0]);
            int a = Integer.parseInt(strArr[1]);
            int b = Integer.parseInt(strArr[2]);
            int answer = 0;

            for (int i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) {
                int num = i;
                int sum = 0;

                while (num!= 0) {
                        sum += num % 10;
                        num /= 10;
                }

                if (sum >= a && sum <= b ) {
                        answer = answer + i;
                }
            }
            System.out.println(answer);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

}
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable `n`, variable `a` and variable `b` are initialized with 20, 2 and 5, respectively. And variable `answer` is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 20 to check each integer `i` in this range.
In each iteration, the value of variable `i` is passed to variable `num` and variable `sum` is first initialized with 0.
Then it calculates the sum of the digits of the variable `num` by repeatedlly extracting the digits of `num` with a while loop and adding it to variable `sum`.
After that it checks if the calculated variable `sum` fall within the range [2, 5]. If it does, it adds the value of variable `i` to variable `answer`. The condition is met when `i` is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
When the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable `answer` as output, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
        int x1 = scan.nextInt();
        int y1 = scan.nextInt();
        int x2 = scan.nextInt();
        int y2 = scan.nextInt();
        int x3 = x2 + (y1 - y2);
        int y3 = y2 - (x1 - x2);
        int x4 = x1 - (y2 - y1);
        int y4 = y1 + (x2 - x1);
        System.out.println(x3 + " ▁ " + y3 + " ▁ " + x4 + " ▁ " + y4);
    }
}
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
2 3 6 6

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are initialized with 2, 3, 6 and 6, respectively.

The first step is to calculate the coordinates of the third point, which is `(x2 + (y1 - y2), y2 - (x1 - x2))`.

The value of `x3` is calculated as `x2 + (y1 - y2)` which is `6 + (3 - 6)` which is `3`.

The value of `y3` is calculated as `y2 - (x1 - x2)` which is `6 - (2 - 6)` which is `-2`.

The second step is to calculate the coordinates of the fourth point, which is `(x1 - (y2 - y1), y1 + (x2 - x1))`.

The value of `x4` is calculated as `x1 - (y2 - y1)` which is `2 - (6 - 3)` which is `-4`.

The value of `y4` is calculated as `y1 + (x2 - x1)` which is `3 + (6 - 2)` which is `5`.

Finally, the output is `3 ▁ -2 ▁ -4 ▁ 5`.
