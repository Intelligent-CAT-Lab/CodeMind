### Instruction:
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
I want to act as a Java code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Consider the following code:
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(System.in);
            BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(isr);
            String strArr[] = br.readLine().split(" ");

            int n = Integer.parseInt(strArr[0]);
            int a = Integer.parseInt(strArr[1]);
            int b = Integer.parseInt(strArr[2]);
            int answer = 0;

            for (int i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) {
                int num = i;
                int sum = 0;

                while (num!= 0) {
                        sum += num % 10;
                        num /= 10;
                }

                if (sum >= a && sum <= b ) {
                        answer = answer + i;
                }
            }
            System.out.println(answer);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

}
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable `n`, variable `a` and variable `b` are initialized with 20, 2 and 5, respectively. And variable `answer` is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 20 to check each integer `i` in this range.
In each iteration, the value of variable `i` is passed to variable `num` and variable `sum` is first initialized with 0.
Then it calculates the sum of the digits of the variable `num` by repeatedlly extracting the digits of `num` with a while loop and adding it to variable `sum`.
After that it checks if the calculated variable `sum` fall within the range [2, 5]. If it does, it adds the value of variable `i` to variable `answer`. The condition is met when `i` is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
When the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable `answer` as output, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84
END-OF-OUTPUT
[[[Example End]]]


Consider the following code: 
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = scan.nextInt();
        int count = scan.nextInt();
        printIsland(n, count);
    }

    public static void printIsland(int n, int count) {
        int a = (n + 1) / 2;
        int b = n / 2;
        int max = a * a + b * b;
        if (count > max) {
            System.out.println("NO");
            return;
        }
        System.out.println("YES");
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if ((i + j) % 2 == 0 && count > 0) {
                    sb.append('L');
                    count--;
                } else {
                    sb.append('S');
                }
            }
            sb.append("\n");
        }
        System.out.println(sb);
    }
}
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
100 10000

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable `n` is initialized with 100 and variable `count` is initialized with 10000.
The function `printIsland` is called with `n` and `count` as arguments.
The variable `a` is calculated as `(n + 1) / 2` and variable `b` is calculated as `n / 2`.
The variable `max` is calculated as `a * a + b * b`.
If `count` is greater than `max`, the function returns and prints "NO" as output.
Otherwise, the function prints "YES" as output and creates a StringBuilder object `sb`.
The for loop iterates `n` times and for each iteration, it creates a new line in the StringBuilder object `sb`.
The for loop iterates `n` times and for each iteration, it appends either 'L' or 'S' to the StringBuilder object `sb` based on the condition `(i + j) % 2 == 0 && count > 0`.
If the condition is true, it decrements the `count` variable.
After the for loop finishes, it prints the StringBuilder object `sb` as output.

The output of code execution is:
YES
