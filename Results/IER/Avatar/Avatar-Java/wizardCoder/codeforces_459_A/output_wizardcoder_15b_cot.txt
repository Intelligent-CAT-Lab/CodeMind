### Instruction:
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
I want to act as a Java code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Consider the following code:
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(System.in);
            BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(isr);
            String strArr[] = br.readLine().split(" ");

            int n = Integer.parseInt(strArr[0]);
            int a = Integer.parseInt(strArr[1]);
            int b = Integer.parseInt(strArr[2]);
            int answer = 0;

            for (int i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) {
                int num = i;
                int sum = 0;

                while (num!= 0) {
                        sum += num % 10;
                        num /= 10;
                }

                if (sum >= a && sum <= b ) {
                        answer = answer + i;
                }
            }
            System.out.println(answer);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

}
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable `n`, variable `a` and variable `b` are initialized with 20, 2 and 5, respectively. And variable `answer` is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 20 to check each integer `i` in this range.
In each iteration, the value of variable `i` is passed to variable `num` and variable `sum` is first initialized with 0.
Then it calculates the sum of the digits of the variable `num` by repeatedlly extracting the digits of `num` with a while loop and adding it to variable `sum`.
After that it checks if the calculated variable `sum` fall within the range [2, 5]. If it does, it adds the value of variable `i` to variable `answer`. The condition is met when `i` is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
When the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable `answer` as output, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84

Consider the following code: 
import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
        PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(System.out);
        
        int x1 = in.nextInt(), y1 = in.nextInt(), x2 = in.nextInt(), y2 = in.nextInt();
        
        if (x1 == x2) {
            int dif = Math.abs(y1 - y2);
            pw.println((x1 + dif) + " ▁ " + y1 + " ▁ " + (x1 + dif) + " ▁ " + y2);
        } else if (y1 == y2) {
            int dif = Math.abs(x1 - x2);
            pw.println((x1) + " ▁ " + (y1 + dif) + " ▁ " + (x2) + " ▁ " + (y2 + dif));
        } else if (Math.abs(x1 - x2) == Math.abs(y1 - y2)) {
            pw.println(x1 + " ▁ " + y2 + " ▁ " + x2 + " ▁ " + y1);
        } else {
            pw.println(-1);
        }
        
        pw.close();
    }
    
    static void debug(Object... obj) {
        System.err.println(Arrays.deepToString(obj));
    }
}
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
4 0 0 4

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` are initialized with 4, 0, 0, and 4, respectively.

The first if statement is executed because `x1` and `x2` are equal. The difference between `y1` and `y2` is calculated and stored in the variable `dif`. The values of `x1` and `y1` are added to `dif` to get the coordinates of the upper right corner of the rectangle. The values of `x1` and `y1` are added to `dif` to get the coordinates of the lower left corner of the rectangle. The values of `x1` and `y1` are added to `dif` to get the coordinates of the upper left corner of the rectangle. The values of `x1` and `y1` are added to `dif` to get the coordinates of the lower right corner of the rectangle. These coordinates are printed in the format "x1 ▁ y1 ▁ x2 ▁ y2".

The output of code execution is:
4 ▁ 0 ▁ 4 ▁ 0
