### Instruction:
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
I want to act as a Java code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Consider the following code:
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(System.in);
            BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(isr);
            String strArr[] = br.readLine().split(" ");

            int n = Integer.parseInt(strArr[0]);
            int a = Integer.parseInt(strArr[1]);
            int b = Integer.parseInt(strArr[2]);
            int answer = 0;

            for (int i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) {
                int num = i;
                int sum = 0;

                while (num!= 0) {
                        sum += num % 10;
                        num /= 10;
                }

                if (sum >= a && sum <= b ) {
                        answer = answer + i;
                }
            }
            System.out.println(answer);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

}
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable `n`, variable `a` and variable `b` are initialized with 20, 2 and 5, respectively. And variable `answer` is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 20 to check each integer `i` in this range.
In each iteration, the value of variable `i` is passed to variable `num` and variable `sum` is first initialized with 0.
Then it calculates the sum of the digits of the variable `num` by repeatedlly extracting the digits of `num` with a while loop and adding it to variable `sum`.
After that it checks if the calculated variable `sum` fall within the range [2, 5]. If it does, it adds the value of variable `i` to variable `answer`. The condition is met when `i` is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
When the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable `answer` as output, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84

Consider the following code: 
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = sc.nextInt();
        int b = sc.nextInt();
        double tmp1 = sc.nextDouble();
        double tmp2 = sc.nextDouble();
        
        double h = tmp1 / 6. * Math.PI + tmp2 / 30. * Math.PI / 12.;
        double m = tmp2 / 30. * Math.PI + tmp1 / 6. * Math.PI * 12.;
        double rad = h - m;
        
        double res = Math.sqrt(Math.pow(a, 2) + Math.pow(b, 2) - (2. * a * b * Math.cos(rad)));
        
        System.out.println(res);
    }
}
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
1 2 9 49

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable `a` and `b` are initialized with 1 and 2, respectively. The variables `tmp1` and `tmp2` are initialized with 9 and 49, respectively.

The variable `h` is calculated as follows:

h = (tmp1 / 6. * Math.PI) + (tmp2 / 30. * Math.PI / 12.)

h = (9 / 6. * 3.141592653589793) + (49 / 30. * 3.141592653589793 / 12.)

h = 1.5707963267948966 + 0.1308996938995747

h = 1.7017963267948966

The variable `m` is calculated as follows:

m = (tmp2 / 30. * Math.PI) + (tmp1 / 6. * Math.PI * 12.)

m = (49 / 30. * 3.141592653589793) + (9 / 6. * 3.141592653589793 * 12.)

m = 1.5707963267948966 + 1.7217963267948966

m = 3.293592653589793

The variable `rad` is calculated as follows:

rad = h - m

rad = 1.7017963267948966 - 1.7217963267948966

rad = -0.020000000000000036

The variable `res` is calculated as follows:

res = Math.sqrt(Math.pow(a, 2) + Math.pow(b, 2) - (2. * a * b * Math.cos(rad)))

res = Math.sqrt(Math.pow(1, 2) + Math.pow(2, 2) - (2. * 1 * 2 * Math.cos(-0.020000000000000036)))

res = Math.sqrt(1 + 4 - (2 * 1 * 2 * -0.020000000000000036))

res = 1.9799999999999998

The final output of the code execution is:

1.9799999999999998
