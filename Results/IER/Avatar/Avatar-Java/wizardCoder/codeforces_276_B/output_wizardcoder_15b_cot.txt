### Instruction:
Below is an example:
[[[Example Start]]]
I want to act as a Java code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to print the output of the code.
Consider the following code:
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(System.in);
            BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(isr);
            String strArr[] = br.readLine().split(" ");

            int n = Integer.parseInt(strArr[0]);
            int a = Integer.parseInt(strArr[1]);
            int b = Integer.parseInt(strArr[2]);
            int answer = 0;

            for (int i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) {
                int num = i;
                int sum = 0;

                while (num!= 0) {
                        sum += num % 10;
                        num /= 10;
                }

                if (sum >= a && sum <= b ) {
                        answer = answer + i;
                }
            }
            System.out.println(answer);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

}
<<Question>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
20 2 5
First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT".
<<Answer>>
The variable `n`, variable `a` and variable `b` are initialized with 20, 2 and 5, respectively. And variable `answer` is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 20 to check each integer `i` in this range.
In each iteration, the value of variable `i` is passed to variable `num` and variable `sum` is first initialized with 0.
Then it calculates the sum of the digits of the variable `num` by repeatedlly extracting the digits of `num` with a while loop and adding it to variable `sum`.
After that it checks if the calculated variable `sum` fall within the range [2, 5]. If it does, it adds the value of variable `i` to variable `answer`. The condition is met when `i` is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
When the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable `answer` as output, which is 84.

The output of code execution is:
84

Consider the following code: 
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
        String s = in.next();
        char ar[] = new char[26];
        
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            char ch = s.charAt(i);
            ar[ch - 97]++;
        }
        
        int cntod = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
            if ((ar[i] % 2)!= 0)
                cntod++;
        }
        
        if (cntod == 0)
            System.out.println("First");
        else {
            if (cntod % 2 == 0) {
                System.out.println("Second");
            } else {
                System.out.println("First");
            }
        }
    }
}

First think step by step then print the output of code execution and end the output with "END-OF-OUTPUT"\<<Answer>>
### Response:
The variable `s` is initialized with the input string. The variable `ar` is initialized with an array of size 26, where each element is initialized with 0.

The for loop iterates through each character of the input string `s` and increments the corresponding element of the array `ar` by 1.

The variable `cntod` is initialized with 0. The for loop iterates through each element of the array `ar` and increments the value of `cntod` by 1 if the element is odd.

If `cntod` is 0, it means that there are no odd elements in the array `ar`, so the output is "First".

Otherwise, if `cntod` is even, it means that there are an even number of odd elements in the array `ar`, so the output is "Second".

If `cntod` is odd, it means that there are an odd number of odd elements in the array `ar`, so the output is "First".

The output of code execution is:
First
END-OF-OUTPUT
