### Instruction
I want you to act as a Java code executor. I will give you a piece of Java code and its input. You need to think step by step and then print the output of code execution.

Below is an example:
<Example>
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(System.in);
            BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(isr);
            String strArr[] = br.readLine().split(" ");

            int n = Integer.parseInt(strArr[0]);
            int a = Integer.parseInt(strArr[1]);
            int b = Integer.parseInt(strArr[2]);
            int answer = 0;

            for (int i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) {
                int num = i;
                int sum = 0;

                while (num != 0) {
                        sum += num % 10;
                        num /= 10;
                }

                if (sum >= a && sum <= b ) {
                        answer = answer + i;
                }
            }
            System.out.println(answer);
            } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

}
</Code>
What would be the output of code execution given the following input:
```20 2 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]
[/INST]
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n, variable a and variable b are initialized with 20, 2 and 5 respectively according to the input. And variable sum is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 20 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger num by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum falls within the range [2, 5]. If it does, it adds the current interger i to variable answer. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14 and 20.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable answer as output, which is 84.
<<<Output>>>
84

</Example>

Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int r = Integer.parseInt(sc.next());
        int d = Integer.parseInt(sc.next());
        int x = Integer.parseInt(sc.next());

        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            x = r * x - d;
            System.out.println(x);
        }
    }
}
<Code>

What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
 `2 1 2`? 
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.

Follow the following format:
<<<Analysis>>>
{YOUR ANALYSIS}
<<<Output>>>
{OUTPUT}
[END-OF-RESPONSE]

### Response:
<<<Analysis>>>
The given code takes three inputs: r, d, and x. It then enters a for loop that iterates 10 times. In each iteration, it calculates the next value of x using the formula `x = r * x - d` and prints the result.

The inputs given are `2 1 2`. The variable r is initialized with 2, d with 1, and x with 2.

The for loop starts with i = 0 and ends at i = 9. In each iteration, it calculates the next value of x using the formula `x = r * x - d` and prints the result.

The calculation for each iteration is as follows:
- For i = 0, x = 2 * 2 - 1 = 3
- For i = 1, x = 2 * 3 - 1 = 5
- For i = 2, x = 2 * 5 - 1 = 11
- For i = 3, x = 2 * 11 - 1 = 23
- For i = 4, x = 2 * 23 - 1 = 47
- For i = 5, x = 2 * 47 - 1 = 95
- For i = 6, x = 2 * 95 - 1 = 191
- For i = 7, x = 2 * 191 - 1 = 383
- For i = 8, x = 2 * 383 - 1 = 767
- For i = 9, x = 2 * 767 - 1 = 1535

The output of the code would be the sequence of values calculated in each iteration of the loop.

<<<Output>>>
3
5
11
23
47
95
191
383
767
1535
