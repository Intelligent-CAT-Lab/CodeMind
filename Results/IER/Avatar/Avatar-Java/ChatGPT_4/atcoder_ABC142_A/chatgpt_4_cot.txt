<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 64 according to the input. The variable sum is initialized with 0.0.
The code enters a for loop and iterates from 1 to 64. Inside the loop, it checks if the current integer i is odd (i % 2 != 0). If it is odd, it adds 1 to the sum.
Since every second number is odd, there will be 32 odd numbers between 1 and 64 (inclusive). Therefore, the sum will be incremented 32 times by 1, resulting in a sum of 32.
After the loop finishes, the code calculates the average by dividing the sum by N (sum / N), which is 32 / 64.
The result of this division is 0.5.
<<<Output>>>
0.5
