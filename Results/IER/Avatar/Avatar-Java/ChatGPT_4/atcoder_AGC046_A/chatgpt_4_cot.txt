<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by initializing three integer variables: i, k with a value of 360, and j with a value of 1. It then creates a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream (System.in).

The code checks if the next token in the input stream is an integer using sc.hasNextInt(). If it is not an integer, it prints an error message "整数を入力してください" (which translates to "Please enter an integer") and does not assign a value to i.

Since the input is `1`, which is an integer, the code proceeds to parse the input as an integer and assigns it to i.

Next, the code checks if the value of i is within the range 1 to 179 inclusive. Since the input is `1`, it satisfies this condition.

The code then enters a while loop that continues to increment j until the condition `((i * j) % k == 0)` is true. This condition is checking for the smallest integer j such that the product of i and j is a multiple of k (360 degrees, representing a full circle).

For the input `1`, the loop will terminate on the first iteration because `(1 * 1) % 360` is `0`, which satisfies the condition.

After the loop, the code prints the value of j, which is `1`.
