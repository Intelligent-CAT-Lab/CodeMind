<<<Analysis>>>
The code starts by creating a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream. It then reads two integers, n and m, which are assigned the values 59 and 96 respectively according to the input.

The first if statement checks if n is equal to 0. Since n is 59, this condition is false, so the code does not enter this block.

The second if statement checks if m is less than or equal to n. Since m is 96 and n is 59, this condition is also false, so the code does not enter this block either.

Since neither of the first two if conditions are met, the code proceeds to the last print statement. It prints the value of m followed by " ▁ " and then the value of (m + n - 1). The calculation for the second number is 96 + 59 - 1, which equals 154.

Therefore, the output will be "96 ▁ 154".
