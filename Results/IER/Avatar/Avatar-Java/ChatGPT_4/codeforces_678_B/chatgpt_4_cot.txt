The input year is 2096. The method check_leap is called to determine if the year 2096 is a leap year. According to the check_leap method, a year is a leap year if it is divisible by 400 or if it is divisible by 4 but not by 100. Since 2096 is divisible by 4 and not by 100, it is a leap year.

The program then enters an infinite loop, starting from the year 2097. For each year, it checks if the year is a leap year and adds 366 to the sum if it is, or 365 if it is not. It then checks if the sum is divisible by 7. If the sum is divisible by 7, it checks if the current year is a leap year and if it matches the leap year status of the input year (2096). If both years are either leap years or both are not leap years, it prints the current year and returns, ending the program.

The loop will continue until it finds a year that satisfies both conditions: the sum of days since the input year is divisible by 7, and the year has the same leap year status as the input year.

The first year after 2096 that is a leap year is 2104. However, the sum of days from 2097 to 2104 is not divisible by 7. The next leap year after 2104 is 2108, and the sum of days from 2097 to 2108 is 4383, which is also not divisible by 7. This process will continue until it finds a year that satisfies both conditions.

The year that satisfies both conditions is 2124. The sum of days from 2097 to 2124 is 10227, which is divisible by 7 (10227 % 7 == 0). Since 2124 is a leap year, just like the input year 2096, the program will print 2124 and terminate.
