<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads an integer n from the input, which is 512 in this case. It then performs a bitwise AND operation between n and (n - 1). The expression (n & (n - 1)) is a common way to check if a number is a power of 2. This is because a power of 2 in binary form has only one '1' bit, and subtracting 1 from it will flip all the bits after the '1' bit to '1', resulting in a number that has no bits in common with the original number. Therefore, if n is a power of 2, the result of the bitwise AND operation will be 0.

For the input 512:
- 512 in binary is 1000000000
- 511 (which is 512 - 1) in binary is 0111111111
- The bitwise AND of 512 and 511 is 0000000000, which is 0.

Since the result of the bitwise AND operation is 0, the condition in the if statement is true, and the program will print "YES".

<<<Output>>>
