<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read input from the standard input. It then reads two integers, a and b, from the input. In this case, both a and b are 6.

The code then checks if a is equal to b. Since in this case a is equal to b (both are 6), it enters the first if condition and returns a multiplied by 2, which is 6 * 2.

The solve() method will return 12, and the main method will print this value to the standard output.

<<<Output>>>
12
