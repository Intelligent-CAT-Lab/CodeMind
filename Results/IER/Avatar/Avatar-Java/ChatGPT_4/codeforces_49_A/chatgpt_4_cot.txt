<<<Analysis>>>
The input string is read and trimmed of any leading or trailing whitespace. The question mark at the end of the string is removed, and the last character of the resulting string is extracted. This character is 'p'.

An array of strings containing the vowels "A", "E", "I", "O", "U", "Y" is created. The code then checks if the extracted character 'p' matches any of the vowels in the array, ignoring case. Since 'p' is not a vowel, the match will fail.

The result of the match is a boolean value, which is false in this case. The ternary operator then selects "NO" because the boolean value is false.

The output of the code will be "NO".
