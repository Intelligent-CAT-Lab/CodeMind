<<<Analysis>>>
The input provided initializes the variables as follows: n = 1, k = 1, l = 1, r = 1, sAll = 1, sk = 1.

The method `getPoints` is called with these values and the following steps are executed:

1. An array `ans` of size n (which is 1) is created and filled with the value of l (which is 1). So `ans` is now [1].
2. The variable `sAll` is updated to `sAll - sk + (n - k) * l`, which is `1 - 1 + (1 - 1) * 1` = 0.
3. The variable `sk` is updated to `sk - k * l`, which is `1 - 1 * 1` = 0.
4. The first while loop checks if `sk > 0`, which is not true since `sk` is 0, so the loop is not executed.
5. The second while loop checks if `sAll > 0`, which is also not true since `sAll` is 0, so the loop is not executed.

Since no changes are made to the `ans` array after its initialization, the method returns the initial array [1].

The main method then prints the elements of the `ans` array, which contains just one element, 1.
