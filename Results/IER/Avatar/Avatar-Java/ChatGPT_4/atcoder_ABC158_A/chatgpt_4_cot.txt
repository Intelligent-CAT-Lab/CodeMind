<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read input from the user. It then reads a single word from the input and assigns it to the variable `str`. The input provided is "BBA".

The if statement checks if `str` is equal to "AAA" or "BBB". Since `str` is "BBA", it does not match either "AAA" or "BBB". Therefore, the condition of the if statement is false.

As a result, the else block is executed, and the program prints "Yes" to the standard output.

<<<Output>>>
Yes
