<<<Analysis>>>
The input provided is `STOP`. The FastScanner class is used to read this input. The `next()` method of the FastScanner class will be called, which reads the next token from the input. Since `STOP` is a single word without any spaces, it will be treated as a single token.

The `Set<String> chars` is initialized as a HashSet, and then the `addAll` method is called with `Arrays.asList(s.split(" "))`. However, since there are no spaces in the input `STOP`, the `split(" ")` method will return an array containing the single element `STOP`. Therefore, the `chars` set will contain only one element, which is `STOP`.

The condition `if (chars.size() == 2)` checks if the size of the `chars` set is 2. Since the `chars` set contains only one element, the condition will be false.

As a result, the `else` block will be executed, and the program will print `No`.

<<<Output>>>
No
