The variable n is initialized with 29 according to the input. The array a is initialized with the values 27, 18, and 2, and then sorted to become [2, 18, 27].
The variable max is initialized but not used in the code.
The array d is created with a size of n + 1 (30 in this case), and all its elements are initialized to -500. Then d[0] is set to 0.
The code then enters a nested for loop. The outer loop iterates from 0 to 29 (inclusive), and the inner loop iterates over the indices of the sorted array a.
For each i, the code checks if i minus the current element of array a (a[j]) is greater than or equal to 0 and if d[i - a[j]] is not equal to -1. If both conditions are true, it sets d[i] to the maximum of its current value and d[i - a[j]] + 1.
This loop effectively calculates the maximum number of pieces that can be obtained by cutting the number n into pieces of sizes that are in the array a.
The final value of d[29] will be the output, which is the maximum number of pieces that can be obtained from 29 using pieces of size 2, 18, and 27.

Let's calculate the values manually:
- d[0] = 0 (base case)
- d[2] = max(-500, d[0] + 1) = 1 (one piece of size 2)
- d[4] = max(-500, d[2] + 1) = 2 (two pieces of size 2)
- ...
- d[18] = max(-500, d[0] + 1) = 1 (one piece of size 18)
- d[20] = max(-500, d[18] + 1) = 2 (one piece of size 18 and one of size 2)
- ...
- d[27] = max(-500, d[0] + 1) = 1 (one piece of size 27)
- d[29] = max(-500, d[27] + 1) = 2 (one piece of size 27 and one of size 2)

The maximum number of pieces that can be obtained from 29 using pieces of size 2, 18, and 27 is 2.
