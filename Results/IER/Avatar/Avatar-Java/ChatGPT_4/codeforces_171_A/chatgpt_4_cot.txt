<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers a and b from the input, which are 35005211 and 521595368 respectively. It then calls the getNum method with these two numbers as arguments.

Inside the getNum method, it initializes a variable reverseB to 0. It then enters a while loop that continues as long as b is greater than 0. Inside the loop, it reverses the number b by taking the remainder of b divided by 10 (which gives the last digit of b) and adding it to reverseB after multiplying reverseB by 10 (to shift the digits to the left). Then it divides b by 10 to remove the last digit. This process repeats until b becomes 0.

The reversed number of b (reverseB) is then added to a, and the result is returned.

For the given input, the reversal of b (521595368) would be 863595125. When this is added to a (35005211), the result is 898600336.
