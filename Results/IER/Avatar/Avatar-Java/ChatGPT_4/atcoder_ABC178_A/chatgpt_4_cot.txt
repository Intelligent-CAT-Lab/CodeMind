<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes an integer variable x with the value read from the standard input. The input provided is `0`, so x is set to 0.
The code then checks if x is equal to 0. Since x is indeed 0, the condition is true.
Because the condition is true, the code inside the if block is executed, which prints "1" to the standard output.
No other conditions or loops are present, so the program ends after printing the output.
