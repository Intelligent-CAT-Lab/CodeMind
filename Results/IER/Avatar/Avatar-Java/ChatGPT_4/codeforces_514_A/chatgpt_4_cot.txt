The variable x is initialized with 5728 according to the input. The program then enters a while loop that continues as long as x is greater than 0.

In each iteration of the while loop:
1. The remainder r of x divided by 10 is calculated, which gives the last digit of x.
2. If the difference between 9 and r is less than r, and if x divided by 10 is not 0 or 9 - r is not 0 (which is the case when r is 0 and x is the last digit), then 9 - r is added to the list. Otherwise, r is added to the list.
3. x is divided by 10 (integer division) to remove the last digit.

The loop processes the digits of 5728 as follows:
- 8 % 10 = 8 (9 - 8 = 1, which is less than 8, so 1 is added to the list)
- 2 % 10 = 2 (9 - 2 = 7, which is greater than 2, so 2 is added to the list)
- 7 % 10 = 7 (9 - 7 = 2, which is less than 7, so 2 is added to the list)
- 5 % 10 = 5 (9 - 5 = 4, which is less than 5, so 4 is added to the list)

The list now contains [1, 2, 2, 4] in reverse order of the digits of x.

The program then initializes pow as 0 and newNumber as 0. It enters a for loop to reconstruct the number from the list, using the pow variable to keep track of the position of each digit.

The loop processes the list as follows:
- newNumber = 0 + 1 * (10^0) = 1
- pow is incremented to 1
- newNumber = 1 + 2 * (10^1) = 21
- pow is incremented to 2
- newNumber = 21 + 2 * (10^2) = 221
- pow is incremented to 3
- newNumber = 221 + 4 * (10^3) = 4221

Finally, the program prints the value of newNumber, which is 4221.
