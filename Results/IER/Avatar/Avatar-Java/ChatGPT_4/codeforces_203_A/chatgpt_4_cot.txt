<<<Analysis>>>
The input provided initializes the following variables:
- points = 3
- t = 1
- a = 20
- b = 15
- ta = 17
- tb = 5

The `solve` method contains two nested for loops that iterate from 0 to t-1, which in this case is just 0 since t is 1. The condition inside the if statement checks four different conditions for each combination of i and j:

1. points == a - i * ta + b - j * tb
2. points == 0
3. points == a - ta * i
4. points == b - tb * j

Since points is not 0, the second condition is not met. We only need to check the other three conditions for i = 0 and j = 0, as those are the only iterations that will occur due to t being 1.

For i = 0 and j = 0:
- The first condition checks if 3 == 20 - 0 * 17 + 15 - 0 * 5, which simplifies to 3 == 35, which is false.
- The third condition checks if 3 == 20 - 17 * 0, which simplifies to 3 == 20, which is false.
- The fourth condition checks if 3 == 15 - 5 * 0, which simplifies to 3 == 15, which is false.

Since none of the conditions are met, the method will not print "YES" and return early. Instead, it will finish the loops and print "NO" at the end.
