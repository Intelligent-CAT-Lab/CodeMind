<<<Analysis>>>
The input provided initializes n with 100 and count with 10000. The method printIsland is called with these values.

Inside the printIsland method, the variables a and b are calculated as follows:
- a = (n + 1) / 2 = (100 + 1) / 2 = 101 / 2 = 50 (since it's integer division)
- b = n / 2 = 100 / 2 = 50

The variable max is calculated as:
- max = a * a + b * b = 50 * 50 + 50 * 50 = 2500 + 2500 = 5000

The if condition checks if count (10000) is greater than max (5000). Since it is, the method prints "NO" and returns, so the rest of the code to build the StringBuilder and print the island pattern is not executed.

Therefore, the output will be "NO" without any island pattern.
