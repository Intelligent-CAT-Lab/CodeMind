<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 9995083 according to the input. The variable ans is initialized with 0 and is of type long to handle large numbers.
The code enters a for loop and iterates from 1 to 9995083 (inclusive).

In each iteration of the loop, the following calculation is performed:
- The current loop index i is multiplied by (n / i) which is the integer division of n by i.
- This result is then multiplied by ((n / i) + 1) which is one more than the integer division of n by i.
- The product of these two is then divided by 2.
- This result is added to the ans variable.

This calculation is essentially summing up the series of arithmetic progressions for each divisor of n. The formula used is the sum of an arithmetic series: (first term + last term) * number of terms / 2, where:
- The first term is i (the current divisor).
- The last term is n (the number being divided) divided by i, multiplied by i.
- The number of terms is (n / i).

The loop continues until i reaches n, and in each iteration, the calculated value is added to ans.

After the loop finishes, the final value of ans is printed as the output.

The calculation is too complex to be done manually, so we will not attempt to calculate the exact value of ans. However, the code will correctly compute the sum of all the arithmetic progressions for each divisor of n and output the final result.

<<<Output>>>
The output is the final value of ans after the loop, which is a large number that results from the given calculation. Since I cannot execute the code, I cannot provide the exact numerical output.
