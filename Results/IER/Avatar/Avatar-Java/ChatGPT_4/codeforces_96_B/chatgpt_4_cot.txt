<<<Analysis>>>
The variable `number` is initialized with `77777777` according to the input. The variable `ans` is initialized with `-1` and `value` with `0`. The variable `mask` is initialized with `2`.

The program enters a while loop that continues as long as `value` is less than `number`. Inside the loop, the following steps are performed:

1. The binary string representation of `mask` is obtained by calling `Integer.toBinaryString(mask++)` and then `substring(1)` is used to remove the leading '1' that is always present in the binary representation of any number greater than 1 in Java.

2. A count of zeros in the binary string is maintained by iterating over each character in the string and incrementing `zeros` if the character is '0'.

3. The program then checks if the number of zeros is equal to the number of ones (since the length of the string minus the number of zeros gives the number of ones). If they are not equal, the loop continues with the next iteration (incrementing `mask`).

4. If the number of zeros equals the number of ones, the binary string is transformed by replacing '0' with '4' and '1' with '7', creating a string that represents a lucky number (a number consisting only of digits 4 and 7).

5. The transformed string is then parsed into a long integer `value`.

6. The loop continues until `value` is greater than or equal to `number`.

The loop will terminate when it finds the smallest lucky number that is greater than or equal to `77777777`. The lucky numbers are generated in increasing order, so the first lucky number that is greater than or equal to `77777777` will be the output.

The lucky numbers generated by this process are 4, 7, 44, 47, 74, 77, 444, 447, 474, 477, 744, 747, 774, 777, 4444, 4447, and so on. The first lucky number greater than `77777777` is `777777774`.
