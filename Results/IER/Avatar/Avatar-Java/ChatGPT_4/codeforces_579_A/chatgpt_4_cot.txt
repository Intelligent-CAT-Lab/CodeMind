The variable n is initialized with 9 according to the input. The variable s is initialized with a single space character " ".
The while loop is used to convert the number 9 to its binary representation in reverse order. The loop runs as long as n is greater than 0.
In the first iteration, n % 2 equals 1 (since 9 is odd), n is then divided by 2 and becomes 4, and "1 " is appended to s, which becomes " 1 ".
In the second iteration, n % 2 equals 0 (since 4 is even), n is then divided by 2 and becomes 2, and "0 " is appended to s, which becomes " 1 0 ".
In the third iteration, n % 2 equals 0 (since 2 is even), n is then divided by 2 and becomes 1, and "0 " is appended to s, which becomes " 1 0 0 ".
In the fourth iteration, n % 2 equals 1 (since 1 is odd), n is then divided by 2 and becomes 0, and "1 " is appended to s, which becomes " 1 0 0 1 ".
The while loop ends because n is now 0.

The variable ans is initialized with 0. A for loop is used to iterate over each character in the string s.
The for loop checks each character of s to see if it is '1'. If it is, ans is incremented by 1.
The string s is " 1 0 0 1 ", and it contains two '1's. Therefore, ans is incremented twice, resulting in a final value of 2.

The final value of ans, which is 2, is printed as the output.
