<<<Analysis>>>
The input is a single character '0'. The character array s1 will contain this single character. The variables ans, c1, and c0 are initialized to 0.

The for loop will iterate only once since the length of s1 is 1. Inside the loop, the condition checks if the current character is '1'. Since the character is '0', it goes to the else block.

Inside the else block, it checks if c1 is greater than 0, which it is not, so it increments c0 by 1. The value of c0 becomes 1, and c1 remains 0. The variable ans remains 0 since neither of the if conditions inside the loop are satisfied.

After the loop, the program prints the value of ans multiplied by 2. Since ans is 0, the output will be 0 * 2, which is 0.
