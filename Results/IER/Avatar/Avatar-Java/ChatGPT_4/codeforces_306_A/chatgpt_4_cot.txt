<<<Analysis>>>
The input provided is `87 34`, which means n = 87.0 and m = 34.0 after being parsed as doubles.

The first for loop runs from i = 0 to i < m - (n % m), which is 34 - (87 % 34). Since 87 % 34 is 19, the loop runs from i = 0 to i < 34 - 19, which is i < 15.

Inside the first for loop, it prints the integer part of n / m, which is the integer part of 87 / 34. Since 87 / 34 is approximately 2.5588, the integer part is 2. So it prints "2 " fifteen times.

The second for loop starts with i = (int) (m - (n % m)), which is 15, and runs until i < m, which is 34.

Inside the second for loop, it prints the ceiling of n / m, which is the smallest integer greater than or equal to 87 / 34. Since 87 / 34 is approximately 2.5588, the ceiling is 3. So it prints "3 " nineteen times (from i = 15 to i = 33).

Finally, the PrintWriter is closed, which flushes the output to the console.
