<<<Analysis>>>
The variables A, B, and K are initialized with 1000000000000 each according to the input.
The variable n is calculated as A - K, which is 1000000000000 - 1000000000000 = 0.

The first if condition checks if A + B is less than or equal to K. Since A + B equals 2000000000000 and K is 1000000000000, the condition is false.

The else if condition checks if n is less than 0. Since n is 0, this condition is also false.

The program then proceeds to the else block, which prints the value of n and B separated by " ▁ ". Since n is 0 and B is 1000000000000, the output will be "0 ▁ 1000000000000".

<<<Output>>>
0 ▁ 1000000000000
