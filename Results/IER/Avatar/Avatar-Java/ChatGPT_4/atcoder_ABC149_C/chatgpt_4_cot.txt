<<<Analysis>>>
The variable X is initialized with 9552 according to the input. The variable prime is also set to 9552, and mid is calculated as half of prime, which is 4776.
The code enters a while loop that will continue until it finds a prime number. Inside the loop, there is a for loop that checks if the current value of prime is divisible by any number from 2 to mid. If it is divisible, flag is set to true and the for loop breaks.
If flag is true after the for loop, it means that the current number is not prime, so the code increments prime by 1, resets flag to false, and the while loop continues to the next iteration.
If flag is false after the for loop, it means that the current number is prime, and the while loop breaks.
The first prime number greater than or equal to 9552 is 9553, which is not divisible by any number between 2 and 4776. Therefore, the loop will break on the first iteration, and the program will print 9553.
<<<Output>>>
9553
