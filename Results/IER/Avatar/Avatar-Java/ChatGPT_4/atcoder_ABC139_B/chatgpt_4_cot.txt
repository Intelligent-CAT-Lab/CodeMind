<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a and b are initialized with 8 and 8 respectively according to the input. The variable kuti is initialized with 1 and variable tap with 0.
The code enters a while loop that continues as long as kuti is less than b (8 in this case).
Inside the while loop, the following operations occur:
- kuti is decreased by 1, which makes it 0 in the first iteration.
- Then kuti is increased by a (which is 8), making it 8 after the first iteration.
- tap is incremented by 1, making it 1 after the first iteration.
After the first iteration, kuti is no longer less than b, so the loop terminates.
The final value of tap, which is 1, is printed as the output.
