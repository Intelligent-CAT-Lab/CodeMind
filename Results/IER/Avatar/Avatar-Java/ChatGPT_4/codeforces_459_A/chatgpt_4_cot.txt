<<<Analysis>>>
The input provided initializes the variables x1, y1, x2, and y2 with the values 4, 0, 0, and 4 respectively.

The code then checks three conditions to determine the coordinates of the fourth point of a square given the coordinates of two opposite corners.

1. The first condition checks if x1 is equal to x2, which would mean that the two points are vertically aligned. This is not the case here since x1 is 4 and x2 is 0.

2. The second condition checks if y1 is equal to y2, which would mean that the two points are horizontally aligned. This is also not the case here since y1 is 0 and y2 is 4.

3. The third condition checks if the absolute difference between x1 and x2 is equal to the absolute difference between y1 and y2. This would mean that the two points are diagonally aligned at an angle that would form a square. In this case, the absolute difference between x1 and x2 is |4 - 0| = 4, and the absolute difference between y1 and y2 is |0 - 4| = 4. Since these differences are equal, the condition is met.

The code then prints the coordinates of the other two corners of the square, which are (x1, y2) and (x2, y1). Therefore, the output will be "4 ▁ 4 ▁ 0 ▁ 0".
