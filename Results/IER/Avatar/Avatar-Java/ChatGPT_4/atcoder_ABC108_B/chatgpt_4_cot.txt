<<<Analysis>>>
The input provided initializes the variables x1, y1, x2, and y2 with the values 2, 3, 6, and 6 respectively. The code then calculates the values of x3, y3, x4, and y4 using the given formulas:
- x3 = x2 + (y1 - y2) = 6 + (3 - 6) = 6 - 3 = 3
- y3 = y2 - (x1 - x2) = 6 - (2 - 6) = 6 - (-4) = 6 + 4 = 10
- x4 = x1 - (y2 - y1) = 2 - (6 - 3) = 2 - 3 = -1
- y4 = y1 + (x2 - x1) = 3 + (6 - 2) = 3 + 4 = 7

Finally, the code prints the calculated values of x3, y3, x4, and y4 separated by " ▁ ".

<<<Output>>>
3 ▁ 10 ▁ -1 ▁ 7
