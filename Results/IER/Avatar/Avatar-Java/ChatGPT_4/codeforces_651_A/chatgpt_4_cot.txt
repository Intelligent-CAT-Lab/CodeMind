<<<Analysis>>>
The variables num1 and num2 are initialized with 100 and 25 respectively according to the input. The variable counter is initialized with 0.

The code enters a while loop that continues as long as both num1 and num2 are not 0. Inside the loop, there is a check to break out of the loop if both num1 and num2 are 1, but this condition is not met initially.

The loop contains an if-else statement that checks if num1 is less than or equal to num2. If it is, num1 is incremented by 1 and num2 is decremented by 2. Otherwise, num1 is decremented by 2 and num2 is incremented by 1. After each operation, the counter is incremented by 1.

Let's simulate the loop:
- num1 = 100, num2 = 25, counter = 0 (initial values)
- num1 = 98, num2 = 26, counter = 1 (num1 > num2, so num1 -= 2, num2 += 1)
- num1 = 96, num2 = 27, counter = 2 (num1 > num2, so num1 -= 2, num2 += 1)
- ...
- This pattern continues until num2 becomes greater than num1.
- When num2 is greater than num1, the condition in the if statement will be true, and the operations will be num1 += 1, num2 -= 2.
- This will continue until num1 becomes 1 and num2 becomes 1, at which point the loop will break.

To find the exact counter value when the loop breaks, we need to calculate the number of iterations. Since num2 is increasing by 1 and decreasing by 2 in alternate steps, it will eventually reach 1. Each time num1 is decremented by 2 and num2 is incremented by 1, the sum of num1 and num2 decreases by 1. This will happen until num2 is greater than num1.

The sum of num1 and num2 is initially 125. We need to reach a point where num1 and num2 are both 1, which means the sum needs to be 2. The difference between 125 and 2 is 123. Since the sum decreases by 1 in each iteration, it will take 123 iterations to reach the sum of 2.

Therefore, the counter will be 123 when the loop breaks.
