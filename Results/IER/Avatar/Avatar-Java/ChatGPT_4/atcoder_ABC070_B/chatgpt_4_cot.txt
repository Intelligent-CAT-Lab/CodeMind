<<<Analysis>>>
The variables a, b, c, and d are initialized with 0, 50, 50, and 100 respectively according to the input. An integer array named 'array' of size 101 is created and initialized with all elements as 0.

The first for loop iterates from a (0) to b (50) exclusive, incrementing the value at each index of the 'array' by 1. After this loop, the elements from index 0 to 49 in 'array' will be 1, and the rest will remain 0.

The second for loop iterates from c (50) to d (100) exclusive, incrementing the value at each index of the 'array' by 1. After this loop, the elements from index 50 to 99 in 'array' will be 1, and the rest will remain as they were after the first loop.

The third for loop iterates over the entire 'array' and counts the number of times the value at an index is exactly 2. Since the first two loops incremented different ranges and there is no overlap between the ranges (0-49 and 50-99), there will be no index where the value is 2.

Therefore, the variable 'ans' will remain 0, as there are no indices in 'array' where the value is 2.
