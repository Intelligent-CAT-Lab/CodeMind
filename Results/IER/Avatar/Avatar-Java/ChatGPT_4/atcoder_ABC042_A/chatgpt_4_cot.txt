<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads three integers from the input and assigns them to num_1, num_2, and num_3 respectively. The input provided is "5 5 7", so num_1 is 5, num_2 is 5, and num_3 is 7.

The code then checks if any of the three numbers is 7. If one of them is 7, it checks if the other two numbers are both 5. If this condition is met, it prints "YES", otherwise it prints "NO".

In the given input, num_3 is 7, and both num_1 and num_2 are 5. Therefore, the condition for num_3 being 7 is met, and since num_1 and num_2 are both 5, the code will print "YES".
<<<Output>>>
YES
