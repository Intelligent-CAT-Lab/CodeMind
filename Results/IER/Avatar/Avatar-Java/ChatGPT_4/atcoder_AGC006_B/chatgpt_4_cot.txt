<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers N and x from the input, which are 2 and 1 respectively. It then checks if x is equal to 1 or 2 * N - 1, which would be 3 in this case. Since x is indeed equal to 1, the condition is true, and the code prints "No" and breaks out of the while loop. The rest of the code inside the while loop is not executed because of the break statement.

<<<Output>>>
No
