<<<Analysis>>>
The code is designed to calculate the number of strings of length N composed of the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' that do not contain the substring "AGC" in any form, including after swapping any two adjacent characters. The calculation is done using dynamic programming with memoization to avoid recalculating subproblems.

The input N is initialized with 99. The memo array is initialized to have 100 Map<String, Long> elements, each of which will store the number of valid strings ending with a particular 3-character sequence.

The `calc()` method starts the process by calling `dfs(0, "TTT")`, which represents the initial state with a pseudo 3-character sequence "TTT" (not part of the actual string).

The `dfs` method is a recursive function that takes the current length of the string being built and the last 3 characters of the string. It checks if the current state has already been computed and stored in the memo array. If not, it proceeds to try adding each of the four possible characters ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T') to the string and checks if the resulting 4-character string (including the new character) is valid by calling `isOK`.

The `isOK` method checks if the 4-character string contains "AGC" or would contain "AGC" after swapping any two adjacent characters. If the string is valid, the `dfs` method is called recursively with the new last 3 characters and the current length incremented by 1.

The result for each state is the sum of the results of these recursive calls, modulo 1000000007L. This result is stored in the memo array before the method returns it.

The `main` method creates an instance of the Main class, calls the `calc()` method, and prints the result.

Given the complexity of the problem and the large input (N = 99), it is not feasible to manually calculate the exact output. The output will be a long integer representing the number of valid strings of length 99 modulo 1000000007L.
