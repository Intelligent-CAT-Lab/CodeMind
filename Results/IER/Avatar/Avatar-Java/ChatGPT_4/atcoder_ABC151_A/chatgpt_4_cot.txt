<<<Analysis>>>
The Scanner object `sc` is created to read input from the standard input stream. The input string `s` is read from the input, which is "c". The `charAt(0)` method is used to get the first character of the string, which is 'c'. The character 'c' is then incremented using the `++` operator. In Java, incrementing a char type results in the next character in the Unicode character set. Since 'c' is the character before 'd' in the Unicode character set, incrementing 'c' results in 'd'. The incremented character 'd' is then printed to the standard output.
