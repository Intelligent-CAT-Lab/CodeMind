<<<Analysis>>>
The variables r, d, and x are initialized with 2, 1, and 2 respectively according to the input.
The code enters a for loop that will iterate 10 times.
In each iteration, it calculates a new value for x using the formula x = r * x - d, which in this case is x = 2 * x - 1.
The new value of x is then printed out.

Let's calculate the value of x for each iteration:
1. x = 2 * 2 - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3
2. x = 2 * 3 - 1 = 6 - 1 = 5
3. x = 2 * 5 - 1 = 10 - 1 = 9
4. x = 2 * 9 - 1 = 18 - 1 = 17
5. x = 2 * 17 - 1 = 34 - 1 = 33
6. x = 2 * 33 - 1 = 66 - 1 = 65
7. x = 2 * 65 - 1 = 130 - 1 = 129
8. x = 2 * 129 - 1 = 258 - 1 = 257
9. x = 2 * 257 - 1 = 514 - 1 = 513
10. x = 2 * 513 - 1 = 1026 - 1 = 1025

These values will be printed one per line in the output.
