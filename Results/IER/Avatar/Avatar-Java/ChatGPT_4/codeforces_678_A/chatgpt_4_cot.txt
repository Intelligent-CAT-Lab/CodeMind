<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers from the input, n and k, which are 999999999 and 1 respectively. It then calculates the next multiple of k that is greater than n. Since k is 1, any number divided by 1 is the number itself, and adding 1 to it gives the next integer. Therefore, the calculation is straightforward: (n / k + 1) * k = (999999999 / 1 + 1) * 1 = 999999999 + 1 = 1000000000. The result of this calculation is then printed to the console.
<<<Output>>>
