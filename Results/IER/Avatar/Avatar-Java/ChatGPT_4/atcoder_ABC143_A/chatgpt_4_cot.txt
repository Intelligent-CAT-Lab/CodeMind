<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two integers A and B from the input, which are 75 and 25 respectively. It then calculates the expression A - (B * 2). For the given input, this expression evaluates to 75 - (25 * 2), which is 75 - 50, resulting in 25. The ternary operator checks if the result of the expression is greater than 0. Since 25 is greater than 0, the condition is true, and the code outputs the result of the expression, which is 25. If the result of the expression had been 0 or negative, the code would have output 0 instead.
<<<Output>>>
