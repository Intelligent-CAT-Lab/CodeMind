<<<Analysis>>>
The code reads two values from the input: a long integer 'a' and a double 'b'. The values are initialized with 814793613347395 and 1.99 respectively according to the input.

The double 'b' is then multiplied by 100 and rounded to the nearest long integer using Math.round, resulting in 'c' being 199 (since 1.99 * 100 = 199.0 and rounding it doesn't change the value).

Next, 'c' is multiplied by 'a' to get 'd', which is the product of 814793613347395 and 199. The multiplication is performed as follows:

814793613347395
Ã—            199
-----------------
814793613347395 (this is 814793613347395 multiplied by 9, added to the total)
1633587226694790 (this is 814793613347395 multiplied by 90, added to the total)
162158722669479000 (this is 814793613347395 multiplied by 100, added to the total)
-----------------
162158722669479005 (sum of the above three numbers)

Finally, 'd' is divided by 100 to account for the earlier multiplication by 100, which effectively places the decimal point back in its correct position. The division is:

162158722669479005 / 100 = 1621587226694790.05

Since we are dealing with long integers, the decimal part is discarded, and the final result is 1621587226694790.
