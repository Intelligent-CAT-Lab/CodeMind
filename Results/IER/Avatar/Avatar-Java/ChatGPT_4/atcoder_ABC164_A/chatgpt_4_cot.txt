<<<Analysis>>>
The code uses a Scanner to read input from the standard input. It initializes an ArrayList of Strings called scList to store the input lines.

The for loop is intended to read multiple lines of input until an exception occurs (which would be caused by the end of input). However, since the condition for the for loop is `i >= 0`, which is always true, the loop will continue indefinitely until an exception is thrown. In this case, the exception is expected to be thrown when there is no more input to read, which will break the loop.

The input `1 100` is read as a single line and added to scList. Then, the first element of scList is split using the delimiter " ‚ñÅ ". The resulting array numlist will have two elements: "1" and "100".

These two elements are then parsed into integers and assigned to Sheep and Wolve, respectively. The condition in the if statement checks if Wolve is greater than or equal to Sheep. Since Wolve (100) is greater than Sheep (1), the condition is true, and "unsafe" is printed to the standard output.
