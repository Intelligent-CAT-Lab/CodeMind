{A 1000x1000 grid of zeros, with each row followed by a newline character. Since it's not practical to display 1,000,000 zeros here, the output is conceptually represented as follows:}

0000000000...0000
0000000000...0000
...
0000000000...0000
{Note: Each line contains 1000 zeros, and there are 1000 lines in total.}
