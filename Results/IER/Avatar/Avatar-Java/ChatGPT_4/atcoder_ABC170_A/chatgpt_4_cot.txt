<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read input from the user and an integer variable `anser` (which seems to be a typo for "answer") with a value of 0. It also initializes an integer array `count` with a size of 5, with all elements defaulting to 0.

The code then enters a for loop that iterates 5 times, corresponding to the indices of the `count` array (0 to 4). Inside the loop, the code reads an integer `x` from the input using the Scanner object and adds this value to the current element of the `count` array at index `i`.

After updating the `count` array, the code checks if the current element of `count` is equal to 0. If it is, the variable `anser` is set to the current index `i`.

The input provided is `1 2 3 4 0`. The loop will process each number as follows:
- First iteration (i=0): Reads 1, `count[0]` becomes 1, no change to `anser`.
- Second iteration (i=1): Reads 2, `count[1]` becomes 2, no change to `anser`.
- Third iteration (i=2): Reads 3, `count[2]` becomes 3, no change to `anser`.
- Fourth iteration (i=3): Reads 4, `count[3]` becomes 4, no change to `anser`.
- Fifth iteration (i=4): Reads 0, `count[4]` becomes 0, `anser` is set to 4.

After the loop, the code prints `anser + 1`, which is `4 + 1`.

Therefore, the output will be 5.
