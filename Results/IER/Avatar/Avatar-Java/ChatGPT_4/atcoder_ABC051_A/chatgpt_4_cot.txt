<<<Analysis>>>
The code initializes a Scanner object to read input from the standard input stream (System.in). The scanner is set to use a comma (",") as the delimiter, which means it will separate the input into tokens whenever it encounters a comma.

The scanner then reads three tokens using the `next()` method, which reads input until it encounters the delimiter (a comma in this case). The input provided is `pnxnn,muduhzn,aquud`.

The first call to `scanner.next()` reads the first token "pnxnn" up to the first comma and assigns it to the variable `a`.
The second call to `scanner.next()` reads the second token "muduhzn" up to the second comma and assigns it to the variable `b`.
The third call to `scanner.next()` reads the third token "aquud" up to the end of the input (since there are no more commas) and assigns it to the variable `c`.

Finally, the program prints the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` separated by " ▁ ".

Therefore, the output will be the three tokens separated by " ▁ ".
