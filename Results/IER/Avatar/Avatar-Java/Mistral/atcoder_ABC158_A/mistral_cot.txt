 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable str is initialized with the input "BBA".
It enters an if-else statement and checks if the value of variable str is equal to "AAA" or "BBB".
Since the value of variable str is "BBA", the condition is not met and the code executes the else block.
Therefore, the return value of the code is "Yes".
<<<Output>>>
Yes
