It enters a while loop and it iterates until a is less than b.
Inside the while loop, it calculates the remainder of a divided by b and adds it to variable res. Then it calculates the new value of a by dividing a by b and adding the remainder of a divided by b.
It continues this process until a is less than b.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable res as output, which is 10.
