 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n1 is initialized with 99992 according to the input.
It calculates the value of variable n using the formula `(long) ((Math.sqrt(1 + (8 * n1)) - 1) / 2)`.
It calculates the value of variable ans using the formula `n1 - (((n + 1) * n) / 2)`.
It then prints the value of ans, which is 49996.
<<<Output>>>
