 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized with the input string "0000000000".
It enters a while loop that checks if the string s contains the substring "0B " or "1B ". If it does, it replaces it with an empty string using the replaceAll() method.
Then it replaces the substring " B " with an empty string using the replaceAll() method.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable s, which is "0000000000".
<<<Output>>>
0000000000
