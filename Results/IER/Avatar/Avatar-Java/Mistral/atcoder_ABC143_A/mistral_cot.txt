 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes two integer inputs A and B from the user using the Scanner class.
It then checks if the difference between A and (B multiplied by 2) is greater than 0. If it is, it prints the difference. Otherwise, it prints 0.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code for the input `75 25` would be `50`.
