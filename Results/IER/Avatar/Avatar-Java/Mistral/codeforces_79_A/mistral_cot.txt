 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable x and y are initialized with 1 and 20 respectively according to the input. The variable turn is initialized with 0.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until the turn variable is not equal to 0.
Inside the while loop, it checks the turn variable and if it is even, it checks if the player can take 2 units of x and 2 units of y. If it can, it subtracts 2 units of x and 2 units of y from the variables x and y respectively.
If it is odd, it checks if the player can take 1 unit of x and 12 units of y. If it can, it subtracts 1 unit of x and 12 units of y from the variables x and y respectively.
If it is neither even nor odd, it checks if the player can take 0 units of x and 22 units of y. If it can, it subtracts 22 units of y from the variable y.
If none of the above conditions are met, it prints "Hanako" and returns.
After the loop finishes, it prints "Ciel" and returns.
