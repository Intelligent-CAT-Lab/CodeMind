 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N and x are initialized with 2 and 1 respectively according to the input.
It enters a while loop and it continues until it has no more input.
Inside the while loop, it checks if x is equal to 1 or 2 \* N - 1. If it is, it prints "No" and breaks out of the loop. Otherwise, it prints "Yes".
Then it initializes two variables low and high with x - 1 and x + 1 respectively.
It creates an empty ArrayDeque<Integer> object called deq and adds x to it.
It enters a while loop that continues until low is 0 or high is 2 \* N.
Inside the while loop, it checks if low is 0. If it is, it adds high + 1 to deq and increments high by 2.
If high is 2 \* N, it adds low - 1 to deq and decrements low by 2.
If neither of the above conditions are met, it adds low to deq, decrements low by 1 and adds high to deq, increments high by 1.
After the while loop finishes, it prints all the elements of deq in order.
