 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 9 according to the input. The variable s is initialized with a space.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until n becomes 0. In each iteration, it calculates the remainder of n divided by 2 and adds it to variable s with a space in between.
After the loop finishes, it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of variable s. In each iteration, it checks if the current character of variable s is equal to '1'. If it is, it increments the value of variable ans.
After the for loop finishes, it prints the value of variable ans as output, which is 3.
<<<Output>>>
