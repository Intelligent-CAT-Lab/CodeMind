 <<<Analysis>>>
The code uses the `Scanner` class to read input from the user. The `useDelimiter` method is used to set the delimiter as a comma.
The `next` method is used to read the first string, `a`, the second string, `b`, and the third string, `c`.
The `System.out.println` statement is used to print the three strings separated by spaces.
