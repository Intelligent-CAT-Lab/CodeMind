 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable r, variable d and variable x are initialized with 2, 1 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 9 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of x by multiplying variable r with variable x and subtracting variable d.
Then it prints the value of x in each iteration.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable x as output, which is 10.
