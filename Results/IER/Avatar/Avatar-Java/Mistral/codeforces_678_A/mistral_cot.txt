 <<<Analysis>>>
The program takes two integer inputs n and k from the user. In this case, n is 999999999 and k is 1.
The program calculates the value of ((n / k + 1) * k) by first dividing n by k and then adding 1 to the result. Then it multiplies the result by k.
In this case, the value of ((999999999 / 1 + 1) * 1) is 999999999.
<<<Output>>>
999999999
