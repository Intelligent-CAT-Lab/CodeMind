 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable i is initialized with 1 according to the input. The variable k is initialized with 360 and variable j is initialized with 1.
It enters an if statement to check if the value of i is between 1 and 179. Since 1 is within this range, it enters the while loop.
Inside the while loop, it repeatedly increments the value of variable j until it finds a value of j such that (i * j) % k == 0. This is equivalent to finding the smallest positive integer j such that i * j is divisible by k.
The loop continues until it finds such a value of j. Since i = 1, the smallest positive integer j that satisfies the condition is j = 1. Therefore, the return value of the code is 1.
