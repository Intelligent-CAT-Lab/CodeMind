The variable a, variable b, variable c and variable d are initialized with 0, 50, 50 and 100 respectively according to the input.
It creates an array of size 101 and initializes it with 0.
It enters two for loops, one for the range [a, b] and another for the range [c, d]. In each loop, it increments the value of array[i] by 1.
After the loops finishes, it iterates through the array and counts the number of elements that have a value of 2. It does this by checking if array[i] is equal to 2 and if it is, it increments the variable ans by 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 1.
