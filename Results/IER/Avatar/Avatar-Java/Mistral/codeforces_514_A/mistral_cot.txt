 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable x is initialized with 5728 according to the input.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until x becomes 0.
Inside the while loop, it calculates the remainder of x divided by 10 and assigns it to variable r.
Then it checks if 9 - r < r. If it is true, it means that the last digit of x is 0, so it adds 9 - r to the list. Otherwise, it means that the last digit of x is not 0, so it adds r to the list.
After the loop finishes, it initializes variable pow to 0 and variable newNumber to 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the size of the list.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the newNumber by adding the current element of the list multiplied by the power of 10 to the newNumber.
Then it increments the power of 10.
After the for loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable newNumber as output, which is 5728.
<<<Output>>>
5728
