 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four integer inputs from the user, which are stored in the variables x1, y1, x2 and y2.
It then calculates the coordinates of the four points on the plane using the given equations x3 = x2 + (y1 - y2), y3 = y2 - (x1 - x2), x4 = x1 - (y2 - y1) and y4 = y1 + (x2 - x1).
Finally, it prints the coordinates of the four points on the plane.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is:
```
10  10  0  0
```
This is because the coordinates of the four points on the plane are (6, 6), (3, 6), (0, 0) and (3, 0) respectively.
