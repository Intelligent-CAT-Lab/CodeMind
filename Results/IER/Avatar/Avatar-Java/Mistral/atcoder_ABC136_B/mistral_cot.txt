 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 99999 according to the input. The variable count is initialized with 0. The variable temp is initialized with N.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until temp becomes 0. Inside the while loop, it calculates the number of digits of the current interger temp by repeatedlylly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable count.
After the while loop finishes, it enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to count. Inside the for loop, it checks if the current iteration is the last iteration by checking if i is equal to count. If it is, it adds the number of digits of N minus the number of digits of N minus 1 plus 1 to variable ans. If it is not, it checks if the current iteration is the first iteration by checking if i is equal to 1. If it is, it adds 9 to variable ans. If it is not, it checks if the current iteration is odd by checking if i is odd. If it is odd, it adds the number of digits of N raised to the power of i minus the number of digits of N raised to the power of i minus 1 to variable ans.
After the for loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 100000.
<<<Output>>>
100000
