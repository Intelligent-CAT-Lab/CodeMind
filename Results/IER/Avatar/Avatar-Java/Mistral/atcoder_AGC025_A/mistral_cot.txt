 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with the input "9".
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to n.length()-1 to check each character of the string n.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character is not equal to '0'. If it is not, it calculates the sum of all the characters in the string n by iterating through all the characters and adding their ASCII value to variable sum.
Then it prints the value of variable sum.
After the loop finishes, it checks if the first character of the string n is '1'. If it is, it prints 10.
After the condition is checked, it prints the first character of the string n.
<<<Output>>>
