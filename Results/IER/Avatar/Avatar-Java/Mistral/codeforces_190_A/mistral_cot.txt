 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and variable m are initialized with 59 and 96 respectively according to the input.
It enters an if statement and it checks if n is equal to 0. If it is, it checks if m is not equal to 0. If it is, it prints "Impossible". If it is not, it prints 0 0.
It then enters another if statement and it checks if m is less than or equal to n. If it is, it checks if m is equal to 0. If it is, it assigns 1 to variable m. If it is not, it prints n and (m + n - 1).
It then enters another if statement and it checks if m is greater than n. If it is, it prints m and (m + n - 1).
Since m is greater than n, it prints 96 195.
<<<Output>>>
