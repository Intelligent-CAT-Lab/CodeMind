 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and variable k are initialized with 10 and 3 respectively according to the input.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until l is greater than n. The value of variable l is also passed to variable r.
Inside the while loop, it calculates the length of the current substring by adding the length of the current substring and the length of the next substring.
Then it adds the length of the current substring to the dp array at index j.
After the while loop finishes, it enters two nested for loops. The outer for loop iterates from 1 to k and the inner for loop iterates from 1 to q.
Inside the outer for loop, it calculates the dp value at index i * (q + 1) + j by adding the dp value at index i * (q + 1) + j - 1 and the dp value at index (i - 1) * (q + 1) + q - j + 1 multiplied by the length of the current substring.
Then it calculates the remainder of the dp value at index i * (q + 1) + j by dividing it by mod.
After the nested for loops finishes, it prints the dp value at index k * (q + 1) - 1.
