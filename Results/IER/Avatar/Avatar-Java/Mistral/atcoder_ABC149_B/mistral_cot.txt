 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable A, variable B and variable K are initialized with 1000000000000, 1000000000000 and 1000000000000 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the value of variable n by subtracting variable K from variable A.
It enters an if-else statement to check the value of variable n.
If variable n is less than or equal to 0, it prints "0   0" as output.
If variable n is less than 0, it prints "0   " followed by the value of variable A + B - K.
If variable n is greater than 0, it prints the value of variable n followed by the value of variable B.
Since variable n is greater than 0, it prints "1000000000000 1000000000000" followed by "1000000000000" as output.
<<<Output>>>
1000000000000 1000000000000
