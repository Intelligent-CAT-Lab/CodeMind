 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable d and variable x are initialized with 1000, 100 and 100 respectively according to the input.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until N is less than or equal to 0.5.
Inside the while loop, it calculates the value of adnum by adding the value of d and x multiplied by (N - 0.5) to it.
Then it adds the value of adnum to the variable ans.
Then it updates the value of d and x using the following formula:
d = (N + 1.0) * d / N + (5.0 * x) / (2.0 * N)
x = (1.0 + (2.0 / N)) * x
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output.
