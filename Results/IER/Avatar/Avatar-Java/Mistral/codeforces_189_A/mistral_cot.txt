The variable n is initialized with 4 according to the input. And variable a is initialized with 29, 27 and 18.
It creates an array d of size n+1 and fills it with -500. It also initializes variable max with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 4 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable max.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 2 to check each integer j in this range.
It checks if i - a[j] >= 0 and if d[i - a[j]] != -1. If both conditions are met, it updates the value of d[i] with the maximum of d[i] and d[i - a[j]] + 1.
After the loops finishes, it print the fianl value of variable max as output, which is 3.
