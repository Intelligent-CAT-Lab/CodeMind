 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized with the input string.
It creates an array ar of size 26, where each element represents the count of a character in the input string.
It enters a for loop and iterates through each character in the input string. For each character, it subtracts 97 from its ASCII value and uses the resulting integer as an index to increment the corresponding element in the array ar.
It enters another for loop and iterates through each element in the array ar. If the count of a character is odd, it increments the variable cntod.
It checks the value of variable cntod. If it is 0, it prints "First". Otherwise, it checks if cntod is even or odd. If it is even, it prints "Second". Otherwise, it prints "First".
<<<Output>>>
First
