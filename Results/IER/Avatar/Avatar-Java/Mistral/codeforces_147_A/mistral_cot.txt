 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 5 and variable a is initialized with 1.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 5 to check each integer a in this range.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the factorial of the current interger a by repeatedlly multiplying the current interger a with the previous interger a-1.
Then it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger a by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum falls within the range [1, 5]. If it does, it prints the current interger a followed by a comma and a space.
After the loop finishes, it prints the fianl value of variable sum as output, which is 15.
<<<Output>>>
1!1 , 2!2 , 3!3 , 4!4 , 5!5
15
