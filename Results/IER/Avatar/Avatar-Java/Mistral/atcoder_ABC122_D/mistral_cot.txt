 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 99 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 98 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable current.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger current by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum falls within the range [2, 5]. If it does, it adds the current interger current to variable answer. The condition is met when i is 2,3,4,5,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60,61,62,63,64,65,66,67,68,69,70,71,72,73,74,75,76,77,78,79,80,81,82,83,84,85,86,87,88,89,90,91,92,93,94,95,96,97,98,99.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable answer as output, which is 100.
