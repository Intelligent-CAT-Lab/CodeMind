 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable X is initialized with 9552 according to the input.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until it finds a prime number.
Inside the while loop, it first calculates the mid of the current number by dividing it by 2.
Then it sets the flag variable to false.
It enters a for loop that iterates from 2 to mid. For each iteration, it checks if the current number is divisible by the current value of i. If it is, it sets the flag variable to true and breaks out of the for loop.
After the for loop finishes, it checks the value of flag. If it is true, it means that the current number is not a prime number, so it increments the prime variable and continues the while loop. If it is false, it means that the current number is a prime number, so it prints the value of prime and exits the while loop.
After the while loop finishes, it prints the value of prime, which is 9553.
<<<Output>>>
9553
