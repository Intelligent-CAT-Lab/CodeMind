 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 512 according to the input.
The code checks if n is a power of 2 by checking if (n & (n - 1)) == 0.
A power of 2 is a number that is equal to its binary representation minus 1. For example, 2^5 = 32, 2^6 = 64, 2^7 = 128, 2^8 = 256, 2^9 = 512.
Since 512 is a power of 2, the condition (n & (n - 1)) == 0 is true and the code prints "YES".
<<<Output>>>
YES
