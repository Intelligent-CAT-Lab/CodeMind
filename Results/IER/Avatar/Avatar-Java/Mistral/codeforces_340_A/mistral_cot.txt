The variable x, variable y, variable a and variable b are initialized with 1, 1, 1 and 1000000000 respectively according to the input. And variable c is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 1000000000 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the greatest common divisor of variable x and variable y using the gcd function.
Then it calculates the least common multiple of variable x and variable y by dividing variable x and variable y by their greatest common divisor.
It enters another for loop and it iterates from 1000000000 to 1 to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the calculated variable j is divisible by the least common multiple of variable x and variable y. If it is, it breaks out of the loop.
It enters another for loop and it iterates from 1 to 1000000000 to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the calculated variable j is divisible by the least common multiple of variable x and variable y. If it is, it breaks out of the loop.
It checks if both the for loops have broken out of the loop. If both have, it calculates the value of variable c by subtracting the value of variable i from the value of variable j and dividing the result by the least common multiple of variable x and variable y.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable c as output, which is 1.
