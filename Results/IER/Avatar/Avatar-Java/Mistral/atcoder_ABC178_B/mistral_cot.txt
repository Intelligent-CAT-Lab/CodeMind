 <<<Analysis>>>
The code takes four long inputs from the user, a, b, c and d.
It uses the Math.max() method to find the maximum value among the four inputs.
It then uses the Math.max() method again to find the maximum value among the two maximum values found in the previous step.
Finally, it returns the result of the second Math.max() method.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code is 418379342.
