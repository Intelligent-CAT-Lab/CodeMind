The variable s1 is initialized with the input string. The variable ans is initialized with 0 and c1 and c0 are initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the input string s1.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character of the string s1 is '1'. If it is, it decrements c0 and increments ans. If c0 is greater than 0, it means that the previous character was '0' and it decrements c0. If c0 is less than or equal to 0, it means that the previous character was '1' and it increments c1.
If the current character of the string s1 is not '1', it decrements c1 and increments ans. If c1 is greater than 0, it means that the previous character was '1' and it decrements c1. If c1 is less than or equal to 0, it means that the previous character was '0' and it increments c0.
After the loop finishes, it multiplies the value of variable ans by 2 and prints it as output.
