The variable n and variable k are initialized with 24 and 7440 respectively according to the input. The variable i is initialized with 1.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until k - req < 0.
Inside the while loop, it checks if k - req >= 0. If it does, it subtracts the value of req from k and increments the value of i. If k - req < 0, it breaks out of the loop.
Then it checks if i % n != 0. If it is not, it assigns the value of n to variable req. Otherwise, it assigns the value of i % n to variable req.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable k as output, which is 7440.
<<<Output>>>
7440
