 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable x1, y1, x2 and y2 are initialized with 4, 0, 0 and 4 respectively according to the input.
It enters a series of if-else statements to check the relationship between x1, y1, x2 and y2.
The first if statement checks if x1 is equal to x2. Since x1 is 4 and x2 is 0, it is not equal to x2. So this condition is not met.
The second if statement checks if y1 is equal to y2. Since y1 is 0 and y2 is 4, it is not equal to y2. So this condition is not met.
The third if statement checks if Math.abs(x1 - x2) is equal to Math.abs(y1 - y2). Since Math.abs(4 - 0) is not equal to Math.abs(0 - 4), this condition is not met.
Since none of the conditions are met, the else statement is executed and it prints -1 as output.
<<<Output>>>
-1
