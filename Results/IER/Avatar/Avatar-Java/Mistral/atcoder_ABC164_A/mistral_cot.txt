 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable Sheep and Wolve are initialized with 1 and 100 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 0 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable Sheep.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger Sheep by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum falls within the range [1, 100]. If it does, it prints "safe" otherwise it prints "unsafe".
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable Sheep as output, which is 1.
<<<Output>>>
safe
