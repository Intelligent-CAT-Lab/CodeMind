The variable gen, variable st and variable tim are initialized with 6289344232651169, 4170875805886064 and 618522710 respectively according to the input.
And variable beg is initialized with 0 and variable end is initialized with 1.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until variable beg equals variable end.
Inside the while loop, it calculates the middle value of variable beg and variable end by adding 1 to variable beg and dividing variable end by 2.
Then it calls the function get(long a) to calculate the value of variable a.
It compares the value of variable a with variable gen and variable st. If the value of variable a is greater than variable gen, it updates variable end to variable beg - 1. Otherwise, it updates variable beg to variable med + 1.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable beg - st + 1 as output, which is 1.
