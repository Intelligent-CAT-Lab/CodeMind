The variable y is initialized with 2096 according to the input.
The function check\_leap(y) is called to check if y is a leap year.
The variable sum is initialized with 0 and mod is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from y+1 to infinity to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger i by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum is divisible by 7. If it is, it checks if the current year is a leap year or not. If it is a leap year and y is also a leap year, it prints the current year i. If it is not a leap year and y is also not a leap year, it continues to the next iteration. If it is a leap year and y is not a leap year, or if it is not a leap year and y is a leap year, it continues to the next iteration.
After the loop finishes, it returns the current year i.
<<<Output>>>
2096
