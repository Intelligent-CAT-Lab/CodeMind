 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n and m are initialized with 87 and 34 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 33 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of n / m and rounds it up to the nearest integer using ceil() method.
Then it prints the value of n / m.
After the loop finishes, it prints the value of ceil(n / m).
The output is:
```
1 1
```
<<<Output>>>
