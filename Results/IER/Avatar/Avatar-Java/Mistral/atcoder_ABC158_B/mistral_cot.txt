 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N, variable A and variable B are initialized with 501719768609305159, 370614275896614890 and 131105492712690269 respectively according to the input.
It creates a Solver object and calls its run() method.
Inside the run() method, it reads the input values using Scanner object and assigns them to variables N, A and B.
It calculates the value of base by dividing N by the sum of A and B.
It calculates the value of mod by taking the remainder of N divided by the sum of A and B.
It checks if mod is greater than or equal to A, if it is, it assigns the value of A to mod.
It prints the final value of base * A + mod as output.
