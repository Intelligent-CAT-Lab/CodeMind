 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable str is initialized with the input "8.3". The variable index is initialized with the index of the first dot in the string, which is 2. The variable d is initialized with the value of the digit after the dot, which is 3. The variable i is initialized with the value of the digit before the dot, which is 8.
It enters the if statement and checks if i is equal to 9. Since i is not equal to 9, it proceeds to the next if statement.
It checks if d is greater than or equal to 5. Since d is less than 5, it proceeds to the else block.
It writes the substring of the input string from the beginning to the index - 1 (which is 1 in this case) and the value of i + 1 (which is 9 in this case) to the output stream.
It writes the newline character to the output stream.
