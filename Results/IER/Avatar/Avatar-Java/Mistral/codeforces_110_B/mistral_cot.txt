 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 100 according to the input.
It enters an if-else statement and checks if n is equal to 1. Since it is not equal to 1, it moves to the else block.
Inside the else block, it enters another if-else statement and checks if n is equal to 2. Since it is not equal to 2, it moves to the else block.
Inside the else block, it enters another if-else statement and checks if n is equal to 3. Since it is not equal to 3, it moves to the else block.
Inside the else block, it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 24 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable t.
Inside the for loop, it prints the string "abcd" 6 times.
After the loop finishes, it checks the value of variable t. Since t is 1, it prints the string "a".
After the if-else statement, it returns the value of variable t, which is 1.
