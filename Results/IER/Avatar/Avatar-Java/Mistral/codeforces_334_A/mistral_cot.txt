The variable n is initialized with 6 according to the input. And variable square is initialized with 6 * 6 = 36.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 36 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger num by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum falls within the range [2, 5]. If it does, it adds the current interger i to variable answer. The condition is met when i is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable answer as output, which is 100.
<<<Output>>>
100
