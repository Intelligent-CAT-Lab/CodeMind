 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable num1 and variable num2 are initialized with 100 and 25 respectively according to the input.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until num1 is 0 or num2 is 0.
Inside the while loop, it checks if num1 is equal to 1 and num2 is also equal to 1. If it is, it breaks out of the loop.
If num1 is less than or equal to num2, it increments num1 and decrements num2 by 2.
If num1 is greater than num2, it decrements num1 by 2 and increments num2.
It also increments the counter variable for each iteration.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable counter as output, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
