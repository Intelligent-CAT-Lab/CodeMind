The variable n is initialized with 9995083 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 9995083 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of ans by multiplying i with the value of n divided by i and the value of n divided by i plus 1 and then dividing the result by 2.
The formula used to calculate ans is: ans = (i * (n / i) * ((n / i) + 1)) / 2
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
