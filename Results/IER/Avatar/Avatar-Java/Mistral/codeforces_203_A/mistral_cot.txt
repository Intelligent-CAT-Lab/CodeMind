 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable points, variable t, variable a and variable b are initialized with 3, 1, 20 and 15 respectively according to the input. And variable ta and variable tb are initialized with 17 and 5 respectively.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the points variable is equal to a - i \* ta + b - j \* tb or if points variable is equal to 0 or if points variable is equal to a - ta \* i or if points variable is equal to b - tb \* j. If any of these conditions are met, it prints "YES" and returns from the function.
It also enters another for loop and it iterates from 1 to 1 to check each integer j in this range.
After the loops finishes, it returns "NO" as none of the conditions are met.
<<<Output>>>
NO
