 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first imports the java.util package and creates a Scanner object to read input from the user.
It then reads two long values a and b from the user using the nextLong() method of the Scanner object.
It then checks the values of a and b using if-else statements.
If both a and b are zero, it prints "Zero".
If both a and b are negative, it checks if the difference between a and b is even or odd using the modulo operator (%). If it is even, it prints "Positive". Otherwise, it prints "Negative".
If both a and b are positive, it prints "Positive".
<<<Output>>>
Negative
