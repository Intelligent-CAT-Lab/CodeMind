The variable l and variable r are initialized with 999999999 and 999999999 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 9 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable temp.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the maximum value of the form 10^i - 10^(i/2) by repeatedlylly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable maxxes.
Then it calls the mult function with variable l and variable r and it returns the maximum value between mult(l) and mult(r).
After the loop finishes, it calls the mult function with variable l and variable r again and it returns the maximum value between mult(l) and mult(r).
Then it enters another for loop and it iterates from 0 to 9 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable temp.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current integer i is less than or equal to l and greater than or equal to r. If it is, it returns the maximum value between maxxes[i] and res.
After the loop finishes, it prints the fianl value of variable res as output, which is 999999999.
<<<Output>>>
999999999
