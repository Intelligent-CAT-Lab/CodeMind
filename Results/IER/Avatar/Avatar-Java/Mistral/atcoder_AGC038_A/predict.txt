The variable h, variable w, variable a and variable b are initialized with 1000, 1000, 0 and 0 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 1000 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of x based on the condition j < a ^ i < b. If the condition is met, x is set to 1, otherwise it is set to 0.
Then it appends the value of x to StringBuilder sb.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of StringBuilder sb as output, which is:
```
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
