 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable s is initialized with the input "0". The variable ans1 and ans2 are initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the input string s. The value of variable i is also passed to variable c.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current index i is even or odd. If it is even, it checks if the current character c is '0' or not. If it is '0', it increments the value of ans1. Otherwise, it increments the value of ans2.
If it is odd, it checks if the current character c is '1' or not. If it is '1', it increments the value of ans1. Otherwise, it increments the value of ans2.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans1 and ans2.
The value of ans1 is 1 and ans2 is 0.
