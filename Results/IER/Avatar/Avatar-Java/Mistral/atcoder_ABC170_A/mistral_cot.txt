The variable anser is initialized with 0 and count is an array of size 5.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 4 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable x.
Inside the for loop, it adds the value of variable x to the corresponding element of the count array.
Then it checks if the count of any element in the count array is 0. If it is, it assigns the current value of i to variable anser.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable anser as output, which is 4.
