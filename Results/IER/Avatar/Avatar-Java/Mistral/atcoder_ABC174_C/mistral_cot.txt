The variable n is initialized with 260522 according to the input. The variable num is initialized with 7. The variable res is initialized with 1.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until num is greater than or equal to n. Inside the loop, it calculates the next value of num by multiplying it with 10 and adding 7. It also increments the value of res.
Then it enters another while loop that runs indefinitely. It checks if num is divisible by n. If it is, it breaks out of the loop. Otherwise, it continues to iterate. Inside the loop, it calculates the next value of num by taking the remainder of num divided by n and then multiplying it with 10 and adding 7. It also increments the value of res.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable res as output, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10
