 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 366735600000 according to the input.
It calls the function primeFactor(N) to find the prime factors of N.
The primeFactor function returns a list of integers representing the count of each prime factor found in N.
It then iterates through the list of prime factors and for each prime factor, it finds the smallest power of that prime factor that is greater than or equal to N.
It does this by repeatedly subtracting the current power of the prime factor from N and incrementing the power until N is no longer divisible by that prime factor.
It keeps track of the number of times it subtracts the power of the prime factor from N and increments the power.
It repeats this process for all prime factors found in N.
Finally, it prints the total number of times it subtracted the power of a prime factor from N.
<<<Output>>>
The return value of the code would be 100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
