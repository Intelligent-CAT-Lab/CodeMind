 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 999999991 according to the input. And variable sum is initialized with 0.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until n becomes 0.
Inside the while loop, it calculates the sum of the digits of the current interger n by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a while loop and adding it to variable sum.
Then it checks if the calculated variable sum is equal to 1. If it is, it increments the variable total by 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable total as output, which is 1.
<<<Output>>>
