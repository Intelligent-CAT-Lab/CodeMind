 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable monsterHP and variable servalATK are initialized with 10000 and 1 respectively according to the input.
It calculates the remainder of monsterHP divided by servalATK using the modulo operator (%). The remainder is stored in variable mod.
Then it calculates the quotient of monsterHP divided by servalATK using the division operator (/). The quotient is stored in variable ans.
It checks if the remainder is greater than 0. If it is, it increments the value of variable ans by 1.
Finally, it prints the value of variable ans as output.
