The variable o, variable g and variable x are initialized with 1000, 1000000000 and 1000 respectively according to the input. And variable borrow is initialized with 0.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 1000000000 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable x.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of x by multiplying i with o.
Then it calculates the value of borrow by subtracting n from x.
After the loop finishes, it checks if the value of borrow is less than or equal to 0. If it is, it prints 0 as output. Otherwise, it prints the value of borrow as output.
In this case, the value of borrow is 100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
