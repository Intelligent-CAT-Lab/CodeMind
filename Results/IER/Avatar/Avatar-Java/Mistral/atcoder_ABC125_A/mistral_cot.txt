The variable n, variable k, variable m, variable l, variable a and variable b are initialized with 20, 0, 19, 0, 20 and 20 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 20 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of variable k by adding the value of variable b to the value of variable k for each integer i in the range.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable k as output, which is 380.
