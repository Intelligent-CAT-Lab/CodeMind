The variable input is initialized with the input string "2 2" using the Scanner class. The variable result is initialized with 0, variable p is initialized with 0 and variable g is initialized with 1.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to the length of the input string - 1. The value of variable i is also passed to variable index.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character at index i is 'g'. If it is, it increments the variable result by 1 and increments variable p by 1. If p + 1 is less than or equal to g, it means that the current character is the first 'g' in the string, so it increments p by 1. If p + 1 is greater than g, it means that the current character is the second 'g' in the string, so it increments g by 1.
If the current character is not 'g', it increments variable p by 1. If p + 1 is less than or equal to g, it means that the current character is the first non-'g' character in the string, so it increments p by 1. If p + 1 is greater than g, it means that the current character is the second non-'g' character in the string, so it increments g by 1 and decrements the variable result by 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable result as output, which is 2.
