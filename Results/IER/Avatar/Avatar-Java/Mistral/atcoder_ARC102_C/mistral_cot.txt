 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable k and n are initialized with 1 and 200000 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to 200000 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the number of pairs of integers that can be chosen from the range [1, 2k] by using the formula k - i / 2.
It also calculates the number of active integers that are not included in the pairs by subtracting the number of pairs from 2k.
It then calculates the total number of combinations of choosing pairs of integers and the number of combinations of choosing active integers.
It uses the formula nchoosek[pairs][j] to calculate the number of combinations of choosing j elements from a set of k elements.
It uses the formula nchoosek[n + active - 1][active + j - 1] to calculate the number of combinations of choosing j elements from a set of n + active - 1 elements.
It uses the formula nchoosek[n + active - 2][active + j - 1] to calculate the number of combinations of choosing j elements from a set of n + active - 2 elements.
It uses the formula times2 \* nchoosek[pairs][j] to calculate the number of combinations of choosing j elements from a set of k elements.
It uses the formula total += choice \* nchoosek[n + active - 1][active + j - 1] to calculate the total number of combinations of choosing pairs of integers and the number of combinations of choosing active integers.
It uses the formula total += choice \* nchoosek[n + active - 2][active + j - 1] to calculate the total number of combinations of choosing pairs of integers and the number of combinations of choosing active integers.
It uses the formula total %= mod to calculate the final result.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable total as output, which is 1.
