 <<<Analysis>>>
The variable A, variable B, variable C and variable D are initialized with 2, 1, 3 and 4 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 2 to 4 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable powI.
Inside the for loop, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 1 to 3 to check each integer j in this range. The value of variable j is also passed to variable powC.
It calculates the value of dp[i][j] by multiplying dp[i - 1][j] with j and adding sum[i - 1][j - 1] * j.
It calculates the value of sum[i][j] by multiplying sum[i][j - 1] with (i + 1) and adding dp[i][j].
After the two loops finishes, it calculates the final value of ans by multiplying dp[i][j] with ((powC * powI) % MOD) and adding sum[i - 1][j - 1] * j.
It then prints the final value of ans as output, which is 10.
