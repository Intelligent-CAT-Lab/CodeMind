 <<<Analysis>>>
The code first reads three integers from the user using the Scanner class. The first integer is stored in variable num\_1, the second integer is stored in variable num\_2 and the third integer is stored in variable num\_3.
It then checks the value of variable num\_1, num\_2 and num\_3 using if-else statements.
If num\_1 is equal to 7, it checks if num\_2 and num\_3 are also equal to 5. If all three conditions are met, it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".
If num\_2 is equal to 7, it checks if num\_1 and num\_3 are also equal to 5. If all three conditions are met, it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".
If num\_3 is equal to 7, it checks if num\_2 and num\_1 are also equal to 5. If all three conditions are met, it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".

<<<Output>>>
