he variable a and variable b are initialized with 1 and 2 respectively according to the input.
The variable tmp1 and variable tmp2 are initialized with 9 and 49 respectively according to the input.
The variable h is calculated by dividing tmp1 by 6 and multiplying it by pi. The variable m is calculated by dividing tmp2 by 30 and multiplying it by pi.
The variable rad is calculated by subtracting variable h from variable m.
The variable res is calculated by taking the square root of the sum of the squares of variable a and variable b, minus the product of the product of variable a and variable b and the cosine of variable rad.
After the calculations, it prints the final value of variable res as output, which is 2.0.
<<<Output>>>
2.0
