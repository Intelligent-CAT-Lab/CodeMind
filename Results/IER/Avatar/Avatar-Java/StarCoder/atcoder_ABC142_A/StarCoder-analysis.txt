e variable N is initialized with 64 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 64 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger i is odd. If it is, it adds 1 to variable sum.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable sum divided by N as output, which is 0.128.
