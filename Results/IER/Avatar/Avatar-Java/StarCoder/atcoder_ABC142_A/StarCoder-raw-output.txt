e variable N is initialized with 64 according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 64 to check each integer i in this range.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger i is odd. If it is, it adds 1 to variable sum.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable sum divided by N as output, which is 0.128.
<<<Output>>>
0.128

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        Scanner stdin = new Scanner(System.in);
        int N = stdin.nextInt();
        int sum = 0;
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
            if (i % 2!= 0) {
                sum += 1;
            }
        }
        
        System.out.println(sum);
    }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```64
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
