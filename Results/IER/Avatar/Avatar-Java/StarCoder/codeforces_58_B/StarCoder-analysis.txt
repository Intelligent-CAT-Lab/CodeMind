he variable n is initialized with 733035.
The variable m is initialized with the value of variable n.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from n-1 to 1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable m.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger m is divisible by the current interger i. If it is, it prints the current interger i and the current interger m.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable m as output, which is 1.
