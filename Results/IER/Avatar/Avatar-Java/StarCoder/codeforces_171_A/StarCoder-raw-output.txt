he variable a is initialized with 35005211 and variable b is initialized with 521595368.
The function getNum is called with the values of variables a and b as parameters.
Inside the function, variable reverseB is initialized with 0.
It enters a while loop and it iterates while variable b is greater than 0.
Inside the while loop, it calculates the reverse of variable b by repeatedlly extracting the digits of number with a modulus operator and adding it to variable reverseB.
After the loop finishes, it returns the value of variable reverseB as output.
The function getNum is called again with the values of variables a and reverseB as parameters.
The function returns the sum of the values of variables a and reverseB as output.
