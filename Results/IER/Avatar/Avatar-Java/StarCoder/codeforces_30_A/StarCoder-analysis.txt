he variable A is initialized with 7 and variable B is initialized with 896. Variable N is initialized with 7.
The code enters a for loop and it iterates from -1000 to 1000.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of x to the power of N and multiplies it with variable A.
Then it checks if the calculated value equals variable B. If it does, it prints the value of x as output.
If the calculated value does not equal variable B, it prints "No solution" as output.
