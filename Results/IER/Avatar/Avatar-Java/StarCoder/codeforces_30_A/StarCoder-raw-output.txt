he variable A is initialized with 7 and variable B is initialized with 896. Variable N is initialized with 7.
The code enters a for loop and it iterates from -1000 to 1000.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the value of x to the power of N and multiplies it with variable A.
Then it checks if the calculated value equals variable B. If it does, it prints the value of x as output.
If the calculated value does not equal variable B, it prints "No solution" as output.
<<<Output>>>
-1000

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class A31 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
        int N = in.nextInt();
        int[] arr = new int[N];
        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
            arr[i] = in.nextInt();
        }
        int max = arr[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < N; i++) {
            if (arr[i] > max) {
                max = arr[i];
            }
        }
        System.out.println(max);
    }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 1 2 3 4 5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 5.
The code enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 4.
Inside the for loop, it initializes the value of variable i with the value of the current iteration of the for loop.
Then it initializes the value of the current element of the array arr with the value of variable i.
The code enters another for loop and it iterates from 1 to 4.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the value of the current element of the array arr is greater than the value of variable max. If it is, it updates the value of variable max with the value of the current element of the array arr
