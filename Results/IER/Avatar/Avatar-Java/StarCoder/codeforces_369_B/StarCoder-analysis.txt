he variable n, variable k, variable l, variable r, variable sAll and variable sk are initialized with 1 respectively according to the input.
The variable ans is initialized with an array of length n, and it is filled with value l.
The variable sAll is subtracted by the sum of the values of variables sk and (n - k) * l.
The variable sk is subtracted by k * l.
The while loop is executed until variable sk is greater than 0.
Inside the while loop, the variable idx is initialized with n - 1.
The while loop is executed until variable sk is greater than 0 and variable idx is greater than or equal to n - k.
Inside the while loop, the value of variable ans at index idx is incremented by 1.
The variable sk is decremented by 1.
The while loop is executed until variable sAll is greater than 0.
Inside the while loop, the variable idx is initialized with 0.
The while loop is executed until variable sAll is greater than 0 and variable idx is less than n - k.
Inside the while loop, the value of variable ans at index idx is incremented by 1.
The variable sAll is decremented by 1.
The array ans is returned as output.
