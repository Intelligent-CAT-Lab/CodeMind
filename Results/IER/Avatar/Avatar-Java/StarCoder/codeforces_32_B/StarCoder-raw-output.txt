he variable s is initialized with the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of variable s. The value of variable i is also passed to variable str.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current character of variable s is '.' or not. If it is, it adds 0 to variable str.
If it is not, it checks if the current character of variable s is '-' and the next character is '.'. If it is, it adds 1 to variable str.
If it is not, it adds 2 to variable str and it increments variable i by 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable str as output, which is 022.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class cf32B {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
        String s = input.next();
        String str = "";

        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            if (s.charAt(i) == '.') {
                str += 0;
            } else {
                if (s.charAt(i) == '-' && s.charAt(i + 1) == '.') {
                    str += 1;
                } else {
                    str += 2;
                    i++;
                }
            }
        }

        System.out.println(str);
    }
}

<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```-..
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
