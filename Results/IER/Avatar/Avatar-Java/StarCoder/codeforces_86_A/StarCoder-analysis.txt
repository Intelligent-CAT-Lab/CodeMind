he variable l and variable r are initialized with 999999999 and 999999999 respectively according to the input.
The variable res is initialized with 0.
The variable maxxes is initialized with 10 elements.
The variable temp is initialized with 0.
The for loop iterates from 0 to 9 to initialize the elements of array maxxes.
The variable temp is multiplied by 10 and added by 9 to get the next element of array maxxes.
The variable temp is divided by 2 and multiplied by (temp - temp/2) to get the next element of array maxxes.
The variable res is compared with the maximum of the current value of res and the next element of array maxxes.
The variable res is compared with the maximum of the current value of res and the next element of array maxxes.
The for loop iterates from 0 to 9 to check if the current element of array maxxes falls within the range [l, r]. If it does, it updates the value of res to the maximum of the current value of res and the next element of array maxxes.
The variable res is printed as output.
