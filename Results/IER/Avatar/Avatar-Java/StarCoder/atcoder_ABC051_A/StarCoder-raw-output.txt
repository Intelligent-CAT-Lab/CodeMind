he variable a, variable b and variable c are initialized with the input.
The code concatenates the three variables a, b and c with a space in between and prints the result.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        scanner.useDelimiter(",");
        
        String a = scanner.next();
        String b = scanner.next();
        String c = scanner.next();
        
        System.out.println(a + " ▁ " + b + " ▁ " + c);
    }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```pnxnn,muduhzn,aquud
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
