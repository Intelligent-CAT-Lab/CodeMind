he variable o, variable g and variable x are initialized with 1000, 1000000000 and 0 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 1000 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is multiplied by variable o and added to variable x.
After the loop finishes, it calculates the difference between variable x and variable n and stores it in variable borrow.
If the value of variable borrow is less than or equal to 0, it prints 0 as output. Otherwise, it prints the value of variable borrow as output.
