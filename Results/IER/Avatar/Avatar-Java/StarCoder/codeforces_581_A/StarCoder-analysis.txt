he variable a and variable b are initialized with 45 and 99 respectively according to the input.
It enters a while loop and it checks if the values of variables a and b are both positive.
Inside the while loop, it increments the value of variable count by 1.
Then it decrements the value of variable a by 1 and variable b by 1.
After the loop finishes, it calculates the final value of variable ans by dividing the value of variable a by 2 and adding it to the value of variable b by 2.
It then prints the values of variables count and ans as output, which is 10 10.
