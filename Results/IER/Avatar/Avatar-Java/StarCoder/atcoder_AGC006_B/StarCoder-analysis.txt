variable N is initialized with 2 and variable x is initialized with 1.
It enters a while loop and it checks if the value of variable x is either 1 or 2*N-1. If it is, it prints "No" and breaks out of the loop.
If the value of variable x is neither 1 nor 2*N-1, it prints "Yes" and enters another while loop.
Inside the while loop, it initializes two variables low and high with the values of variable x-1 and variable x+1 respectively.
It also initializes an ArrayDeque object deq with the value of variable x.
Then it enters another while loop and it checks if the value of variables low and high are either 0 or 2*N. If it is, it pushes the value of variable high to the front of the deque deq and adds the value of variable high+1 to the deque deq. Then it increments the value of variable high by 2.
If the value of variables low and high are neither 0 nor 2*N, it pushes the value of variable low to the front of the deque deq and adds the value of variable low-1 to the deque deq. Then it decrements the value of variable low by 2.
After the while loop finishes, it enters a for loop and it iterates through the deque deq and prints each element.
