he variable n is initialized with 260522 according to the input.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until variable num is greater than or equal to variable n.
Inside the while loop, it calculates the next value of variable num by multiplying it by 10 and adding 7.
Then it increments variable res by 1.
Then it initializes a set with an empty set.
Then it enters another while loop and it iterates until variable num is divisible by variable n.
Inside the while loop, it calculates the remainder of variable num divided by variable n.
Then it increments variable res by 1.
Then it checks if the remainder of variable num divided by variable n is already in the set. If it is, it sets variable res to -1.
Then it calculates the next value of variable num by multiplying it by 10 and adding 7.
After the while loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable res as output, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        int num = 7;
        int res = 1;

        while (num < n) {
            num = num * 10 + 7;
            res++;
        }

        Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();

        while (true) {
            if (num % n == 0)
                break;
            num %= n;
            res++;
            if (!set.add(num)) {
                res = -1;
                break;
            }
            num = num * 10 + 7;
        }

        System.out.println(res);
    }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```260523
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 260523 according to the input.
It enters a while loop and it
