he variable n is initialized with 260522 according to the input.
It enters a while loop and it iterates until variable num is greater than or equal to variable n.
Inside the while loop, it calculates the next value of variable num by multiplying it by 10 and adding 7.
Then it increments variable res by 1.
Then it initializes a set with an empty set.
Then it enters another while loop and it iterates until variable num is divisible by variable n.
Inside the while loop, it calculates the remainder of variable num divided by variable n.
Then it increments variable res by 1.
Then it checks if the remainder of variable num divided by variable n is already in the set. If it is, it sets variable res to -1.
Then it calculates the next value of variable num by multiplying it by 10 and adding 7.
After the while loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable res as output, which is 10.
