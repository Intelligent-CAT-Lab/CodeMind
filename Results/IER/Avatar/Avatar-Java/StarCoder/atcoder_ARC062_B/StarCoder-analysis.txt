he variable input is initialized with the string "2 2" which is the input.
The variable result is initialized with 0.
The variable p is initialized with 0.
The variable g is initialized with 1.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 1 to 1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable p.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the character at index i of the array input is 'g'. If it is, it checks if the value of variable p plus 1 is less than or equal to the value of variable g. If it is, it increments the value of variable result by 1 and increments the value of variable p by 1. If it is not, it increments the value of variable g by 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable result as output, which is 1.
