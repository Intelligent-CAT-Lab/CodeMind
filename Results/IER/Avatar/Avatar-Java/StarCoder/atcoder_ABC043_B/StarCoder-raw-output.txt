he variable s is initialized with 0000000000.
It enters a while loop and it checks if the string s contains "0B " or "1B ". If it does, it replaces the substring "0B " or "1B " with an empty string.
Then it replaces the substring " B " with an empty string.
After the loop finishes, it print the final value of variable s as output, which is 0.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        String s = sc.next();
        
        while (s.contains("0B ") || s.contains("1B ")) {
            s = s.replaceAll("0B ", "");
            s = s.replaceAll("1B ", "");
        }
        
        s = s.replaceAll(" B ", "");
        
        System.out.println(s);
    }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```0000000000
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
