he variable A, B, C and D are initialized with 2, 1, 3 and 4 respectively according to the input.
The variable dp is initialized with a 2D array of size D x C. The variable sum is initialized with a 2D array of size D x C.
The variable ans is initialized with 0.
The variable powC is initialized with 1.
The variable powI is initialized with 1.
The for loop iterates from A to C to calculate the value of variable dp.
The for loop iterates from B to D to calculate the value of variable sum.
The for loop iterates from D to B to calculate the value of variable ans.
The for loop iterates from C to A to calculate the value of variable ans.
The final value of variable ans is printed as output.
