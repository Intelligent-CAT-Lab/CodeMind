e variable A is initialized with 75 and variable B is initialized with 25.
The value of variable A is subtracted by the product of variable B and 2.
If the result is greater than 0, then the result is printed as output.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int A = sc.nextInt();
        int B = sc.nextInt();
        System.out.println(A + B);
    }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```10 20
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable A is initialized with 10 and variable B is initialized with 20.
The value of variable A is added to variable B.
The result is printed as output.
<<<Output>>>
