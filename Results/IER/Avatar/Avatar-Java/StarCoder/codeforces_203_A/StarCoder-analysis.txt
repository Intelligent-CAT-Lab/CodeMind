e variable points is initialized with 3.
The variable t is initialized with 1.
The variable a is initialized with 20.
The variable b is initialized with 15.
The variable ta is initialized with 17.
The variable tb is initialized with 5.
The for loop iterates from 0 to 0.
The for loop iterates from 0 to 0.
The if statement checks if the variable points is equal to a - i * ta + b - j * tb or if the variable points is equal to 0 or if the variable points is equal to a - ta * i or if the variable points is equal to b - tb * j.
The if statement is true for the first iteration, so it prints YES as output.
