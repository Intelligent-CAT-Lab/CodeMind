 variable N is initialized with 366735600000.
The function primeFactor is called with variable N as argument.
The function primeFactor returns a list of prime factors of N.
The list is iterated through and the variable pow is initialized with the current prime factor.
The variable increase is initialized with 1.
The while loop is entered and the condition is checked.
The condition is met when pow - increase >= 0.
The while loop exits when the condition is not met.
The variable count is incremented by 1.
The for loop is exited.
The final value of variable count is printed as output.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int N = sc.nextInt();
        int[] arr = new int[N];
        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
            arr[i] = sc.nextInt();
        }
        int[] dp = new int[N];
        dp[0] = arr[0];
        dp[1] = Math.max(arr[0], arr[1]);
        for (int i = 2; i < N; i++) {
            dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i - 1], dp[i - 2] + arr[i]);
        }
        System.out.println(dp[N - 1]);
    }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5
1
2
3
4
5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable N is initialized with 5.
An array of size N is created and initialized with 0.
The for loop is entered and the variable i is initialized with 0.
The condition is checked.
The condition is met when i < N.
The variable i is incremented by 1.
The variable arr[i] is initialized with the next input.
The for loop is
