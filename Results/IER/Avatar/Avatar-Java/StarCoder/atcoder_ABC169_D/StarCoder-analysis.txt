variable N is initialized with 366735600000.
The function primeFactor is called with variable N as argument.
The function primeFactor returns a list of prime factors of N.
The list is iterated through and the variable pow is initialized with the current prime factor.
The variable increase is initialized with 1.
The while loop is entered and the condition is checked.
The condition is met when pow - increase >= 0.
The while loop exits when the condition is not met.
The variable count is incremented by 1.
The for loop is exited.
