he variable n is initialized with 9.
It enters a while loop and it iterates from 9 to 0 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable x.
Inside the while loop, it divides the current interger i by 2 and stores the remainder in variable x.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable s as output, which is 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1.

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class codforce {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner str = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = str.nextInt();
        int a = 0;
        int b = 0;
        int c = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int x = str.nextInt();
            if (x % 2 == 0) {
                a++;
            } else {
                b++;
            }
        }
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int x = str.nextInt();
            if (x % 3 == 0) {
                c++;
            }
        }
        
        System.out.println(a + " " + b + " " + c);
    }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5
1
2
3
4
5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 5.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 4 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable x.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger i is even or odd. If it is even, it adds 1 to variable a. If it is odd, it adds 1 to variable b.
After the loop finishes, it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to
