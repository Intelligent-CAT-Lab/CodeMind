he variable z is initialized with the input. It is split into 4 parts by the space character.
The variable x is initialized with the first part of z.
The variable y is initialized with the second part of z.
The variable a is initialized with the third part of z.
The variable b is initialized with the fourth part of z.
The variable c is initialized with 0.
The variable i is initialized with the value of variable a.
The variable j is initialized with the value of variable b.
The variable lcm is initialized with the value of variable x multiplied by the value of variable y divided by the gcd of x and y.
The for loop iterates from variable a to variable b and checks if i is divisible by lcm. If it is, it breaks out of the loop.
The for loop iterates from variable b to variable a and checks if j is divisible by lcm. If it is, it breaks out of the loop.
If the condition for both loops is met, it calculates the number of integers between a and b that are divisible by lcm and stores it in variable c.
After the loop finishes, it prints the final value of variable c as output, which is 1.
