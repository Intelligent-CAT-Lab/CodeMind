variable num1 and variable num2 are initialized with 100 and 25 respectively according to the input. And variable counter is initialized with 0.
It enters a while loop and it checks if both variables are not equal to 0.
Inside the while loop, it checks if the value of variable num1 is less than or equal to the value of variable num2. If it is, it increments the value of variable num1 by 1 and decrements the value of variable num2 by 2.
If the value of variable num1 is greater than the value of variable num2, it decrements the value of variable num1 by 2 and increments the value of variable num2 by 1.
It increments the value of variable counter by 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable counter as output, which is 10.
