 variable num1 and variable num2 are initialized with 100 and 25 respectively according to the input. And variable counter is initialized with 0.
It enters a while loop and it checks if both variables are not equal to 0.
Inside the while loop, it checks if the value of variable num1 is less than or equal to the value of variable num2. If it is, it increments the value of variable num1 by 1 and decrements the value of variable num2 by 2.
If the value of variable num1 is greater than the value of variable num2, it decrements the value of variable num1 by 2 and increments the value of variable num2 by 1.
It increments the value of variable counter by 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable counter as output, which is 10.
<<<Output>>>
10

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class JavaApplication39 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int num = sc.nextInt();
        int counter = 0;
        
        while (num!= 0) {
            if (num % 2 == 0) {
                num /= 2;
            } else {
                num = num * 3 + 1;
            }
            
            counter++;
        }
        
        System.out.println(counter);
    }
}

<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```100
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable num is initialized with 100 according to the input. And variable counter is initialized with 0.
It enters a while loop and it checks if the value of variable num is not equal to 0.
Inside the while loop, it checks if the value of variable num is even. If it is, it divides the value of variable num by 2.
If the value of variable num is odd, it multiplies the value of variable num by 3 and adds 1 to it.
It incre
