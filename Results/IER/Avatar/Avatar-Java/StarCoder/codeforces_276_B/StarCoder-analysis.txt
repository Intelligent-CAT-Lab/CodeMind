e variable s is initialized with the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to the length of the string s. The value of variable i is also passed to variable ch.
Inside the for loop, it calculates the number of times the character ch occurs in the string s. The character ch is extracted from the string s by calling the method charAt(i).
After the loop finishes, it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 25. The value of variable i is also passed to variable cntod.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the number of times the character ch occurs in the string s is odd. If it is, it increments the value of variable cntod.
After the loop finishes, it checks if the value of variable cntod is 0. If it is, it prints "First".
Otherwise, it enters a nested if statement.
Inside the nested if statement, it checks if the value of variable cntod is even. If it is, it prints "Second".
Otherwise, it prints "First".
