he variable x is initialized with 5728.
It enters a while loop and it checks if the value of variable x is greater than 0.
Inside the while loop, it calculates the remainder of the division of variable x by 10.
Then it checks if the value of variable r is less than or equal to 9 - r.
If it is, it adds the value of 9 - r to the list.
If it is not, it adds the value of r to the list.
After the loop finishes, it calculates the value of variable newNumber by adding the values of the list elements one by one.
Then it prints the value of variable newNumber as output, which is 5728.
