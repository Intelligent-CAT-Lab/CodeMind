variable t, variable s and variable q are initialized with 100000, 3125 and 2 respectively according to the input.
It enters a while loop and it checks if the current value of variable s is less than variable t.
If it is, it multiplies the current value of variable s by variable q and increments the value of variable sum by 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable sum as output, which is 10.
