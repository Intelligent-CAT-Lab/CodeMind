 variable question is initialized with the input.
Then it extracts the last character of the variable question and stores it in variable ch.
Then it creates an array of strings vowels with the values "A", "E", "I", "O", "U", "Y".
Then it checks if any of the elements in the array vowels is equal to the variable ch or is equal to the lowercase version of variable ch.
If any of the elements in the array vowels is equal to the variable ch or is equal to the lowercase version of variable ch, then the value of variable b is set to true.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable b as output, which is true.
<<<Output>>>
true

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = scanner.nextInt();
        int[] arr = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            arr[i] = scanner.nextInt();
        }
        int max = arr[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if (arr[i] > max) {
                max = arr[i];
            }
        }
        System.out.println(max);
    }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 1 2 3 4 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input to generate the output. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 5.
Then it creates an array of integers arr with n elements.
Then it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to n-1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger i is greater than the current value of variable max. If it is, then it updates the value of variable max with the value of current interger i.
After the loop finishes,
