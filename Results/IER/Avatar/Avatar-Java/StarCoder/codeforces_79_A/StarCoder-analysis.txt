he variable x and variable y are initialized with 1 and 20 respectively according to the input.
It enters a while loop and it keeps repeating the following steps until the loop terminates.
If the current turn is even, it checks if it can take 2 busses from the current position. If it can, it deducts 2 from both x and y.
If it cannot, it checks if it can take 1 bus from the current position. If it can, it deducts 1 from both x and y.
If it cannot, it checks if it can take 0 bus from the current position. If it can, it deducts 0 from y.
If it cannot, it prints "Hanako" as output and terminates the loop.
If the current turn is odd, it checks if it can take 0 bus from the current position. If it can, it deducts 0 from y.
If it cannot, it checks if it can take 1 bus from the current position. If it can, it deducts 1 from both x and y.
If it cannot, it checks if it can take 2 busses from the current position. If it can, it deducts 2 from both x and y.
If it cannot, it prints "Ciel" as output and terminates the loop.
