he variable a, b, c and d are initialized with 418379342, 802780784, -790013317 and -445130206 respectively according to the input.
The code calculates the maximum of four values, which are a * c, b * d, a * d and b * c respectively.
The maximum of these four values is printed as output.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        int a[] = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            a[i] = sc.nextInt();
        }
        int max = a[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if (a[i] > max) {
                max = a[i];
            }
        }
        System.out.println(max);
    }
}
</Code>
<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5 1 2 3 4 5```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the code based on your analysis.
<<<Analysis>>>
The variable n is initialized with 5 according to the input.
The array a is initialized with n elements.
The variable max is initialized with the first element of array a.
The code enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to n - 1 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable j.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the current interger a[i] is greater than the current value of variable max. If it is, it updates the value of variable max with the current value of a[i].
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable max as output, which is 5.
<<<Output>>>
5
