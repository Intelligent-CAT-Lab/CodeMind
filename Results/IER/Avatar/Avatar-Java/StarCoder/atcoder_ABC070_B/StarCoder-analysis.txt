he variable a, b, c and d are initialized with 0, 50, 50 and 100 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 50 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it increments the value of array[i] by 1.
After the loop finishes, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 50 to 100 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it increments the value of array[i] by 1.
After the loop finishes, it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 100 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the value of array[i] is equal to 2. If it is, it increments the value of variable ans by 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 2.
