he variable a, b, c and d are initialized with 0, 50, 50 and 100 respectively according to the input.
It enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 50 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it increments the value of array[i] by 1.
After the loop finishes, it enters another for loop and it iterates from 50 to 100 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it increments the value of array[i] by 1.
After the loop finishes, it enters a for loop and it iterates from 0 to 100 to check each integer i in this range. The value of variable i is also passed to variable num.
Inside the for loop, it checks if the value of array[i] is equal to 2. If it is, it increments the value of variable ans by 1.
After the loop finishes, it print the fianl value of variable ans as output, which is 2.
<<<Output>>>

TASK:
Consider the following code:
<Code>
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        int[] array = new int[n];
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            array[i] = sc.nextInt();
        }
        
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
                if (array[i] > array[j]) {
                    ans++;
                }
            }
        }
        
        System.out.println(ans);
    }
}

<<<Question>>>
What would be the output of code executiion given the following input:
```5
1 2 3 4 5
```
First analyze step by step about how the code processes the input. 
Then print the output of the
