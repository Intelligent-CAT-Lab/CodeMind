e variable n is initialized with 59 and variable m is initialized with 96.
The if statement checks if n is equal to 0. If it is, it checks if m is not equal to 0. If it is, it prints "Impossible".
If n is not equal to 0, it checks if m is less than or equal to n. If it is, it checks if m is equal to 0. If it is, it sets m to 1.
Then it prints the value of n and m plus n minus 1.
If m is greater than n, it prints the value of m and m plus n minus 1.
